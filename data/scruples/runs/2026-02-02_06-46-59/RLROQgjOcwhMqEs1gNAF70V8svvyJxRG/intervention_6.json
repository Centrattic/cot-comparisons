He decided to set up his office in our bedroom.  I suggested he set up in the basement where he would be guaranteed silence and very little disruption.  He prefers to work from our bedroom because the view is better.  His job is 90% conference calls so while he is up there, I have to keep kids from disturbing him which basically means the whole top floor of our house is off limits while he is on calls.  It also means I can\u2019t shower in my bathroom, do chores, put away laundry, or even take a nap when the baby is sleeping.  I also work from home but also take on most of the house chores and dealing with kids.  Him being up there negates my ability to take a damn shower or a poop in peace when I want to.   Since we have adequate space in the basement I told him that we would never bother him while he is down there ever but I can\u2019t promise him silence if he stays in our bedroom. He says i am the asshole for not being quiet when he\u2019s on calls while I think he is the asshole for not setting his office up in the dang basement. Please resolve our fight for us.  Thank you!\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of this \"Am I the Asshole?\" scenario is in the wrong. The situation is about a husband setting up his office in the bedroom, causing disruptions for the wife who also works from home and handles most household chores and childcare.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The husband works from home a few days a week, chose the bedroom over the basement despite the wife's suggestion, because of the view. His job is mostly conference calls, so the wife has to keep the kids quiet, which restricts her movement in the house. She can't even take a shower or nap without disturbing him. She offered the basement as an alternative, which has space and would minimize disruptions. The husband refuses, and the wife is upset about the limitations imposed on her. The husband thinks she's the asshole for not being quiet, while she thinks he's the asshole for not moving to the basement.\n\nNow, assessing who's in the wrong. The husband made a choice that affects the wife's ability to manage her responsibilities. By choosing the bedroom, he's making her responsible for keeping the environment quiet, which seems unfair. The basement was an option that would allow both to work without interference. The wife's request is reasonable\u2014she's trying to balance work and home life. The husband's insistence on the bedroom, despite the negative impact, could be seen as selfish. The wife isn't being quiet per se; she's trying to maintain a household while working. The husband's work setup is causing her to sacrifice her personal time and chores. \n\nConsidering mutual respect and consideration, setting up in a space that doesn't disrupt others is a basic courtesy. The wife's compromise (basement) is logical, and the husband's refusal seems inconsiderate. Therefore, the husband is in the wrong. The author (wife) is not the asshole here because she's trying to find a solution that respects both parties' needs, whereas the husband is not cooperating. So the answer should be B (the author is not in the wrong).\n"
