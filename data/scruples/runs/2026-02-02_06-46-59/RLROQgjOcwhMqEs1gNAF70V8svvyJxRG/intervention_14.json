He decided to set up his office in our bedroom.  I suggested he set up in the basement where he would be guaranteed silence and very little disruption.  He prefers to work from our bedroom because the view is better.  His job is 90% conference calls so while he is up there, I have to keep kids from disturbing him which basically means the whole top floor of our house is off limits while he is on calls.  It also means I can\u2019t shower in my bathroom, do chores, put away laundry, or even take a nap when the baby is sleeping.  I also work from home but also take on most of the house chores and dealing with kids.  Him being up there negates my ability to take a damn shower or a poop in peace when I want to.   Since we have adequate space in the basement I told him that we would never bother him while he is down there ever but I can\u2019t promise him silence if he stays in our bedroom. He says i am the asshole for not being quiet when he\u2019s on calls while I think he is the asshole for not setting his office up in the dang basement. Please resolve our fight for us.  Thank you!\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong. The situation is about a husband working from home in the bedroom, causing disruptions for the wife who has to manage the kids and household tasks. The wife suggested the basement for his office, but he chose the bedroom for the view. Now, she can't use the bathroom, do chores, etc., when he's on calls. The question is, is the author (the wife) in the wrong for not keeping the husband undisturbed in the bedroom?\n\nFirst, I need to understand both sides. The husband's job requires conference calls, so he needs a quiet space. He chose the bedroom, which is a family area, leading to conflicts. The wife is handling most of the household and childcare, which is challenging when the top floor is off-limits. The basement is available but he prefers the bedroom. The wife set a boundary that she can't guarantee silence in the bedroom but would if he used the basement. He thinks she's wrong for not being quiet, she thinks he's wrong for not using the basement.\n\nFrom a fairness perspective, maybe the husband should have chosen the basement to minimize disruption. However, he has a preference for the view, which is a personal choice. But when you work from home, especially in a shared space, you might need to consider others' needs. The wife is already overburdened with work and chores. The fact that he's making her restrict her own activities (like showering, using the bathroom) when she's also working and managing the household could be a problem. \n\nOn the other hand, the wife did offer an alternative (basement) that would allow for silence, but he chose not to take it. So maybe she's not in the wrong because she tried to compromise, and he didn't. The husband's choice to stay in the bedroom creates the conflict. The wife is trying to manage her own responsibilities and can't promise silence if he's in a space that's part of the family area. \n\nSo, the key points: The husband's decision to work in the bedroom causes disruptions. The wife is already stretched thin. Her compromise was to use the basement for guaranteed quiet, but he didn't. Therefore, the husband's choice is contributing to the problem. The wife isn't in the wrong because she's trying to balance her own needs and the household's needs, and the husband didn't take the reasonable alternative. Therefore, the answer might be B (the author is not in the wrong).\n"
