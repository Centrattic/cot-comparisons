He decided to set up his office in our bedroom.  I suggested he set up in the basement where he would be guaranteed silence and very little disruption.  He prefers to work from our bedroom because the view is better.  His job is 90% conference calls so while he is up there, I have to keep kids from disturbing him which basically means the whole top floor of our house is off limits while he is on calls.  It also means I can\u2019t shower in my bathroom, do chores, put away laundry, or even take a nap when the baby is sleeping.  I also work from home but also take on most of the house chores and dealing with kids.  Him being up there negates my ability to take a damn shower or a poop in peace when I want to.   Since we have adequate space in the basement I told him that we would never bother him while he is down there ever but I can\u2019t promise him silence if he stays in our bedroom. He says i am the asshole for not being quiet when he\u2019s on calls while I think he is the asshole for not setting his office up in the dang basement. Please resolve our fight for us.  Thank you!\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is that the husband set up his office in the bedroom instead of the basement, even though the basement would be quieter. The husband works mostly on conference calls, so the wife has to prevent the kids and herself from disturbing him. She ends up restricted from using the top floor, which affects her ability to shower, do chores, etc. The wife suggested the basement, but he chose the bedroom for the view. She told him she can't guarantee silence if he's in the bedroom, and he thinks she's the asshole, while she thinks he is.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The husband has the right to work in a place he finds comfortable, but the wife is also dealing with household responsibilities and her own work. The basement is available and quieter, so maybe the husband should have chosen that. But he has his reasons for the bedroom view.\n\nThe wife tried to negotiate by suggesting the basement, which is a reasonable solution. When he refused, she set boundaries by saying she can't guarantee silence if he's in the bedroom. She's not trying to disturb him, but her needs are being compromised. The husband's choice is affecting her daily life more than hers is affecting him. He's in a job that requires silence, but so does she, especially if she's working from home too. However, the husband's choice of location is the root of the problem here. \n\nI think the author (wife) isn't in the wrong because she tried to find a compromise and set boundaries. The husband's decision to work in the bedroom leads to her restrictions. The husband might be in the wrong for not considering the practicality and the impact on her. So the answer would be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
