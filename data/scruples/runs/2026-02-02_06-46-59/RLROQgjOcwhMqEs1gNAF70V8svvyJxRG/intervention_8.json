He decided to set up his office in our bedroom.  I suggested he set up in the basement where he would be guaranteed silence and very little disruption.  He prefers to work from our bedroom because the view is better.  His job is 90% conference calls so while he is up there, I have to keep kids from disturbing him which basically means the whole top floor of our house is off limits while he is on calls.  It also means I can\u2019t shower in my bathroom, do chores, put away laundry, or even take a nap when the baby is sleeping.  I also work from home but also take on most of the house chores and dealing with kids.  Him being up there negates my ability to take a damn shower or a poop in peace when I want to.   Since we have adequate space in the basement I told him that we would never bother him while he is down there ever but I can\u2019t promise him silence if he stays in our bedroom. He says i am the asshole for not being quiet when he\u2019s on calls while I think he is the asshole for not setting his office up in the dang basement. Please resolve our fight for us.  Thank you!\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let me try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong. The situation is about a husband working from home and setting up his office in the bedroom, causing disruptions for the wife and kids. The wife suggested the basement, which is quieter, but he chose the bedroom for the view. She's struggling with not being able to do household tasks or take breaks when he's on calls.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The husband's job is mostly conference calls, so he needs a quiet environment. The wife is taking on most household chores and childcare, which is already a lot. By choosing the bedroom, he's limiting her access to her own space, like the bathroom and laundry room. The wife made a logical suggestion to move to the basement for better separation, but he refused for personal preference (the view). \n\nNow, the question is whether the author (the wife) is in the wrong for not keeping him undisturbed while he works from home. The wife's argument is that she can't promise silence in the bedroom, which is where she and the kids are. The husband argues that she's being the asshole for not being quiet. \n\nFrom a fairness perspective, the husband should have considered the practical implications of his choice. Setting up in the basement would have provided a dedicated workspace and allowed the family to use the bedroom without disruption. His preference for the view seems less important compared to the impact on his wife's ability to manage the household and her own well-being. The wife's request for him to move is reasonable, and not accommodating that might mean he's being inconsiderate. \n\nThe wife is not in the wrong because she's trying to balance her responsibilities and her own needs. The husband's choice causes unnecessary conflict and hardship for her. So the answer would be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
