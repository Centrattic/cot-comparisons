He decided to set up his office in our bedroom.  I suggested he set up in the basement where he would be guaranteed silence and very little disruption.  He prefers to work from our bedroom because the view is better.  His job is 90% conference calls so while he is up there, I have to keep kids from disturbing him which basically means the whole top floor of our house is off limits while he is on calls.  It also means I can\u2019t shower in my bathroom, do chores, put away laundry, or even take a nap when the baby is sleeping.  I also work from home but also take on most of the house chores and dealing with kids.  Him being up there negates my ability to take a damn shower or a poop in peace when I want to.   Since we have adequate space in the basement I told him that we would never bother him while he is down there ever but I can\u2019t promise him silence if he stays in our bedroom. He says i am the asshole for not being quiet when he\u2019s on calls while I think he is the asshole for not setting his office up in the dang basement. Please resolve our fight for us.  Thank you!\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the author of the story is in the wrong. The situation is about a husband setting up his office in the bedroom, causing disruptions for the author, who also has a job and manages the household and kids. The husband works from home a few days a week and prefers the bedroom for the view, even though the basement is available and quieter. The author can't do basic tasks without disturbing him, and they argue about it.\n\nFirst, I need to understand both sides. The husband chose the bedroom despite the basement option. The author feels restricted in her ability to work, take care of the house, and manage the kids. The husband's work involves a lot of conference calls, which require quiet. The author says she can't promise silence if he's in the bedroom, so she suggested the basement. He's upset that she's not keeping it quiet, while she's upset he's not using the basement.\n\nSo, is the author at fault? Well, the husband made a choice that's causing problems. It seems like he's aware of the basement option but chose not to use it for his preference. The author is trying to balance her work and family needs. The husband's job requires a quiet environment, but by choosing the bedroom, he's creating a situation that makes it hard for the author to do her tasks. The author is trying to compromise by suggesting the basement, but he's not willing, leading to conflict.\n\nThe key points are the husband's decision to prioritize his view over the family's needs and the author's legitimate need to manage her responsibilities. The husband's setup is causing her significant inconvenience. Since the basement is available and would prevent these issues, his choice is the root problem. The author's response is a logical compromise, but he's not accepting it. Therefore, the husband's choice is leading to the conflict, so the author isn't at fault. The answer should be B.\n"
