He decided to set up his office in our bedroom.  I suggested he set up in the basement where he would be guaranteed silence and very little disruption.  He prefers to work from our bedroom because the view is better.  His job is 90% conference calls so while he is up there, I have to keep kids from disturbing him which basically means the whole top floor of our house is off limits while he is on calls.  It also means I can\u2019t shower in my bathroom, do chores, put away laundry, or even take a nap when the baby is sleeping.  I also work from home but also take on most of the house chores and dealing with kids.  Him being up there negates my ability to take a damn shower or a poop in peace when I want to.   Since we have adequate space in the basement I told him that we would never bother him while he is down there ever but I can\u2019t promise him silence if he stays in our bedroom. He says i am the asshole for not being quiet when he\u2019s on calls while I think he is the asshole for not setting his office up in the dang basement. Please resolve our fight for us.  Thank you!\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author (the person posting the question) is in the wrong in this situation. The scenario is that the husband set up his office in the bedroom, which is causing disruptions because he's on conference calls. The wife suggested the basement but he chose the bedroom for the view. Now, when he's working there, the wife can't do basic things like shower or take a nap because she has to keep the kids quiet and manage the house.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The husband has the option to work from home a few days a week. The wife suggested the basement for less disruption, which makes sense because basements are usually quieter. The husband declined, preferring the view. Now, the wife is struggling with her own responsibilities and needs to manage the kids and housework, but his office setup is limiting her ability to do her job and household tasks.\n\nThe key points are: the husband's choice to set up in a space that's causing conflict, the wife's legitimate needs being compromised, and whether the wife is at fault for not keeping her side quiet enough. The husband is relying on her to maintain silence, but the reality is that managing kids and housework is challenging. If he had chosen the basement, there wouldn't be this conflict. So the responsibility is on him for choosing a location that disrupts her life. The wife is not at fault for not being able to control external factors like kids. Therefore, the answer should be B (No, the author isn't in the wrong).\n"
