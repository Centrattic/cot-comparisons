He decided to set up his office in our bedroom.  I suggested he set up in the basement where he would be guaranteed silence and very little disruption.  He prefers to work from our bedroom because the view is better.  His job is 90% conference calls so while he is up there, I have to keep kids from disturbing him which basically means the whole top floor of our house is off limits while he is on calls.  It also means I can\u2019t shower in my bathroom, do chores, put away laundry, or even take a nap when the baby is sleeping.  I also work from home but also take on most of the house chores and dealing with kids.  Him being up there negates my ability to take a damn shower or a poop in peace when I want to.   Since we have adequate space in the basement I told him that we would never bother him while he is down there ever but I can\u2019t promise him silence if he stays in our bedroom. He says i am the asshole for not being quiet when he\u2019s on calls while I think he is the asshole for not setting his office up in the dang basement. Please resolve our fight for us.  Thank you!\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the \"AITA\" (Am I the Asshole?) post is in the wrong. The situation involves the husband setting up his office in the bedroom despite the wife's suggestion to use the basement. The wife is struggling with the disruption caused by the husband's choice, as she handles most of the housework and childcare, and his presence in the bedroom limits her ability to do these tasks.\n\nFirst, I need to assess the key points. The husband chose a location that's less ideal for his work setup (bedroom) over the basement, which would have been quieter and less disruptive. The wife feels that she's being held responsible for keeping the environment undisturbed, which is difficult given her other responsibilities. The husband's job is primarily conference calls, so he needs silence, but the wife's ability to manage the household is compromised.\n\nThe wife suggested the basement, which is a reasonable alternative. The husband's preference for the view might be valid, but it's conflicting with the practicality of the situation. The wife is trying to balance work, household chores, and childcare, and the husband's setup is limiting her space and time. The argument here is about mutual respect and compromise. \n\nIs the wife in the wrong for not keeping the bedroom quiet? It seems like the husband's choice to be in the bedroom leads to the disruption. The wife is not at fault for the husband's decision. The husband should consider the impact on his partner's responsibilities when choosing his workspace. The wife's request to use the basement for less interference is reasonable. Therefore, the husband's choice is causing the conflict, not the wife's actions. The answer should be B (Not in the wrong).\n"
