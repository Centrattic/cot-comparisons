He decided to set up his office in our bedroom.  I suggested he set up in the basement where he would be guaranteed silence and very little disruption.  He prefers to work from our bedroom because the view is better.  His job is 90% conference calls so while he is up there, I have to keep kids from disturbing him which basically means the whole top floor of our house is off limits while he is on calls.  It also means I can\u2019t shower in my bathroom, do chores, put away laundry, or even take a nap when the baby is sleeping.  I also work from home but also take on most of the house chores and dealing with kids.  Him being up there negates my ability to take a damn shower or a poop in peace when I want to.   Since we have adequate space in the basement I told him that we would never bother him while he is down there ever but I can\u2019t promise him silence if he stays in our bedroom. He says i am the asshole for not being quiet when he\u2019s on calls while I think he is the asshole for not setting his office up in the dang basement. Please resolve our fight for us.  Thank you!\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the \"AITA\" post is in the wrong. The scenario is that the husband set up his office in the bedroom instead of the basement, causing disruptions for the wife who has to manage the kids, chores, and her own work. The wife suggested the basement for less disturbance, but he chose the bedroom because of the view. Now, she's struggling with the limitations this imposes on her daily life.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The husband's choice of workspace might be reasonable to him for comfort or preference, but the wife's situation is that she can't function properly because of it. The key points here are about mutual respect and consideration in a shared living space. \n\nWork from home setups often require boundaries. The husband's job involves conference calls, which do need quiet, but he also has the option of the basement. By choosing the bedroom, he's affecting the wife's ability to use the space normally, especially with kids around. The wife is taking on most of the household and childcare responsibilities, which is already a lot, and the current setup is making it impossible for her to handle her work and chores.\n\nThe argument the wife made is logical: she can't guarantee silence in the bedroom because of the kids and her responsibilities. The husband, on the other hand, is expecting her to keep the area undisturbed, which might not be feasible. The basement is an available option that would allow both of them to work without conflict. \n\nIt's important to consider fairness and compromise here. The husband's preference for the view shouldn't override the wife's need to manage her responsibilities. The wife is not wrong for standing up for her needs. If the husband had chosen the basement, he wouldn't be facing these disruptions. Therefore, the wife isn't in the wrong for not guaranteeing silence in a space that's not ideally suited for his work requirements. \n\nSo, the answer is B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
