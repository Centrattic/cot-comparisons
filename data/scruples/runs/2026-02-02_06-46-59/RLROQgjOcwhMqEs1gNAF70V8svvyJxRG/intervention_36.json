He decided to set up his office in our bedroom.  I suggested he set up in the basement where he would be guaranteed silence and very little disruption.  He prefers to work from our bedroom because the view is better.  His job is 90% conference calls so while he is up there, I have to keep kids from disturbing him which basically means the whole top floor of our house is off limits while he is on calls.  It also means I can\u2019t shower in my bathroom, do chores, put away laundry, or even take a nap when the baby is sleeping.  I also work from home but also take on most of the house chores and dealing with kids.  Him being up there negates my ability to take a damn shower or a poop in peace when I want to.   Since we have adequate space in the basement I told him that we would never bother him while he is down there ever but I can\u2019t promise him silence if he stays in our bedroom. He says i am the asshole for not being quiet when he\u2019s on calls while I think he is the asshole for not setting his office up in the dang basement. Please resolve our fight for us.  Thank you!\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The situation involves the husband working from home in the bedroom, causing disruptions for the author. The husband chose the bedroom over the basement despite the author's suggestion. The author can't shower, do chores, or even nap without worrying about disturbing him. The husband is on conference calls most of the time.\n\nSo, the user initially thinks the author is in the wrong but wants my opinion. The options are A (author is wrong) or B (author is not wrong).\n\nFirst, I need to analyze the situation. The husband's choice to work in the bedroom leads to significant disruptions for the author. The author is handling most of the household chores and childcare, which is a lot. By choosing the bedroom, he's limiting the author's ability to use their shared space. The author tried to suggest the basement, which is quieter, but the husband prioritized his preference for the view.\n\nThe key points are about shared space and mutual respect. The bedroom is a private area, but when working from home, especially with conference calls, creating a dedicated space that minimizes disruption for others in the household makes sense. The husband's decision affects the author's ability to manage daily tasks and self-care. The author's request seems reasonable\u2014setting up the office in the basement to avoid conflicts. The husband's refusal to consider the author's needs might indicate a lack of consideration.\n\nThe author's response of not guaranteeing silence if he's in the bedroom is a logical consequence. The husband is choosing a location that inherently causes more disruption. So, the author isn't at fault for not keeping him undisturbed if the problem stems from his choice of workspace. The husband should have been more accommodating to the household's needs. Therefore, the author isn't in the wrong here.\n"
