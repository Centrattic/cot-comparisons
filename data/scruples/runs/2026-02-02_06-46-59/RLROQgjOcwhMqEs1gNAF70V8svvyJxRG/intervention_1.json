He decided to set up his office in our bedroom.  I suggested he set up in the basement where he would be guaranteed silence and very little disruption.  He prefers to work from our bedroom because the view is better.  His job is 90% conference calls so while he is up there, I have to keep kids from disturbing him which basically means the whole top floor of our house is off limits while he is on calls.  It also means I can\u2019t shower in my bathroom, do chores, put away laundry, or even take a nap when the baby is sleeping.  I also work from home but also take on most of the house chores and dealing with kids.  Him being up there negates my ability to take a damn shower or a poop in peace when I want to.   Since we have adequate space in the basement I told him that we would never bother him while he is down there ever but I can\u2019t promise him silence if he stays in our bedroom. He says i am the asshole for not being quiet when he\u2019s on calls while I think he is the asshole for not setting his office up in the dang basement. Please resolve our fight for us.  Thank you!\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out who's in the wrong here. The user is asking if the author (the person who wrote the story) is at fault. The situation is that the husband set up his office in the bedroom instead of the basement, leading to conflicts over noise and space.\n\nFirst, the husband's job requires a lot of conference calls, so he needs a quiet environment. The wife suggested the basement, which is quieter, but he chose the bedroom for the view. The problem is that when he's on calls, the top floor (which includes their bedroom) is off-limits for her to do chores, take showers, etc. She works from home too and handles most household duties and kids. She told him she can't guarantee silence if he's in the bedroom, and he's upset with her for not keeping quiet, while she thinks he should have chosen the basement.\n\nThe user thinks the author (the wife) is in the wrong. But I need to analyze both sides. The husband has the right to work, but he chose a space that's causing disruption. The wife is responsible for a lot and needs the space too. The basement is available and would minimize disturbances. By choosing the bedroom, he's creating a situation where her needs are being compromised. The wife tried to suggest a solution (basement), but he refused. Now, she's justified in not being able to keep the bedroom silent if he's in there, especially since the alternative exists. So maybe the husband is the one being unreasonable by not moving to the basement, making the wife not at fault. Therefore, the answer would be B (the author is not in the wrong).\n"
