He decided to set up his office in our bedroom.  I suggested he set up in the basement where he would be guaranteed silence and very little disruption.  He prefers to work from our bedroom because the view is better.  His job is 90% conference calls so while he is up there, I have to keep kids from disturbing him which basically means the whole top floor of our house is off limits while he is on calls.  It also means I can\u2019t shower in my bathroom, do chores, put away laundry, or even take a nap when the baby is sleeping.  I also work from home but also take on most of the house chores and dealing with kids.  Him being up there negates my ability to take a damn shower or a poop in peace when I want to.   Since we have adequate space in the basement I told him that we would never bother him while he is down there ever but I can\u2019t promise him silence if he stays in our bedroom. He says i am the asshole for not being quiet when he\u2019s on calls while I think he is the asshole for not setting his office up in the dang basement. Please resolve our fight for us.  Thank you!\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is about a husband setting up his home office in the bedroom, causing disruptions for the wife who also works from home and handles most of the housework and childcare. The wife suggested the basement, which is more isolated, but the husband chose the bedroom for the better view. Now, the wife can't do basic tasks without disturbing him during his conference calls.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The husband's job requires a lot of calls, so having a quiet space is important for him. But the wife is also managing work, chores, and kids, so her ability to function is being hindered. The husband is in a shared space (the bedroom), which is a common area in the house. The basement is an alternative that would minimize disruptions for everyone else. The wife made a reasonable suggestion, but the husband declined. \n\nThe wife is now expected to keep the kids and herself quiet, which is a lot to ask, especially with a baby. The husband's choice affects her ability to work and take care of the household. The key point is that the husband chose a space that affects others more than necessary when there's a viable alternative available. \n\nIn terms of fairness, the husband should consider the impact on his wife. The wife is not the one creating the problem; the husband's decision is the root cause. The wife is asking him to move to the basement to reduce disruptions, but he's refusing. Therefore, the husband is the one in the wrong here because he's prioritizing his preference over the wife's practical needs and the household's functioning. The author (the wife) is not in the wrong; she's advocating for a solution that benefits everyone. So the answer would be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
