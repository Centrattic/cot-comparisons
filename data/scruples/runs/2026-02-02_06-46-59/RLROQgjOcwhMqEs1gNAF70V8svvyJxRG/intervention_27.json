He decided to set up his office in our bedroom.  I suggested he set up in the basement where he would be guaranteed silence and very little disruption.  He prefers to work from our bedroom because the view is better.  His job is 90% conference calls so while he is up there, I have to keep kids from disturbing him which basically means the whole top floor of our house is off limits while he is on calls.  It also means I can\u2019t shower in my bathroom, do chores, put away laundry, or even take a nap when the baby is sleeping.  I also work from home but also take on most of the house chores and dealing with kids.  Him being up there negates my ability to take a damn shower or a poop in peace when I want to.   Since we have adequate space in the basement I told him that we would never bother him while he is down there ever but I can\u2019t promise him silence if he stays in our bedroom. He says i am the asshole for not being quiet when he\u2019s on calls while I think he is the asshole for not setting his office up in the dang basement. Please resolve our fight for us.  Thank you!\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is about the husband setting up his office in the bedroom, causing disruptions for the author who has to manage the kids, chores, etc. The author suggested the basement, but the husband prefers the bedroom for the view. The author then says they can't guarantee silence if he's in the bedroom, leading to a conflict.\n\nSo, the author is saying they can't keep the kids and themselves quiet when the husband is in the bedroom, so they told him they can't promise silence. The husband then thinks she's the asshole for not being quiet, while she thinks he's the asshole for not moving to the basement.\n\nI need to decide if the author is in the wrong. The key points here are about shared space and responsibilities. The husband chose his own comfort (better view) over a less disruptive area (basement), which the author had suggested. The author is handling most of the housework and childcare, which is taking a toll. By setting up in the bedroom, the husband is creating a situation where the author's ability to manage the household is hindered.\n\nFrom a fairness perspective, when someone is given an option that minimizes disruption (basement), choosing a more convenient spot that causes issues for the partner might be seen as self-centered. However, the author is also making a boundary by saying she can't guarantee silence if he's in the bedroom. But maybe she's overstepping by not enforcing that boundary, or maybe she's justified because the husband's choice is causing the problem.\n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong. If the husband is the one who chose the bedroom despite the suggestion, then he's the one causing the conflict. The author is trying to manage her responsibilities, and the husband's choice is making it harder. Therefore, the author might not be in the wrong because she's pushing back against an unfair situation. Alternatively, perhaps she is in the wrong if she's not being considerate enough despite the husband's choice. But considering that the husband had the option to choose the basement and didn't, the author's stance seems reasonable. So the answer is probably B (not in the wrong).\n"
