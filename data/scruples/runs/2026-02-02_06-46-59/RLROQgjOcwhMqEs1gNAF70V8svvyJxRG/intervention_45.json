He decided to set up his office in our bedroom.  I suggested he set up in the basement where he would be guaranteed silence and very little disruption.  He prefers to work from our bedroom because the view is better.  His job is 90% conference calls so while he is up there, I have to keep kids from disturbing him which basically means the whole top floor of our house is off limits while he is on calls.  It also means I can\u2019t shower in my bathroom, do chores, put away laundry, or even take a nap when the baby is sleeping.  I also work from home but also take on most of the house chores and dealing with kids.  Him being up there negates my ability to take a damn shower or a poop in peace when I want to.   Since we have adequate space in the basement I told him that we would never bother him while he is down there ever but I can\u2019t promise him silence if he stays in our bedroom. He says i am the asshole for not being quiet when he\u2019s on calls while I think he is the asshole for not setting his office up in the dang basement. Please resolve our fight for us.  Thank you!\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is that the husband set up his office in the bedroom, causing disruptions for the wife, who can't do her daily tasks or work because he's there. The wife suggested the basement, which is quieter and has more space, but the husband prefers the bedroom for the view. Now, the main conflict is about whether the wife is wrong for not keeping the bedroom undisturbed while he works.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The husband's perspective: he's working from home, and he chose the bedroom over the basement for a better view. His job involves a lot of conference calls, so he probably needs a quiet space. But the wife is the one handling most of the household chores, work, and kids. The basement is available and quieter, so she offered that as an alternative. However, he refused, leading to her being unable to use the top floor, including showering or doing chores when he's on calls.\n\nFrom the wife's side, she's already overburdened with work, kids, and household duties. By forcing her to be quiet in the bedroom, it's limiting her ability to manage her responsibilities. The husband's choice to stay in the bedroom is causing her inconvenience, and she's standing her ground by saying she can't guarantee silence there. The husband, on the other hand, is frustrated that she's not keeping things quiet despite his preference for working there.\n\nThe key points here are about mutual respect and compromise. The husband has a valid need for a quiet workspace, but he also has a responsibility to consider his wife's needs. Conversely, the wife is managing a lot and should ideally have a space where she can work and manage the household without being restricted. The suggestion to use the basement was reasonable, and by refusing, the husband might be the one not compromising. However, the wife's refusal to let him stay in the bedroom, leading to potential disruptions, could be seen as inconsiderate if his job requires it. But given the circumstances, the basement is a better alternative for minimizing disruptions, so the husband's choice to stay in the bedroom might be the more selfish one.\n\nIn terms of responsibility, both have duties to consider each other's needs. The husband's work requires a quiet space, but the wife's ability to work and care for the kids is also important. The basement offers a solution that doesn't interfere with her, so it seems the husband is the one not being reasonable by not choosing that option. The wife's stance is that she can't promise silence in the bedroom, which is a fair point. If her work and household duties require her mobility, then the husband moving to the basement would be the compromise. Therefore, the wife isn't in the wrong because she's advocating for her own needs, while the husband is not accommodating. So the answer is B (author is not in the wrong).\n"
