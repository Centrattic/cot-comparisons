He decided to set up his office in our bedroom.  I suggested he set up in the basement where he would be guaranteed silence and very little disruption.  He prefers to work from our bedroom because the view is better.  His job is 90% conference calls so while he is up there, I have to keep kids from disturbing him which basically means the whole top floor of our house is off limits while he is on calls.  It also means I can\u2019t shower in my bathroom, do chores, put away laundry, or even take a nap when the baby is sleeping.  I also work from home but also take on most of the house chores and dealing with kids.  Him being up there negates my ability to take a damn shower or a poop in peace when I want to.   Since we have adequate space in the basement I told him that we would never bother him while he is down there ever but I can\u2019t promise him silence if he stays in our bedroom. He says i am the asshole for not being quiet when he\u2019s on calls while I think he is the asshole for not setting his office up in the dang basement. Please resolve our fight for us.  Thank you!\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of the \"Am I the Asshole\" (AITA) post is in the wrong. The situation is about their husband working from home in the bedroom, causing disruptions.\n\nFirst, the husband chose to set up his office in the bedroom despite the wife's suggestion to use the basement, which is quieter. The wife ends up having to manage the kids and household tasks without being able to do her own things because the husband is on conference calls. She feels it's unfair, especially since she also works from home and handles most chores. The husband argues that the wife isn't keeping him undisturbed, while she thinks he should have chosen the basement.\n\nThe user thinks the author (the wife) is in the wrong, but wants my opinion. I need to determine if A (Yes, she's wrong) or B (No, she's not) is correct.\n\nIn typical AITA scenarios, people often consider fairness, communication, and mutual respect. The husband made a choice that affects the wife's ability to function. The basement was suggested as a better spot for him to work without disrupting the rest of the home. By choosing the bedroom, he's creating a conflict. The wife isn't the one making the noise; the kids are, which she's trying to manage. Her responsibility to the kids and home tasks is being compromised. The husband seems to be placing the burden on her to ensure silence, which isn't entirely her control, especially with young children.\n\nThe wife's argument is that he should have chosen the basement, which would have minimized disruption. She's not in the wrong for not being able to control the kids during his calls. The husband's choice to be in the bedroom, where the family activities are, leads to this conflict. So, the husband might be the one at fault here. Therefore, the author (the wife) is not in the wrong. Answer B.\n"
