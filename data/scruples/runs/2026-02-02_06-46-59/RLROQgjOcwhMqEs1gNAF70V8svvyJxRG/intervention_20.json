He decided to set up his office in our bedroom.  I suggested he set up in the basement where he would be guaranteed silence and very little disruption.  He prefers to work from our bedroom because the view is better.  His job is 90% conference calls so while he is up there, I have to keep kids from disturbing him which basically means the whole top floor of our house is off limits while he is on calls.  It also means I can\u2019t shower in my bathroom, do chores, put away laundry, or even take a nap when the baby is sleeping.  I also work from home but also take on most of the house chores and dealing with kids.  Him being up there negates my ability to take a damn shower or a poop in peace when I want to.   Since we have adequate space in the basement I told him that we would never bother him while he is down there ever but I can\u2019t promise him silence if he stays in our bedroom. He says i am the asshole for not being quiet when he\u2019s on calls while I think he is the asshole for not setting his office up in the dang basement. Please resolve our fight for us.  Thank you!\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the situation is in the wrong. The scenario is about a couple where the husband set up his office in their bedroom, leading to disruptions for the wife. She wanted him to use the basement instead, which she offers as a solution for less interference. The husband prefers the bedroom for the view. The wife has to manage the kids and housework while he's there, and she can't even take a shower or nap without worrying about disturbing him. She told him she can't guarantee silence if he's in their bedroom but would ensure silence if he were in the basement. Now, they argue about who's the asshole.\n\nThe user thinks the author (the wife) is in the wrong but wants to know what I think. The answer should be A or B. \n\nFirst, I need to analyze the situation. The key factors here are the husband's choice to set up in the bedroom despite the wife's suggestion, and the resulting impact on her ability to function in her home. The wife is shouldering most of the domestic responsibilities and her work, which makes the disruption significant. The husband's preference for the bedroom over the basement might be a matter of comfort or view, but it's causing her major inconvenience. \n\nThe user initially thought the wife is in the wrong, but from my perspective, the husband's decision to prioritize his comfort over her practical needs might make him the one in the wrong. The wife's request is reasonable: use a space that's better for focus (basement) to allow her to manage the household and her work. By choosing to be in the bedroom, he's creating a situation where she can't even do basic tasks without worrying about disturbing him. \n\nHowever, the wife did offer a compromise (basement for silence). The husband's refusal might be the crux here. The wife's actions are trying to balance both their needs, but the husband's choice is causing the conflict. So, the husband's inconsiderate choice could be the issue. Therefore, the wife isn't in the wrong for pointing this out. The answer would be B (the author is not in the wrong).\n"
