He decided to set up his office in our bedroom.  I suggested he set up in the basement where he would be guaranteed silence and very little disruption.  He prefers to work from our bedroom because the view is better.  His job is 90% conference calls so while he is up there, I have to keep kids from disturbing him which basically means the whole top floor of our house is off limits while he is on calls.  It also means I can\u2019t shower in my bathroom, do chores, put away laundry, or even take a nap when the baby is sleeping.  I also work from home but also take on most of the house chores and dealing with kids.  Him being up there negates my ability to take a damn shower or a poop in peace when I want to.   Since we have adequate space in the basement I told him that we would never bother him while he is down there ever but I can\u2019t promise him silence if he stays in our bedroom. He says i am the asshole for not being quiet when he\u2019s on calls while I think he is the asshole for not setting his office up in the dang basement. Please resolve our fight for us.  Thank you!\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out who's in the wrong here. So the situation is about a couple where the husband works from home and set up his office in their bedroom, causing disruptions for the wife. The wife suggested using the basement instead, which would be quieter. The husband prefers the bedroom for the view. The wife ends up having to manage the kids, chores, and even her own needs because the top floor is off-limits when he's on calls. She works from home too and handles most of the housework. The husband says she's the asshole for not keeping quiet, while she thinks he's the asshole for not using the basement. The user is asking if the author (the wife) is in the wrong.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the arguments from both sides. The husband chose the bedroom despite the basement being available. He's using his preference for the view as a reason, but that might not be a strong enough justification given the impact on his wife's daily life. The wife is taking on a lot, both work and household responsibilities, and the husband's setup is limiting her ability to do her job and manage the house. The basement option would minimize disruptions for both, so why isn't he using that? Maybe he values the view more than her comfort? But that seems selfish.\n\nThen there's the question of shared responsibility. Both work from home and have kids, so they need a setup that allows both to function. By choosing the bedroom, he's imposing his preference on her, making her adjust her schedule and activities to avoid disturbing him. The wife is trying to set boundaries by saying she can't guarantee silence if he's in the bedroom. That makes sense because she can't control the kids or her own needs. The husband, in turn, is upset about the noise, but maybe he overlooked the practical implications of his choice.\n\nThe key points here are about compromise and considering each other's needs. The husband's decision to work in the bedroom despite the basement being available might be the root of the problem. The wife is not in the wrong for not keeping him undisturbed because the disruptions are beyond her control (kids, chores, etc.), and she's already made a compromise by offering the basement. The husband isn't respecting her needs by sticking to his preference without considering how it affects her. So, the answer would be that the author (wife) is not in the wrong. Therefore, the correct answer is B.\n"
