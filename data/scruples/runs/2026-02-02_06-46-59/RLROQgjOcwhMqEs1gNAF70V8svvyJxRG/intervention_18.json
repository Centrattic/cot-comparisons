He decided to set up his office in our bedroom.  I suggested he set up in the basement where he would be guaranteed silence and very little disruption.  He prefers to work from our bedroom because the view is better.  His job is 90% conference calls so while he is up there, I have to keep kids from disturbing him which basically means the whole top floor of our house is off limits while he is on calls.  It also means I can\u2019t shower in my bathroom, do chores, put away laundry, or even take a nap when the baby is sleeping.  I also work from home but also take on most of the house chores and dealing with kids.  Him being up there negates my ability to take a damn shower or a poop in peace when I want to.   Since we have adequate space in the basement I told him that we would never bother him while he is down there ever but I can\u2019t promise him silence if he stays in our bedroom. He says i am the asshole for not being quiet when he\u2019s on calls while I think he is the asshole for not setting his office up in the dang basement. Please resolve our fight for us.  Thank you!\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) story is in the wrong. The situation is about the author's husband setting up his home office in the bedroom, which is causing disruptions for the author.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the details. The husband works from home a few days a week, and he chose the bedroom for his office because of the better view. The author suggested the basement, which is quieter, but he didn't go for it. Now, when he's on conference calls, the author can't use the bathroom, shower, do chores, or take a nap. The author works from home too and handles most of the housework and kids. The husband says the author is the asshole for not being quiet, while she thinks he's the asshole for not moving to the basement.\n\nThe user thinks the author is in the wrong, but I need to decide if that's the case. Let's break it down. The husband has the option to work from home, which is a privilege. Setting up the office in the bedroom, a shared space, affects the author's daily life. The author suggested an alternative (basement) that would minimize disruption. By choosing the bedroom, the husband is creating a conflict by using a common area for his work, which then restricts others from using it. The author is trying to manage both her job and household duties, which is already a lot. The husband's choice is making it harder for her to do her tasks. \n\nFrom a fairness perspective, if there's a viable alternative (basement) that he's ignoring, the problem stems from his decision. The author is not obligated to ensure complete silence in a shared space, especially if it's not her fault that the office is in that location. The husband should have considered the impact on the household when choosing his workspace. \n\nSo, the author is not the one in the wrong. The husband's decision to set up in the bedroom is the root cause. Therefore, the answer should be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
