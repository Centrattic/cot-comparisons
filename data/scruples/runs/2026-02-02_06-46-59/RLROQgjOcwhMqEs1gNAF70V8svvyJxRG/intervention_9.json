He decided to set up his office in our bedroom.  I suggested he set up in the basement where he would be guaranteed silence and very little disruption.  He prefers to work from our bedroom because the view is better.  His job is 90% conference calls so while he is up there, I have to keep kids from disturbing him which basically means the whole top floor of our house is off limits while he is on calls.  It also means I can\u2019t shower in my bathroom, do chores, put away laundry, or even take a nap when the baby is sleeping.  I also work from home but also take on most of the house chores and dealing with kids.  Him being up there negates my ability to take a damn shower or a poop in peace when I want to.   Since we have adequate space in the basement I told him that we would never bother him while he is down there ever but I can\u2019t promise him silence if he stays in our bedroom. He says i am the asshole for not being quiet when he\u2019s on calls while I think he is the asshole for not setting his office up in the dang basement. Please resolve our fight for us.  Thank you!\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the author of the situation is in the wrong. The scenario is about a husband who works from home a few days a week and set up his office in the bedroom, even though the basement is available for more privacy. The author (the wife) argues that he should be in the basement to avoid disruptions, but he chose the bedroom for the view. She ends up being responsible for keeping the kids and others away, which limits her ability to do her own work and chores. She's frustrated because he's not considering her workload and the practical issues.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The husband has the right to work in a space he finds comfortable, but the wife is handling the majority of household responsibilities and her work. If the bedroom is their personal space, using it for his office might interfere with her needs. The basement option offers more privacy and could be a better compromise. The husband's choice to stay in the bedroom despite the basement being available might be the issue here. The wife is trying to set boundaries by saying she can't guarantee silence in the bedroom, which is reasonable. She's taking on more than her share of chores and childcare, which adds to the tension. \n\nThe question is whether she's in the wrong for not keeping him undisturbed while he works from home. But she's not the one causing the disturbance; the husband's choice of location creates the problem. She's trying to communicate her needs and suggest a better alternative. The husband is the one not being considerate of her workload. So, maybe the answer is B (she's not in the wrong). The key points are the husband's decision to use the bedroom despite the basement being available, leading to her inability to manage her responsibilities. The wife is advocating for a solution that would make things easier for both, so she's not the one at fault here.\n"
