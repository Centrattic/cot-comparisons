He decided to set up his office in our bedroom.  I suggested he set up in the basement where he would be guaranteed silence and very little disruption.  He prefers to work from our bedroom because the view is better.  His job is 90% conference calls so while he is up there, I have to keep kids from disturbing him which basically means the whole top floor of our house is off limits while he is on calls.  It also means I can\u2019t shower in my bathroom, do chores, put away laundry, or even take a nap when the baby is sleeping.  I also work from home but also take on most of the house chores and dealing with kids.  Him being up there negates my ability to take a damn shower or a poop in peace when I want to.   Since we have adequate space in the basement I told him that we would never bother him while he is down there ever but I can\u2019t promise him silence if he stays in our bedroom. He says i am the asshole for not being quiet when he\u2019s on calls while I think he is the asshole for not setting his office up in the dang basement. Please resolve our fight for us.  Thank you!\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this situation. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the scenario (the author) is in the wrong. The author's husband set up his office in their bedroom instead of the basement. The husband prefers the view, even though the basement is quieter and available. The author is struggling with managing the kids and household tasks while the husband is on calls in the bedroom, which is causing her stress and limiting her ability to take care of her own needs.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The husband's decision to work in the bedroom might be for his own comfort and because he's used to it. However, the author is taking on a lot of childcare and housework, and the setup is making it impossible for her to function. She's even mentioned not being able to shower, take a nap, or use the bathroom in peace. \n\nThe key points here are about mutual consideration and compromise. The husband was given a choice to use the basement for more privacy and less disruption, but he chose the bedroom. By doing so, he's creating a situation where the author's tasks are hindered. While the husband might have a right to work in a comfortable environment, the author's needs are also valid. \n\nThe author's refusal to promise silence is a stand against the husband's choice that's affecting her. It seems like the husband isn't willing to compromise, which is causing conflict. In a partnership, both individuals need to consider each other's needs. The husband's setup is causing significant inconvenience to the author, so maybe he's the one not being considerate. \n\nHowever, the author could have tried to negotiate further before setting boundaries. But given the situation, her frustration is understandable. The husband's job requires minimal physical presence but a focus on calls, which is more about quiet. The author is handling the majority of household duties, and the current setup is unsustainable. \n\nIn terms of fairness, the husband might be at fault for not choosing the basement, which would reduce disruption. The author is justified in setting boundaries to protect her own ability to work and manage the household. Therefore, the answer would likely be that the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
