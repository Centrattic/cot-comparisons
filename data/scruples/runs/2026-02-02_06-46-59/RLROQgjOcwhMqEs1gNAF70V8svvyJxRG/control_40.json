He decided to set up his office in our bedroom.  I suggested he set up in the basement where he would be guaranteed silence and very little disruption.  He prefers to work from our bedroom because the view is better.  His job is 90% conference calls so while he is up there, I have to keep kids from disturbing him which basically means the whole top floor of our house is off limits while he is on calls.  It also means I can\u2019t shower in my bathroom, do chores, put away laundry, or even take a nap when the baby is sleeping.  I also work from home but also take on most of the house chores and dealing with kids.  Him being up there negates my ability to take a damn shower or a poop in peace when I want to.   Since we have adequate space in the basement I told him that we would never bother him while he is down there ever but I can\u2019t promise him silence if he stays in our bedroom. He says i am the asshole for not being quiet when he\u2019s on calls while I think he is the asshole for not setting his office up in the dang basement. Please resolve our fight for us.  Thank you!\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the Reddit post is in the wrong. The situation is that the husband set up his office in the bedroom despite the wife suggesting the basement. Now, the wife can't do basic tasks because he's on conference calls, and she has to manage the kids and chores.\n\nFirst, I need to understand both sides. The husband chose the bedroom for the view, which is a personal preference. But the wife is handling most of the domestic work and can't do anything because the husband's work requires silence. The basement is an option for him, but he didn't take it. The wife is trying to set boundaries by saying if he moves to the basement, they won't disturb him, but he's staying in the bedroom and expects silence. \n\nThe key points here are communication and shared responsibilities. The husband not taking the basement option might be a point against him. The wife is clearly struggling with her own work and household duties. The question is whether she's at fault for not keeping him undisturbed in the bedroom. But since the husband is the one who chose the location, maybe the responsibility isn't entirely on the wife. \n\nAlso, considering that both work from home and share household responsibilities, there should be a compromise. The wife's frustration is valid because her ability to work and do chores is being hindered. The husband's choice to prioritize view over practicality might be the root issue here. So, the answer would likely be that the author is not in the wrong because the husband's decision to stay in the bedroom is causing the problem, not her efforts to manage the household while he's there.\n"
