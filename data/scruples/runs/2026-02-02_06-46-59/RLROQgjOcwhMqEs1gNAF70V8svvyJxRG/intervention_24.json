He decided to set up his office in our bedroom.  I suggested he set up in the basement where he would be guaranteed silence and very little disruption.  He prefers to work from our bedroom because the view is better.  His job is 90% conference calls so while he is up there, I have to keep kids from disturbing him which basically means the whole top floor of our house is off limits while he is on calls.  It also means I can\u2019t shower in my bathroom, do chores, put away laundry, or even take a nap when the baby is sleeping.  I also work from home but also take on most of the house chores and dealing with kids.  Him being up there negates my ability to take a damn shower or a poop in peace when I want to.   Since we have adequate space in the basement I told him that we would never bother him while he is down there ever but I can\u2019t promise him silence if he stays in our bedroom. He says i am the asshole for not being quiet when he\u2019s on calls while I think he is the asshole for not setting his office up in the dang basement. Please resolve our fight for us.  Thank you!\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the situation is in the wrong. The scenario is about a husband setting up his office in the bedroom, causing disruptions for the author who has to manage the kids and household tasks.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the key points. The husband chose the bedroom over the basement because of the view. His job is mostly conference calls, so the author has to prevent the kids from disturbing him. This leads to the author being unable to use the top floor for normal activities like showering or doing chores. The author works from home too and handles most of the housework and kids. She told him she can't guarantee silence if he's in the bedroom, but the basement is available. The husband thinks she's the problem for not being quiet, while she thinks he's wrong for not using the basement.\n\nThe user initially thinks the author is in the wrong but wants a second opinion. So, the question is whether the author is at fault here.\n\nLet me break it down. The husband has the option to work from the basement, which would minimize disruptions. By choosing the bedroom, he's creating a situation where the author's ability to manage the household is compromised. The author is working from home as well and handling most of the domestic responsibilities. The husband's choice directly affects her ability to do her job and take care of the house.\n\nFrom a fairness perspective, when someone has a choice between two locations, the one that causes fewer disruptions for the household should be the preferred choice. The basement, being quieter and less used by the family, seems like the more considerate option. The husband chose the bedroom, which is a shared space, leading to conflicts. The author is trying to balance her work and family duties, but the husband's setup is making it harder for her.\n\nThe argument here is about mutual consideration. The husband isn't respecting the author's need for space and quiet to do her own work and manage the house. The author is trying to set boundaries, which is reasonable. If the husband had chosen the basement, these conflicts wouldn't arise. Therefore, the husband's decision is the root of the problem, making the author not at fault.\n\nSo, the answer would be B (No, the author is not in the wrong). The husband is the one making the choice that causes disruption, and the author is just trying to cope with the situation he created.\n"
