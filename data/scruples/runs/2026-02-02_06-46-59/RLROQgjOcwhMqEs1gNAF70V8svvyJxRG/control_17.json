He decided to set up his office in our bedroom.  I suggested he set up in the basement where he would be guaranteed silence and very little disruption.  He prefers to work from our bedroom because the view is better.  His job is 90% conference calls so while he is up there, I have to keep kids from disturbing him which basically means the whole top floor of our house is off limits while he is on calls.  It also means I can\u2019t shower in my bathroom, do chores, put away laundry, or even take a nap when the baby is sleeping.  I also work from home but also take on most of the house chores and dealing with kids.  Him being up there negates my ability to take a damn shower or a poop in peace when I want to.   Since we have adequate space in the basement I told him that we would never bother him while he is down there ever but I can\u2019t promise him silence if he stays in our bedroom. He says i am the asshole for not being quiet when he\u2019s on calls while I think he is the asshole for not setting his office up in the dang basement. Please resolve our fight for us.  Thank you!\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote this is in the wrong. The situation is about a husband setting up his office in the bedroom instead of the basement, leading to conflicts with the wife who handles most of the housework and childcare. \n\nFirst, the husband chose the bedroom for better scenery, even though the basement is more practical. The wife is struggling to manage the house and her own work because the bedroom is now off-limits during his calls. She told him she can't guarantee silence there, so he should move to the basement. He's upset she isn't quiet, but she's arguing he should move.\n\nSo, the question is whether the author (the wife) is wrong for not keeping him undisturbed. The key points are the husband's choice to be in a disruptive location despite having a better option. The wife is already overburdened with work and kids. By choosing the bedroom, he's making her life harder. She's being honest about the trade-off, which is a reasonable response. He's the one who opted for convenience over practicality. The wife isn't obligated to sacrifice her needs for his preference. Therefore, the author isn't in the wrong. Answer B.\n"
