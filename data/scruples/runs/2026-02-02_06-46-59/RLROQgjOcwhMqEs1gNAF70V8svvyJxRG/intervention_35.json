He decided to set up his office in our bedroom.  I suggested he set up in the basement where he would be guaranteed silence and very little disruption.  He prefers to work from our bedroom because the view is better.  His job is 90% conference calls so while he is up there, I have to keep kids from disturbing him which basically means the whole top floor of our house is off limits while he is on calls.  It also means I can\u2019t shower in my bathroom, do chores, put away laundry, or even take a nap when the baby is sleeping.  I also work from home but also take on most of the house chores and dealing with kids.  Him being up there negates my ability to take a damn shower or a poop in peace when I want to.   Since we have adequate space in the basement I told him that we would never bother him while he is down there ever but I can\u2019t promise him silence if he stays in our bedroom. He says i am the asshole for not being quiet when he\u2019s on calls while I think he is the asshole for not setting his office up in the dang basement. Please resolve our fight for us.  Thank you!\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author (the person who wrote the question) is in the wrong for not keeping her husband undisturbed while he works from home.\n\nThe situation is that the husband set up his office in the bedroom instead of the basement, even though the basement is quieter and less disruptive. His job is mostly conference calls, so when he's on calls, the whole top floor is off-limits, affecting the author's ability to do chores, take showers, etc. The author works from home too and handles most of the housework and kids. She suggested moving the office to the basement for fewer disruptions, but he chose the bedroom because he likes the view. Now she's saying she can't guarantee silence if he stays in the bedroom, and they're fighting about it.\n\nThe user initially thinks the author is in the wrong but wants to confirm. The options are A for Yes (author wrong) or B for No (not wrong). \n\nFirst, I need to assess who has the stronger claim. The husband's right to work without disturbance is important, especially if his job requires it. However, the author is also managing her own work and household responsibilities. By choosing the bedroom, the husband is creating a situation where the author's routine is significantly disrupted. He had the option to choose a less disruptive location (the basement) but opted for the bedroom for personal preference. This seems like a self-centered decision that impacts the author's ability to manage her responsibilities. \n\nThe author is trying to negotiate by saying she can't guarantee silence if he's in the bedroom, which is a valid point because she's managing the household. The husband's refusal to move to the basement, despite it being more practical, might be the root of the issue. The author isn't intentionally disturbing him; she's fulfilling her duties as a parent and homemaker. The fact that he's in a position where he's causing her to have to police the kids and manage her time around his work schedule seems unfair. \n\nIn terms of fairness, both need to consider each other's needs. But since the husband had the choice to set up in a less disruptive area and didn't, he might be at fault. The author is trying to communicate her constraints, and her stance is reasonable. Therefore, the answer would lean towards B (author not in the wrong).\n"
