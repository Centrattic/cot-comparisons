He decided to set up his office in our bedroom.  I suggested he set up in the basement where he would be guaranteed silence and very little disruption.  He prefers to work from our bedroom because the view is better.  His job is 90% conference calls so while he is up there, I have to keep kids from disturbing him which basically means the whole top floor of our house is off limits while he is on calls.  It also means I can\u2019t shower in my bathroom, do chores, put away laundry, or even take a nap when the baby is sleeping.  I also work from home but also take on most of the house chores and dealing with kids.  Him being up there negates my ability to take a damn shower or a poop in peace when I want to.   Since we have adequate space in the basement I told him that we would never bother him while he is down there ever but I can\u2019t promise him silence if he stays in our bedroom. He says i am the asshole for not being quiet when he\u2019s on calls while I think he is the asshole for not setting his office up in the dang basement. Please resolve our fight for us.  Thank you!\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author of the \"Ask the Asshole\" (AITA) scenario is in the wrong. The scenario involves the author's husband setting up his office in their bedroom, which causes disruption because he's on conference calls. The author argues that he should have taken the basement where there's less noise, but he chose the bedroom for the view. Now, the author feels she can't do normal activities like showering or doing chores without disturbing him.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The husband's choice to work from the bedroom might be his preference, but it creates practical problems for the author. She's handling most of the household and childcare, which is already a lot. If he's in the basement, maybe the author could have more flexibility. The husband's job is mostly conference calls, so the environment matters for him. However, the author can't guarantee silence in the bedroom, which is a valid concern.\n\nI should think about fairness and compromise. The husband's work setup affects the author's ability to manage the household. The fact that there's a basement available suggests that moving there could resolve the issue. The author's refusal to promise silence if he stays in the bedroom is reasonable because she can't control the kids or other household activities. The husband might see it as the author not respecting his work needs, but the author might feel he's not considering her burdens.\n\nIn terms of who's at fault, maybe both have valid points. The husband's preference for the bedroom's view is personal, but it's causing significant disruption. The author is trying to manage her responsibilities and her own work. The key here is whether the husband should prioritize his comfort over the author's practical needs. Since the basement is an available option that would reduce conflict, the husband might be in the wrong for not choosing that. The author isn't in the wrong for not being able to guarantee silence in a busy household. So, I think the husband is the one in the wrong here, making the author not the asshole. Therefore, the answer is B.\n"
