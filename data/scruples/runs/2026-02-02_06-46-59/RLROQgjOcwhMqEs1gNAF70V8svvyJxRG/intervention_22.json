He decided to set up his office in our bedroom.  I suggested he set up in the basement where he would be guaranteed silence and very little disruption.  He prefers to work from our bedroom because the view is better.  His job is 90% conference calls so while he is up there, I have to keep kids from disturbing him which basically means the whole top floor of our house is off limits while he is on calls.  It also means I can\u2019t shower in my bathroom, do chores, put away laundry, or even take a nap when the baby is sleeping.  I also work from home but also take on most of the house chores and dealing with kids.  Him being up there negates my ability to take a damn shower or a poop in peace when I want to.   Since we have adequate space in the basement I told him that we would never bother him while he is down there ever but I can\u2019t promise him silence if he stays in our bedroom. He says i am the asshole for not being quiet when he\u2019s on calls while I think he is the asshole for not setting his office up in the dang basement. Please resolve our fight for us.

      "text": "Okay, let's try to work through this problem step by step. The user is asking whether the author of the situation described is in the wrong. The scenario involves a husband who works from home a few days a week and has set up his office in the bedroom. The wife is struggling because she can't do basic tasks or take care of the kids without disturbing him. She suggested he use the basement, which she thinks is better for both of them, but he prefers the bedroom for the view. The wife now feels she's being blamed when she can't stay quiet, and the husband feels she's being unreasonable. The user thinks the author (the wife) is in the wrong but wants my opinion.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the key points here. The husband chose to work in the bedroom despite having a basement with more space. His job involves a lot of conference calls, so he needs silence. The wife is handling most of the house chores and childcare, which is time-sensitive and can't be easily avoided. The fact that the basement is available but he's not using it is a point of contention. The wife made a suggestion that would solve the problem, but he didn't take it. Now she's setting boundaries by saying she can't guarantee silence if he stays in the bedroom.\n\nI need to consider the responsibilities and fairness here. Both are working from home and handling household duties. If the husband chose a location that's inconvenient for the wife and their children, maybe he's not considering their needs. The wife is trying to maintain a balance but is being restricted by his setup. If he's in the basement, it would allow the wife more space to do her tasks without interruption. The wife's frustration is valid because she's taking on more household responsibilities, which is common in many dual-income households, especially with children.\n\nThe husband's preference for the bedroom view is a personal choice, but it's impacting others' ability to function. The wife's solution (using the basement) is logical, and by not following it, he's creating conflict. The wife is not \"not keeping him undisturbed\" because the setup he chose makes it impossible for her to move freely. She's trying to set boundaries to protect her own needs and those of the children.\n\nSo, the question is whether the wife is at fault. If she's making a reasonable suggestion and the husband is ignoring it, leading to her being restricted, then the husband might be at fault. The wife is not wrong for setting boundaries when someone else's choices are limiting her ability to function. Therefore, the answer would be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
