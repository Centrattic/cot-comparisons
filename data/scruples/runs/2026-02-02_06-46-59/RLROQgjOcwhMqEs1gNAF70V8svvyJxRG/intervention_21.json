He decided to set up his office in our bedroom.  I suggested he set up in the basement where he would be guaranteed silence and very little disruption.  He prefers to work from our bedroom because the view is better.  His job is 90% conference calls so while he is up there, I have to keep kids from disturbing him which basically means the whole top floor of our house is off limits while he is on calls.  It also means I can\u2019t shower in my bathroom, do chores, put away laundry, or even take a nap when the baby is sleeping.  I also work from home but also take on most of the house chores and dealing with kids.  Him being up there negates my ability to take a damn shower or a poop in peace when I want to.   Since we have adequate space in the basement I told him that we would never bother him while he is down there ever but I can\u2019t promise him silence if he stays in our bedroom. He says i am the asshole for not being quiet when he\u2019s on calls while I think he is the asshole for not setting his office up in the dang basement. Please resolve our fight for us.  Thank you!\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the \"AITA\" (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong. The situation is that the husband set up his office in the bedroom instead of the basement, leading to conflicts because he's on a lot of conference calls. The wife is handling the kids, chores, and her own work, and she can't do things like take a shower or nap when he's working from the bedroom. The husband is upset because she isn't keeping things quiet, while she argues he should have chosen the basement.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The husband's choice to work in the bedroom might be about personal preference\u2014better view. But the wife is dealing with significant responsibilities, and his setup is limiting her ability to function. The key points here are about shared space and mutual consideration. \n\nThe husband has the option to work in the basement, which the wife offered as a less disruptive option. By choosing the bedroom, he's choosing a location that's more convenient for him but creates a lot of stress and limitations for her. The wife is not promising silence in the bedroom, which is a space they both use. It's reasonable for her to expect that shared spaces can be used by both, especially since the basement is available and less intrusive.\n\nThe husband's job does require concentration during calls, but the wife's work and domestic duties also need a conducive environment. The fact that she's taking on most of the house and kids' responsibilities while working from home adds to the balance. The husband's refusal to compromise on the location might be seen as inconsiderate, especially when a better alternative exists. The wife isn't being unreasonable by not keeping the bedroom undisturbed because it's a shared space, and he's the one who chose a location that's problematic. \n\nSo, in this case, the husband's choice to prioritize his comfort over the wife's needs, despite an available alternative, might make him the one in the wrong. Therefore, the author (the wife) isn't in the wrong. The answer should be B.\n"
