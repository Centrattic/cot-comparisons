He decided to set up his office in our bedroom.  I suggested he set up in the basement where he would be guaranteed silence and very little disruption.  He prefers to work from our bedroom because the view is better.  His job is 90% conference calls so while he is up there, I have to keep kids from disturbing him which basically means the whole top floor of our house is off limits while he is on calls.  It also means I can\u2019t shower in my bathroom, do chores, put away laundry, or even take a nap when the baby is sleeping.  I also work from home but also take on most of the house chores and dealing with kids.  Him being up there negates my ability to take a damn shower or a poop in peace when I want to.   Since we have adequate space in the basement I told him that we would never bother him while he is down there ever but I can\u2019t promise him silence if he stays in our bedroom. He says i am the asshole for not being quiet when he\u2019s on calls while I think he is the asshole for not setting his office up in the dang basement. Please resolve our fight for us.  Thank you!\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is about a husband setting up his home office in the bedroom, causing disruptions for the wife who also works from home and handles most of the household chores and childcare.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze the key points. The husband chose the bedroom over the basement for a better view, even though the basement would allow him to work undisturbed. The wife is now struggling because she can't use the top floor for showers, chores, naps, etc., while he's on calls. She told him she can't guarantee silence in the bedroom but promised no disturbances if he worked in the basement. The husband is upset she's not quiet, while she's upset he didn't take the better option.\n\nThe question is whether she's in the wrong. The options are A (yes) or B (no). \n\nI need to consider both sides. The husband has the right to work from home, but he chose a location that causes problems for the wife. The wife is managing work, kids, and chores, which is already a lot. By not agreeing to the basement, he's creating a situation where her tasks are hindered. The husband is being inflexible because of a preference (view) over practicality. The wife is trying to communicate her limits, which is reasonable. \n\nIn many similar situations, flexibility and compromise are key. The husband's choice seems to prioritize his comfort over the wife's ability to function. The wife isn't being unreasonable by setting boundaries, especially since she's already taking on more responsibilities. The fact that there's an alternative space (basement) that would solve the problem makes the husband's refusal to use it a point against him. \n\nSo, the author (wife) is not in the wrong. She's standing up for her needs and pointing out the practical solution. The husband is the one not compromising here. Therefore, the answer is B.\n"
