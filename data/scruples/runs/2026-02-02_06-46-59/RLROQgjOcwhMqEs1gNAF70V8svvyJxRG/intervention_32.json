He decided to set up his office in our bedroom.  I suggested he set up in the basement where he would be guaranteed silence and very little disruption.  He prefers to work from our bedroom because the view is better.  His job is 90% conference calls so while he is up there, I have to keep kids from disturbing him which basically means the whole top floor of our house is off limits while he is on calls.  It also means I can\u2019t shower in my bathroom, do chores, put away laundry, or even take a nap when the baby is sleeping.  I also work from home but also take on most of the house chores and dealing with kids.  Him being up there negates my ability to take a damn shower or a poop in peace when I want to.   Since we have adequate space in the basement I told him that we would never bother him while he is down there ever but I can\u2019t promise him silence if he stays in our bedroom. He says i am the asshole for not being quiet when he\u2019s on calls while I think he is the asshole for not setting his office up in the dang basement. Please resolve our fight for us.  Thank you!\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the situation is in the wrong. The scenario is about a husband setting up his office in the bedroom, causing disruptions for the wife. The wife suggested the basement for less disturbance but he chose the bedroom for a better view. Now she's struggling with managing the kids, chores, and her own work because he's in the bedroom working.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze the key points. The husband's job is mostly conference calls, so he needs quiet during those times. The wife is handling most of the household duties and her own work from home. The problem is that the husband's choice of location is making it hard for the wife to do her tasks and manage the kids. She told him she can't guarantee quiet in the bedroom but can in the basement. He's upset she's not being quiet, while she thinks he's wrong for not choosing the basement.\n\nNow, considering typical responsibilities in a household. Usually, both partners should compromise and consider each other's needs. Setting up an office in a shared space like the bedroom might not be the best idea if it causes significant disruption. The husband's preference for a better view seems less important compared to the practical impact on his wife's ability to manage the home and work. The wife is taking on a lot, especially with kids involved.\n\nIs the wife in the wrong? If she didn't set boundaries and let him choose the bedroom despite knowing the issues, maybe. But she did suggest the basement, which he rejected. She's honest about her limitations in keeping the bedroom quiet. The husband is the one who chose a location that's causing conflicts. So perhaps the husband is the asshole here. The wife is trying to manage and has communicated her concerns. The husband isn't considering her workload and the impact of his decision.\n\nBut maybe the wife could have found another solution? Like using a different room or adjusting schedules. However, the basement was available and he refused. So the main issue is his choice leading to her being overburdened. The wife isn't at fault for not keeping the bedroom undisturbed when he knew the risks. Therefore, the answer is B (the author is not in the wrong).\n"
