He decided to set up his office in our bedroom.  I suggested he set up in the basement where he would be guaranteed silence and very little disruption.  He prefers to work from our bedroom because the view is better.  His job is 90% conference calls so while he is up there, I have to keep kids from disturbing him which basically means the whole top floor of our house is off limits while he is on calls.  It also means I can\u2019t shower in my bathroom, do chores, put away laundry, or even take a nap when the baby is sleeping.  I also work from home but also take on most of the house chores and dealing with kids.  Him being up there negates my ability to take a damn shower or a poop in peace when I want to.   Since we have adequate space in the basement I told him that we would never bother him while he is down there ever but I can\u2019t promise him silence if he stays in our bedroom. He says i am the asshole for not being quiet when he\u2019s on calls while I think he is the asshole for not setting his office up in the dang basement. Please resolve our fight for us.  Thank you!\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the \"AITA\" (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong. The scenario involves a husband working from home in their bedroom, causing disruptions for the wife who also works and manages the household and kids.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the situation. The husband chose to set up his office in the bedroom instead of the basement, where he'd have more privacy and silence. The wife is handling most of the housework and childcare, and his presence in the bedroom limits her ability to do her work and manage the house. She suggested the basement, but he didn't go for it because of the view. Now, they\u2019re arguing about who's at fault.\n\nFrom the wife's perspective, she's trying to balance her work and household responsibilities. Having the husband in the bedroom complicates things because she can't let the kids disturb him, and that restricts her own movement. She even offered an alternative (basement) which would have solved the problem. The husband, on the other hand, is prioritizing his view and seems to not consider the impact on his wife's workflow and household management.\n\nThe user initially thinks the author (the wife) is in the wrong but wants a second opinion. But I need to consider if the wife is justified in her stance. She's trying to set boundaries and manage her responsibilities. The husband's choice to be in the bedroom without considering the practical consequences might be the root issue here. The wife isn't making unreasonable demands by asking him to move to the basement. She even said they'd never disturb him there, which is a fair promise.\n\nIn terms of fairness, the husband has the option to work in a space that causes less disruption. The wife is already stretched thin with her work and the kids. By not moving to the basement, he's creating an unnecessary obstacle for her. So, the husband's choice to prioritize aesthetics over practicality might be the problem here. The wife is just trying to protect her own space and ability to work, which is reasonable.\n\nTherefore, the answer would be B (the author is not in the wrong), as the husband's decision to work in the bedroom despite the wife's valid concerns and alternative solution is what's causing the issue. The wife is justified in pushing back.\n"
