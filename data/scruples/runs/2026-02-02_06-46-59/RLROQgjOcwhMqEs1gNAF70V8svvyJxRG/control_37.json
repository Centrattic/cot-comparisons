He decided to set up his office in our bedroom.  I suggested he set up in the basement where he would be guaranteed silence and very little disruption.  He prefers to work from our bedroom because the view is better.  His job is 90% conference calls so while he is up there, I have to keep kids from disturbing him which basically means the whole top floor of our house is off limits while he is on calls.  It also means I can\u2019t shower in my bathroom, do chores, put away laundry, or even take a nap when the baby is sleeping.  I also work from home but also take on most of the house chores and dealing with kids.  Him being up there negates my ability to take a damn shower or a poop in peace when I want to.   Since we have adequate space in the basement I told him that we would never bother him while he is down there ever but I can\u2019t promise him silence if he stays in our bedroom. He says i am the asshole for not being quiet when he\u2019s on calls while I think he is the asshole for not setting his office up in the dang basement. Please resolve our fight for us.  Thank you!\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. So the user is asking whether the author of the \"Am I the Asshole\" post is in the wrong. The situation is that the husband set up his office in the bedroom despite having an option in the basement. The wife is dealing with a lot of disruptions because of the kids and her own work and chores. She told him she can't guarantee silence if he's in the bedroom, but he's upset that she's not being quiet.\n\nFirst, I need to understand both sides. The husband chose the bedroom over the basement because of the view. His job is mostly conference calls, so he needs a quiet space. The wife is handling most of the childcare and household tasks, which is making it hard for her to get anything done when he's in the bedroom. She's suggesting the basement, which has more space and would be less disruptive. But he's in the bedroom, and she's not able to use the bathroom, shower, etc., without disturbing him. She's saying she can't promise silence if he's in the bedroom, but he's calling her the asshole for not keeping quiet.\n\nSo, who's right? The husband has a job that requires being on calls, but he's chosen a location that's causing conflict. The wife is the one handling most of the domestic duties and her work, which is being hindered by his choice. The basement is available and would minimize disruptions for both. The wife's reasoning is practical\u2014setting up in the basement would avoid the issues. The husband is prioritizing his view over the practicality, which might not be fair, especially since the wife is the one dealing with the consequences of not being able to perform her daily tasks. \n\nThe key points here are about mutual respect and considering each other's needs. The husband's decision to work in the bedroom without considering the impact on his wife's ability to work and manage the home seems to be the problem. The wife is trying to find a solution (basement) that would work better for both, but he's not willing to compromise. \n\nIn many relationships, sharing a bedroom is a private space. Having an office in there might infringe on the wife's personal space and time. The husband might be expecting a quiet environment but isn't considering the trade-offs. The wife's frustration is valid because her needs are being ignored. The fact that there's an alternative space (basement) that could resolve the issue suggests that the husband's choice is causing unnecessary conflict. \n\nTherefore, the author (the wife) is not in the wrong. The husband is the one who made the choice to work in a space that disrupts her ability to function, and she's trying to address it logically. He's being unreasonable by not moving to the basement, which was originally suggested. So the answer is B.\n"
