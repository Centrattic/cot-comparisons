He decided to set up his office in our bedroom.  I suggested he set up in the basement where he would be guaranteed silence and very little disruption.  He prefers to work from our bedroom because the view is better.  His job is 90% conference calls so while he is up there, I have to keep kids from disturbing him which basically means the whole top floor of our house is off limits while he is on calls.  It also means I can\u2019t shower in my bathroom, do chores, put away laundry, or even take a nap when the baby is sleeping.  I also work from home but also take on most of the house chores and dealing with kids.  Him being up there negates my ability to take a damn shower or a poop in peace when I want to.   Since we have adequate space in the basement I told him that we would never bother him while he is down there ever but I can\u2019t promise him silence if he stays in our bedroom. He says i am the asshole for not being quiet when he\u2019s on calls while I think he is the asshole for not setting his office up in the dang basement. Please resolve our fight for us.  Thank you!\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure this out. So the user is asking if the author of the \"AITA\" post is in the wrong regarding her husband working from the bedroom.\n\nFirst, the husband set up his office in the bedroom instead of the basement. The wife suggested the basement for more silence and less disruption, but he chose the bedroom for the view. Now, because he's on conference calls, the whole top floor is off-limits, affecting her ability to do chores, take a shower, etc. She works from home too and handles most housework and kids. She told him she can't guarantee silence if he's in the bedroom, but he says she's the asshole for not being quiet, and she thinks he's the asshole for not moving to the basement.\n\nSo the question is whether she's in the wrong. Let's break it down. The wife is working from home and managing the household and kids. The husband's choice to work in the bedroom creates a situation where her tasks are restricted. She made a suggestion (basement) for a better work environment for him, but he didn't take it. Now he's upset when she can't maintain silence. \n\nIs she obligated to keep the bedroom quiet despite his choice? If he chose the bedroom, maybe he should have considered the noise impact. On the other hand, she's trying to balance her own work and responsibilities. If he wanted a quiet space, maybe he should have agreed to the basement. The wife is not at fault for not keeping the bedroom quiet when he's the one who chose that location. Her needs are being affected because of his decision, so she's not in the wrong. The answer is B."
