He decided to set up his office in our bedroom.  I suggested he set up in the basement where he would be guaranteed silence and very little disruption.  He prefers to work from our bedroom because the view is better.  His job is 90% conference calls so while he is up there, I have to keep kids from disturbing him which basically means the whole top floor of our house is off limits while he is on calls.  It also means I can\u2019t shower in my bathroom, do chores, put away laundry, or even take a nap when the baby is sleeping.  I also work from home but also take on most of the house chores and dealing with kids.  Him being up there negates my ability to take a damn shower or a poop in peace when I want to.   Since we have adequate space in the basement I told him that we would never bother him while he is down there ever but I can\u2019t promise him silence if he stays in our bedroom. He says i am the asshole for not being quiet when he\u2019s on calls while I think he is the asshole for not setting his office up in the dang basement. Please resolve our fight for us.  Thank you!\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of the \"Am I the Asshole\" post is in the wrong. The situation is about the husband setting up his office in the bedroom, causing disruptions for the wife. \n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The husband works from home part-time and chose the bedroom as his office. The wife suggested the basement for fewer disturbances, but he prefers the view. His job is mostly conference calls, so she has to keep the kids from disturbing him, which limits her ability to use the top floor. She works from home too and handles most chores and childcare. She told him she can't guarantee silence if he stays in the bedroom but promised no disturbances if he used the basement. Now they're arguing about who's the asshole.\n\nThe user wants a yes or no answer if the author is in the wrong. The options are A for yes, B for no.\n\nHmm. The wife is the one who wrote the post, so she's the author. The question is whether she's in the wrong. From the description, she's trying to balance her work and household duties. The husband chose a location that's causing her stress and limiting her ability to work and manage the home. She's making a reasonable suggestion (basement) for his office to avoid the problem, but he refuses for a non-essential reason (better view). \n\nThe wife's actions are in her own interest, trying to maintain her productivity and manage the household. She's not the one causing the disruption; the husband's choice of workspace is the root issue. She's setting boundaries by saying if he's in the basement, there's no problem. But he's choosing not to comply, leading to her being unable to function. \n\nIn typical scenarios like this, the person who is creating a situation that affects others without considering their needs is more in the wrong. The husband is prioritizing his own comfort (view) over the practicality and the wife's responsibilities. The wife is trying to reason and find a solution (basement) but he's not cooperating. \n\nSo the answer would be B (she's not in the wrong) because she's the one trying to resolve the issue and the husband's choice is causing the problem. She's not at fault for not allowing disturbances when he's in a space that's not the designated quiet area.\n"
