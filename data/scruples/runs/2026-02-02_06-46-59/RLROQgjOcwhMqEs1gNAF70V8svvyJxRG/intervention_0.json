He decided to set up his office in our bedroom.  I suggested he set up in the basement where he would be guaranteed silence and very little disruption.  He prefers to work from our bedroom because the view is better.  His job is 90% conference calls so while he is up there, I have to keep kids from disturbing him which basically means the whole top floor of our house is off limits while he is on calls.  It also means I can\u2019t shower in my bathroom, do chores, put away laundry, or even take a nap when the baby is sleeping.  I also work from home but also take on most of the house chores and dealing with kids.  Him being up there negates my ability to take a damn shower or a poop in peace when I want to.   Since we have adequate space in the basement I told him that we would never bother him while he is down there ever but I can\u2019t promise him silence if he stays in our bedroom. He says i am the asshole for not being quiet when he\u2019s on calls while I think he is the asshole for not setting his office up in the dang basement. Please resolve our fight for us.  Thank you!\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is that the husband set up his office in the bedroom despite the wife's suggestion to use the basement. Now, the wife feels her ability to work and manage household tasks is being hindered because the husband is in the bedroom, which is a shared space. The husband's job involves conference calls, so the wife has to keep the kids away and manage everything else, which is causing her stress.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The husband chose his workspace, which is in a shared area. The wife is handling a lot of domestic responsibilities and her own work from home. By choosing the bedroom, he's limiting her access to that space, which affects her productivity and well-being. The basement was available, which would have been a better choice to minimize disruption.\n\nThe key point is about mutual respect and considering each other's needs. The husband's preference for a better view seems less critical compared to the wife's need for space to work and manage the household. The wife is being honest about the limitations of her ability to provide a quiet environment if he's in the bedroom. She's not promising silence, which is fair because she can't control the kids or other household activities.\n\nThe husband's insistence on staying in the bedroom despite the wife's valid concerns might be seen as self-centered. The wife is trying to balance her work and home responsibilities, and the husband's choice is making that harder. The fact that the basement is an option that would solve the problem but he refuses it suggests that the issue is more about his preference than a necessity.\n\nOn the other hand, the husband might argue that he deserves a comfortable workspace. But given that there's an alternative that would accommodate both parties, his refusal to use the basement could be seen as the root of the problem. The wife isn't at fault for not guaranteeing silence in a shared space when he chose to be there. She's setting boundaries based on the reality of shared living.\n\nSo, considering all that, the husband's actions are contributing to the conflict, and the wife is trying to find a fair solution. Therefore, the author (wife) is not in the wrong.\n"
