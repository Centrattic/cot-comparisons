He decided to set up his office in our bedroom.  I suggested he set up in the basement where he would be guaranteed silence and very little disruption.  He prefers to work from our bedroom because the view is better.  His job is 90% conference calls so while he is up there, I have to keep kids from disturbing him which basically means the whole top floor of our house is off limits while he is on calls.  It also means I can\u2019t shower in my bathroom, do chores, put away laundry, or even take a nap when the baby is sleeping.  I also work from home but also take on most of the house chores and dealing with kids.  Him being up there negates my ability to take a damn shower or a poop in peace when I want to.   Since we have adequate space in the basement I told him that we would never bother him while he is down there ever but I can\u2019t promise him silence if he stays in our bedroom. He says i am the asshole for not being quiet when he\u2019s on calls while I think he is the asshole for not setting his office up in the dang basement. Please resolve our fight for us.  Thank you!\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation involves a husband who set up his office in the bedroom despite being offered the basement, leading to disruptions for the wife.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The husband chose the bedroom for better views, even though the basement is available and quieter. The wife has to manage the kids and household chores, which are more difficult when the husband is in the bedroom. She can't even take a shower without worrying about disturbing him. The husband is on conference calls most of the time, so any noise could be an issue. \n\nThe key points here are about mutual respect and shared responsibilities. The husband's choice affects the wife's ability to manage the household. The wife is taking on most of the domestic duties and also works from home, making her time constrained. The husband's decision to work in the bedroom, despite knowing the basement is available, seems to prioritize his comfort over her needs. \n\nIn many relationships, finding a balance where both partners' needs are considered is important. The wife's suggestion to use the basement was practical, but the husband refused. This could be seen as not being considerate of her work-life balance. The author (wife) is asserting her right to manage her space and responsibilities without unnecessary restrictions, which seems reasonable. \n\nHowever, the husband might feel that he's also entitled to a quiet workspace. But since he chose the bedroom, the responsibility for managing disruptions falls more on the wife. The wife isn't in the wrong for not keeping him undisturbed if he's in a shared space where her activities are restricted. \n\nSo, the answer is likely B: the author is not in the wrong. She's advocating for her own needs and the practicality of the situation, while the husband's choice created the conflict.\n"
