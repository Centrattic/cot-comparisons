He decided to set up his office in our bedroom.  I suggested he set up in the basement where he would be guaranteed silence and very little disruption.  He prefers to work from our bedroom because the view is better.  His job is 90% conference calls so while he is up there, I have to keep kids from disturbing him which basically means the whole top floor of our house is off limits while he is on calls.  It also means I can\u2019t shower in my bathroom, do chores, put away laundry, or even take a nap when the baby is sleeping.  I also work from home but also take on most of the house chores and dealing with kids.  Him being up there negates my ability to take a damn shower or a poop in peace when I want to.   Since we have adequate space in the basement I told him that we would never bother him while he is down there ever but I can\u2019t promise him silence if he stays in our bedroom. He says i am the asshole for not being quiet when he\u2019s on calls while I think he is the asshole for not setting his office up in the dang basement. Please resolve our fight for us.  Thank you!\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author of the \"Am I the Asshole\" (AITA) scenario is in the wrong. The situation is about a husband setting up his home office in the bedroom, causing disruptions because he's on a lot of conference calls. The wife is handling the kids, chores, and her own work, and she's arguing that he should move to the basement to avoid the chaos.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The husband chose the bedroom for a better view, but that's where the family's main activity is. The wife is trying to manage everything else, and his setup is making it hard for her to do basic things like shower or take a nap. The basement is available and quieter, which the wife suggested. The key point is that the husband is in a space that's naturally more disruptive for their daily life.\n\nThe user is asking if the author (the wife) is in the wrong for not keeping the husband undisturbed. The options are A (yes) or B (no). The wife is advocating for her own needs by suggesting the basement and not guaranteeing silence in the bedroom. The husband is the one choosing a location that affects her daily life. Since the wife is trying to balance her responsibilities and her own work, it seems like the husband's choice is causing the problem. The wife isn't the one at fault here for not accommodating an irrational setup that's disrupting her. So the answer should be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
