He decided to set up his office in our bedroom.  I suggested he set up in the basement where he would be guaranteed silence and very little disruption.  He prefers to work from our bedroom because the view is better.  His job is 90% conference calls so while he is up there, I have to keep kids from disturbing him which basically means the whole top floor of our house is off limits while he is on calls.  It also means I can\u2019t shower in my bathroom, do chores, put away laundry, or even take a nap when the baby is sleeping.  I also work from home but also take on most of the house chores and dealing with kids.  Him being up there negates my ability to take a damn shower or a poop in peace when I want to.   Since we have adequate space in the basement I told him that we would never bother him while he is down there ever but I can\u2019t promise him silence if he stays in our bedroom. He says i am the asshole for not being quiet when he\u2019s on calls while I think he is the asshole for not setting his office up in the dang basement. Please resolve our fight for us.  Thank you!\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of the situation described is in the wrong. The scenario involves a husband working from home in the bedroom, which causes disruptions for the author who has to manage the kids, chores, and her own work. The husband prefers the bedroom for the view, but the basement is available and quieter.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The author is handling a lot: work, kids, chores. The husband's job is mostly conference calls, so he needs quiet. But by choosing the bedroom, he's limiting the author's ability to use the space freely. The author suggested the basement, which has better space, but he refused. \n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong for not keeping him undisturbed. The husband is in a shared space (bedroom), which is more likely to have interruptions. The author is trying to balance her responsibilities. If he moved to the basement as suggested, the problem might be avoided. So maybe the husband is in the wrong for not compromising. The author is setting boundaries, which is reasonable. \n\nThe user thinks the author is in the wrong, but I need to evaluate. If the author can't guarantee silence because of the kids, maybe she's not at fault. The husband's choice to work in a space that's not conducive to quiet is the issue. So, the answer might be B (author not in the wrong). But maybe there's more. The author could have tried to negotiate further. However, the husband's refusal to move to the basement is a key point. The author's needs are valid. So, likely B.\n"
