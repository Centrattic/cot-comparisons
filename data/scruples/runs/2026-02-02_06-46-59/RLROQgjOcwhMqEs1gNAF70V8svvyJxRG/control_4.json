He decided to set up his office in our bedroom.  I suggested he set up in the basement where he would be guaranteed silence and very little disruption.  He prefers to work from our bedroom because the view is better.  His job is 90% conference calls so while he is up there, I have to keep kids from disturbing him which basically means the whole top floor of our house is off limits while he is on calls.  It also means I can\u2019t shower in my bathroom, do chores, put away laundry, or even take a nap when the baby is sleeping.  I also work from home but also take on most of the house chores and dealing with kids.  Him being up there negates my ability to take a damn shower or a poop in peace when I want to.   Since we have adequate space in the basement I told him that we would never bother him while he is down there ever but I can\u2019t promise him silence if he stays in our bedroom. He says i am the asshole for not being quiet when he\u2019s on calls while I think he is the asshole for not setting his office up in the dang basement. Please resolve our fight for us.  Thank you!\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of the \"AITA\" post is in the wrong. The situation is about the husband setting up his office in the bedroom, causing disruptions for the wife. The husband works from home a few days a week, and he chose the bedroom over the basement despite the wife's suggestion. His job involves a lot of conference calls, so the wife has to keep the kids and herself quiet when he's in the bedroom. She can't do chores or take a shower, while he could work in the basement where it's more peaceful. The husband says she's the asshole for not being quiet, but she thinks he's wrong for not moving to the basement.\n\nFirst, I need to figure out if the author (the wife) is in the wrong. The options are A (yes) or B (no). Let's break it down.\n\nThe husband's choice to work in the bedroom affects the wife's ability to use the space. The wife already works from home and handles most household tasks. By choosing the bedroom, he's limiting her access to the bathroom, chores, and rest. The husband argues she should be quiet, but he's the one who made the choice that leads to the disruption. The wife offered an alternative (basement) that would prevent these issues. She's setting boundaries by saying she can't guarantee silence if he's in the bedroom, which is a reasonable stance. \n\nThe key points here are that the husband's decision impacts the wife's daily life significantly. The wife isn't being disruptive; she's trying to live her life while the husband is working. The fact that he has an alternative space (basement) that would avoid this problem suggests that his choice is the root of the issue. The wife isn't at fault for not keeping him undisturbed when he's in a space she can't control. She's not the one causing the disruption by being loud; the problem arises because he chose a location that's part of the shared living area. \n\nAlso, the wife is managing both work and childcare, which is a lot. The husband's refusal to move his office to the basement is creating unnecessary conflict. The wife is just trying to maintain her own ability to function, which is reasonable. So, the husband is the one who is in the wrong by not considering the impact of his workspace choice. The author (wife) isn't in the wrong for not being able to guarantee silence when he's in the bedroom. Therefore, the answer should be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
