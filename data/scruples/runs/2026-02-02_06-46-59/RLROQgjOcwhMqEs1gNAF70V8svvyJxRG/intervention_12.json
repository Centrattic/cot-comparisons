He decided to set up his office in our bedroom.  I suggested he set up in the basement where he would be guaranteed silence and very little disruption.  He prefers to work from our bedroom because the view is better.  His job is 90% conference calls so while he is up there, I have to keep kids from disturbing him which basically means the whole top floor of our house is off limits while he is on calls.  It also means I can\u2019t shower in my bathroom, do chores, put away laundry, or even take a nap when the baby is sleeping.  I also work from home but also take on most of the house chores and dealing with kids.  Him being up there negates my ability to take a damn shower or a poop in peace when I want to.   Since we have adequate space in the basement I told him that we would never bother him while he is down there ever but I can\u2019t promise him silence if he stays in our bedroom. He says i am the asshole for not being quiet when he\u2019s on calls while I think he is the asshole for not setting his office up in the dang basement. Please resolve our fight for us.  Thank you!\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is about the husband setting up his office in the bedroom instead of the basement, causing disruptions for the author. The author has to manage the kids, chores, and her own work from home, but can't do anything when he's in the bedroom on calls.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze both sides. The husband chose the bedroom because of the view, and he's not in the basement where he wouldn't be disturbed. The author offered the basement as a better option for him. She's taking on most of the household responsibilities and her own work, but his setup in the bedroom makes it hard for her to do anything. She told him she can't guarantee quiet in the bedroom, so he's in the wrong for not moving. But the husband might argue that he has a right to work comfortably and that she's supposed to support him.\n\nFrom a fairness perspective, the husband should consider the family's needs. The basement is available and would minimize disruptions. By choosing the bedroom, he's making it harder for her to manage the home and her own work. The author is trying to balance everything, and the husband's choice is causing unnecessary conflict. The key point is that he has the space to work elsewhere but refuses. So the author isn't in the wrong for not promising to be quiet when he's in the bedroom; she's being realistic. The husband is the one not compromising here. Therefore, the answer should be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
