He decided to set up his office in our bedroom.  I suggested he set up in the basement where he would be guaranteed silence and very little disruption.  He prefers to work from our bedroom because the view is better.  His job is 90% conference calls so while he is up there, I have to keep kids from disturbing him which basically means the whole top floor of our house is off limits while he is on calls.  It also means I can\u2019t shower in my bathroom, do chores, put away laundry, or even take a nap when the baby is sleeping.  I also work from home but also take on most of the house chores and dealing with kids.  Him being up there negates my ability to take a damn shower or a poop in peace when I want to.   Since we have adequate space in the basement I told him that we would never bother him while he is down there ever but I can\u2019t promise him silence if he stays in our bedroom. He says i am the asshole for not being quiet when he\u2019s on calls while I think he is the asshole for not setting his office up in the dang basement. Please resolve our fight for us.  Thank you!\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is about a husband setting up his office in the bedroom, which causes disruptions for the wife who also works from home and handles the kids and chores.\n\nFirst, the husband chose to work from the bedroom despite being offered the basement, which is quieter. The wife is frustrated because she can't use the top floor, take a shower, do chores, etc., when he's on calls. She told him she can't guarantee silence if he stays in the bedroom, and he's upset she's not quiet enough.\n\nThe user thinks the author (the wife) is in the wrong, but wants to know if that's the case. I need to consider who is at fault here. The husband had an alternative (basement) but didn't take it. The wife is trying to balance work, kids, and chores, and the current setup is making it impossible for her to function. \n\nThe husband's choice to be in the bedroom leads to the disruptions. The wife is being honest about her limitations. If he had chosen the basement, the problem wouldn't exist. The wife isn't at fault for setting boundaries, especially when he made the decision that affects her. So, probably the answer is B (the author is not in the wrong). The husband is the one who didn't consider the consequences of his choice.\n"
