He decided to set up his office in our bedroom.  I suggested he set up in the basement where he would be guaranteed silence and very little disruption.  He prefers to work from our bedroom because the view is better.  His job is 90% conference calls so while he is up there, I have to keep kids from disturbing him which basically means the whole top floor of our house is off limits while he is on calls.  It also means I can\u2019t shower in my bathroom, do chores, put away laundry, or even take a nap when the baby is sleeping.  I also work from home but also take on most of the house chores and dealing with kids.  Him being up there negates my ability to take a damn shower or a poop in peace when I want to.   Since we have adequate space in the basement I told him that we would never bother him while he is down there ever but I can\u2019t promise him silence if he stays in our bedroom. He says i am the asshole for not being quiet when he\u2019s on calls while I think he is the asshole for not setting his office up in the dang basement. Please resolve our fight for us.  Thank you!\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the author (the person who wrote the post) is in the wrong. The situation is that the husband set up his home office in the bedroom instead of the basement, which has better soundproofing. The wife is struggling because she can't do daily tasks or take care of the kids without disturbing him. She argues he should have chosen the basement for less disruption.\n\nSo, the author (the wife) is saying that she can't keep him undisturbed in the bedroom, hence the title. She's trying to make him move the office to the basement for practical reasons. The husband, on the other hand, prefers the bedroom for the view. The main conflict is about workspace setup affecting household dynamics.\n\nThe user initially thinks the author is in the wrong. I need to consider both sides. The husband's choice to work in the bedroom might not be inconsiderate, but it's causing significant inconvenience for the wife. She works from home too and handles most chores and kids. If he set it up in the basement, which she offered, maybe the problem would be resolved. But he chose the bedroom for the view, which is a personal preference but at the expense of her ability to function.\n\nIs the wife in the wrong for not keeping him undisturbed? Well, she's not trying to be disruptive, but the setup makes it hard for her. Maybe the issue is more about the husband not considering the practicality, but the wife isn't wrong for pointing that out. The question is whether she's in the wrong for not keeping him undisturbed. If she's expected to adjust her life to his preferences, maybe she's not in the wrong. Alternatively, if he's in the bedroom, it's reasonable to expect some noise from household activities, but since his job relies on conference calls, silence is necessary. The compromise was offered (moving to the basement), which he refused. So maybe the husband is the one being unreasonable, and the wife is justified in her stance. Therefore, the author (wife) isn't in the wrong. So answer B.\n"
