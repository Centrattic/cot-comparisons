He decided to set up his office in our bedroom.  I suggested he set up in the basement where he would be guaranteed silence and very little disruption.  He prefers to work from our bedroom because the view is better.  His job is 90% conference calls so while he is up there, I have to keep kids from disturbing him which basically means the whole top floor of our house is off limits while he is on calls.  It also means I can\u2019t shower in my bathroom, do chores, put away laundry, or even take a nap when the baby is sleeping.  I also work from home but also take on most of the house chores and dealing with kids.  Him being up there negates my ability to take a damn shower or a poop in peace when I want to.   Since we have adequate space in the basement I told him that we would never bother him while he is down there ever but I can\u2019t promise him silence if he stays in our bedroom. He says i am the asshole for not being quiet when he\u2019s on calls while I think he is the asshole for not setting his office up in the dang basement. Please resolve our fight for us.  Thank you!\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the story is in the wrong. The situation is that the husband set up his office in the bedroom, even though the wife suggested the basement for better silence. Now, the wife can't use the bathroom or do chores when he's on calls because she has to keep the kids from disturbing him. She works from home too and handles most of the housework and kids.\n\nSo, the main points here: the husband chose the bedroom despite the wife's advice, leading to her being unable to do her tasks. The question is whether she's in the wrong for not keeping him undisturbed. \n\nI need to assess both sides. The husband's choice to work in the bedroom might be affecting the wife's ability to work and manage the household. The wife is trying to balance her work, chores, and kids, which is a lot. The husband's refusal to move to the basement is causing conflict. \n\nThe wife's argument is that she can't guarantee silence in the bedroom, which is why she told him to go to the basement. The husband says she's the asshole for not being quiet, but she's the one managing the kids and household. \n\nSo, is the wife in the wrong? If the husband chose the bedroom despite knowing the consequences, maybe he's at fault for not compromising. The wife is just trying to do her responsibilities. The fact that the basement is available and would solve the problem suggests that the husband's choice is the root issue. Therefore, the author (wife) is not in the wrong. Answer B.\n"
