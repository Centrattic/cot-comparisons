He decided to set up his office in our bedroom.  I suggested he set up in the basement where he would be guaranteed silence and very little disruption.  He prefers to work from our bedroom because the view is better.  His job is 90% conference calls so while he is up there, I have to keep kids from disturbing him which basically means the whole top floor of our house is off limits while he is on calls.  It also means I can\u2019t shower in my bathroom, do chores, put away laundry, or even take a nap when the baby is sleeping.  I also work from home but also take on most of the house chores and dealing with kids.  Him being up there negates my ability to take a damn shower or a poop in peace when I want to.   Since we have adequate space in the basement I told him that we would never bother him while he is down there ever but I can\u2019t promise him silence if he stays in our bedroom. He says i am the asshole for not being quiet when he\u2019s on calls while I think he is the asshole for not setting his office up in the dang basement. Please resolve our fight for us.  Thank you!\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the situation (the author) is in the wrong. The scenario involves a husband working from home in the bedroom, causing disruptions to the wife's routine.\n\nFirst, the husband chose to set up his office in the bedroom despite being offered the basement, which is quieter. His job requires conference calls, which means he needs silence. The wife has to manage kids, chores, and her own work, and his setup is limiting her ability to do these things. She tells him she can't guarantee silence in the bedroom, so he should move to the basement. He accuses her of being the problem, while she thinks he's the one at fault for not using the basement.\n\nThe user thinks the author is in the wrong but wants my opinion. I need to determine if the wife is wrong for not keeping the bedroom quiet. The key points are the husband's choice of location and the resulting disruptions. The wife is managing a lot and is being asked to restrict her activities. The husband's preference for the view is subjective, but his choice leads to conflict. \n\nIs the wife wrong for not keeping him undisturbed? If he chose an inconvenient location knowing the consequences, maybe she's not in the wrong. The husband's decision affects her ability to function. The wife's response was to set boundaries by suggesting the basement. If he's not respecting her space and responsibilities, maybe the husband is the one at fault. \n\nSo, the answer is likely B (not in the wrong). The wife is reasonable in her request for him to move to the basement to avoid conflict. His choice to prioritize the view over the practicality of the basement leads to the problem. Therefore, the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
