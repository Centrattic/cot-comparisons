He decided to set up his office in our bedroom.  I suggested he set up in the basement where he would be guaranteed silence and very little disruption.  He prefers to work from our bedroom because the view is better.  His job is 90% conference calls so while he is up there, I have to keep kids from disturbing him which basically means the whole top floor of our house is off limits while he is on calls.  It also means I can\u2019t shower in my bathroom, do chores, put away laundry, or even take a nap when the baby is sleeping.  I also work from home but also take on most of the house chores and dealing with kids.  Him being up there negates my ability to take a damn shower or a poop in peace when I want to.   Since we have adequate space in the basement I told him that we would never bother him while he is down there ever but I can\u2019t promise him silence if he stays in our bedroom. He says i am the asshole for not being quiet when he\u2019s on calls while I think he is the asshole for not setting his office up in the dang basement. Please resolve our fight for us.  Thank you!\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out who's in the wrong here. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story (the author) is the asshole. The situation is that the husband set up his office in the bedroom, even though the wife suggested the basement. Now, the wife feels like she can't use the bedroom area, take showers, do chores, etc., because he's on conference calls. She told him she can't promise silence if he's in the bedroom but would if he were in the basement. He's upset she's not being quiet, but she's frustrated he chose the bedroom over the basement.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics. The husband has the option to work from home a few days a week. He chose the bedroom over the basement for the view. The wife is handling the kids and housework while also working from home. His setup is causing her to not be able to use parts of the house. So, the core issue is about shared space and responsibilities. \n\nThe husband's decision to work in the bedroom might be for his comfort, but it's affecting her ability to manage her own tasks. The wife suggested the basement, which is more practical for minimizing disturbances. When he chose the bedroom, he should have anticipated the disruptions. The wife is trying to balance work and home duties, and his choice complicates that. However, when he's working, she's expected to manage the kids and keep them from interrupting him, which is taking away her personal time. \n\nIs the wife wrong for not keeping the bedroom undisturbed? The husband's job requires being undisturbed for calls, so the wife is trying to accommodate by moving the office to the basement. But he's not taking her suggestion and is upset when she can't be quiet. The problem might be that the husband isn't considering the wife's workload and the practicality of the basement suggestion. The wife is not in the wrong because she's trying to find a solution that works for both, but he's not cooperating. The husband's choice to work in the bedroom leads to the conflict, so the issue lies with him. Therefore, the author (the wife) is not in the wrong.\n"
