He decided to set up his office in our bedroom.  I suggested he set up in the basement where he would be guaranteed silence and very little disruption.  He prefers to work from our bedroom because the view is better.  His job is 90% conference calls so while he is up there, I have to keep kids from disturbing him which basically means the whole top floor of our house is off limits while he is on calls.  It also means I can\u2019t shower in my bathroom, do chores, put away laundry, or even take a nap when the baby is sleeping.  I also work from home but also take on most of the house chores and dealing with kids.  Him being up there negates my ability to take a damn shower or a poop in peace when I want to.   Since we have adequate space in the basement I told him that we would never bother him while he is down there ever but I can\u2019t promise him silence if he stays in our bedroom. He says i am the asshole for not being quiet when he\u2019s on calls while I think he is the asshole for not setting his office up in the dang basement. Please resolve our fight for us.  Thank you!\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the \"AITA\" post is in the wrong. The situation is about a husband working from home in the bedroom, causing the wife to have to manage everything else while he's there.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the key points. The husband set up his office in the bedroom instead of the basement, despite the wife suggesting the basement for less disruption. His job is mostly conference calls, so she has to prevent kids and herself from disturbing him. This limits her ability to do chores, shower, nap, etc. She works from home too and handles most housework and kids. She told him she can't guarantee silence in the bedroom, so he should go to the basement. He says she's the asshole for not being quiet, but she thinks he's wrong for not moving to the basement.\n\nNow, determining if the author (the wife) is in the wrong. The question is whether she's at fault. The husband chose the bedroom despite being told the basement is better. The wife is managing a lot and has valid reasons for needing the space. She set boundaries, and the husband is upset about that. \n\nTypically, in such scenarios, if someone is given a reasonable alternative (like the basement) but chooses a location that causes disruption, they might be at fault. The wife is trying to balance work and home duties, so her needing the bedroom space makes sense. The husband's refusal to move might be the issue here. So the answer would be B (the author is not in the wrong). The husband is the one causing the conflict by not moving, and the wife is protecting her own needs and responsibilities.\n"
