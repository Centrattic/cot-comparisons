He decided to set up his office in our bedroom.  I suggested he set up in the basement where he would be guaranteed silence and very little disruption.  He prefers to work from our bedroom because the view is better.  His job is 90% conference calls so while he is up there, I have to keep kids from disturbing him which basically means the whole top floor of our house is off limits while he is on calls.  It also means I can\u2019t shower in my bathroom, do chores, put away laundry, or even take a nap when the baby is sleeping.  I also work from home but also take on most of the house chores and dealing with kids.  Him being up there negates my ability to take a damn shower or a poop in peace when I want to.   Since we have adequate space in the basement I told him that we would never bother him while he is down there ever but I can\u2019t promise him silence if he stays in our bedroom. He says i am the asshole for not being quiet when he\u2019s on calls while I think he is the asshole for not setting his office up in the dang basement. Please resolve our fight for us.  Thank you!\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the situation is in the wrong. The scenario involves a husband and wife who both work from home and have kids. The husband set up his office in the bedroom instead of the basement, which the wife suggested. Now, the wife can't use the upstairs bathroom, do chores, or take a nap when he's on calls because she has to keep the kids from disturbing him. She told him she can't guarantee silence if he's in the bedroom, but he's upset that she isn't quiet when he's working. The user thinks the author (the wife) is in the wrong but wants my opinion.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze both sides. The husband chose the bedroom despite the wife's suggestion of the basement. His job is 90% conference calls, so maybe he wants to be in a place he finds comfortable. But the wife also works from home and handles most of the housework and kids. By setting up in the bedroom, he's creating a situation where the wife can't use the top floor, which is part of their home. The wife's argument is that she can't guarantee quiet if he's in the bedroom, which is a fair point. It seems like the husband had the option to go to the basement for guaranteed quiet but chose not to. The wife is now stuck having to manage everything else, which is a lot.\n\nThe husband's perspective might be that he's entitled to work in a comfortable space, but the wife's needs are also valid. The key here is that the husband had a choice. The wife offered an alternative (basement) that would minimize disruption for both. By choosing the bedroom, he's creating a conflict. The wife is not wrong for pointing out that his choice affects her ability to work and manage the household. The husband's refusal to move to the basement seems like the root of the conflict. So, in this case, the author (wife) isn't in the wrong. She's advocating for her needs when the husband made a choice that impacts her. Therefore, the answer should be B (the author is not in the wrong).\n"
