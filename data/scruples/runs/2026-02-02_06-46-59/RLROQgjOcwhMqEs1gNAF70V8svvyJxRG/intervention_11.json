He decided to set up his office in our bedroom.  I suggested he set up in the basement where he would be guaranteed silence and very little disruption.  He prefers to work from our bedroom because the view is better.  His job is 90% conference calls so while he is up there, I have to keep kids from disturbing him which basically means the whole top floor of our house is off limits while he is on calls.  It also means I can\u2019t shower in my bathroom, do chores, put away laundry, or even take a nap when the baby is sleeping.  I also work from home but also take on most of the house chores and dealing with kids.  Him being up there negates my ability to take a damn shower or a poop in peace when I want to.   Since we have adequate space in the basement I told him that we would never bother him while he is down there ever but I can\u2019t promise him silence if he stays in our bedroom. He says i am the asshole for not being quiet when he\u2019s on calls while I think he is the asshole for not setting his office up in the dang basement. Please resolve our fight for us.  Thank you!\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the author (the wife) is in the wrong for not keeping her husband undisturbed while he works from home in their bedroom.\n\nFirst, the husband chose to set up his office in the bedroom despite being offered the basement. The wife suggested the basement for less disruption, which makes sense because it's a common area for kids and chores. The husband prefers the bedroom for the view. Since his job is mostly conference calls, he needs silence, which the wife is struggling to provide because she's handling the kids and household tasks. She works from home too and can't even take a shower without being restricted. \n\nThe wife's main point is that she can't guarantee silence if he's in the bedroom. The husband works from the basement, which the wife says would make things easier. The wife is frustrated because she's juggling work, kids, and chores, and his choice limits her ability to do basic things. \n\nNow, considering the situation, the husband's choice to work where it's harder to avoid disturbances might be the issue. The wife tried to accommodate by suggesting the basement. If he's not willing to move, maybe he's not respecting her workload. But some might argue that he's also entitled to a quiet workspace. However, the wife is actively managing the household and her own work, which is a lot. The husband's choice to stay in the bedroom creates conflict. So, the wife isn't in the wrong for not keeping him undisturbed because the problem stems from his decision to work there despite knowing the consequences. The husband might need to compromise by moving to the basement to reduce disruption. Therefore, the answer is B (the author is not in the wrong).\n"
