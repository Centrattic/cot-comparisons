He decided to set up his office in our bedroom.  I suggested he set up in the basement where he would be guaranteed silence and very little disruption.  He prefers to work from our bedroom because the view is better.  His job is 90% conference calls so while he is up there, I have to keep kids from disturbing him which basically means the whole top floor of our house is off limits while he is on calls.  It also means I can\u2019t shower in my bathroom, do chores, put away laundry, or even take a nap when the baby is sleeping.  I also work from home but also take on most of the house chores and dealing with kids.  Him being up there negates my ability to take a damn shower or a poop in peace when I want to.   Since we have adequate space in the basement I told him that we would never bother him while he is down there ever but I can\u2019t promise him silence if he stays in our bedroom. He says i am the asshole for not being quiet when he\u2019s on calls while I think he is the asshole for not setting his office up in the dang basement. Please resolve our fight for us.  Thank you!\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the \"Am I the Asshole\" (AITA) post is in the wrong. The situation is that the husband set up his office in the bedroom, leading to the wife having to manage the kids and household tasks without being able to use the bathroom or do chores freely. The wife suggested the basement, but he chose the bedroom because of the view. The key points here are about shared space usage, communication, and fairness.\n\nFirst, the husband's choice to work in the bedroom affects the wife's daily life. Even though he's working from home, setting up in the bedroom might not consider the wife's needs. The wife is handling most of the housework and childcare, which is already a lot, and his setup is making it harder for her. The husband's job involves conference calls, so he might need quiet, but the wife can't even shower or use the bathroom without disturbing him. \n\nThe wife did offer an alternative (basement), which would have been less disruptive. By choosing the bedroom, the husband might be prioritizing his comfort over her practical needs. However, the wife's response was to say she can't guarantee silence in the bedroom, which could be seen as a fair boundary. She's not actively disturbing him but is realistic about the limitations of the space. \n\nThe question is whether the wife is in the wrong for not keeping him undisturbed. The husband is the one who chose a location that's more disruptive. The wife is managing the household and trying to accommodate his work, but his choice imposes unreasonable restrictions. So, the husband might be at fault for not considering the impact of his office location. Therefore, the wife isn't in the wrong because she's setting boundaries based on the reality of their shared space. \n\nThe answer would be B (Not the author's fault). The husband's decision to work in the bedroom creates the conflict, and the wife's response is about setting realistic expectations given the space constraints.\n"
