He decided to set up his office in our bedroom.  I suggested he set up in the basement where he would be guaranteed silence and very little disruption.  He prefers to work from our bedroom because the view is better.  His job is 90% conference calls so while he is up there, I have to keep kids from disturbing him which basically means the whole top floor of our house is off limits while he is on calls.  It also means I can\u2019t shower in my bathroom, do chores, put away laundry, or even take a nap when the baby is sleeping.  I also work from home but also take on most of the house chores and dealing with kids.  Him being up there negates my ability to take a damn shower or a poop in peace when I want to.   Since we have adequate space in the basement I told him that we would never bother him while he is down there ever but I can\u2019t promise him silence if he stays in our bedroom. He says i am the asshole for not being quiet when he\u2019s on calls while I think he is the asshole for not setting his office up in the dang basement. Please resolve our fight for us.  Thank you!\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that the husband set up his office in the bedroom even though the wife suggested the basement. The main issue is that when he's on conference calls, the wife can't do her chores, take a shower, or even nap because she has to keep the kids from disturbing him. She's also handling most of the housework and the kids, so this setup is really impacting her.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The husband chose to work in the bedroom despite the wife's suggestion of the basement. His reason is the better view, which seems a bit selfish because the basement is more practical. On the other hand, the wife is trying to do her job and manage the household. If the office is in the bedroom, it limits her ability to use that space freely. \n\nThe husband is expecting her to keep the kids quiet and restrict her own activities, which might be a lot to ask. The wife is standing her ground by saying she can't guarantee silence if he's in the bedroom, which makes sense because she can't control the kids or her own needs. The husband's choice to work in the bedroom is causing her significant inconvenience. \n\nIn a shared living space, especially when both partners work from home, compromise is key. The husband's decision to prioritize his view over the practicality and the wife's needs seems to be a problem. The wife is not in the wrong for not keeping him undisturbed when he's in a space that's not ideal for work (the bedroom with kids). She's trying to balance work and household responsibilities, which he's not considering by choosing the bedroom as his office. \n\nSo, considering all that, the answer would be B (the author is not in the wrong) because the husband's choice to work in the bedroom is causing unnecessary disruption, and the wife is justified in pushing back for a more balanced setup.\n"
