He decided to set up his office in our bedroom.  I suggested he set up in the basement where he would be guaranteed silence and very little disruption.  He prefers to work from our bedroom because the view is better.  His job is 90% conference calls so while he is up there, I have to keep kids from disturbing him which basically means the whole top floor of our house is off limits while he is on calls.  It also means I can\u2019t shower in my bathroom, do chores, put away laundry, or even take a nap when the baby is sleeping.  I also work from home but also take on most of the house chores and dealing with kids.  Him being up there negates my ability to take a damn shower or a poop in peace when I want to.   Since we have adequate space in the basement I told him that we would never bother him while he is down there ever but I can\u2019t promise him silence if he stays in our bedroom. He says i am the asshole for not being quiet when he\u2019s on calls while I think he is the asshole for not setting his office up in the dang basement. Please resolve our fight for us.  Thank you!\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of the \"AITA\" post is in the wrong. The situation is about their husband setting up his home office in their bedroom, leading to conflicts where the author can't use the room without disturbing him. The author suggested the basement as an alternative, but the husband prefers the bedroom for the view. The husband is on a lot of calls, so the whole top floor becomes off-limits, affecting the author's ability to take care of chores and personal needs. The author is trying to balance work and household duties, while the husband is choosing comfort over practicality.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze the responsibilities here. The husband chose the bedroom for his office despite the wife's suggestion. The wife is then expected to manage the kids and household without using the top floor. But she's working from home too and handling most of the housework. The husband's choice is causing her limitations in her daily activities.\n\nThe key points are: Did the wife have an obligation to keep the bedroom undisturbed? By moving the office to the bedroom, the husband is occupying a space that's traditionally shared between the couple. The wife's suggestion to use the basement seems reasonable for minimizing disruption. However, the husband chose a shared space, knowing it would cause issues. The wife can't reasonably be expected to avoid using the bedroom entirely if it's necessary for her tasks and personal needs. So, the husband's choice is problematic because he's using a shared area, leading to her being restricted. Therefore, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong. She's trying to balance her responsibilities while the husband is choosing a setup that impacts her negatively. The answer should be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
