He decided to set up his office in our bedroom.  I suggested he set up in the basement where he would be guaranteed silence and very little disruption.  He prefers to work from our bedroom because the view is better.  His job is 90% conference calls so while he is up there, I have to keep kids from disturbing him which basically means the whole top floor of our house is off limits while he is on calls.  It also means I can\u2019t shower in my bathroom, do chores, put away laundry, or even take a nap when the baby is sleeping.  I also work from home but also take on most of the house chores and dealing with kids.  Him being up there negates my ability to take a damn shower or a poop in peace when I want to.   Since we have adequate space in the basement I told him that we would never bother him while he is down there ever but I can\u2019t promise him silence if he stays in our bedroom. He says i am the asshole for not being quiet when he\u2019s on calls while I think he is the asshole for not setting his office up in the dang basement. Please resolve our fight for us.  Thank you!\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) scenario is in the wrong. The situation is about a husband setting up his office in the bedroom, causing disruptions for the wife. The husband works from home a few days a week and chose the bedroom over the basement despite the wife's suggestion. The wife feels she can't do chores, take a nap, or even shower without disturbing him because of the conference calls.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The husband's perspective is that he prefers the bedroom for the view and is working, so he expects quiet. The wife's side is that she's handling most of the household duties and childcare, and his setup is limiting her ability to function. The wife suggested the basement, which is quieter, but he didn't take the suggestion. \n\nThe key points here are about mutual respect and consideration for each other's workspaces and needs. The husband is working, which is important, but the wife is also working from home and handling the household. The fact that there's adequate space in the basement suggests a viable solution exists. By choosing the bedroom, he's creating a situation where the wife can't use the space freely. The wife then tells him she can't guarantee silence, which leads to tension. \n\nThe question is whether the author (the wife) is in the wrong for not keeping him undisturbed while he works. The user thinks the author is in the wrong, but I need to evaluate if that's accurate. The wife tried to accommodate by suggesting the basement, but he declined. Now, she's trying to set boundaries by not making promises she can't keep. If he chose the bedroom, he should accept that it's a shared space and might have interruptions. However, the wife is also trying to work and manage the house, so her needs are valid. \n\nIn a shared living space, both parties need to make compromises. The husband had the option to take the quieter basement but didn't. The wife's response is about setting realistic expectations. If the husband wanted a distraction-free environment, the basement would be better. The wife isn't at fault for not enforcing silence if he chose a space that's not ideal for his work needs. Therefore, the husband might be the one in the wrong for not taking the recommended setup, leading to the conflict. So the answer would be B (the author is not in the wrong).\n"
