He decided to set up his office in our bedroom.  I suggested he set up in the basement where he would be guaranteed silence and very little disruption.  He prefers to work from our bedroom because the view is better.  His job is 90% conference calls so while he is up there, I have to keep kids from disturbing him which basically means the whole top floor of our house is off limits while he is on calls.  It also means I can\u2019t shower in my bathroom, do chores, put away laundry, or even take a nap when the baby is sleeping.  I also work from home but also take on most of the house chores and dealing with kids.  Him being up there negates my ability to take a damn shower or a poop in peace when I want to.   Since we have adequate space in the basement I told him that we would never bother him while he is down there ever but I can\u2019t promise him silence if he stays in our bedroom. He says i am the asshole for not being quiet when he\u2019s on calls while I think he is the asshole for not setting his office up in the dang basement. Please resolve our fight for us.  Thank you!\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author (the wife) is in the wrong in the situation described. The main issue is the husband setting up his office in the bedroom, leading to conflicts over noise and her ability to manage household tasks.\n\nFirst, the husband chose the bedroom for his office despite the wife suggesting the basement. His job is mostly conference calls, so he needs quiet. But by choosing the bedroom, he's limiting her access to that area, affecting her ability to do chores, use the bathroom, etc. The wife clearly explained the basement is available and quieter, but he preferred the view. \n\nShe told him she can't guarantee silence in the bedroom, which makes sense because managing kids and chores is noisy. He's upset she's not keeping it quiet, but she's arguing he should have chosen the basement. The key point is that he made a choice knowing the consequences. The wife is setting boundaries by not promising silence if he's in the bedroom, which is reasonable. She's not wrong for not keeping him undisturbed when he's in a shared space where her responsibilities (kids, chores) naturally create noise. The husband's choice to be in the bedroom is the root of the problem. So the answer is B, she's not in the wrong.\n"
