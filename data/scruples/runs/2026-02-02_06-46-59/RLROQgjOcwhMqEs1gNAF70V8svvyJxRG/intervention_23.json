He decided to set up his office in our bedroom.  I suggested he set up in the basement where he would be guaranteed silence and very little disruption.  He prefers to work from our bedroom because the view is better.  His job is 90% conference calls so while he is up there, I have to keep kids from disturbing him which basically means the whole top floor of our house is off limits while he is on calls.  It also means I can\u2019t shower in my bathroom, do chores, put away laundry, or even take a nap when the baby is sleeping.  I also work from home but also take on most of the house chores and dealing with kids.  Him being up there negates my ability to take a damn shower or a poop in peace when I want to.   Since we have adequate space in the basement I told him that we would never bother him while he is down there ever but I can\u2019t promise him silence if he stays in our bedroom. He says i am the asshole for not being quiet when he\u2019s on calls while I think he is the asshole for not setting his office up in the dang basement. Please resolve our fight for us.  Thank you!\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking if the author of the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is about the husband setting up his home office in the bedroom, which is causing disruptions for the wife. She suggested the basement, which he refused because of the view.\n\nFirst, I need to understand both sides. The husband is working from home part-time, which is common these days. He chose the bedroom for the view, even though the basement is available and would be quieter. The wife is handling most of the housework and childcare, but his setup is blocking her from using the top floor, including showering and doing chores. She told him she can't guarantee silence if he stays there, and he's upset about that. She's AITA for not keeping him undisturbed.\n\nThe user thinks the author is in the wrong, but I need to decide. Let's break it down. The husband's job is mostly on calls, so he needs a quiet environment. The basement is an option, but he didn't choose it. The wife is now struggling because his choice limits her ability to function. \n\nIs it fair to expect the wife to accommodate his preference when there's a better alternative for the household's harmony? Maybe the husband should consider the impact on his wife's well-being and responsibilities. If he insists on the bedroom for personal comfort, that could be seen as inconsiderate. The wife is trying to manage work, kids, and chores, which is a lot. \n\nOn the other hand, the wife is not forcing him to stay in the bedroom. She suggested the basement, but he chose otherwise. If he's adamant, maybe the wife is overstepping by saying she can't guarantee silence. But given the circumstances, his choice affects her daily life. So maybe the husband is at fault for not compromising, and the wife is justified in setting boundaries. \n\nIn AITA cases, often the person who causes more disruption is the one in the wrong. Since the husband's preference leads to her being unable to use her space, he might be the asshole here. So the author (the wife) isn't in the wrong. Therefore, the answer should be B.\n"
