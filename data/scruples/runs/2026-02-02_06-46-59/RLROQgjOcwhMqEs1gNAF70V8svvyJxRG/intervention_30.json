He decided to set up his office in our bedroom.  I suggested he set up in the basement where he would be guaranteed silence and very little disruption.  He prefers to work from our bedroom because the view is better.  His job is 90% conference calls so while he is up there, I have to keep kids from disturbing him which basically means the whole top floor of our house is off limits while he is on calls.  It also means I can\u2019t shower in my bathroom, do chores, put away laundry, or even take a nap when the baby is sleeping.  I also work from home but also take on most of the house chores and dealing with kids.  Him being up there negates my ability to take a damn shower or a poop in peace when I want to.   Since we have adequate space in the basement I told him that we would never bother him while he is down there ever but I can\u2019t promise him silence if he stays in our bedroom. He says i am the asshole for not being quiet when he\u2019s on calls while I think he is the asshole for not setting his office up in the dang basement. Please resolve our fight for us.  Thank you!\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see here. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the \"AITA\" (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong. The situation involves the husband setting up his home office in the bedroom instead of the basement, leading to conflicts with the wife's ability to manage household tasks and take care of the kids.\n\nFirst, the husband chose to work from the bedroom despite the wife suggesting the basement for fewer disturbances. His reasoning is the better view, but the wife ends up having to manage the kids and household chores without being able to use the top floor. She can't even take a shower or nap when the baby is sleeping. The husband's presence in the bedroom disrupts her routine significantly, especially since she's also working from home and handling most of the domestic responsibilities.\n\nThe key points here are about shared living space and mutual consideration. The husband's decision affects the wife's ability to function effectively. While he might prefer the bedroom's view, it's reasonable to expect that in a shared home, both partners should accommodate each other's needs. The basement is available and would minimize disturbances, so the husband's refusal to use it might be seen as self-centered. The wife's frustration is valid because she's managing both work and household duties, and the husband's setup is causing unnecessary hindrance.\n\nHowever, the wife did offer a compromise by suggesting the basement. The husband's choice isn't without reason (the view), but the impact on the wife's daily life is substantial. The wife isn't being entirely unreasonable by not guaranteeing silence if he's in the bedroom, as it's their shared space. The husband's job requires minimal interaction, but he's choosing a location that causes maximum disruption. \n\nIn terms of fairness, the husband's decision seems to prioritize his own comfort over the wife's ability to manage their shared responsibilities. The wife has a valid point in pushing for the basement to reduce conflicts. So, in this scenario, the husband might be the one in the wrong for not considering the practical implications of his choice. Therefore, the original poster (the wife) isn't in the wrong for not keeping him undisturbed when he's in the bedroom, as it's a shared space and his choice to be there leads to unavoidable disruptions. The answer should be B (the author is not in the wrong).\n"
