He decided to set up his office in our bedroom.  I suggested he set up in the basement where he would be guaranteed silence and very little disruption.  He prefers to work from our bedroom because the view is better.  His job is 90% conference calls so while he is up there, I have to keep kids from disturbing him which basically means the whole top floor of our house is off limits while he is on calls.  It also means I can\u2019t shower in my bathroom, do chores, put away laundry, or even take a nap when the baby is sleeping.  I also work from home but also take on most of the house chores and dealing with kids.  Him being up there negates my ability to take a damn shower or a poop in peace when I want to.   Since we have adequate space in the basement I told him that we would never bother him while he is down there ever but I can\u2019t promise him silence if he stays in our bedroom. He says i am the asshole for not being quiet when he\u2019s on calls while I think he is the asshole for not setting his office up in the dang basement. Please resolve our fight for us.  Thank you!\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking whether the author of the Reddit-style post is in the wrong. The situation is that the husband set up his office in the bedroom, leading to the wife feeling restricted in her own home. The husband works mostly on conference calls, so the wife has to manage the kids and household tasks without disturbing him. She suggested moving the office to the basement for less disruption, but he chose the bedroom because of the view. Now, she's saying he's the asshole if he doesn't move, but the husband thinks she's the asshole for not keeping quiet.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze the key points. The husband's choice to work from the bedroom, despite having a better option in the basement, seems to be the main issue here. The wife is handling most of the household chores and childcare, which are time-sensitive and require using the same spaces he's working in. By choosing the bedroom, he's creating a situation where the wife's ability to manage her responsibilities is hindered. \n\nThe wife's argument is that she can't guarantee silence if he's in the bedroom, which is a valid concern because children are unpredictable. The husband, on the other hand, is upset that she's not keeping them quiet, but he initially ignored the better location. The basement, as mentioned, offers a quieter environment, which would prevent these conflicts. \n\nSo, the husband made a decision that affects the wife's daily life significantly. The wife tried to find a compromise (basement) but he didn't take it. Now, she's standing her ground, which is reasonable because she's trying to maintain her own work and home responsibilities. \n\nI think the husband is the one in the wrong here because he chose a less practical location for his office, despite a better alternative being available. The wife is just trying to manage her own tasks and family needs. The answer should be B (author not in the wrong).\n"
