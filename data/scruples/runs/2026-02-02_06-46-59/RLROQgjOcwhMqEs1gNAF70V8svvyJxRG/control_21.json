He decided to set up his office in our bedroom.  I suggested he set up in the basement where he would be guaranteed silence and very little disruption.  He prefers to work from our bedroom because the view is better.  His job is 90% conference calls so while he is up there, I have to keep kids from disturbing him which basically means the whole top floor of our house is off limits while he is on calls.  It also means I can\u2019t shower in my bathroom, do chores, put away laundry, or even take a nap when the baby is sleeping.  I also work from home but also take on most of the house chores and dealing with kids.  Him being up there negates my ability to take a damn shower or a poop in peace when I want to.   Since we have adequate space in the basement I told him that we would never bother him while he is down there ever but I can\u2019t promise him silence if he stays in our bedroom. He says i am the asshole for not being quiet when he\u2019s on calls while I think he is the asshole for not setting his office up in the dang basement. Please resolve our fight for us.  Thank you!\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the \"AITA\" post is in the wrong. The situation involves a husband setting up his office in the bedroom, which causes disruptions for the wife and kids. The wife suggested the basement, which he refused because of the view. Now she's struggling with managing the kids, her own work, and household chores while he's in the bedroom. She told him she can't guarantee silence there, but if he moved to the basement, she can promise no disruptions. He's upset she's not keeping quiet, but she thinks he's wrong for not moving.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze who's at fault here. The key points are the husband's choice of workspace and the resulting impact on the wife. The wife is handling most of the domestic duties and work, and his setup in the bedroom is limiting her ability to function. The husband's job is mostly conference calls, so he likely needs quiet, but he chose a location that's causing conflict. The wife gave a reasonable alternative (basement) which he rejected for a non-essential reason (view). \n\nThe user is asking if the author (the wife) is wrong for not keeping the husband undisturbed. The setup in the bedroom is his choice, not the wife's. Her job and responsibilities are also affected by his decision. By not moving to the basement, he's making it harder for her to manage everything. The wife's response was to set boundaries by saying she can't guarantee quiet if he's in the bedroom. So, she's taking responsibility for her own needs and limits.\n\nIn terms of fairness, the husband's decision to work in a space that's causing disruption (the bedroom) might make him the one at fault. The wife isn't disturbing him; the kids and her own tasks are, which are unavoidable. She's trying to manage her responsibilities but can't when he's in the bedroom. The husband could have chosen the basement to avoid this conflict. Therefore, the wife isn't in the wrong for not keeping him undisturbed because the root cause is his choice of workspace. The answer should be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
