He decided to set up his office in our bedroom.  I suggested he set up in the basement where he would be guaranteed silence and very little disruption.  He prefers to work from our bedroom because the view is better.  His job is 90% conference calls so while he is up there, I have to keep kids from disturbing him which basically means the whole top floor of our house is off limits while he is on calls.  It also means I can\u2019t shower in my bathroom, do chores, put away laundry, or even take a nap when the baby is sleeping.  I also work from home but also take on most of the house chores and dealing with kids.  Him being up there negates my ability to take a damn shower or a poop in peace when I want to.   Since we have adequate space in the basement I told him that we would never bother him while he is down there ever but I can\u2019t promise him silence if he stays in our bedroom. He says i am the asshole for not being quiet when he\u2019s on calls while I think he is the asshole for not setting his office up in the dang basement. Please resolve our fight for us.  Thank you!\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this. The user is asking if the author (the wife) is in the wrong regarding her husband working from the bedroom. The husband set up his office there despite the wife suggesting the basement. His job is mostly conference calls, so she has to keep the kids quiet, limiting her own activities. She works from home too and does most chores and childcare. The husband is upset she's not keeping it quiet, but she argues he should have chosen the basement.\n\nFirst, the husband chose the bedroom despite the basement being available. The wife's suggestion was practical for minimizing disruptions. By choosing the bedroom, he's creating a situation where she has less space and flexibility. The fact that he's on calls a lot means constant noise and the need for silence, which affects her ability to work and manage the household. She's taking on more responsibilities, which seems unfair. \n\nThe wife is setting boundaries by saying she can't guarantee silence in the bedroom but would for the basement. The husband is upset she's not keeping it quiet, but he's the one who didn't follow her suggestion. It seems like he's expecting her to accommodate his choice without considering her own needs. The fact that she works from home and handles most chores adds to the imbalance. The husband's preference for the view shouldn't override her practical needs. So the author isn't in the wrong; the husband is the one who made a choice that's causing conflict without considering her situation.\n"
