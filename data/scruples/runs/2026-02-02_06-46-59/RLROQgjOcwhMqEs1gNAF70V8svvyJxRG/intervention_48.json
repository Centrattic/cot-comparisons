He decided to set up his office in our bedroom.  I suggested he set up in the basement where he would be guaranteed silence and very little disruption.  He prefers to work from our bedroom because the view is better.  His job is 90% conference calls so while he is up there, I have to keep kids from disturbing him which basically means the whole top floor of our house is off limits while he is on calls.  It also means I can\u2019t shower in my bathroom, do chores, put away laundry, or even take a nap when the baby is sleeping.  I also work from home but also take on most of the house chores and dealing with kids.  Him being up there negates my ability to take a damn shower or a poop in peace when I want to.   Since we have adequate space in the basement I told him that we would never bother him while he is down there ever but I can\u2019t promise him silence if he stays in our bedroom. He says i am the asshole for not being quiet when he\u2019s on calls while I think he is the asshole for not setting his office up in the dang basement. Please resolve our fight for us.  Thank you!\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the post is in the wrong. The situation is about a husband setting up his office in the bedroom, causing disruptions for the wife.\n\nFirst, the husband works from home a few days a week. The wife suggested the basement, which is quieter, but he chose the bedroom for the better view. His job is mostly conference calls, so the wife has to keep the kids from disturbing him. This makes the entire top floor off-limits, affecting her ability to do chores, take a shower, or nap. She works from home too and handles most household tasks and kids. She told him she can't guarantee silence if he's in the bedroom but would be quiet if he was in the basement. He's upset she's not quiet, she's upset he didn't take the basement.\n\nThe user thinks the author (the wife) is in the wrong but wants my opinion. I need to decide A (yes, she's wrong) or B (no, she's not).\n\nHmm. The key points here are about compromise and fairness. The husband chose a less convenient location (bedroom) over the basement despite the wife's suggestion. The wife is now dealing with the consequences of his choice. If the basement is available and offers a better work environment for her, but he refuses, maybe he's being stubborn. The wife is trying to balance her work and household duties, which are already a burden. By not moving to the basement, he's making her life harder. So, maybe the husband is the one being unreasonable. Therefore, the wife isn't in the wrong because she's standing her ground about not being able to guarantee silence when he's in a shared space. The husband should have considered the impact on her. So the answer would be B (author not in the wrong).\n"
