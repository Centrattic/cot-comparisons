He decided to set up his office in our bedroom.  I suggested he set up in the basement where he would be guaranteed silence and very little disruption.  He prefers to work from our bedroom because the view is better.  His job is 90% conference calls so while he is up there, I have to keep kids from disturbing him which basically means the whole top floor of our house is off limits while he is on calls.  It also means I can\u2019t shower in my bathroom, do chores, put away laundry, or even take a nap when the baby is sleeping.  I also work from home but also take on most of the house chores and dealing with kids.  Him being up there negates my ability to take a damn shower or a poop in peace when I want to.   Since we have adequate space in the basement I told him that we would never bother him while he is down there ever but I can\u2019t promise him silence if he stays in our bedroom. He says i am the asshole for not being quiet when he\u2019s on calls while I think he is the asshole for not setting his office up in the dang basement. Please resolve our fight for us.  Thank you!\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote this is in the wrong. The situation is about a husband working from home in the bedroom, causing disruptions for the wife and kids. The wife suggested the basement, which is quieter, but he chose the bedroom because of the view. Now the wife can't do chores, shower, nap, etc., when he's on calls. She feels he's in the wrong for not taking the basement, while he blames her for not being quiet.\n\nHmm. So the question is whether the author (the wife) is at fault. The options are A or B. Let me break it down. The husband's job is 90% conference calls, so he needs a quiet space. The wife is managing the house and kids, which also require quiet times. The problem is that they both need quiet but in the same area. The wife offered an alternative in the basement, which has better conditions for quiet. The husband rejected it for a better view. Now the wife is struggling with her responsibilities and personal time because his choice affects her ability to function.\n\nFrom a fairness perspective, the husband's work setup is impacting the household's daily life. The basement option was available and would have minimized disruptions. By choosing the bedroom, he's making her responsible for ensuring silence, which is not feasible given the kids and her own chores. The wife working from home as well adds to the pressure. It seems like the husband is prioritizing his comfort over the household's needs. Therefore, the wife isn't in the wrong for not keeping him undisturbed when he's in a space that inherently causes conflict. The husband should have chosen the basement to avoid the problem. So the answer would be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
