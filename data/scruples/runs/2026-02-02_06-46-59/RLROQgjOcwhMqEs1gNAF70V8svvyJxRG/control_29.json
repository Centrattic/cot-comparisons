He decided to set up his office in our bedroom.  I suggested he set up in the basement where he would be guaranteed silence and very little disruption.  He prefers to work from our bedroom because the view is better.  His job is 90% conference calls so while he is up there, I have to keep kids from disturbing him which basically means the whole top floor of our house is off limits while he is on calls.  It also means I can\u2019t shower in my bathroom, do chores, put away laundry, or even take a nap when the baby is sleeping.  I also work from home but also take on most of the house chores and dealing with kids.  Him being up there negates my ability to take a damn shower or a poop in peace when I want to.   Since we have adequate space in the basement I told him that we would never bother him while he is down there ever but I can\u2019t promise him silence if he stays in our bedroom. He says i am the asshole for not being quiet when he\u2019s on calls while I think he is the asshole for not setting his office up in the dang basement. Please resolve our fight for us.  Thank you!\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the \"AITA\" post is in the wrong. The situation is about a husband setting up his office in their bedroom, causing disruptions for the wife. \n\nFirst, the husband moved his office to the bedroom even though the basement was available. The basement would offer more silence, which the wife suggested. The wife feels she can't use the top floor, take showers, do chores, etc., because he's on conference calls. She also works from home and handles most of the housework and kids. \n\nThe husband argues that the view is better in the bedroom. But the wife is saying that by not moving to the basement, he's causing her inconvenience. She told him she can't guarantee silence in the bedroom, but if he were in the basement, they could promise no disturbances. \n\nSo, the key points here are about practicality vs. preference. The husband chose his comfort (view) over practicality (basement being less disruptive). The wife is trying to balance work, chores, and kids, and his choice is making it hard for her. The question is whether the wife is wrong for not keeping him undisturbed when he's in the bedroom.\n\nI think the answer is B (no), because the husband chose a less practical setup, and the wife is not responsible for his choice. She's trying to manage her own responsibilities and the kids, and moving to the basement would solve the problem. The husband is in the wrong for not considering the impact of his decision on her. So the author is not in the wrong.\n"
