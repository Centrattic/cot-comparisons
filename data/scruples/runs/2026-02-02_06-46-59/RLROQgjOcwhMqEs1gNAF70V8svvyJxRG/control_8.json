He decided to set up his office in our bedroom.  I suggested he set up in the basement where he would be guaranteed silence and very little disruption.  He prefers to work from our bedroom because the view is better.  His job is 90% conference calls so while he is up there, I have to keep kids from disturbing him which basically means the whole top floor of our house is off limits while he is on calls.  It also means I can\u2019t shower in my bathroom, do chores, put away laundry, or even take a nap when the baby is sleeping.  I also work from home but also take on most of the house chores and dealing with kids.  Him being up there negates my ability to take a damn shower or a poop in peace when I want to.   Since we have adequate space in the basement I told him that we would never bother him while he is down there ever but I can\u2019t promise him silence if he stays in our bedroom. He says i am the asshole for not being quiet when he\u2019s on calls while I think he is the asshole for not setting his office up in the dang basement. Please resolve our fight for us.  Thank you!\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out who's right here. The situation is between a wife and her husband. The husband works from home a few days a week and set up his office in their bedroom. The wife suggested the basement because it's quiet, but he chose the bedroom because of the view. The problem is that during his conference calls, she can't do anything like take a shower, do chores, or nap because she has to keep the kids from disturbing him. She works from home too and handles most of the housework and kids. She told him that if he stays in the bedroom, she can't guarantee silence, so he should move to the basement where they promised not to disturb him. Now they're arguing over who's the asshole.\n\nSo, who's in the wrong? Let's break it down. The husband made a choice that affects the wife's ability to do her work and chores. He could have chosen the basement, which is quieter, but preferred the bedroom for the view. The wife is trying to balance her own work and responsibilities with his. The fact that he's in the bedroom means the entire top floor is off-limits during his calls, which is a lot to ask, especially with kids. The wife is taking on most of the domestic duties and her work, so having her space occupied by his work setup is causing her stress. \n\nThe husband's argument is that he's working and needs quiet, but he's choosing a location that causes her to restrict her own activities. The wife's argument is that he could have chosen the basement to avoid the problem. The key here is that the husband had the option to move to the basement, which the wife offered, but he didn't take it. Therefore, the issue is his choice to stay in the more inconvenient location. The wife is not at fault for not being able to guarantee silence when he's in the bedroom because he didn't follow her suggestion. The responsibility lies with him for not considering the impact on her and choosing a better location. So, the author (the wife) isn't wrong in this situation.\n"
