He decided to set up his office in our bedroom.  I suggested he set up in the basement where he would be guaranteed silence and very little disruption.  He prefers to work from our bedroom because the view is better.  His job is 90% conference calls so while he is up there, I have to keep kids from disturbing him which basically means the whole top floor of our house is off limits while he is on calls.  It also means I can\u2019t shower in my bathroom, do chores, put away laundry, or even take a nap when the baby is sleeping.  I also work from home but also take on most of the house chores and dealing with kids.  Him being up there negates my ability to take a damn shower or a poop in peace when I want to.   Since we have adequate space in the basement I told him that we would never bother him while he is down there ever but I can\u2019t promise him silence if he stays in our bedroom. He says i am the asshole for not being quiet when he\u2019s on calls while I think he is the asshole for not setting his office up in the dang basement. Please resolve our fight for us.  Thank you!\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, so I need to figure out whether the author of this situation is in the wrong. Let me read through the details again to make sure I understand everything properly.\n\nThe user is a person whose husband has started working from home a few days a week. He set up his office in their bedroom instead of the basement, which the user suggested. The husband prefers the bedroom because of the view. His job is 90% conference calls, so the user has to keep the kids from disturbing him, which makes the top floor off-limits during those calls. This restriction affects the user's ability to do chores, shower, take naps, or even use the bathroom in peace. The user also works from home and handles most of the housework and childcare. They told the husband that if he stays in the bedroom, they can't guarantee silence, but if he went to the basement, they wouldn't bother him. Now they're arguing about who is the asshole.\n\nHmm. The question is whether the author (the user) is in the wrong. The user is saying that the husband is the asshole for not moving his office to the basement, while the husband thinks the user is the asshole for not being quiet. So the user is asking if they're in the wrong.\n\nFirst, let's break down the key points. The husband chose to work in the bedroom despite the user's suggestion of the basement. The basement would have been quieter and less disruptive. The user is handling both work and childcare, which is a lot, and the husband's setup is causing her to have limited personal time and space. The user is essentially saying that they can't promise silence if he's in the bedroom, but if he moves to the basement, they won't disturb him. The husband is refusing to move, leading to this conflict.\n\nFrom the user's perspective, they're trying to manage the household and their own work, but the husband's choice is making it impossible. The husband, on the other hand, values the view and is upset about not being left alone during calls. The user is arguing that the husband should have moved to the basement to avoid disruption, which would have been a more considerate choice.\n\nIn terms of right and wrong, the user is trying to balance their responsibilities and personal needs. The husband's choice is causing significant disruption to the user's daily routine. The user's suggestion of the basement was a reasonable alternative that would minimize conflict. The husband's refusal to consider that, despite the user's input, might make him the one being inconsiderate. The user isn't obligated to guarantee silence in the bedroom, especially since it's a shared space. The husband's work setup is encroaching on the user's personal space and responsibilities, which is a valid point.\n\nI think the user isn't in the wrong here. The husband made a choice that affects the household's dynamics, and the user is setting boundaries based on that. The user is handling a lot, and the husband's setup is hindering their ability to manage their own work and household duties. The user's request for the husband to move to the basement is reasonable to maintain a balanced living situation. Therefore, the answer should be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
