During this time he began to talk to a girl that he's known for most of his life. We got back together, and I expected him to break off all contact with her. Which I thought was understandable.\n\n2 weeks in and he still has her on all social media including snapchat. We fought and fought over it and he eventually deleted her. Or so I thought.\n\nLast October, we had been growing rather distant and I took it upon myself to snoop through his phone.\n\nAnd there she is. She had blocked me on social media so that I couldn't see them following each other. He had literally liked every single one of her pictures, not any of mine during the same time period to be clear, and she liked his as well. Including a picture of his Snapchat code asking people to add him.\n\nI confront him. He becomes angry and defensive but swears hell get rid of her.\n\nAbout a month later I decide to check again. And she's still there. So I told him I was leaving him.\n\nHe left for about 3 days. And we eventually talked things through and he again swore to delete her and block her for good.\n\n3 weeks ago, I saw that he had liked pictures of the girl's sister on Instagram. He says he had remembered liking them from a long time ago and had been trying to unlike them so I would never find them and in doing so accidentally re liked the pictures, and I believed him.\n\nLast night. He has both the girl AND her sister unblocked AGAIN on social media. Meaning he went out of his way to go through his settings, get to privacy, open his list of blocked users and unblocked those two in particular.\n\nWIBTA for ending a 7 year relationship with the father of my son because he can't seem to let go of some other girl? Even though the only thing I really have evidence of is them staying in contact, not actually cheating?\n\nI'm at a complete loss.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author of the scenario is in the wrong for leaving their fianc\u00e9 after seven years because he kept staying in contact with another girl. The author has a child with their fianc\u00e9, so there's a lot at stake here.\n\nFirst, the main issue seems to be the fianc\u00e9's ongoing contact with a girl he's known for most of his life. The author wanted him to cut off all contact when they first got back together, which he did temporarily but then resumed. The author found out through snooping, which I need to consider. Snooping is generally not advised because it can erode trust, but given the situation, maybe the author felt betrayed enough to justify it.\n\nThe fianc\u00e9's actions include liking multiple pictures of this girl on social media, even after being asked to stop. The fact that he had the girl and her sister unblocked recently is a big red flag. The author confronted him each time, and he promised to delete her but didn't follow through. This pattern of betrayal and broken promises is significant. Even if there's no physical cheating, emotional infidelity can be just as damaging.\n\nThe author had a child with the fianc\u00e9, which adds another layer. The stability of the relationship affects their child. If the fianc\u00e9 can't respect the author's boundaries, it's hard to see how they could maintain a healthy marriage or co-parenting relationship. The author's decision to leave might be based on protecting their own emotional well-being and their child's future.\n\nOn the other hand, the fianc\u00e9 claims he didn't mean to like the pictures, but the author believed him. However, the repeated unblocking suggests intentional actions. The fianc\u00e9's inability to commit to cutting ties, despite promises, shows a lack of respect for the author's feelings and the relationship's boundaries.\n\nThe user initially thought the author was in the wrong, but based on the repeated breaches of trust and the fianc\u00e9's refusal to change his behavior despite being asked multiple times, it seems the author had legitimate reasons to end the relationship. Emotional cheating can be as hurtful as physical cheating, and the author's choice to prioritize their own mental health and their child's stability is understandable.\n"
