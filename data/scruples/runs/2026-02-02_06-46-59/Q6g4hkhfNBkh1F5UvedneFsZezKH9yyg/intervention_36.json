During this time he began to talk to a girl that he's known for most of his life. We got back together, and I expected him to break off all contact with her. Which I thought was understandable.\n\n2 weeks in and he still has her on all social media including snapchat. We fought and fought over it and he eventually deleted her. Or so I thought.\n\nLast October, we had been growing rather distant and I took it upon myself to snoop through his phone.\n\nAnd there she is. She had blocked me on social media so that I couldn't see them following each other. He had literally liked every single one of her pictures, not any of mine during the same time period to be clear, and she liked his as well. Including a picture of his Snapchat code asking people to add him.\n\nI confront him. He becomes angry and defensive but swears hell get rid of her.\n\nAbout a month later I decide to check again. And she's still there. So I told him I was leaving him.\n\nHe left for about 3 days. And we eventually talked things through and he again swore to delete her and block her for good.\n\n3 weeks ago, I saw that he had liked pictures of the girl's sister on Instagram. He says he had remembered liking them from a long time ago and had been trying to unlike them so I would never find them and in doing so accidentally re liked the pictures, and I believed him.\n\nLast night. He has both the girl AND her sister unblocked AGAIN on social media. Meaning he went out of his way to go through his settings, get to privacy, open his list of blocked users and unblocked those two in particular.\n\nWIBTA for ending a 7 year relationship with the father of my son because he can't seem to let go of some other girl? Even though the only thing I really have evidence of is them staying in contact, not actually cheating?\n\nI'm at a complete loss.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author (the person who wrote the \"WIBTA\" post) is in the wrong for ending a 7-year engagement. The situation involves the fianc\u00e9 having contact with another girl he's known for a long time. Let's look at the key points.\n\nFirst, they were in a committed relationship with a child. The fianc\u00e9 broke up with the author once before, then reconciled. The author expected him to cut off contact with this girl. He deleted her once but then she came back, and the author found out through snooping. The fianc\u00e9 liked her photos on social media, and the author confronted him. He swore to delete her again but she was still there. Then, the author found him liking the girl's sister's posts and later discovered he unblocked both the girl and her sister again.\n\nThe author is left with evidence of ongoing contact, not necessarily cheating, but a pattern of not following through on promises. The question is whether the author is wrong to end the engagement.\n\nFrom the author's perspective, trust is broken multiple times. The fianc\u00e9's actions show a lack of commitment to the relationship, which is a dealbreaker, especially in a long-term relationship with a child involved. The author's decision might be based on the emotional toll of repeated betrayals and inability to move forward. \n\nOn the other hand, the fianc\u00e9 might argue that he's not cheating, just maintaining contact with an old friend. But the author feels insecure and that the contact is inappropriate. The fianc\u00e9's inability to cut off contact despite promises could indicate he's not respecting the author's boundaries.\n\nIn relationships, trust is fundamental. If one partner can't respect the other's boundaries, that's a major issue. The author might have felt that they couldn't continue without that trust. Since there's no actual cheating, some might argue the author is overreacting. But the pattern of behavior shows a lack of commitment to the relationship's exclusivity, which is a valid reason to end it.\n\nI think the author is justified in ending the relationship. The fianc\u00e9's actions, while not cheating, show a pattern of disrespecting the author's feelings and boundaries. The repeated breaking of promises to cut off contact is a significant issue in a committed relationship. So the answer would be B (author not in the wrong).\n"
