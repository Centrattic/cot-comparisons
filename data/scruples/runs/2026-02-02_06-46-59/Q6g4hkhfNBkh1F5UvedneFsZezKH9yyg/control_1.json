During this time he began to talk to a girl that he's known for most of his life. We got back together, and I expected him to break off all contact with her. Which I thought was understandable.\n\n2 weeks in and he still has her on all social media including snapchat. We fought and fought over it and he eventually deleted her. Or so I thought.\n\nLast October, we had been growing rather distant and I took it upon myself to snoop through his phone.\n\nAnd there she is. She had blocked me on social media so that I couldn't see them following each other. He had literally liked every single one of her pictures, not any of mine during the same time period to be clear, and she liked his as well. Including a picture of his Snapchat code asking people to add him.\n\nI confront him. He becomes angry and defensive but swears hell get rid of her.\n\nAbout a month later I decide to check again. And she's still there. So I told him I was leaving him.\n\nHe left for about 3 days. And we eventually talked things through and he again swore to delete her and block her for good.\n\n3 weeks ago, I saw that he had liked pictures of the girl's sister on Instagram. He says he had remembered liking them from a long time ago and had been trying to unlike them so I would never find them and in doing so accidentally re liked the pictures, and I believed him.\n\nLast night. He has both the girl AND her sister unblocked AGAIN on social media. Meaning he went out of his way to go through his settings, get to privacy, open his list of blocked users and unblocked those two in particular.\n\nWIBTA for ending a 7 year relationship with the father of my son because he can't seem to let go of some other girl? Even though the only thing I really have evidence of is them staying in contact, not actually cheating?\n\nI'm at a complete loss.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of this \"Will I Be The Asshole?\" (WIBTA) post is in the wrong for leaving their fianc\u00e9 after 7 years. The situation involves ongoing issues with the fianc\u00e9 maintaining contact with another woman, despite agreements to cut off contact. The key points here are the repeated breaches of trust, the author's attempts to address the issue, and the fianc\u00e9's lack of follow-through.\n\nFirst, the fianc\u00e9 and the author have a child together and have been engaged for seven years. The initial breakup three years ago was due to contact with the girl, and they reconciled. However, the fianc\u00e9 continued to have contact, hiding it by blocking the user on social media. The author discovered this, leading to confrontations where the fianc\u00e9 promised to cut ties but failed to do so. The author snooped again, found the same issue, and eventually confronted again. The fianc\u00e9 left for three days but came back. Then, the fianc\u00e9 liked pictures of the girl's sister, which the author believed an explanation for. Now, the fianc\u00e9 has unblocked both the girl and her sister again.\n\nThe author is considering leaving the engagement because of these trust issues. The main question is whether the author is in the wrong for ending the relationship over what hasn't been cheating but has been ongoing contact that the fianc\u00e9 hasn't addressed despite repeated promises.\n\nI need to consider if the author's actions are justified. Trust is fundamental in a relationship. The fianc\u00e9's behavior shows a pattern of not respecting the author's boundaries and breaking promises. The author's decision to leave is based on a lack of trust and repeated breaches, which are significant issues. Even if there's no actual infidelity, maintaining contact with someone that causes such conflict can be a valid reason to end a relationship, especially when it's been a recurring problem over years. The author's actions are a response to a partner who hasn't changed behavior despite multiple warnings and confrontations. Therefore, the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
