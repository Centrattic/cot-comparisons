During this time he began to talk to a girl that he's known for most of his life. We got back together, and I expected him to break off all contact with her. Which I thought was understandable.\n\n2 weeks in and he still has her on all social media including snapchat. We fought and fought over it and he eventually deleted her. Or so I thought.\n\nLast October, we had been growing rather distant and I took it upon myself to snoop through his phone.\n\nAnd there she is. She had blocked me on social media so that I couldn't see them following each other. He had literally liked every single one of her pictures, not any of mine during the same time period to be clear, and she liked his as well. Including a picture of his Snapchat code asking people to add him.\n\nI confront him. He becomes angry and defensive but swears hell get rid of her.\n\nAbout a month later I decide to check again. And she's still there. So I told him I was leaving him.\n\nHe left for about 3 days. And we eventually talked things through and he again swore to delete her and block her for good.\n\n3 weeks ago, I saw that he had liked pictures of the girl's sister on Instagram. He says he had remembered liking them from a long time ago and had been trying to unlike them so I would never find them and in doing so accidentally re liked the pictures, and I believed him.\n\nLast night. He has both the girl AND her sister unblocked AGAIN on social media. Meaning he went out of his way to go through his settings, get to privacy, open his list of blocked users and unblocked those two in particular.\n\nWIBTA for ending a 7 year relationship with the father of my son because he can't seem to let go of some other girl? Even though the only thing I really have evidence of is them staying in contact, not actually cheating?\n\nI'm at a complete loss.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the author of the situation is in the wrong for leaving their fianc\u00e9. The key points here are about betrayal, trust, and the actions taken by both parties.\n\nFirst, the couple has been together for seven years with a child. That's a significant amount of time, so trust and commitment are really important here. The fianc\u00e9 had a history of not cutting off contact with another girl, even after promises to do so. The author found evidence of ongoing contact, including liking each other's social media posts, which could be seen as a breach of trust.\n\nThe author snooped through the phone, which might be a point of contention. Some people might say that invading privacy isn't right, but in a long-term relationship where trust is broken, others might understand it as a necessary action. The fianc\u00e9's reaction was defensive and angry, which could indicate he felt blamed or was hiding something.\n\nThen, after multiple instances of the fianc\u00e9 not following through on deleting the contact, the author decided to leave. The fianc\u00e9 left for three days but came back, and there's still more incidents with even more unblocking. The final straw was both the girl and her sister being unblocked again.\n\nThe question is whether the author is wrong. The fianc\u00e9's actions\u2014repeatedly not honoring his promises to cut off contact, maintaining a close social media presence with someone else, and even unblocking them\u2014could be seen as emotionally unfaithful or as a lack of commitment to the relationship. The author has the right to feel betrayed, especially when trust is repeatedly broken.\n\nOn the other hand, the fianc\u00e9 might argue that there's no actual cheating, just contact. But in relationships, emotional boundaries are crucial, and the fianc\u00e9's actions may have crossed those lines. The author's decision to end the relationship is a personal choice, and if trust can't be rebuilt after multiple attempts, it's a valid decision.\n\nConsidering all that, the author isn't in the wrong. The fianc\u00e9's consistent actions undermined the relationship, leading to the author's justified decision to leave. So the answer should be B.\n"
