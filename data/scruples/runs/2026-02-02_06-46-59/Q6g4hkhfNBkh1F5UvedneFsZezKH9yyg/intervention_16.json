During this time he began to talk to a girl that he's known for most of his life. We got back together, and I expected him to break off all contact with her. Which I thought was understandable.\n\n2 weeks in and he still has her on all social media including snapchat. We fought and fought over it and he eventually deleted her. Or so I thought.\n\nLast October, we had been growing rather distant and I took it upon myself to snoop through his phone.\n\nAnd there she is. She had blocked me on social media so that I couldn't see them following each other. He had literally liked every single one of her pictures, not any of mine during the same time period to be clear, and she liked his as well. Including a picture of his Snapchat code asking people to add him.\n\nI confront him. He becomes angry and defensive but swears hell get rid of her.\n\nAbout a month later I decide to check again. And she's still there. So I told him I was leaving him.\n\nHe left for about 3 days. And we eventually talked things through and he again swore to delete her and block her for good.\n\n3 weeks ago, I saw that he had liked pictures of the girl's sister on Instagram. He says he had remembered liking them from a long time ago and had been trying to unlike them so I would never find them and in doing so accidentally re liked the pictures, and I believed him.\n\nLast night. He has both the girl AND her sister unblocked AGAIN on social media. Meaning he went out of his way to go through his settings, get to privacy, open his list of blocked users and unblocked those two in particular.\n\nWIBTA for ending a 7 year relationship with the father of my son because he can't seem to let go of some other girl? Even though the only thing I really have evidence of is them staying in contact, not actually cheating?\n\nI'm at a complete loss.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that the author is considering leaving their fianc\u00e9 after seven years because of ongoing contact with another girl. They have a son together, which adds another layer.\n\nFirst, the fianc\u00e9 broke up for a month three years ago, then got back together. The author expected him to cut off contact with this girl, which he did initially but then later resumed contact. The author found out through snooping, which might be a point of contention. The fianc\u00e9 was defensive when confronted, and even after multiple promises to delete the girl, he ended up re-adding her and her sister. The author is considering breaking up because of this, even though there's no proof of cheating, just ongoing contact.\n\nNow, the user thinks the author is in the wrong, but I need to evaluate that. Let me break it down. In a relationship, trust is crucial. If one partner is consistently not respecting the other's boundaries about contact with an ex or someone else, that's a problem. The fianc\u00e9 has known the girl most of his life, so maybe there's a history, but the author is concerned about the ongoing contact, especially when he's liked her pictures, kept her on social media, and even re-added her after promising not to. The author's actions of snooping might not be ideal, but if they have a legitimate reason to be concerned, it's understandable. The key issue here is the fianc\u00e9's inability to maintain the boundaries the author set. \n\nThe author is leaving because of the breach of trust, which is a significant issue in any relationship. Even without proof of cheating, the continued contact and broken promises can erode trust. The question is whether the author is justified in leaving. From a moral standpoint, if the fianc\u00e9 is not respecting the author's boundaries despite repeated warnings and confrontations, the author has every right to end the relationship. The author isn't leaving without cause; the problem is the fianc\u00e9's ongoing behavior, not the author's actions. \n\nSo, the answer would likely be that the author is not in the wrong (B). The fianc\u00e9's actions have been the main issue here, not the author's decision to leave after multiple incidents.\n"
