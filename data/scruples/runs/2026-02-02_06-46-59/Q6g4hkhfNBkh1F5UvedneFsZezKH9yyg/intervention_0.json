During this time he began to talk to a girl that he's known for most of his life. We got back together, and I expected him to break off all contact with her. Which I thought was understandable.\n\n2 weeks in and he still has her on all social media including snapchat. We fought and fought over it and he eventually deleted her. Or so I thought.\n\nLast October, we had been growing rather distant and I took it upon myself to snoop through his phone.\n\nAnd there she is. She had blocked me on social media so that I couldn't see them following each other. He had literally liked every single one of her pictures, not any of mine during the same time period to be clear, and she liked his as well. Including a picture of his Snapchat code asking people to add him.\n\nI confront him. He becomes angry and defensive but swears hell get rid of her.\n\nAbout a month later I decide to check again. And she's still there. So I told him I was leaving him.\n\nHe left for about 3 days. And we eventually talked things through and he again swore to delete her and block her for good.\n\n3 weeks ago, I saw that he had liked pictures of the girl's sister on Instagram. He says he had remembered liking them from a long time ago and had been trying to unlike them so I would never find them and in doing so accidentally re liked the pictures, and I believed him.\n\nLast night. He has both the girl AND her sister unblocked AGAIN on social media. Meaning he went out of his way to go through his settings, get to privacy, open his list of blocked users and unblocked those two in particular.\n\nWIBTA for ending a 7 year relationship with the father of my son because he can't seem to let go of some other girl? Even though the only thing I really have evidence of is them staying in contact, not actually cheating?\n\nI'm at a complete loss.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the \"Would I Be Terrible for...\" scenario is in the wrong. The author is considering leaving her fianc\u00e9 after 7 years because he can't stop contacting an old friend. Let's break this down.\n\nFirst, the key points: They've been in a long-term relationship with a child. There was a breakup a few years ago, and during that time, the fianc\u00e9 talked to a girl he's known all his life. When they reconciled, the author expected him to cut contact. He did delete her initially but later reconnected in various ways. The author snooped and found ongoing interactions, leading to confrontations and more issues. The fianc\u00e9 claims he's trying to unlike posts accidentally, but there's evidence he unblocked them again. The author is leaving because of this, even without proof of cheating.\n\nNow, the user thinks the author is in the wrong. But I need to evaluate both sides. The author feels betrayed and unable to trust the fianc\u00e9, which is valid. Emotional infidelity can be a deal-breaker even without physical cheating. The fianc\u00e9 might not have crossed the line into cheating, but the repeated actions of contacting someone else in a committed relationship can strain trust. The author's decision to leave is based on not being able to move past these actions, which is her right. \n\nBut is she wrong? Well, the fianc\u00e9 might argue he's innocent, but the author's feelings are real. In relationships, trust is crucial. If the fianc\u00e9 can't respect boundaries set by the partner, it's a major issue. The author has tried multiple times to address it, and he hasn't complied. So, her leaving isn't necessarily the wrong choice. She's prioritizing her well-being and the relationship's health. \n\nOn the other hand, some might say the evidence isn't concrete as in actual cheating, so maybe she's overreacting. But emotional fidelity is important. The fact that he went out of his way to unblock them suggests he values that connection more than his commitment. The author's decision to leave in this situation is understandable. \n\nSo, considering all that, the answer would be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
