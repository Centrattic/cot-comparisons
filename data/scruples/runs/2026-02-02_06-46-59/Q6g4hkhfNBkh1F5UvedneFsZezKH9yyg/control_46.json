During this time he began to talk to a girl that he's known for most of his life. We got back together, and I expected him to break off all contact with her. Which I thought was understandable.\n\n2 weeks in and he still has her on all social media including snapchat. We fought and fought over it and he eventually deleted her. Or so I thought.\n\nLast October, we had been growing rather distant and I took it upon myself to snoop through his phone.\n\nAnd there she is. She had blocked me on social media so that I couldn't see them following each other. He had literally liked every single one of her pictures, not any of mine during the same time period to be clear, and she liked his as well. Including a picture of his Snapchat code asking people to add him.\n\nI confront him. He becomes angry and defensive but swears hell get rid of her.\n\nAbout a month later I decide to check again. And she's still there. So I told him I was leaving him.\n\nHe left for about 3 days. And we eventually talked things through and he again swore to delete her and block her for good.\n\n3 weeks ago, I saw that he had liked pictures of the girl's sister on Instagram. He says he had remembered liking them from a long time ago and had been trying to unlike them so I would never find them and in doing so accidentally re liked the pictures, and I believed him.\n\nLast night. He has both the girl AND her sister unblocked AGAIN on social media. Meaning he went out of his way to go through his settings, get to privacy, open his list of blocked users and unblocked those two in particular.\n\nWIBTA for ending a 7 year relationship with the father of my son because he can't seem to let go of some other girl? Even though the only thing I really have evidence of is them staying in contact, not actually cheating?\n\nI'm at a complete loss.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote this WIBTA (Would I Be Terrible for) story is in the wrong. The situation is that they're leaving their fianc\u00e9 of 7 years after multiple instances where he kept in contact with an old friend, despite promises to cut off contact. The key points are: they have a child together, there was a breakup and reconciliation, the fianc\u00e9 kept liking the other girl's social media posts, and even after multiple promises to delete her, he kept her unblocked again.\n\nSo, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. The options are A (yes) or B (no). \n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The author is trying to protect the relationship by asking for boundaries\u2014specifically, cutting off contact with someone that's causing conflict. The fianc\u00e9 has a long-standing friendship with this girl, but the author feels threatened. The problem is that while there's no explicit cheating mentioned, there's ongoing emotional harm through the continued contact and the fianc\u00e9's inability to follow through on promises.\n\nIn relationships, trust is crucial. If one partner repeatedly breaks promises about cutting off contact, that can be a deal-breaker. The author has tried multiple times to resolve the issue, but each time the fianc\u00e9 relapses. The author's decision to leave might be seen as a last resort after exhausting other options.\n\nOn the other hand, some might argue that the fianc\u00e9 isn't physically cheating, just maintaining a friendship. But the context here is that the author has been violated by the continued contact despite promises, which can be emotionally abusive. The fact that the fianc\u00e9 went out of his way to unblock them suggests intent to maintain contact, which the author can't trust anymore.\n\nThe presence of a child complicates things, but the author is still the parent and has the right to make decisions about their relationship, even with a child involved. The main issue is the fianc\u00e9's inability to respect boundaries and the resulting erosion of trust. Since the author has tried multiple times and the issues persist, leaving might be a reasonable choice.\n\nSo, considering all that, the author is not in the wrong. The answer should be B.\n"
