During this time he began to talk to a girl that he's known for most of his life. We got back together, and I expected him to break off all contact with her. Which I thought was understandable.\n\n2 weeks in and he still has her on all social media including snapchat. We fought and fought over it and he eventually deleted her. Or so I thought.\n\nLast October, we had been growing rather distant and I took it upon myself to snoop through his phone.\n\nAnd there she is. She had blocked me on social media so that I couldn't see them following each other. He had literally liked every single one of her pictures, not any of mine during the same time period to be clear, and she liked his as well. Including a picture of his Snapchat code asking people to add him.\n\nI confront him. He becomes angry and defensive but swears hell get rid of her.\n\nAbout a month later I decide to check again. And she's still there. So I told him I was leaving him.\n\nHe left for about 3 days. And we eventually talked things through and he again swore to delete her and block her for good.\n\n3 weeks ago, I saw that he had liked pictures of the girl's sister on Instagram. He says he had remembered liking them from a long time ago and had been trying to unlike them so I would never find them and in doing so accidentally re liked the pictures, and I believed him.\n\nLast night. He has both the girl AND her sister unblocked AGAIN on social media. Meaning he went out of his way to go through his settings, get to privacy, open his list of blocked users and unblocked those two in particular.\n\nWIBTA for ending a 7 year relationship with the father of my son because he can't seem to let go of some other girl? Even though the only thing I really have evidence of is them staying in contact, not actually cheating?\n\nI'm at a complete loss.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the WIBTA (Would I Be Terrible for Aborting) question is in the wrong. The situation involves a 7-year engagement with a son, and the author is leaving because the fianc\u00e9 can't cut ties with a girl he's known for a long time.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the timeline. They broke up for a month three years ago, during which the fianc\u00e9 talked to this girl. After getting back together, the author expected him to cut contact. He deleted her initially, but later the author found he was still in contact through social media likes and other interactions. There were confrontations, promises to delete, but it kept happening again. The author snooped, found evidence, confronted, and eventually decided to leave after another incident.\n\nThe key points here are trust and boundaries in a relationship. The author felt that maintaining contact with this girl was a breach of trust. Even though there's no evidence of actual cheating, the fianc\u00e9's actions (continuing to like posts, not deleting as agreed) led to repeated breaches of trust. The author's decision to leave is based on broken promises and lack of respect for boundaries.\n\nIn relationships, trust is crucial. If one partner repeatedly violates the other's trust, even without physical infidelity, it can be grounds for ending the relationship. The author isn't just being petty; they're trying to protect their emotional well-being and the integrity of the relationship. The fianc\u00e9's inability to cut ties despite multiple promises shows a lack of commitment to the relationship's boundaries.\n\nHowever, some might argue that the author snooped, which is a breach of privacy. But given the context of prior issues and the fianc\u00e9's dishonesty, it's understandable as a protective measure. The author is prioritizing their own peace of mind and their son's future stability.\n\nSo, considering all this, the author isn't in the wrong. The answer should be B.\n"
