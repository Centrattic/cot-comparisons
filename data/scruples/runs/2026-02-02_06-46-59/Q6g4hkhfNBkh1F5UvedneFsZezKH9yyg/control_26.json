During this time he began to talk to a girl that he's known for most of his life. We got back together, and I expected him to break off all contact with her. Which I thought was understandable.\n\n2 weeks in and he still has her on all social media including snapchat. We fought and fought over it and he eventually deleted her. Or so I thought.\n\nLast October, we had been growing rather distant and I took it upon myself to snoop through his phone.\n\nAnd there she is. She had blocked me on social media so that I couldn't see them following each other. He had literally liked every single one of her pictures, not any of mine during the same time period to be clear, and she liked his as well. Including a picture of his Snapchat code asking people to add him.\n\nI confront him. He becomes angry and defensive but swears hell get rid of her.\n\nAbout a month later I decide to check again. And she's still there. So I told him I was leaving him.\n\nHe left for about 3 days. And we eventually talked things through and he again swore to delete her and block her for good.\n\n3 weeks ago, I saw that he had liked pictures of the girl's sister on Instagram. He says he had remembered liking them from a long time ago and had been trying to unlike them so I would never find them and in doing so accidentally re liked the pictures, and I believed him.\n\nLast night. He has both the girl AND her sister unblocked AGAIN on social media. Meaning he went out of his way to go through his settings, get to privacy, open his list of blocked users and unblocked those two in particular.\n\nWIBTA for ending a 7 year relationship with the father of my son because he can't seem to let go of some other girl? Even though the only thing I really have evidence of is them staying in contact, not actually cheating?\n\nI'm at a complete loss.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking if the author of the scenario is in the wrong for ending a 7-year relationship with her fianc\u00e9. The key points here are the repeated breaches of trust involving the fianc\u00e9 maintaining contact with a girl he's known for most of his life. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The couple has been together for seven years and has a child. There was a previous breakup where he talked to this girl, and even after reconciling, he kept her on social media. The author discovered he was liking her posts, which he later supposedly deleted but then reappeared. The fianc\u00e9 gave repeated assurances but failed to follow through, leading the author to leave.\n\nThe main issue is whether staying in contact with someone to the point of liking their posts, even without cheating, is a valid reason to end the relationship. The author has evidence of ongoing contact, which she finds unacceptable. The fianc\u00e9 claims it was an accident, but the pattern suggests intentional behavior.\n\nIn relationships, trust is crucial. If one partner repeatedly violates the other's trust, even without physical infidelity, it can be a deal-breaker. The author's decision to leave is based on the lack of trust and the fianc\u00e9's inability to respect her boundaries. The fact that he kept unblocking them after promising not to indicates a pattern of dishonesty. \n\nHowever, some might argue that without proof of actual cheating, leaving could be hasty. But given the context of multiple instances and the emotional impact, the author's feelings are valid. The well-being of the child is also a factor, but the question focuses on the author's wrongness, not the child's welfare.\n\nSo, considering the repeated breaches and the fianc\u00e9's failure to address the issue, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong for leaving. Her actions are a response to broken trust and lack of respect for her boundaries. Therefore, the answer is B.\n"
