During this time he began to talk to a girl that he's known for most of his life. We got back together, and I expected him to break off all contact with her. Which I thought was understandable.\n\n2 weeks in and he still has her on all social media including snapchat. We fought and fought over it and he eventually deleted her. Or so I thought.\n\nLast October, we had been growing rather distant and I took it upon myself to snoop through his phone.\n\nAnd there she is. She had blocked me on social media so that I couldn't see them following each other. He had literally liked every single one of her pictures, not any of mine during the same time period to be clear, and she liked his as well. Including a picture of his Snapchat code asking people to add him.\n\nI confront him. He becomes angry and defensive but swears hell get rid of her.\n\nAbout a month later I decide to check again. And she's still there. So I told him I was leaving him.\n\nHe left for about 3 days. And we eventually talked things through and he again swore to delete her and block her for good.\n\n3 weeks ago, I saw that he had liked pictures of the girl's sister on Instagram. He says he had remembered liking them from a long time ago and had been trying to unlike them so I would never find them and in doing so accidentally re liked the pictures, and I believed him.\n\nLast night. He has both the girl AND her sister unblocked AGAIN on social media. Meaning he went out of his way to go through his settings, get to privacy, open his list of blocked users and unblocked those two in particular.\n\nWIBTA for ending a 7 year relationship with the father of my son because he can't seem to let go of some other girl? Even though the only thing I really have evidence of is them staying in contact, not actually cheating?\n\nI'm at a complete loss.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the scenario is in the wrong for breaking up with their fianc\u00e9 after 7 years. The situation involves ongoing contact with an ex-girlfriend, even after the fianc\u00e9 promised to cut off communication. The author found evidence of likes on social media and eventually discovered they were unblocked again.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The relationship has been long-term, 7 years with a child. The fianc\u00e9 had a history of not cutting off the other girl, despite promises. The author had to snoop, which is a red flag, but maybe justified given the previous issues. The fianc\u00e9's actions\u2014liking her photos, not deleting her, and even unblocking her\u2014show a pattern of not respecting the author's boundaries. \n\nThe user initially thought the author might be in the wrong, but the question is whether the author is actually in the wrong. The main issue here is trust. The fianc\u00e9 repeatedly violated the author's trust by maintaining contact, which the author found unacceptable. Even if there's no actual cheating, the emotional betrayal of maintaining contact can be significant, especially in a long-term committed relationship. \n\nIn relationships, trust is crucial. If one partner consistently breaches the other's trust, it's reasonable for the hurt partner to seek resolution. The author tried to address the issue multiple times, and the fianc\u00e9 didn't follow through. The final straw was the unblocking, which shows a deliberate choice to reconnect. The author decided to leave to protect their own well-being and that of their son. \n\nOn the other hand, the author snooped through the phone, which isn't ideal. But given the context of previous breaches, maybe it's understandable. The fianc\u00e9's behavior was the root cause here. The author isn't necessarily in the wrong for ending the relationship when the trust can't be maintained. \n\nSo considering all that, the answer would be B (No, the author is not in the wrong). The author had legitimate reasons to end the relationship after repeated violations of trust and boundaries.\n"
