During this time he began to talk to a girl that he's known for most of his life. We got back together, and I expected him to break off all contact with her. Which I thought was understandable.\n\n2 weeks in and he still has her on all social media including snapchat. We fought and fought over it and he eventually deleted her. Or so I thought.\n\nLast October, we had been growing rather distant and I took it upon myself to snoop through his phone.\n\nAnd there she is. She had blocked me on social media so that I couldn't see them following each other. He had literally liked every single one of her pictures, not any of mine during the same time period to be clear, and she liked his as well. Including a picture of his Snapchat code asking people to add him.\n\nI confront him. He becomes angry and defensive but swears hell get rid of her.\n\nAbout a month later I decide to check again. And she's still there. So I told him I was leaving him.\n\nHe left for about 3 days. And we eventually talked things through and he again swore to delete her and block her for good.\n\n3 weeks ago, I saw that he had liked pictures of the girl's sister on Instagram. He says he had remembered liking them from a long time ago and had been trying to unlike them so I would never find them and in doing so accidentally re liked the pictures, and I believed him.\n\nLast night. He has both the girl AND her sister unblocked AGAIN on social media. Meaning he went out of his way to go through his settings, get to privacy, open his list of blocked users and unblocked those two in particular.\n\nWIBTA for ending a 7 year relationship with the father of my son because he can't seem to let go of some other girl? Even though the only thing I really have evidence of is them staying in contact, not actually cheating?\n\nI'm at a complete loss.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author of the scenario is in the wrong for ending a 7-year relationship with her fianc\u00e9 because he continues to have contact with an old friend, despite previous agreements to cut off contact. The user thinks the author is in the wrong but is seeking a second opinion.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points of the situation. The couple has a long-term relationship with a child, so the stakes are high. The fianc\u00e9 had contact with a girl he knew for a long time, which led to a breakup and reconciliation. After multiple instances where the author discovers ongoing contact, including liking the girl's photos, the fianc\u00e9 fails to follow through on promises to cut her off. The final straw is when the fianc\u00e9 unblocks both the girl and her sister, leading the author to leave.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author is wrong for ending the relationship. The main factors here are trust, communication, and the repeated breaches of agreed-upon boundaries. The fianc\u00e9's actions show a pattern of not respecting the author's boundaries, which is a significant issue in a relationship. The author has legitimate reasons to feel betrayed, especially since the fianc\u00e9 swore to delete the contact each time but kept failing. The fact that there's no evidence of cheating might make some think the author is overreacting, but emotional infidelity or repeated boundary violations can still be valid reasons to end a relationship, especially when it's causing ongoing stress and distrust.\n\nAnother angle is the author's decision to snoop. While it's not ideal, in the context of a long-term relationship where trust is compromised, it's a common reaction. However, this could be seen as a breach of privacy, but the user's perspective is that the fianc\u00e9's actions justified the snooping.\n\nThe author's decision to leave after multiple failed attempts to resolve the issue could be seen as a last resort. Relationships require mutual respect and effort, and if one partner consistently violates trust, it's reasonable for the other to end it. The presence of a child adds complexity, but the author's well-being is also important, and staying in a toxic environment might not be healthy for either partner or the child.\n\nOn the other hand, some might argue that the author is overreacting if there's no actual cheating, but the repeated unfaithfulness in communication and the fianc\u00e9's inability or unwillingness to respect boundaries can erode the relationship's foundation. The author is prioritizing her own emotional health and the stability of the relationship by leaving.\n\nIn conclusion, the author's actions are a response to ongoing breaches of trust and broken promises. While breaking up is a major decision, the circumstances suggest that the author is justified in her choice. Therefore, the answer would be B (the author is not in the wrong).\n"
