During this time he began to talk to a girl that he's known for most of his life. We got back together, and I expected him to break off all contact with her. Which I thought was understandable.\n\n2 weeks in and he still has her on all social media including snapchat. We fought and fought over it and he eventually deleted her. Or so I thought.\n\nLast October, we had been growing rather distant and I took it upon myself to snoop through his phone.\n\nAnd there she is. She had blocked me on social media so that I couldn't see them following each other. He had literally liked every single one of her pictures, not any of mine during the same time period to be clear, and she liked his as well. Including a picture of his Snapchat code asking people to add him.\n\nI confront him. He becomes angry and defensive but swears hell get rid of her.\n\nAbout a month later I decide to check again. And she's still there. So I told him I was leaving him.\n\nHe left for about 3 days. And we eventually talked things through and he again swore to delete her and block her for good.\n\n3 weeks ago, I saw that he had liked pictures of the girl's sister on Instagram. He says he had remembered liking them from a long time ago and had been trying to unlike them so I would never find them and in doing so accidentally re liked the pictures, and I believed him.\n\nLast night. He has both the girl AND her sister unblocked AGAIN on social media. Meaning he went out of his way to go through his settings, get to privacy, open his list of blocked users and unblocked those two in particular.\n\nWIBTA for ending a 7 year relationship with the father of my son because he can't seem to let go of some other girl? Even though the only thing I really have evidence of is them staying in contact, not actually cheating?\n\nI'm at a complete loss.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking whether the author of the WIBTA (Would I Be Terrible for...) post is in the wrong for ending a 7-year relationship with her fianc\u00e9. The main issue seems to be that the fianc\u00e9 has been maintaining contact with a girl he's known for a long time, even after the author has confronted him multiple times about it. The author found evidence of likes on social media posts, and eventually discovered that the girl and her sister were unblocked again. The key here is that there's no explicit cheating, just ongoing contact that the author perceives as a breach of trust.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The couple has a child together, which adds emotional complexity. The fianc\u00e9 broke up with the author for a month three years ago and started talking to this girl. After getting back together, the author expected him to cut contact, which he initially did but later failed to maintain. The author snooped through his phone, which might be a point of contention. However, the repeated pattern of breaking promises about cutting contact could be seen as a significant issue for the author.\n\nFrom the author's perspective, trust is a major factor. Even if there's no physical cheating, the ongoing communication and social media interactions might make the author feel disrespected and neglected. The fianc\u00e9's inability to sever ties, despite multiple confrontations and promises, could lead the author to believe that he's not fully committed to the relationship. In a long-term partnership, especially with a child involved, trust and boundaries are crucial. If the author feels that these are consistently breached, ending the relationship might be a reasonable decision.\n\nOn the other hand, the fianc\u00e9 might argue that he hasn't crossed into cheating but is maintaining a friendship. However, the author's evidence shows a pattern of behavior that she finds unacceptable. The fact that he unblocked them intentionally, as per the last incident, shows a willful disregard for her feelings. The author, in this case, might feel that she's made her expectations clear and given multiple chances for him to meet them, which he hasn't done.\n\nConsidering the emotional toll of a seven-year relationship with ongoing issues, the decision to leave could be seen as the author prioritizing her own well-being and the health of the relationship. It's possible that the relationship has been strained for years, and the final straw was the repeated breaches of trust. In such cases, ending the relationship might be a way to stop a cycle of hurt and disappointment.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong. She's making a tough choice based on her needs and the lack of progress on the issues that matter to her. The fianc\u00e9's actions have repeatedly caused her distress, and she might have concluded that staying in the relationship is detrimental to her mental health and the future of their child's upbringing. Therefore, the answer would be B (the author is not in the wrong).\n"
