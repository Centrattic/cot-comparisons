During this time he began to talk to a girl that he's known for most of his life. We got back together, and I expected him to break off all contact with her. Which I thought was understandable.\n\n2 weeks in and he still has her on all social media including snapchat. We fought and fought over it and he eventually deleted her. Or so I thought.\n\nLast October, we had been growing rather distant and I took it upon myself to snoop through his phone.\n\nAnd there she is. She had blocked me on social media so that I couldn't see them following each other. He had literally liked every single one of her pictures, not any of mine during the same time period to be clear, and she liked his as well. Including a picture of his Snapchat code asking people to add him.\n\nI confront him. He becomes angry and defensive but swears hell get rid of her.\n\nAbout a month later I decide to check again. And she's still there. So I told him I was leaving him.\n\nHe left for about 3 days. And we eventually talked things through and he again swore to delete her and block her for good.\n\n3 weeks ago, I saw that he had liked pictures of the girl's sister on Instagram. He says he had remembered liking them from a long time ago and had been trying to unlike them so I would never find them and in doing so accidentally re liked the pictures, and I believed him.\n\nLast night. He has both the girl AND her sister unblocked AGAIN on social media. Meaning he went out of his way to go through his settings, get to privacy, open his list of blocked users and unblocked those two in particular.\n\nWIBTA for ending a 7 year relationship with the father of my son because he can't seem to let go of some other girl? Even though the only thing I really have evidence of is them staying in contact, not actually cheating?\n\nI'm at a complete loss.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author of the WIBTA post is in the wrong for leaving their fianc\u00e9 after seven years. The key points here are the ongoing issues with the fianc\u00e9 not cutting contact with another girl, even after multiple promises to do so. The author found instances where the fianc\u00e9 liked pictures of this girl and her sister, leading to confrontations and more promises. The final straw was the fianc\u00e9 unblocking them again.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The relationship has been long-term, with a child together. Trust is a big factor here. The fianc\u00e9 has repeatedly not followed through on commitments to cut contact, which might indicate a lack of respect for the author's feelings or boundaries. The author's actions, like checking the phone, might be seen as invasive, but the fianc\u00e9's behavior could justify that if he was being deceptive.\n\nThe main question is whether the author is wrong for ending the relationship. The author has evidence of the fianc\u00e9 maintaining contact and not keeping promises, which could be a breach of trust. Even without actual cheating, the pattern of behavior might be considered a betrayal of the relationship's expectations. The author's decision to leave due to these ongoing issues could be seen as justified, especially considering the impact on their mental well-being and the stability of the relationship.\n\nOn the other hand, some might argue that the author didn't give enough time for change or that the fianc\u00e9 might have had innocent explanations. However, the repeated nature of the breaches and the fianc\u00e9's defensiveness when confronted suggest a pattern that's unlikely to change. In a committed relationship, both partners need to respect each other's boundaries. The author's decision to end things might be a necessary step for their own peace of mind and the health of the relationship.\n"
