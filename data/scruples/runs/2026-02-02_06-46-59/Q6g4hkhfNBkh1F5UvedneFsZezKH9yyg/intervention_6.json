During this time he began to talk to a girl that he's known for most of his life. We got back together, and I expected him to break off all contact with her. Which I thought was understandable.\n\n2 weeks in and he still has her on all social media including snapchat. We fought and fought over it and he eventually deleted her. Or so I thought.\n\nLast October, we had been growing rather distant and I took it upon myself to snoop through his phone.\n\nAnd there she is. She had blocked me on social media so that I couldn't see them following each other. He had literally liked every single one of her pictures, not any of mine during the same time period to be clear, and she liked his as well. Including a picture of his Snapchat code asking people to add him.\n\nI confront him. He becomes angry and defensive but swears hell get rid of her.\n\nAbout a month later I decide to check again. And she's still there. So I told him I was leaving him.\n\nHe left for about 3 days. And we eventually talked things through and he again swore to delete her and block her for good.\n\n3 weeks ago, I saw that he had liked pictures of the girl's sister on Instagram. He says he had remembered liking them from a long time ago and had been trying to unlike them so I would never find them and in doing so accidentally re liked the pictures, and I believed him.\n\nLast night. He has both the girl AND her sister unblocked AGAIN on social media. Meaning he went out of his way to go through his settings, get to privacy, open his list of blocked users and unblocked those two in particular.\n\nWIBTA for ending a 7 year relationship with the father of my son because he can't seem to let go of some other girl? Even though the only thing I really have evidence of is them staying in contact, not actually cheating?\n\nI'm at a complete loss.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of the WIBTA (Would I Be Terrible for...) post is in the wrong. The situation is a seven-year relationship with a fianc\u00e9 and a child. The main issue is the fianc\u00e9's ongoing contact with a girl he's known for most of his life. \n\nFirst, the author mentions that they broke up for a month three years ago. During that time, the fianc\u00e9 talked to this girl. After getting back together, the author expected him to cut contact, which he initially did, but then later there was more contact. The author snooped and found that the girl had blocked them so the author couldn't see their interactions. The fianc\u00e9 liked her pictures and vice versa, even sharing a Snapchat code. When confronted, he deleted her but later she remained. Then the author found likes on the girl's sister's photos. The fianc\u00e9 claimed it was an accident. Now, he's unblocked both the girl and her sister. The author ends the relationship because of this ongoing contact, even though there's no evidence of cheating.\n\nThe user thinks the author is in the wrong. But I need to evaluate both sides. The key points here are trust, boundaries in a relationship, and the repeated breaches of those boundaries despite promises. The author felt betrayed by the fianc\u00e9's consistent contact with another woman, even if there's no proof of infidelity. In a long-term relationship, especially with a child, trust is crucial. The fianc\u00e9 kept breaking the author's trust by not cutting off contact as agreed, leading to multiple confrontations and lies. The author's decision to leave could be seen as a way to protect her own emotional well-being and that of their child. \n\nOn the other hand, the fianc\u00e9 might argue that the contact isn't cheating, but the author's perception of betrayal is valid because of the emotional impact. The repeated breaches despite promises could justify the break-up. The author isn't wrong for feeling that the relationship can't continue without trust. So, the answer would likely be B (the author is not in the wrong).\n"
