During this time he began to talk to a girl that he's known for most of his life. We got back together, and I expected him to break off all contact with her. Which I thought was understandable.\n\n2 weeks in and he still has her on all social media including snapchat. We fought and fought over it and he eventually deleted her. Or so I thought.\n\nLast October, we had been growing rather distant and I took it upon myself to snoop through his phone.\n\nAnd there she is. She had blocked me on social media so that I couldn't see them following each other. He had literally liked every single one of her pictures, not any of mine during the same time period to be clear, and she liked his as well. Including a picture of his Snapchat code asking people to add him.\n\nI confront him. He becomes angry and defensive but swears hell get rid of her.\n\nAbout a month later I decide to check again. And she's still there. So I told him I was leaving him.\n\nHe left for about 3 days. And we eventually talked things through and he again swore to delete her and block her for good.\n\n3 weeks ago, I saw that he had liked pictures of the girl's sister on Instagram. He says he had remembered liking them from a long time ago and had been trying to unlike them so I would never find them and in doing so accidentally re liked the pictures, and I believed him.\n\nLast night. He has both the girl AND her sister unblocked AGAIN on social media. Meaning he went out of his way to go through his settings, get to privacy, open his list of blocked users and unblocked those two in particular.\n\nWIBTA for ending a 7 year relationship with the father of my son because he can't seem to let go of some other girl? Even though the only thing I really have evidence of is them staying in contact, not actually cheating?\n\nI'm at a complete loss.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for ending a 7-year relationship with her fianc\u00e9. The main issue is that the fianc\u00e9 has been in contact with an old friend, even after promises to cut off contact. The author snoop-checked his phone multiple times and found that he liked posts from this girl and her sister. The fianc\u00e9 claims he's trying to unlike them, but they keep getting reactivated. The author finally leaves, and now questions if she's in the wrong.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. Trust is a big part of any relationship. The fianc\u00e9 repeatedly broke promises to cut off contact, which could be seen as a breach of trust. Even though there's no evidence of cheating, the ongoing communication and the effort to hide it (like blocking the author) suggests emotional unfaithfulness. The author felt justified in leaving due to the lack of trust and repeated dishonesty.\n\nOn the other hand, some might argue that the author snooped, which can be a contentious issue. If she didn't confront him first and instead snoop, that could be seen as violating his privacy. However, given the history of the issue, she might have felt it was necessary to protect the relationship. \n\nThe fianc\u00e9's actions show a pattern of not respecting boundaries. Even if he says he's trying to fix it, the repeated instances indicate a lack of commitment to the relationship. The author's decision to leave could be seen as a self-protective measure rather than being in the wrong. \n\nSo, weighing both sides, the author's actions seem justified. The fianc\u00e9's behavior eroded trust, and the author made a hard decision to end the relationship to protect herself and her son. Therefore, the answer would be B (Not in the wrong).\n"
