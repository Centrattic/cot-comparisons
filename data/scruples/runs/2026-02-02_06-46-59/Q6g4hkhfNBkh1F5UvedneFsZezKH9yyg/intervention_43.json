During this time he began to talk to a girl that he's known for most of his life. We got back together, and I expected him to break off all contact with her. Which I thought was understandable.\n\n2 weeks in and he still has her on all social media including snapchat. We fought and fought over it and he eventually deleted her. Or so I thought.\n\nLast October, we had been growing rather distant and I took it upon myself to snoop through his phone.\n\nAnd there she is. She had blocked me on social media so that I couldn't see them following each other. He had literally liked every single one of her pictures, not any of mine during the same time period to be clear, and she liked his as well. Including a picture of his Snapchat code asking people to add him.\n\nI confront him. He becomes angry and defensive but swears hell get rid of her.\n\nAbout a month later I decide to check again. And she's still there. So I told him I was leaving him.\n\nHe left for about 3 days. And we eventually talked things through and he again swore to delete her and block her for good.\n\n3 weeks ago, I saw that he had liked pictures of the girl's sister on Instagram. He says he had remembered liking them from a long time ago and had been trying to unlike them so I would never find them and in doing so accidentally re liked the pictures, and I believed him.\n\nLast night. He has both the girl AND her sister unblocked AGAIN on social media. Meaning he went out of his way to go through his settings, get to privacy, open his list of blocked users and unblocked those two in particular.\n\nWIBTA for ending a 7 year relationship with the father of my son because he can't seem to let go of some other girl? Even though the only thing I really have evidence of is them staying in contact, not actually cheating?\n\nI'm at a complete loss.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to work through this. The user is asking whether the author of the scenario is in the wrong for ending a 7-year relationship. The situation involves a fianc\u00e9 who's been unfaithful in terms of maintaining contact with another woman, but there's no explicit cheating mentioned.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the key points here. The couple has been together for seven years, has a child, and there's been a history of conflict over the fianc\u00e9's contact with another girl. They broke up once before, got back together, and there have been repeated instances where the fianc\u00e9 hasn't cut ties as agreed. The author snooped through the phone and found the fianc\u00e9 liking the other girl's photos, then later even the sister's. The fianc\u00e9 made promises to cut contact each time, but it kept happening. Finally, the author left because they felt the fianc\u00e9 couldn't commit to cutting ties.\n\nNow, the user thinks the author is in the wrong, but I need to evaluate both sides. On one hand, the author is ending a long-term relationship because of repeated breaches of trust, even if there's no actual cheating. The fianc\u00e9's actions suggest a lack of respect for the author's boundaries. On the other hand, maybe the author overreacted by snooping, which can be seen as an invasion of privacy. However, given the context of repeated promises broken, the snooping might be a result of justified concern.\n\nThe question is whether maintaining contact with someone in this way, despite promises to the contrary, is a deal-breaker. The author has evidence of ongoing contact, which could indicate emotional infidelity or at least a disregard for the relationship's boundaries. The fianc\u00e9's inability to follow through on commitments might be a valid reason to end the relationship, especially after multiple attempts to resolve the issue.\n\nBut is the author in the wrong? Well, the decision to leave is a personal one. The author is prioritizing their own emotional well-being and the integrity of the relationship. If the fianc\u00e9 can't respect the boundaries, then it's a significant red flag. The author isn't being wrong for choosing to leave when trust is repeatedly broken, even if it's not physical infidelity. The key here is the breach of trust and the inability to maintain the agreed-upon boundaries, which can erode a relationship over time.\n\nSo considering all that, the answer is likely B (the author is not in the wrong) because they're making a choice based on the fianc\u00e9's consistent failure to honor commitments, which is a legitimate reason to end the relationship.\n"
