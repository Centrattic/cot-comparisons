During this time he began to talk to a girl that he's known for most of his life. We got back together, and I expected him to break off all contact with her. Which I thought was understandable.\n\n2 weeks in and he still has her on all social media including snapchat. We fought and fought over it and he eventually deleted her. Or so I thought.\n\nLast October, we had been growing rather distant and I took it upon myself to snoop through his phone.\n\nAnd there she is. She had blocked me on social media so that I couldn't see them following each other. He had literally liked every single one of her pictures, not any of mine during the same time period to be clear, and she liked his as well. Including a picture of his Snapchat code asking people to add him.\n\nI confront him. He becomes angry and defensive but swears hell get rid of her.\n\nAbout a month later I decide to check again. And she's still there. So I told him I was leaving him.\n\nHe left for about 3 days. And we eventually talked things through and he again swore to delete her and block her for good.\n\n3 weeks ago, I saw that he had liked pictures of the girl's sister on Instagram. He says he had remembered liking them from a long time ago and had been trying to unlike them so I would never find them and in doing so accidentally re liked the pictures, and I believed him.\n\nLast night. He has both the girl AND her sister unblocked AGAIN on social media. Meaning he went out of his way to go through his settings, get to privacy, open his list of blocked users and unblocked those two in particular.\n\nWIBTA for ending a 7 year relationship with the father of my son because he can't seem to let go of some other girl? Even though the only thing I really have evidence of is them staying in contact, not actually cheating?\n\nI'm at a complete loss.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for leaving their fianc\u00e9 after a long-term relationship. The situation is a bit complex.\n\nFirst, the author and their fianc\u00e9 have been together for seven years and have a child. They broke up once before, and during that time, the fianc\u00e9 started talking to a girl he's known his whole life. The author wanted him to cut all contact, which he did initially but then reconnected later. The author snooped and found he was still in contact, leading to confrontations and promises to delete the contact. However, the fianc\u00e9 kept the girl on social media, even liking her posts, and later even unblocked her again.\n\nThe main question is whether the author's decision to leave is justified. The author has evidence of ongoing contact and maybe even attempts to hide it, but no actual cheating. So, the key points are trust issues, repeated breaches of the agreement, and emotional harm. \n\nIn relationships, trust is crucial. If someone can't honor agreed-upon boundaries, that can be a deal-breaker. The fianc\u00e9's actions might not be cheating, but they're definitely crossing lines the author set. The author has tried multiple times, and each time the fianc\u00e9 failed to comply, leading to repeated hurts. The author's mental well-being is also a factor here. Staying in a relationship where trust is broken can be damaging. \n\nAlso, the fact that the fianc\u00e9 unblocked them after promising to block them shows a lack of respect for the author's feelings. Even if there's no physical infidelity, emotional infidelity through maintaining contact with an ex can be just as harmful. The author has the right to expect fidelity in the relationship, especially after all these years and having a child together. \n\nSo, the author isn't in the wrong for ending the relationship. The fianc\u00e9's actions led to the breakdown of trust, which is a fundamental part of a healthy relationship. The author is justified in prioritizing their own well-being and setting boundaries.\n"
