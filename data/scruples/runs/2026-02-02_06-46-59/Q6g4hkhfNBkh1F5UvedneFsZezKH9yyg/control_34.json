During this time he began to talk to a girl that he's known for most of his life. We got back together, and I expected him to break off all contact with her. Which I thought was understandable.\n\n2 weeks in and he still has her on all social media including snapchat. We fought and fought over it and he eventually deleted her. Or so I thought.\n\nLast October, we had been growing rather distant and I took it upon myself to snoop through his phone.\n\nAnd there she is. She had blocked me on social media so that I couldn't see them following each other. He had literally liked every single one of her pictures, not any of mine during the same time period to be clear, and she liked his as well. Including a picture of his Snapchat code asking people to add him.\n\nI confront him. He becomes angry and defensive but swears hell get rid of her.\n\nAbout a month later I decide to check again. And she's still there. So I told him I was leaving him.\n\nHe left for about 3 days. And we eventually talked things through and he again swore to delete her and block her for good.\n\n3 weeks ago, I saw that he had liked pictures of the girl's sister on Instagram. He says he had remembered liking them from a long time ago and had been trying to unlike them so I would never find them and in doing so accidentally re liked the pictures, and I believed him.\n\nLast night. He has both the girl AND her sister unblocked AGAIN on social media. Meaning he went out of his way to go through his settings, get to privacy, open his list of blocked users and unblocked those two in particular.\n\nWIBTA for ending a 7 year relationship with the father of my son because he can't seem to let go of some other girl? Even though the only thing I really have evidence of is them staying in contact, not actually cheating?\n\nI'm at a complete loss.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking whether the author (the person who wrote the WIBTA post) is in the wrong for leaving her fianc\u00e9 after seven years. The key points here are the ongoing issues with her fianc\u00e9 maintaining contact with another girl despite promises to cut it off, the author checking his phone, and the repeated incidents where he didn't follow through.\n\nFirst, the relationship has a long history, and they have a child together. The fianc\u00e9 had a month-long breakup with the author, during which he started talking to this girl. When they reconciled, the author expected him to cut contact, which seems reasonable in a committed relationship. The fianc\u00e9 did delete her initially but then reconnected later, using social media blocks to hide the interactions. The author found evidence of likes and other interactions, leading to confrontations and promises to stop, but the behavior continued. The author then decided to leave.\n\nNow, the question is about whether she's in the wrong. The user is looking for a judgment between A (Yes, she's wrong) or B (No, she's not wrong). \n\nIn relationships, trust and boundaries are crucial. The fianc\u00e9 repeatedly broke his promises to stop contacting this girl, which would erode trust. The author's actions of checking his phone could be seen as snooping, but in the context of a long-term relationship with a history of deceit, it might be viewed as a last resort. The fianc\u00e9's behavior, even if not cheating, involved intentional deception and maintaining a connection that the author found unacceptable. The author's decision to leave after multiple breaches of trust and broken promises could be justified. \n\nHowever, some might argue that the author could have handled it differently or that the fianc\u00e9's actions, while wrong, don't necessarily warrant ending a seven-year relationship. But considering the repeated nature of the issue and the lack of genuine effort to fix it, the author's choice might be seen as protecting her own well-being and the integrity of the relationship. So, the answer is likely B (No, she's not in the wrong)."
