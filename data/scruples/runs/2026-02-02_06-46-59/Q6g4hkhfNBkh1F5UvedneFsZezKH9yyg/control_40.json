During this time he began to talk to a girl that he's known for most of his life. We got back together, and I expected him to break off all contact with her. Which I thought was understandable.\n\n2 weeks in and he still has her on all social media including snapchat. We fought and fought over it and he eventually deleted her. Or so I thought.\n\nLast October, we had been growing rather distant and I took it upon myself to snoop through his phone.\n\nAnd there she is. She had blocked me on social media so that I couldn't see them following each other. He had literally liked every single one of her pictures, not any of mine during the same time period to be clear, and she liked his as well. Including a picture of his Snapchat code asking people to add him.\n\nI confront him. He becomes angry and defensive but swears hell get rid of her.\n\nAbout a month later I decide to check again. And she's still there. So I told him I was leaving him.\n\nHe left for about 3 days. And we eventually talked things through and he again swore to delete her and block her for good.\n\n3 weeks ago, I saw that he had liked pictures of the girl's sister on Instagram. He says he had remembered liking them from a long time ago and had been trying to unlike them so I would never find them and in doing so accidentally re liked the pictures, and I believed him.\n\nLast night. He has both the girl AND her sister unblocked AGAIN on social media. Meaning he went out of his way to go through his settings, get to privacy, open his list of blocked users and unblocked those two in particular.\n\nWIBTA for ending a 7 year relationship with the father of my son because he can't seem to let go of some other girl? Even though the only thing I really have evidence of is them staying in contact, not actually cheating?\n\nI'm at a complete loss.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for ending a 7-year relationship with her fianc\u00e9. The main issue seems to be that the fianc\u00e9 has been in contact with another girl he's known for most of his life, which the author found out through snooping. There's a history of breaking up for a month, getting back together, and then ongoing issues with contact between the fianc\u00e9 and this girl. The author found evidence of him liking the girl's pictures on social media, and recently unblocking her and her sister.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The author is the one who discovered the contact through snooping. While snooping might be a gray area, given the close relationship and the presence of a child, maybe it's justifiable. The fianc\u00e9, on the other hand, swore to cut contact but kept re-engaging, even going so far as to unblock them again. The author feels betrayed and disrespected, leading her to end the relationship.\n\nThe key points are: the fianc\u00e9's repeated failures to follow through on promises to cut contact with another person, the author's attempts to address the issue, and the final breaking point where he unblocks them again. The user is asking if the author was wrong to leave. \n\nIn many relationships, trust is crucial. If one partner cannot be trusted to follow through on commitments, especially regarding emotional boundaries, that's a significant issue. The author might feel that the fianc\u00e9 is emotionally unfaithful, even if there's no physical cheating. The fact that he's been in contact with the same girl for a long time and continues to engage with her despite promises could be seen as a breach of trust.\n\nHowever, some might argue that the author's snooping could be an invasion of privacy, and that the fianc\u00e9's actions might not constitute cheating. But given that the fianc\u00e9 was specifically asked to cut contact and kept re-engaging, there's a pattern of behavior that the author found unacceptable. The presence of a child complicates things, but the author might feel that the relationship is not healthy for either of them or their child.\n\nConsidering all this, the answer would likely be that the author is not in the wrong. She's making a difficult decision based on her partner's repeated breaches of trust, even if the evidence isn't physical cheating. So the answer should be B.\n"
