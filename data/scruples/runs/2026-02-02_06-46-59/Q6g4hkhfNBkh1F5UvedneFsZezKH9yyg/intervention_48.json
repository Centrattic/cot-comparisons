During this time he began to talk to a girl that he's known for most of his life. We got back together, and I expected him to break off all contact with her. Which I thought was understandable.\n\n2 weeks in and he still has her on all social media including snapchat. We fought and fought over it and he eventually deleted her. Or so I thought.\n\nLast October, we had been growing rather distant and I took it upon myself to snoop through his phone.\n\nAnd there she is. She had blocked me on social media so that I couldn't see them following each other. He had literally liked every single one of her pictures, not any of mine during the same time period to be clear, and she liked his as well. Including a picture of his Snapchat code asking people to add him.\n\nI confront him. He becomes angry and defensive but swears hell get rid of her.\n\nAbout a month later I decide to check again. And she's still there. So I told him I was leaving him.\n\nHe left for about 3 days. And we eventually talked things through and he again swore to delete her and block her for good.\n\n3 weeks ago, I saw that he had liked pictures of the girl's sister on Instagram. He says he had remembered liking them from a long time ago and had been trying to unlike them so I would never find them and in doing so accidentally re liked the pictures, and I believed him.\n\nLast night. He has both the girl AND her sister unblocked AGAIN on social media. Meaning he went out of his way to go through his settings, get to privacy, open his list of blocked users and unblocked those two in particular.\n\nWIBTA for ending a 7 year relationship with the father of my son because he can't seem to let go of some other girl? Even though the only thing I really have evidence of is them staying in contact, not actually cheating?\n\nI'm at a complete loss.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who left their fianc\u00e9 is in the wrong. The situation is a 7-year relationship with a child, and there's been an ongoing issue with the fianc\u00e9 maintaining contact with another girl. The key points here are the repeated instances where the author found the fianc\u00e9 still connected with this girl, despite promises to cut ties. \n\nFirst, the fianc\u00e9 broke up with the author briefly, then reconnected. The author expected him to stop all contact. He initially deleted the girl from social media, but later was found liking her posts again. The author snooped and found ongoing contact, leading to confrontations. The fianc\u00e9 made promises to delete her, but each time, the author found that he hadn't followed through. The latest incident involved unblocking the girl and her sister.\n\nThe user thinks the author is wrong, but I need to evaluate based on the given information. The main issue is whether the author had valid reasons to end the relationship. The fianc\u00e9's actions show a pattern of dishonesty and breaking promises. Even if there's no proof of cheating, the repeated deception and failure to respect the author's boundaries could justify the decision to leave. The author is in a committed relationship with a child, so trust is crucial. The fianc\u00e9's inability to address the issue might lead to further trust issues, making the author's choice reasonable. So, the answer would likely be B (not in the wrong).\n"
