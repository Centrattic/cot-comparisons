During this time he began to talk to a girl that he's known for most of his life. We got back together, and I expected him to break off all contact with her. Which I thought was understandable.\n\n2 weeks in and he still has her on all social media including snapchat. We fought and fought over it and he eventually deleted her. Or so I thought.\n\nLast October, we had been growing rather distant and I took it upon myself to snoop through his phone.\n\nAnd there she is. She had blocked me on social media so that I couldn't see them following each other. He had literally liked every single one of her pictures, not any of mine during the same time period to be clear, and she liked his as well. Including a picture of his Snapchat code asking people to add him.\n\nI confront him. He becomes angry and defensive but swears hell get rid of her.\n\nAbout a month later I decide to check again. And she's still there. So I told him I was leaving him.\n\nHe left for about 3 days. And we eventually talked things through and he again swore to delete her and block her for good.\n\n3 weeks ago, I saw that he had liked pictures of the girl's sister on Instagram. He says he had remembered liking them from a long time ago and had been trying to unlike them so I would never find them and in doing so accidentally re liked the pictures, and I believed him.\n\nLast night. He has both the girl AND her sister unblocked AGAIN on social media. Meaning he went out of his way to go through his settings, get to privacy, open his list of blocked users and unblocked those two in particular.\n\nWIBTA for ending a 7 year relationship with the father of my son because he can't seem to let go of some other girl? Even though the only thing I really have evidence of is them staying in contact, not actually cheating?\n\nI'm at a complete loss.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, so the user is asking if the person in the scenario is in the wrong for leaving their fianc\u00e9 of 7 years. Let me read through the situation again to make sure I get all the details.\n\nThe author and their fianc\u00e9 have been together for 7 years and have a 6-year-old son. They broke up for a month about 3 years ago, during which the fianc\u00e9 started talking to a girl he's known for most of his life. They reconciled, and the author expected him to cut contact with her. He deleted her, but then later, the author found out he was still connected on social media. They fought, he deleted her again. Then the author snooped and found he had liked her photos again, and after another argument, he deleted her once more. Now, the author found that he unblocked both the girl and her sister, leading them to end the relationship.\n\nThe user initially thinks the author is in the wrong, but wants to know my take. The key points here are about trust, repeated breaches of past agreements, and the context of a long-term relationship with a child. The main question is whether the author is justified in leaving because the fianc\u00e9 can't let go of another woman, even without evidence of actual cheating.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the nature of the relationship. A 7-year engagement with a child is a significant commitment. The fianc\u00e9's actions include maintaining contact with another woman despite promises to delete her, which the author finds unacceptable. The fact that he unblocked her and her sister again, even after previous incidents, might indicate a pattern of behavior that the author can't overlook.\n\nThe user's initial thought is that the author is in the wrong, but that might come from a place of thinking that snooping is wrong or that staying in contact with someone isn't as serious as cheating. However, the author's perspective is that they can't trust their partner to respect their boundaries, especially given the history. The fianc\u00e9's willingness to lie or make excuses (like accidentally reliking photos) and then repeatedly breaking promises could be seen as a violation of trust, which is crucial in a long-term relationship, particularly when co-parenting.\n\nIn relationships, trust and mutual respect are foundational. If one partner repeatedly breaches the other's trust by not following through on agreements, especially regarding boundaries with others, it's reasonable for the other partner to feel that the relationship is unsustainable. The author might have felt that they tried multiple times to resolve the issue, but the fianc\u00e9's actions kept undermining their efforts, leading to the decision to leave.\n\nAnother angle is the impact on their child. If the relationship is unstable and the parents are in conflict due to these issues, it could affect the child's well-being. The author might be prioritizing the child's stability by ending the relationship if trust is broken.\n\nThe fianc\u00e9's own defense could be that he's known this girl for a long time and that there's no cheating involved, just staying in touch. But in the context of a breakup and reconciliation, maintaining contact with an ex or someone close during a fragile period can be problematic. The author might have felt that this contact was a red flag, especially with the pattern of deception and broken promises.\n\nSo, considering all these factors, the author's decision to end the relationship because of a pattern of disrespecting boundaries and repeated lies about contact with another person might be justified. They might have reached a point where they can't trust their fianc\u00e9, and in a long-term relationship, especially with a child, that trust is essential. The answer would probably be B (No, the author is not in the wrong) because maintaining trust is a valid reason to end a relationship, even without proof of infidelity.\n"
