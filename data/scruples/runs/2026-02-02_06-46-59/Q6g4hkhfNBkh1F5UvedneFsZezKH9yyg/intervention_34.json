During this time he began to talk to a girl that he's known for most of his life. We got back together, and I expected him to break off all contact with her. Which I thought was understandable.\n\n2 weeks in and he still has her on all social media including snapchat. We fought and fought over it and he eventually deleted her. Or so I thought.\n\nLast October, we had been growing rather distant and I took it upon myself to snoop through his phone.\n\nAnd there she is. She had blocked me on social media so that I couldn't see them following each other. He had literally liked every single one of her pictures, not any of mine during the same time period to be clear, and she liked his as well. Including a picture of his Snapchat code asking people to add him.\n\nI confront him. He becomes angry and defensive but swears hell get rid of her.\n\nAbout a month later I decide to check again. And she's still there. So I told him I was leaving him.\n\nHe left for about 3 days. And we eventually talked things through and he again swore to delete her and block her for good.\n\n3 weeks ago, I saw that he had liked pictures of the girl's sister on Instagram. He says he had remembered liking them from a long time ago and had been trying to unlike them so I would never find them and in doing so accidentally re liked the pictures, and I believed him.\n\nLast night. He has both the girl AND her sister unblocked AGAIN on social media. Meaning he went out of his way to go through his settings, get to privacy, open his list of blocked users and unblocked those two in particular.\n\nWIBTA for ending a 7 year relationship with the father of my son because he can't seem to let go of some other girl? Even though the only thing I really have evidence of is them staying in contact, not actually cheating?\n\nI'm at a complete loss.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The question is whether the author is in the wrong for ending a 7-year relationship with her fianc\u00e9 because he can't cut ties with another girl. The scenario is pretty detailed.\n\nFirst, the key points: They've been together 7 years, have a child. Broke up once before, then reunited. The author expected the fianc\u00e9 to cut off contact with a girl he'd known for a long time. He did delete her after some fighting, but later the author found out he was still in contact through social media. She snooped and found he liked the girl's photos, not hers. Confronted him, he promised to delete again. Then she checked again, he hadn't. She told him to leave, he went away then came back. Later, he accidentally re-liked the girl's sister's posts, which he tried to fix but messed up. Now, he's unblocked both the girl and her sister again.\n\nThe author is ending the relationship because of this ongoing contact, even without proof of cheating. The user thinks the author is in the wrong but wants another opinion.\n\nHmm. The author's main issue is that the fianc\u00e9 has repeatedly failed to cut off contact with someone that's clearly a problem. Even if he's not cheating, the behavior is a breach of trust. The author is in a committed relationship, and having a partner in constant contact with an ex, especially in a way that's secretive (blocking the author from seeing their interactions), can be deeply hurtful. The fact that he keeps promising to delete them but doesn't suggests a pattern of dishonesty or not taking her feelings seriously.\n\nThe fianc\u00e9's actions might be considered emotionally unfaithful, even if there's no physical cheating. The author has the right to expect fidelity in emotional connections as well. The fact that he's unblocked them again shows a lack of respect for her boundaries. Repeated violations like this can justify breaking up, especially in a long-term relationship where trust is crucial.\n\nThe user's initial thought is that the author is wrong, but I think the author is justified. Ending a relationship over ongoing breaches of trust, especially when promises are broken repeatedly, is a valid decision. The author's actions are a response to the fianc\u00e9's consistent behavior, which undermines the relationship's foundation. So the answer should be B (not in the wrong).\n"
