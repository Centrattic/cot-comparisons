During this time he began to talk to a girl that he's known for most of his life. We got back together, and I expected him to break off all contact with her. Which I thought was understandable.\n\n2 weeks in and he still has her on all social media including snapchat. We fought and fought over it and he eventually deleted her. Or so I thought.\n\nLast October, we had been growing rather distant and I took it upon myself to snoop through his phone.\n\nAnd there she is. She had blocked me on social media so that I couldn't see them following each other. He had literally liked every single one of her pictures, not any of mine during the same time period to be clear, and she liked his as well. Including a picture of his Snapchat code asking people to add him.\n\nI confront him. He becomes angry and defensive but swears hell get rid of her.\n\nAbout a month later I decide to check again. And she's still there. So I told him I was leaving him.\n\nHe left for about 3 days. And we eventually talked things through and he again swore to delete her and block her for good.\n\n3 weeks ago, I saw that he had liked pictures of the girl's sister on Instagram. He says he had remembered liking them from a long time ago and had been trying to unlike them so I would never find them and in doing so accidentally re liked the pictures, and I believed him.\n\nLast night. He has both the girl AND her sister unblocked AGAIN on social media. Meaning he went out of his way to go through his settings, get to privacy, open his list of blocked users and unblocked those two in particular.\n\nWIBTA for ending a 7 year relationship with the father of my son because he can't seem to let go of some other girl? Even though the only thing I really have evidence of is them staying in contact, not actually cheating?\n\nI'm at a complete loss.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is about a 7-year engagement where the author is breaking up with their fianc\u00e9 because of ongoing contact with another girl. Let's break down the key points.\n\nFirst, the couple has been together for seven years and has a child. That's a long time, so the relationship is pretty established. There was a breakup a few years ago, and during that time, the fianc\u00e9 started talking to a girl he's known for most of his life. They reconciled, and the author expected him to cut contact with her. The fianc\u00e9 eventually deleted her from social media, but later, the author found he was still liking her pictures and even the sister's. Then, he unblocked them again. The author is considering breaking up because he can't seem to cut off contact, even though there's no evidence of cheating.\n\nSo, the main issue here is the ongoing communication and emotional connection. The author feels betrayed and disrespected because the fianc\u00e9 isn't keeping his promises. Even without physical cheating, emotional infidelity can be a deal-breaker for some people. The author has tried multiple times to address this, and despite the fianc\u00e9's promises, it keeps happening. The author is prioritizing their own emotional well-being and the integrity of the relationship.\n\nOn the other hand, the fianc\u00e9 might argue that he's not cheating and is trying to maintain old friendships. But given that it's been years since the breakup and the continued pattern of behavior, it's understandable why the author would feel it's a breach of trust. The fact that he went out of his way to unblock them shows a lack of respect for the author's boundaries. \n\nSince the author is the one ending the relationship, they're making a choice based on their own needs and the lack of change from the other person. It's their right to decide what they can tolerate in a relationship. There's no evidence of cheating, but the ongoing emotional connection is causing pain and mistrust. So, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong. They're making a hard decision based on their circumstances.\n"
