During this time he began to talk to a girl that he's known for most of his life. We got back together, and I expected him to break off all contact with her. Which I thought was understandable.\n\n2 weeks in and he still has her on all social media including snapchat. We fought and fought over it and he eventually deleted her. Or so I thought.\n\nLast October, we had been growing rather distant and I took it upon myself to snoop through his phone.\n\nAnd there she is. She had blocked me on social media so that I couldn't see them following each other. He had literally liked every single one of her pictures, not any of mine during the same time period to be clear, and she liked his as well. Including a picture of his Snapchat code asking people to add him.\n\nI confront him. He becomes angry and defensive but swears hell get rid of her.\n\nAbout a month later I decide to check again. And she's still there. So I told him I was leaving him.\n\nHe left for about 3 days. And we eventually talked things through and he again swore to delete her and block her for good.\n\n3 weeks ago, I saw that he had liked pictures of the girl's sister on Instagram. He says he had remembered liking them from a long time ago and had been trying to unlike them so I would never find them and in doing so accidentally re liked the pictures, and I believed him.\n\nLast night. He has both the girl AND her sister unblocked AGAIN on social media. Meaning he went out of his way to go through his settings, get to privacy, open his list of blocked users and unblocked those two in particular.\n\nWIBTA for ending a 7 year relationship with the father of my son because he can't seem to let go of some other girl? Even though the only thing I really have evidence of is them staying in contact, not actually cheating?\n\nI'm at a complete loss.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the situation is in the wrong for leaving their fianc\u00e9 after seven years. The key points here are about trust, cheating, and communication.\n\nFirst, the couple has a six-year-old son together, so there's a long-term commitment beyond just the relationship. The fianc\u00e9 broke up with his partner for a month three years ago, and during that time, he started talking to a girl he's known for a long time. When they reconciled, the author expected him to cut contact. He did delete her, but later it's revealed he's still liking her social media posts. There's a pattern here: even after promises to cut contact, he keeps reconnecting with her. The author snooped, found evidence of ongoing contact, and confrontations lead to temporary fixes, but the problem keeps recurring. The final straw is unblocking the girl and her sister, leading the author to leave.\n\nThe author isn't accusing him of cheating, just of maintaining contact and favoring another girl. The fianc\u00e9's actions show a lack of commitment to the relationship by keeping this contact. The author tried multiple times to resolve the issue through communication, but the fianc\u00e9 didn't follow through. The question is whether the author is in the wrong for ending the relationship.\n\nIn relationships, trust is crucial. If one partner consistently violates trust by maintaining contact with someone in a way that causes distress, it's reasonable to end things. The author isn't in the wrong for prioritizing their well-being and the health of the relationship. The fianc\u00e9's actions show a pattern of disrespecting the author's boundaries. So, the answer is B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
