During this time he began to talk to a girl that he's known for most of his life. We got back together, and I expected him to break off all contact with her. Which I thought was understandable.\n\n2 weeks in and he still has her on all social media including snapchat. We fought and fought over it and he eventually deleted her. Or so I thought.\n\nLast October, we had been growing rather distant and I took it upon myself to snoop through his phone.\n\nAnd there she is. She had blocked me on social media so that I couldn't see them following each other. He had literally liked every single one of her pictures, not any of mine during the same time period to be clear, and she liked his as well. Including a picture of his Snapchat code asking people to add him.\n\nI confront him. He becomes angry and defensive but swears hell get rid of her.\n\nAbout a month later I decide to check again. And she's still there. So I told him I was leaving him.\n\nHe left for about 3 days. And we eventually talked things through and he again swore to delete her and block her for good.\n\n3 weeks ago, I saw that he had liked pictures of the girl's sister on Instagram. He says he had remembered liking them from a long time ago and had been trying to unlike them so I would never find them and in doing so accidentally re liked the pictures, and I believed him.\n\nLast night. He has both the girl AND her sister unblocked AGAIN on social media. Meaning he went out of his way to go through his settings, get to privacy, open his list of blocked users and unblocked those two in particular.\n\nWIBTA for ending a 7 year relationship with the father of my son because he can't seem to let go of some other girl? Even though the only thing I really have evidence of is them staying in contact, not actually cheating?\n\nI'm at a complete loss.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is a 7-year engagement where the author is considering leaving the fianc\u00e9 because of ongoing issues with him maintaining contact with another girl. The key points are:\n\n1. They broke up for a month three years ago, during which he communicated with a girl he's known a long time. They reconciled, and the author expected him to cut contact. He deleted her initially but later had her back on social media, even liking her pictures while ignoring the author's. The author discovered this through snooping, which might be a red flag about trust issues.\n\n2. The fianc\u00e9 became defensive when confronted, promised to delete her again, but failed. The author found more instances of contact, including the girl's sister. The fianc\u00e9 gave explanations like accidentally reliking or trying to unlike, but the author found them unblocked again recently.\n\n3. The author is considering ending a long-term relationship because of this, even without proof of cheating. The question is whether the author is wrong to do so.\n\nNow, thinking about relationships and trust, if one partner is consistently unable to follow through on promises to cut contact with someone the other finds suspicious, that's a big issue. Rebuilding trust after multiple instances of deception (like hiding contacts, blocking/unblocking, etc.) is tough. The author's actions, while involving snooping, were in response to repeated broken promises. The fianc\u00e9's behavior seems to be a pattern of dishonesty and lack of respect for the author's feelings.\n\nBut is the author in the wrong for leaving? Well, if the relationship has been built on a foundation of trust that's been repeatedly broken, then the author is justified in seeking to end it. The fianc\u00e9's inability to let go and the dishonesty could be deal-breakers. The author isn't necessarily wrong for wanting out if they feel they can't trust him anymore. Also, the presence of a child complicates things, but the author might be prioritizing their own well-being and the integrity of their relationship.\n\nSnooping is ethically questionable, but in this case, it's a response to prior issues. The main issue is the fianc\u00e9's ongoing behavior versus the author's right to be with someone who respects their boundaries and is honest. So, the author isn't in the wrong for leaving given the circumstances. The answer should be B.\n"
