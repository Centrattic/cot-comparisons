During this time he began to talk to a girl that he's known for most of his life. We got back together, and I expected him to break off all contact with her. Which I thought was understandable.\n\n2 weeks in and he still has her on all social media including snapchat. We fought and fought over it and he eventually deleted her. Or so I thought.\n\nLast October, we had been growing rather distant and I took it upon myself to snoop through his phone.\n\nAnd there she is. She had blocked me on social media so that I couldn't see them following each other. He had literally liked every single one of her pictures, not any of mine during the same time period to be clear, and she liked his as well. Including a picture of his Snapchat code asking people to add him.\n\nI confront him. He becomes angry and defensive but swears hell get rid of her.\n\nAbout a month later I decide to check again. And she's still there. So I told him I was leaving him.\n\nHe left for about 3 days. And we eventually talked things through and he again swore to delete her and block her for good.\n\n3 weeks ago, I saw that he had liked pictures of the girl's sister on Instagram. He says he had remembered liking them from a long time ago and had been trying to unlike them so I would never find them and in doing so accidentally re liked the pictures, and I believed him.\n\nLast night. He has both the girl AND her sister unblocked AGAIN on social media. Meaning he went out of his way to go through his settings, get to privacy, open his list of blocked users and unblocked those two in particular.\n\nWIBTA for ending a 7 year relationship with the father of my son because he can't seem to let go of some other girl? Even though the only thing I really have evidence of is them staying in contact, not actually cheating?\n\nI'm at a complete loss.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of this situation is in the wrong when they left their fianc\u00e9 after seven years. The main issue seems to be the fianc\u00e9's ongoing contact with another girl, even after promises to cut it off. The author found out by snooping, which might be a point to consider.\n\nFirst, the fianc\u00e9 had a history of this\u2014breaking up for a month, then reconnecting but not cutting off the girl. Then, after being asked to delete her, he did but later unblocked her again. The author checked the phone and found likes on the girl's and her sister's posts. The fianc\u00e9 gave excuses, like accidentally re-liking, but then unblocked them again.\n\nThe author is left wondering if they're wrong for ending the relationship. The user initially thinks the author is in the wrong but wants another opinion. So, I need to evaluate if the author overreacted or if the fianc\u00e9's actions were justified.\n\nOn one hand, the author is making a tough decision, possibly breaking up a long-term relationship with a child. On the other hand, the fianc\u00e9's behavior shows a pattern of not respecting boundaries, which could erode trust. The author had evidence of ongoing contact despite promises, which is a breach of trust. The fianc\u00e9's excuses might not be sufficient, especially if it keeps happening.\n\nAlso, the author's actions of snooping might be questionable, but given the context, they were trying to protect the relationship. The key points are betrayal of trust through continued contact and broken promises. The author might feel they have no choice if the fianc\u00e9 can't change. So, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong here.\n"
