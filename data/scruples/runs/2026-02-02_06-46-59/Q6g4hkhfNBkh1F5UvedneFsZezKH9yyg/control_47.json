During this time he began to talk to a girl that he's known for most of his life. We got back together, and I expected him to break off all contact with her. Which I thought was understandable.\n\n2 weeks in and he still has her on all social media including snapchat. We fought and fought over it and he eventually deleted her. Or so I thought.\n\nLast October, we had been growing rather distant and I took it upon myself to snoop through his phone.\n\nAnd there she is. She had blocked me on social media so that I couldn't see them following each other. He had literally liked every single one of her pictures, not any of mine during the same time period to be clear, and she liked his as well. Including a picture of his Snapchat code asking people to add him.\n\nI confront him. He becomes angry and defensive but swears hell get rid of her.\n\nAbout a month later I decide to check again. And she's still there. So I told him I was leaving him.\n\nHe left for about 3 days. And we eventually talked things through and he again swore to delete her and block her for good.\n\n3 weeks ago, I saw that he had liked pictures of the girl's sister on Instagram. He says he had remembered liking them from a long time ago and had been trying to unlike them so I would never find them and in doing so accidentally re liked the pictures, and I believed him.\n\nLast night. He has both the girl AND her sister unblocked AGAIN on social media. Meaning he went out of his way to go through his settings, get to privacy, open his list of blocked users and unblocked those two in particular.\n\nWIBTA for ending a 7 year relationship with the father of my son because he can't seem to let go of some other girl? Even though the only thing I really have evidence of is them staying in contact, not actually cheating?\n\nI'm at a complete loss.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the situation is in the wrong for leaving their fianc\u00e9 after seven years.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The author's fianc\u00e9 has been in contact with a girl he's known for a long time, even after the author asked him to cut off contact. The couple had broken up for a month three years ago, and during that time, the fianc\u00e9 started talking to the girl. They reconciled, and the author expected him to stop contact. He deleted her but later, the author found out through snooping that he was still in touch, even liking her social media posts and the sister's. The fianc\u00e9 gave excuses each time, like accidentally re-liking posts, but now he's unblocked them again.\n\nThe key points here are trust and consistency. The author has evidence of ongoing contact despite promises to stop. The fianc\u00e9's behavior suggests a pattern of not following through on commitments, which could indicate a lack of respect for the author's boundaries. Even though there's no evidence of cheating, the consistent contact might be considered emotionally unfaithful depending on their agreement. The author, after repeated breaches and broken promises, decides to end the relationship. \n\nIn relationships, trust is crucial. If one partner repeatedly violates the other's trust without genuine effort to change, it's reasonable for the other to seek the relationship's end. The father of their child complicates things, but the author's well-being and the need for a healthy partnership are also important. The author isn't in the wrong for prioritizing their needs after such persistent issues.\n"
