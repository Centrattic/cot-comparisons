During this time he began to talk to a girl that he's known for most of his life. We got back together, and I expected him to break off all contact with her. Which I thought was understandable.\n\n2 weeks in and he still has her on all social media including snapchat. We fought and fought over it and he eventually deleted her. Or so I thought.\n\nLast October, we had been growing rather distant and I took it upon myself to snoop through his phone.\n\nAnd there she is. She had blocked me on social media so that I couldn't see them following each other. He had literally liked every single one of her pictures, not any of mine during the same time period to be clear, and she liked his as well. Including a picture of his Snapchat code asking people to add him.\n\nI confront him. He becomes angry and defensive but swears hell get rid of her.\n\nAbout a month later I decide to check again. And she's still there. So I told him I was leaving him.\n\nHe left for about 3 days. And we eventually talked things through and he again swore to delete her and block her for good.\n\n3 weeks ago, I saw that he had liked pictures of the girl's sister on Instagram. He says he had remembered liking them from a long time ago and had been trying to unlike them so I would never find them and in doing so accidentally re liked the pictures, and I believed him.\n\nLast night. He has both the girl AND her sister unblocked AGAIN on social media. Meaning he went out of his way to go through his settings, get to privacy, open his list of blocked users and unblocked those two in particular.\n\nWIBTA for ending a 7 year relationship with the father of my son because he can't seem to let go of some other girl? Even though the only thing I really have evidence of is them staying in contact, not actually cheating?\n\nI'm at a complete loss.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author of the WIBTA (Would I Be Terrible for...) post is in the wrong after leaving her fianc\u00e9 of seven years. The main issue is that the fianc\u00e9 had contact with a girl he'd known for a long time, which the author found problematic. They had multiple instances where he failed to delete her from social media, even after promises. The author snooped and found likes on the girl's and her sister's posts, leading to the final breakup.\n\nFirst, I need to assess the situation from both sides. The author is the one who left, citing trust issues and lack of commitment. The fianc\u00e9 claims he didn't mean to keep the contact, even accidentally. But the pattern is repeated: despite agreements to cut contact, he keeps reconnecting. The author's actions of checking his phone might be seen as invasive, but given the context of prior issues, it's understandable she felt the need to confirm.\n\nThe key points are the repeated breaches of trust, even if not cheating. The fianc\u00e9's inability to follow through on promises might indicate a deeper issue, like not respecting boundaries or having unresolved feelings. The author's decision to leave might be justified if she can't trust him anymore. But is she in the wrong for leaving? The question is about whether she's at fault.\n\nThe answer is likely B (No), because staying in a relationship where trust is broken multiple times can be justified. The author isn't cheating, but the fianc\u00e9's actions are eroding trust. The author isn't in the wrong for prioritizing her own well-being and their child's environment. However, snooping might be questionable, but it's often a reaction to prior issues. The main issue is the fianc\u00e9's repeated failures, so the author isn't the one at fault.\n"
