During this time he began to talk to a girl that he's known for most of his life. We got back together, and I expected him to break off all contact with her. Which I thought was understandable.\n\n2 weeks in and he still has her on all social media including snapchat. We fought and fought over it and he eventually deleted her. Or so I thought.\n\nLast October, we had been growing rather distant and I took it upon myself to snoop through his phone.\n\nAnd there she is. She had blocked me on social media so that I couldn't see them following each other. He had literally liked every single one of her pictures, not any of mine during the same time period to be clear, and she liked his as well. Including a picture of his Snapchat code asking people to add him.\n\nI confront him. He becomes angry and defensive but swears hell get rid of her.\n\nAbout a month later I decide to check again. And she's still there. So I told him I was leaving him.\n\nHe left for about 3 days. And we eventually talked things through and he again swore to delete her and block her for good.\n\n3 weeks ago, I saw that he had liked pictures of the girl's sister on Instagram. He says he had remembered liking them from a long time ago and had been trying to unlike them so I would never find them and in doing so accidentally re liked the pictures, and I believed him.\n\nLast night. He has both the girl AND her sister unblocked AGAIN on social media. Meaning he went out of his way to go through his settings, get to privacy, open his list of blocked users and unblocked those two in particular.\n\nWIBTA for ending a 7 year relationship with the father of my son because he can't seem to let go of some other girl? Even though the only thing I really have evidence of is them staying in contact, not actually cheating?\n\nI'm at a complete loss.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for ending a 7-year relationship because their fianc\u00e9 can't stop contacting an old friend.\n\nFirst, the situation: They've been together 7 years, have a child. The fianc\u00e9 had a breakup for a month 3 years ago, during which he talked to a girl he's known for years. After getting back together, the author expected him to cut contact. He deleted her, but later the author found out he was still connecting with her on social media, even liking her photos. There were confrontations, promises to cut contact, but it kept happening again. The author ended things because of this pattern.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author is wrong. Let's consider key points. Infidelity isn't mentioned; there's no evidence of cheating, just social media interactions. However, the fianc\u00e9's actions show a pattern of not respecting the author's boundaries. The author's trust was broken multiple times, leading to emotional distress. The author has a right to set boundaries in a relationship, especially when it comes to their partner's interactions with others. If the partner repeatedly violates those boundaries despite promises, it's a valid reason to end the relationship. The presence of a child adds complexity, but the author's well-being is also important. In many cases, consistent betrayal of trust, even without physical infidelity, can be a legitimate reason to leave. The author isn't wrong for prioritizing their mental health and the relationship's integrity.\n"
