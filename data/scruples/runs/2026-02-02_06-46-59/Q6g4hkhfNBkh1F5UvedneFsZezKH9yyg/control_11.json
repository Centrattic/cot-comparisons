During this time he began to talk to a girl that he's known for most of his life. We got back together, and I expected him to break off all contact with her. Which I thought was understandable.\n\n2 weeks in and he still has her on all social media including snapchat. We fought and fought over it and he eventually deleted her. Or so I thought.\n\nLast October, we had been growing rather distant and I took it upon myself to snoop through his phone.\n\nAnd there she is. She had blocked me on social media so that I couldn't see them following each other. He had literally liked every single one of her pictures, not any of mine during the same time period to be clear, and she liked his as well. Including a picture of his Snapchat code asking people to add him.\n\nI confront him. He becomes angry and defensive but swears hell get rid of her.\n\nAbout a month later I decide to check again. And she's still there. So I told him I was leaving him.\n\nHe left for about 3 days. And we eventually talked things through and he again swore to delete her and block her for good.\n\n3 weeks ago, I saw that he had liked pictures of the girl's sister on Instagram. He says he had remembered liking them from a long time ago and had been trying to unlike them so I would never find them and in doing so accidentally re liked the pictures, and I believed him.\n\nLast night. He has both the girl AND her sister unblocked AGAIN on social media. Meaning he went out of his way to go through his settings, get to privacy, open his list of blocked users and unblocked those two in particular.\n\nWIBTA for ending a 7 year relationship with the father of my son because he can't seem to let go of some other girl? Even though the only thing I really have evidence of is them staying in contact, not actually cheating?\n\nI'm at a complete loss.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is about a committed relationship, a fianc\u00e9 with a child, and the person is considering ending it because their partner keeps having contact with another girl. The user wants to know if the author (the one considering leaving) is at fault.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the timeline and the key points. They've been together for seven years, have a child. There was a breakup for a month three years ago, during which the fianc\u00e9 talked to a girl he's known a long time. After getting back together, the author expected him to cut contact. He deleted her, but later the author found out he was still liking her social media posts. There was a fight, and he deleted her again. Then, the author checked and found she was still there, leading to another confrontation. The fianc\u00e9 left for three days but came back. Then, recently, the author found that he liked the girl's sister's photos, which he tried to explain as accidental. Finally, the author discovered that he unblocked both the girl and her sister on social media.\n\nThe main question is whether the author is in the wrong for leaving over this. The author is asking if they're being too harsh. They don't have evidence of cheating, just ongoing contact.\n\nNow, from an ethical standpoint, trust is crucial in a committed relationship. The author's concern is that the fianc\u00e9 isn't maintaining boundaries, which can be a valid reason for concern. The repeated instances where the fianc\u00e9 didn't follow through on promises to cut contact might indicate a lack of respect for the author's feelings and boundaries. Even if there's no actual cheating, the pattern of behavior could erode trust and lead to emotional harm.\n\nIn relationships, especially long-term ones, partners have a right to expect fidelity in both action and attention. If one partner is consistently engaging with someone else in a way that the other finds uncomfortable, it's a reasonable expectation that they would respect the boundaries set. The fact that the author had to check his phone multiple times suggests that the communication between them was inadequate. Instead of open and honest dialogue, the author resorted to snooping, which might not be ideal, but it shows the depth of their concern.\n\nHowever, the author is also making the decision to leave, which is a major step. The fianc\u00e9 might argue that his actions don't constitute cheating and that the author is overreacting. On the other hand, the author's feelings are valid if they feel betrayed by the ongoing contact.\n\nFrom a moral perspective, the author isn't in the wrong because they're prioritizing their own well-being and the health of the relationship by leaving when trust has been repeatedly broken. The fianc\u00e9's actions, even if not physically cheating, could be emotionally damaging. The author has every right to set boundaries and walk away if those boundaries aren't respected.\n\nSo the answer would be B (No), the author isn't in the wrong. They're justified in leaving due to the ongoing violations of trust and the impact on their relationship.\n"
