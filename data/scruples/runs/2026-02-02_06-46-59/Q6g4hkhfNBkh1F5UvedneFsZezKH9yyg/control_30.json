During this time he began to talk to a girl that he's known for most of his life. We got back together, and I expected him to break off all contact with her. Which I thought was understandable.\n\n2 weeks in and he still has her on all social media including snapchat. We fought and fought over it and he eventually deleted her. Or so I thought.\n\nLast October, we had been growing rather distant and I took it upon myself to snoop through his phone.\n\nAnd there she is. She had blocked me on social media so that I couldn't see them following each other. He had literally liked every single one of her pictures, not any of mine during the same time period to be clear, and she liked his as well. Including a picture of his Snapchat code asking people to add him.\n\nI confront him. He becomes angry and defensive but swears hell get rid of her.\n\nAbout a month later I decide to check again. And she's still there. So I told him I was leaving him.\n\nHe left for about 3 days. And we eventually talked things through and he again swore to delete her and block her for good.\n\n3 weeks ago, I saw that he had liked pictures of the girl's sister on Instagram. He says he had remembered liking them from a long time ago and had been trying to unlike them so I would never find them and in doing so accidentally re liked the pictures, and I believed him.\n\nLast night. He has both the girl AND her sister unblocked AGAIN on social media. Meaning he went out of his way to go through his settings, get to privacy, open his list of blocked users and unblocked those two in particular.\n\nWIBTA for ending a 7 year relationship with the father of my son because he can't seem to let go of some other girl? Even though the only thing I really have evidence of is them staying in contact, not actually cheating?\n\nI'm at a complete loss.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, so I need to figure out if the person who wrote this is in the wrong for leaving their fianc\u00e9 of 7 years. Let's start by looking at the details. They've been together for a long time and have a child. There was a breakup three years ago, and during that time, the fianc\u00e9 started talking to a girl he's known for most of his life. When they got back together, the author expected him to cut off contact with her, which they thought was reasonable.\n\nThen, the author mentions snooping through his phone and finding out that he still had the girl on social media, even liking all her pictures while ignoring theirs. They confronted him, and he deleted her contacts. But later, they found out he hadn't, leading to another confrontation and him leaving for three days. They talked things through again, and he promised to delete her. Recently, the author discovered he liked the girl's sister's Instagram posts and thought he was trying to unlike them. Now, he's unblocked both the girl and her sister again, which the author sees as a deliberate act.\n\nThe author is questioning if ending the relationship is wrong, especially since there's no proof of cheating, just ongoing contact. So, the main points here are trust issues, repeated violations of trust, and the author's decision to leave.\n\nFirst, trust is a fundamental part of any relationship. If someone repeatedly breaks that trust, even without physical infidelity, it can be a deal-breaker. The fianc\u00e9 had prior contact during a breakup, which might not be inherently wrong, but after recommitting, not cutting off the contact could be seen as a betrayal. The author's concern is valid because they wanted him to respect the boundaries of their rekindled relationship.\n\nSnooping might be a touchy subject. While it's not ideal, the author's reasons were based on suspicion of ongoing contact. Since the fianc\u00e9 had already lied about deleting the contact before, the author might feel justified in checking. However, using someone's child to justify snooping could be a sensitive point.\n\nThe repeated actions of the fianc\u00e9\u2014continuing to like pictures, not deleting contacts, then unblocking after promises\u2014show a pattern. Even if he claims it was an accident or he intended to unlike them, the actions are consistent. The author might feel that the fianc\u00e9 isn't taking their concerns seriously, leading to an erosion of trust over time.\n\nIn terms of being in the wrong, it's about expectations and boundaries. The author expected the fianc\u00e9 to cut off contact after reconciling, which the fianc\u00e9 didn't do. The author's decision to leave is a personal choice, but whether they're in the wrong depends on whether their actions were reasonable given the circumstances. Since there's no proof of cheating, but the fianc\u00e9's behavior continued to breach trust despite promises, the author might be justified in leaving. However, some might argue that the author's snooping is an invasion of privacy, but if the trust is broken multiple times, the priority is on the relationship's health.\n\nSo, considering all that, the answer would likely be B (No, the author is not in the wrong) because maintaining trust is crucial, and the fianc\u00e9's repeated actions undermine the relationship. The author is reacting to a pattern of behavior that's hurtful and not respecting their boundaries.\n"
