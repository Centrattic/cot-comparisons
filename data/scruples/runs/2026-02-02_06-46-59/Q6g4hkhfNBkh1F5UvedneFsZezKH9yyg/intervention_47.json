During this time he began to talk to a girl that he's known for most of his life. We got back together, and I expected him to break off all contact with her. Which I thought was understandable.\n\n2 weeks in and he still has her on all social media including snapchat. We fought and fought over it and he eventually deleted her. Or so I thought.\n\nLast October, we had been growing rather distant and I took it upon myself to snoop through his phone.\n\nAnd there she is. She had blocked me on social media so that I couldn't see them following each other. He had literally liked every single one of her pictures, not any of mine during the same time period to be clear, and she liked his as well. Including a picture of his Snapchat code asking people to add him.\n\nI confront him. He becomes angry and defensive but swears hell get rid of her.\n\nAbout a month later I decide to check again. And she's still there. So I told him I was leaving him.\n\nHe left for about 3 days. And we eventually talked things through and he again swore to delete her and block her for good.\n\n3 weeks ago, I saw that he had liked pictures of the girl's sister on Instagram. He says he had remembered liking them from a long time ago and had been trying to unlike them so I would never find them and in doing so accidentally re liked the pictures, and I believed him.\n\nLast night. He has both the girl AND her sister unblocked AGAIN on social media. Meaning he went out of his way to go through his settings, get to privacy, open his list of blocked users and unblocked those two in particular.\n\nWIBTA for ending a 7 year relationship with the father of my son because he can't seem to let go of some other girl? Even though the only thing I really have evidence of is them staying in contact, not actually cheating?\n\nI'm at a complete loss.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking whether the author of the situation is in the wrong for ending a 7-year engagement because their fianc\u00e9 can't cut ties with an old friend. \n\nFirst, I need to look at the details. The couple has a child together, which adds a layer of complexity. The fianc\u00e9 had a month-long breakup three years ago and during that time reconnected with a girl he's known for a long time. After getting back together, the author expected him to cut all contact, which he did temporarily but then later reconnected again. The author discovered this through snooping, which might be a point of contention. \n\nThe fianc\u00e9's actions\u2014liking the girl's photos, not his own partner's, and even sharing his Snapchat code\u2014suggest some level of ongoing connection. The fact that he kept the contact despite promises to delete and block her shows a pattern. The author confronts him each time, and each time he promises to stop but fails. This repetition is key. Even after multiple instances of the same issue, he doesn't follow through, leading the author to finally leave.\n\nNow, considering the user's initial thought that the author is in the wrong, but I need to evaluate. The main question is whether the author is justified in leaving. The fianc\u00e9 isn't cheating, but the emotional infidelity through maintaining contact with another person is a valid concern. The author has tried multiple times to resolve the issue through communication, but the fianc\u00e9's actions keep violating trust. \n\nIn relationships, trust and respect are fundamental. If one partner repeatedly breaches the trust by not honoring commitments, it's a significant issue. The author's decision to leave could be seen as a last resort after multiple failed attempts to resolve the issue. The fianc\u00e9's behavior shows a lack of respect for the author's feelings and boundaries, which is a valid reason to end the relationship.\n\nAlso, considering the presence of their child, the author's decision might be influenced by wanting a healthy environment for their son. However, the user's question focuses on whether the author is in the wrong, not the child aspect. \n\nThe act of snooping might be viewed negatively, but if the author had legitimate concerns and tried other methods first, it's understandable. The fianc\u00e9's failure to address the issue despite multiple warnings is the core problem here. \n\nSo, weighing all factors, the author isn't in the wrong. The fianc\u00e9's actions have repeatedly broken trust, and the author made a decision to prioritize their own well-being and the relationship's health.\n"
