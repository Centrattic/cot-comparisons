During this time he began to talk to a girl that he's known for most of his life. We got back together, and I expected him to break off all contact with her. Which I thought was understandable.\n\n2 weeks in and he still has her on all social media including snapchat. We fought and fought over it and he eventually deleted her. Or so I thought.\n\nLast October, we had been growing rather distant and I took it upon myself to snoop through his phone.\n\nAnd there she is. She had blocked me on social media so that I couldn't see them following each other. He had literally liked every single one of her pictures, not any of mine during the same time period to be clear, and she liked his as well. Including a picture of his Snapchat code asking people to add him.\n\nI confront him. He becomes angry and defensive but swears hell get rid of her.\n\nAbout a month later I decide to check again. And she's still there. So I told him I was leaving him.\n\nHe left for about 3 days. And we eventually talked things through and he again swore to delete her and block her for good.\n\n3 weeks ago, I saw that he had liked pictures of the girl's sister on Instagram. He says he had remembered liking them from a long time ago and had been trying to unlike them so I would never find them and in doing so accidentally re liked the pictures, and I believed him.\n\nLast night. He has both the girl AND her sister unblocked AGAIN on social media. Meaning he went out of his way to go through his settings, get to privacy, open his list of blocked users and unblocked those two in particular.\n\nWIBTA for ending a 7 year relationship with the father of my son because he can't seem to let go of some other girl? Even though the only thing I really have evidence of is them staying in contact, not actually cheating?\n\nI'm at a complete loss.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong for leaving their fianc\u00e9 after seven years. The situation involves a long-term relationship with a child, broken up before, then issues with the fianc\u00e9 continuing to contact an ex-friend, leading to the author snoop and find out about likes on social media. The fianc\u00e9 keeps promising to cut contact but doesn't, and then the author leaves.\n\nFirst, I need to determine if the author is in the wrong. The key points here are the fianc\u00e9's actions versus the author's response. The fianc\u00e9 had a history of not cutting contact with the girl, even after agreements to do so. The author found evidence of likes on social media, not actual cheating. The fianc\u00e9 gave conflicting explanations, like accidentally re-liking old posts. The author then decides to leave, which is a significant decision given the long-term commitment and having a child together.\n\nNow, considering relationship norms, trust is crucial. The fianc\u00e9's actions suggest a lack of commitment to the relationship's boundaries. Even if it's not cheating, maintaining contact with an ex, especially in a way that the partner finds uncomfortable, can be a deal-breaker. The author has tried multiple times to resolve this, confront, and forgive, but the issue keeps recurring. The author's decision to leave is based on broken trust and the partner's inability to respect boundaries.\n\nHowever, some might argue that the author's snooping could be seen as an invasion of privacy. But given the repeated promises broken and the impact on the relationship's trust, the author's actions could be justified. The fianc\u00e9's behavior has been consistent in violating agreed-upon boundaries, which could make the author's decision reasonable.\n\nSo, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong. The fianc\u00e9's ongoing actions have caused significant distress, and after multiple attempts to address it, leaving might be the right choice. The key is whether the author's reaction is proportionate. Since there's no evidence of cheating, but there's a pattern of behavior that the author finds unacceptable, ending the relationship isn't necessarily wrong. Therefore, the answer would be B (Not in the wrong).\n"
