During this time he began to talk to a girl that he's known for most of his life. We got back together, and I expected him to break off all contact with her. Which I thought was understandable.\n\n2 weeks in and he still has her on all social media including snapchat. We fought and fought over it and he eventually deleted her. Or so I thought.\n\nLast October, we had been growing rather distant and I took it upon myself to snoop through his phone.\n\nAnd there she is. She had blocked me on social media so that I couldn't see them following each other. He had literally liked every single one of her pictures, not any of mine during the same time period to be clear, and she liked his as well. Including a picture of his Snapchat code asking people to add him.\n\nI confront him. He becomes angry and defensive but swears hell get rid of her.\n\nAbout a month later I decide to check again. And she's still there. So I told him I was leaving him.\n\nHe left for about 3 days. And we eventually talked things through and he again swore to delete her and block her for good.\n\n3 weeks ago, I saw that he had liked pictures of the girl's sister on Instagram. He says he had remembered liking them from a long time ago and had been trying to unlike them so I would never find them and in doing so accidentally re liked the pictures, and I believed him.\n\nLast night. He has both the girl AND her sister unblocked AGAIN on social media. Meaning he went out of his way to go through his settings, get to privacy, open his list of blocked users and unblocked those two in particular.\n\nWIBTA for ending a 7 year relationship with the father of my son because he can't seem to let go of some other girl? Even though the only thing I really have evidence of is them staying in contact, not actually cheating?\n\nI'm at a complete loss.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong for ending a 7-year relationship. Let me start by breaking down the situation step by step.\n\nFirst, the author and their fianc\u00e9 have been together for seven years and have a child. That's a long time, so there's a significant emotional investment and a family involved. The key issue here seems to be the fianc\u00e9's ongoing contact with an old friend, which the author finds unacceptable despite no actual cheating. \n\nThree years ago, they broke up for a month, and during that time, the fianc\u00e9 started talking to this girl he's known for life. After getting back together, the author expected him to cut contact with her. He deleted her initially but then, after some time, there were multiple instances where the author discovered ongoing contact. The author snooped through the phone and found that he was liking the girl's pictures, and even after confrontations, the contact continued. The fianc\u00e9 promised to delete her each time but failed to do so. Most recently, he unblocked both the girl and her sister, which the author found out about and decided to leave.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. Let's consider the factors. \n\n1. **Trust and Boundaries**: In a long-term relationship, trust is crucial. The author felt that maintaining contact with an ex-friend was a breach of that trust. Even without physical cheating, emotional boundaries can be important. The author's expectation that the fianc\u00e9 would cut contact might be based on how they both define fidelity in their relationship.\n\n2. **Repeated Violations**: The issue isn't a one-time occurrence. It's been happening multiple times over several years. Each time the author confronts him, he promises to stop but doesn't follow through. This pattern of behavior could indicate a lack of respect for the author's feelings and boundaries.\n\n3. **Evidence of Contact**: The author has evidence of the fianc\u00e9 liking the girl's pictures and unblocking her. Even if not physical, this can be seen as emotional unfaithfulness depending on the relationship's norms. The fianc\u00e9's excuses (like accidentally re-liking) might not be convincing, especially after multiple instances.\n\n4. **Impact on the Relationship**: The author has taken steps like snooping, which can be seen as a breach of trust, but it's also understandable given the situation. The fianc\u00e9's inability to commit to cutting contact despite repeated promises could be a sign of deeper issues, like not valuing the relationship enough. \n\n5. **The Child Factor**: They have a child together. Ending the relationship affects the child, but the child's well-being also depends on the parents' ability to maintain a healthy relationship. Constant conflict and lack of trust might harm the child in the long run.\n\n6. **Communication**: The author has tried to communicate the issue multiple times, but the fianc\u00e9 hasn't changed his behavior. If there's no willingness to address the problem, it's a sign that the relationship might not be salvageable.\n\n7. **Moral Judgment**: The question is about being in the wrong. The author is choosing to end the relationship because of these repeated violations. If the fianc\u00e9 isn't willing to respect the author's boundaries, then the author's decision could be seen as justified. However, one might argue that the author could have tried more ways to resolve the issue before leaving, but given the pattern and the lack of change, maybe it's a reasonable decision.\n\nConsidering all these points, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong. They've been through a lot, and the fianc\u00e9's actions have repeatedly broken their trust. The decision to leave might be a result of feeling that the relationship isn't healthy or respectful. So, the answer is likely B (No).\n"
