During this time he began to talk to a girl that he's known for most of his life. We got back together, and I expected him to break off all contact with her. Which I thought was understandable.\n\n2 weeks in and he still has her on all social media including snapchat. We fought and fought over it and he eventually deleted her. Or so I thought.\n\nLast October, we had been growing rather distant and I took it upon myself to snoop through his phone.\n\nAnd there she is. She had blocked me on social media so that I couldn't see them following each other. He had literally liked every single one of her pictures, not any of mine during the same time period to be clear, and she liked his as well. Including a picture of his Snapchat code asking people to add him.\n\nI confront him. He becomes angry and defensive but swears hell get rid of her.\n\nAbout a month later I decide to check again. And she's still there. So I told him I was leaving him.\n\nHe left for about 3 days. And we eventually talked things through and he again swore to delete her and block her for good.\n\n3 weeks ago, I saw that he had liked pictures of the girl's sister on Instagram. He says he had remembered liking them from a long time ago and had been trying to unlike them so I would never find them and in doing so accidentally re liked the pictures, and I believed him.\n\nLast night. He has both the girl AND her sister unblocked AGAIN on social media. Meaning he went out of his way to go through his settings, get to privacy, open his list of blocked users and unblocked those two in particular.\n\nWIBTA for ending a 7 year relationship with the father of my son because he can't seem to let go of some other girl? Even though the only thing I really have evidence of is them staying in contact, not actually cheating?\n\nI'm at a complete loss.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking whether the author of the scenario is in the wrong for ending a 7-year relationship with her fianc\u00e9 over his continued contact with another girl, even though there's no evidence of cheating.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation thoroughly. The couple has been together for seven years with a child. They previously broke up for a month and reconciled, but the fianc\u00e9 had contact with a girl he knew for most of his life. The author wanted him to cut off contact, which he did temporarily but then resumed. The author snooped and found ongoing likes on social media, leading to confrontations. Despite promises to delete the girl, he kept her unblocked and even liked her sister's posts. The author left him, and the question is whether she's in the wrong.\n\nThe user initially thought the author might be in the wrong but is unsure. I need to consider both sides. On one hand, the author has valid reasons for feeling betrayed and mistrustful. Her fianc\u00e9 broke his promises multiple times, which can erode trust. The fact that he went out of his way to unblock them might indicate intentional deception, which is a red flag in a relationship, especially with a child involved.\n\nOn the other hand, there's no evidence of actual cheating. The fianc\u00e9 claims he didn't intend to like the posts and the sister's pictures were accidental. The author's decision to leave based on ongoing contact without proof of infidelity might be seen as harsh by some. However, the repeated breaking of promises and the effort to hide the contact could justify her decision, as maintaining trust is crucial in a long-term relationship.\n\nIn relationships, trust is foundational. If one partner can't respect boundaries set by the other, especially after multiple warnings, it's a significant issue. The author might feel that her needs for security and a committed relationship are not being met. The fianc\u00e9's actions, even if not cheating, show a lack of commitment to the relationship's exclusivity in communication and social interactions.\n\nConsidering these points, the author's decision to leave is a personal choice, but the question is whether she's in the wrong. Since the fianc\u00e9's actions repeatedly violated her trust and boundaries, leading to a breakdown in the relationship, it's more about whether her reaction is justified. Given the context, her decision isn't in the wrong because the trust was broken multiple times, and she prioritized her well-being and the well-being of their son.\n"
