During this time he began to talk to a girl that he's known for most of his life. We got back together, and I expected him to break off all contact with her. Which I thought was understandable.\n\n2 weeks in and he still has her on all social media including snapchat. We fought and fought over it and he eventually deleted her. Or so I thought.\n\nLast October, we had been growing rather distant and I took it upon myself to snoop through his phone.\n\nAnd there she is. She had blocked me on social media so that I couldn't see them following each other. He had literally liked every single one of her pictures, not any of mine during the same time period to be clear, and she liked his as well. Including a picture of his Snapchat code asking people to add him.\n\nI confront him. He becomes angry and defensive but swears hell get rid of her.\n\nAbout a month later I decide to check again. And she's still there. So I told him I was leaving him.\n\nHe left for about 3 days. And we eventually talked things through and he again swore to delete her and block her for good.\n\n3 weeks ago, I saw that he had liked pictures of the girl's sister on Instagram. He says he had remembered liking them from a long time ago and had been trying to unlike them so I would never find them and in doing so accidentally re liked the pictures, and I believed him.\n\nLast night. He has both the girl AND her sister unblocked AGAIN on social media. Meaning he went out of his way to go through his settings, get to privacy, open his list of blocked users and unblocked those two in particular.\n\nWIBTA for ending a 7 year relationship with the father of my son because he can't seem to let go of some other girl? Even though the only thing I really have evidence of is them staying in contact, not actually cheating?\n\nI'm at a complete loss.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking whether the author of the WIBTA (Would I Be Terrible for...) post is in the wrong. The situation is about a 7-year engagement where the fianc\u00e9 is struggling to cut off contact with a girl he's known for a long time. The author found out that despite previous promises, the fianc\u00e9 kept liking her posts and even unblocked her and her sister recently. The key issue is whether the author is in the wrong for leaving the relationship based on this.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The couple has a child together, which adds complexity. The fianc\u00e9 has a history of not following through on promises to cut off contact, which the author finds unacceptable. The author snoop through the phone, which might be a point of contention. However, given the history of deceit, maybe the author felt justified.\n\nThe fianc\u00e9's actions of continuing to engage with the girl, even after multiple confrontations and promises to stop, suggest a pattern of behavior that breaches trust. The fact that he unblocked them again shows a lack of commitment to the author's needs. The author decided to end the engagement because they couldn't trust him anymore, which is a significant decision, especially with a child involved.\n\nOn the other hand, some might argue that not cheating but just maintaining contact with an ex isn't necessarily wrong. However, in the context of a long-term relationship where both parties agreed to cut off contact, this could be seen as a violation of their agreement. The author has a right to expect fidelity in the relationship, not just physical but emotional as well. The repeated breaking of promises might have eroded the author's trust to the point where continuing the relationship isn't viable.\n\nThe fact that the author found evidence of ongoing contact each time the fianc\u00e9 promised to stop indicates a pattern of dishonesty. The author's decision to leave is a response to this ongoing betrayal. Even if the fianc\u00e9 claims he didn't cheat, the emotional connection and the refusal to respect boundaries are significant issues.\n\nConsidering all this, the author isn't in the wrong for ending the relationship. They made a tough choice to prioritize their own well-being and trust. So the answer should be B (No).\n"
