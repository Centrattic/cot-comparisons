During this time he began to talk to a girl that he's known for most of his life. We got back together, and I expected him to break off all contact with her. Which I thought was understandable.\n\n2 weeks in and he still has her on all social media including snapchat. We fought and fought over it and he eventually deleted her. Or so I thought.\n\nLast October, we had been growing rather distant and I took it upon myself to snoop through his phone.\n\nAnd there she is. She had blocked me on social media so that I couldn't see them following each other. He had literally liked every single one of her pictures, not any of mine during the same time period to be clear, and she liked his as well. Including a picture of his Snapchat code asking people to add him.\n\nI confront him. He becomes angry and defensive but swears hell get rid of her.\n\nAbout a month later I decide to check again. And she's still there. So I told him I was leaving him.\n\nHe left for about 3 days. And we eventually talked things through and he again swore to delete her and block her for good.\n\n3 weeks ago, I saw that he had liked pictures of the girl's sister on Instagram. He says he had remembered liking them from a long time ago and had been trying to unlike them so I would never find them and in doing so accidentally re liked the pictures, and I believed him.\n\nLast night. He has both the girl AND her sister unblocked AGAIN on social media. Meaning he went out of his way to go through his settings, get to privacy, open his list of blocked users and unblocked those two in particular.\n\nWIBTA for ending a 7 year relationship with the father of my son because he can't seem to let go of some other girl? Even though the only thing I really have evidence of is them staying in contact, not actually cheating?\n\nI'm at a complete loss.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to work through this step by step. So the user is asking whether the author of the scenario is in the wrong. The situation involves a 7-year engagement with a son, and the author is considering breaking off the engagement because their fianc\u00e9 keeps in contact with an ex-girlfriend. The key points here are the repeated instances where the fianc\u00e9 continues to interact with this girl through social media, despite promises to cut contact. The author has snooped multiple times and found evidence of likes and unblocking, even though there's no actual cheating mentioned.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The couple has a child together, so the relationship is long-term and there's a kid involved. The author has made it clear that they felt betrayed by the ongoing contact, leading to arguments and eventual decision to leave. The fianc\u00e9, on the other hand, has given explanations\u2014like accidentally re-liking posts and not remembering\u2014but the author continues to find him unblocking these people. \n\nNow, the question is whether the author is in the wrong for leaving. The user initially thought the author was in the wrong, but that might not be the case. Let's analyze the dynamics. Trust is a big factor here. The fianc\u00e9 broke promises multiple times, which could erode trust. The author's actions, like snooping, might be seen as a breach of privacy, but in the context of a relationship where trust is compromised, some might argue it's justified. However, snooping can also be seen as invasive.\n\nThe fianc\u00e9's actions are questionable. Even without physical cheating, emotional infidelity through maintaining contact and showing favoritism (liking her posts over the author's) can be damaging. The fact that he went out of his way to unblock them suggests a deliberate choice, not just a mistake. The author's decision to leave after repeated breaches of trust might be seen as justified. However, the user is asking if the author is in the wrong, so we have to weigh the right to end a relationship versus maybe giving more chances. \n\nIn relationships, the expectation of exclusivity is important. If one partner can't respect boundaries set by the other, especially after multiple instances, it's reasonable for the other to end things. The author has tried communication and giving chances. Since the issues persist, leaving could be a valid decision. The user initially thought the author was wrong, but in this scenario, the fianc\u00e9's actions are the recurring problem. So the answer might lean towards the author not being in the wrong.\n"
