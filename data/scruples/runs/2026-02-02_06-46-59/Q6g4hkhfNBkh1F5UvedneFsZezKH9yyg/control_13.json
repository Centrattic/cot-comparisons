During this time he began to talk to a girl that he's known for most of his life. We got back together, and I expected him to break off all contact with her. Which I thought was understandable.\n\n2 weeks in and he still has her on all social media including snapchat. We fought and fought over it and he eventually deleted her. Or so I thought.\n\nLast October, we had been growing rather distant and I took it upon myself to snoop through his phone.\n\nAnd there she is. She had blocked me on social media so that I couldn't see them following each other. He had literally liked every single one of her pictures, not any of mine during the same time period to be clear, and she liked his as well. Including a picture of his Snapchat code asking people to add him.\n\nI confront him. He becomes angry and defensive but swears hell get rid of her.\n\nAbout a month later I decide to check again. And she's still there. So I told him I was leaving him.\n\nHe left for about 3 days. And we eventually talked things through and he again swore to delete her and block her for good.\n\n3 weeks ago, I saw that he had liked pictures of the girl's sister on Instagram. He says he had remembered liking them from a long time ago and had been trying to unlike them so I would never find them and in doing so accidentally re liked the pictures, and I believed him.\n\nLast night. He has both the girl AND her sister unblocked AGAIN on social media. Meaning he went out of his way to go through his settings, get to privacy, open his list of blocked users and unblocked those two in particular.\n\nWIBTA for ending a 7 year relationship with the father of my son because he can't seem to let go of some other girl? Even though the only thing I really have evidence of is them staying in contact, not actually cheating?\n\nI'm at a complete loss.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is a seven-year engagement with a son together. The fianc\u00e9 has had ongoing issues with contacting a girl he's known for most of his life, even after promises to cut contact. The author found out through snooping that he was still connected on social media, liking her posts, and even reconnected her sister. They've had multiple arguments and reconciliations, but the behavior keeps happening. The author ends the relationship because of this, even though there's no evidence of cheating just persistent contact with another woman.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The author is the one who ended the engagement. The fianc\u00e9's actions were a breach of trust, even if not cheating. The author felt the need to snoop, which might not be ideal, but given the repeated violations, it's understandable. The fianc\u00e9 kept breaking promises to cut contact, showing a pattern of dishonesty. The author's decision to leave is based on trust issues and the inability to move past this behavior. \n\nIs the author in the wrong? Well, in a relationship, trust is crucial. If one partner repeatedly violates the other's trust by maintaining contact with someone the other is uncomfortable with, it's a problem. The fianc\u00e9's actions are ongoing and despite multiple chances, he keeps failing to follow through on his promises. The author is not at fault for ending the relationship due to these breaches. While snooping isn't great, the context is important here\u2014trying to confirm trust issues. The author isn't wrong for prioritizing their own emotional well-being and the future of the relationship. There's no evidence of cheating, but the pattern of behavior is still toxic. So, the answer would be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
