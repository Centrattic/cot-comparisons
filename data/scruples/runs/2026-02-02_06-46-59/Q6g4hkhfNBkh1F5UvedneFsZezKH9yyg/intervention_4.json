During this time he began to talk to a girl that he's known for most of his life. We got back together, and I expected him to break off all contact with her. Which I thought was understandable.\n\n2 weeks in and he still has her on all social media including snapchat. We fought and fought over it and he eventually deleted her. Or so I thought.\n\nLast October, we had been growing rather distant and I took it upon myself to snoop through his phone.\n\nAnd there she is. She had blocked me on social media so that I couldn't see them following each other. He had literally liked every single one of her pictures, not any of mine during the same time period to be clear, and she liked his as well. Including a picture of his Snapchat code asking people to add him.\n\nI confront him. He becomes angry and defensive but swears hell get rid of her.\n\nAbout a month later I decide to check again. And she's still there. So I told him I was leaving him.\n\nHe left for about 3 days. And we eventually talked things through and he again swore to delete her and block her for good.\n\n3 weeks ago, I saw that he had liked pictures of the girl's sister on Instagram. He says he had remembered liking them from a long time ago and had been trying to unlike them so I would never find them and in doing so accidentally re liked the pictures, and I believed him.\n\nLast night. He has both the girl AND her sister unblocked AGAIN on social media. Meaning he went out of his way to go through his settings, get to privacy, open his list of blocked users and unblocked those two in particular.\n\nWIBTA for ending a 7 year relationship with the father of my son because he can't seem to let go of some other girl? Even though the only thing I really have evidence of is them staying in contact, not actually cheating?\n\nI'm at a complete loss.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. So the user is asking whether the author of the situation described is in the wrong for leaving their fianc\u00e9 after 7 years. The key points here are about the trust issues and the ongoing contact with another girl despite promises to stop.\n\nFirst, the author and their fianc\u00e9 have been together for seven years and have a child. That's a long time, so the relationship is pretty serious. The fianc\u00e9 had a breakup for a month three years ago, and during that time he started talking to a girl he's known for a long time. When they reconciled, the author expected him to cut all contact with her. He did delete her initially but then later kept reconnecting, even after confrontations. The author found out he was still liking her posts and even the girl's sister's posts. The fianc\u00e9 gives excuses, like accidentally liking them again, but the author keeps finding him reconnecting each time.\n\nNow, the author is considering ending the relationship because of this ongoing behavior. The question is whether the author is in the wrong. The user initially thought the author might be wrong but is unsure.\n\nHmm. From an ethical standpoint, trust is crucial in a long-term relationship, especially when there's a child involved. The fianc\u00e9 repeatedly broke promises to cut off contact with the girl, even going as far as unblocking her after multiple assurances. The author has evidence of this behavior, even if it's not actual cheating. The fianc\u00e9's actions could be seen as a breach of trust, which might justify the author's decision to leave. \n\nOn the other hand, maybe the author snooped through the phone, which isn't great. But considering the context of repeated trust issues, the author's actions might be understandable. The fianc\u00e9's behavior shows a pattern of not respecting the author's concerns, which could lead to a breakdown in the relationship. The author isn't leaving over a single incident but a pattern of behavior that's eroded trust over time.\n\nI think the author isn't in the wrong here because they're acting on valid concerns about their partner's loyalty and the impact on their family. The fianc\u00e9's actions have created a situation where trust is irreparable. Answer B.\n"
