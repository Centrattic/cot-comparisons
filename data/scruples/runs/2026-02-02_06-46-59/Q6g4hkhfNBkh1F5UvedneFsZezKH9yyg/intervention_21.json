During this time he began to talk to a girl that he's known for most of his life. We got back together, and I expected him to break off all contact with her. Which I thought was understandable.\n\n2 weeks in and he still has her on all social media including snapchat. We fought and fought over it and he eventually deleted her. Or so I thought.\n\nLast October, we had been growing rather distant and I took it upon myself to snoop through his phone.\n\nAnd there she is. She had blocked me on social media so that I couldn't see them following each other. He had literally liked every single one of her pictures, not any of mine during the same time period to be clear, and she liked his as well. Including a picture of his Snapchat code asking people to add him.\n\nI confront him. He becomes angry and defensive but swears hell get rid of her.\n\nAbout a month later I decide to check again. And she's still there. So I told him I was leaving him.\n\nHe left for about 3 days. And we eventually talked things through and he again swore to delete her and block her for good.\n\n3 weeks ago, I saw that he had liked pictures of the girl's sister on Instagram. He says he had remembered liking them from a long time ago and had been trying to unlike them so I would never find them and in doing so accidentally re liked the pictures, and I believed him.\n\nLast night. He has both the girl AND her sister unblocked AGAIN on social media. Meaning he went out of his way to go through his settings, get to privacy, open his list of blocked users and unblocked those two in particular.\n\nWIBTA for ending a 7 year relationship with the father of my son because he can't seem to let go of some other girl? Even though the only thing I really have evidence of is them staying in contact, not actually cheating?\n\nI'm at a complete loss.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking if the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong. The situation involves a seven-year engagement with a son, a broken-up period, and ongoing issues with the fianc\u00e9 contacting another girl. The author decided to leave because of this, even without proof of cheating.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The fianc\u00e9 had multiple instances of not cutting off contact with the girl, even after promises. The author snooped through the phone and found likes on the girl's and her sister's posts. The fianc\u00e9's explanations vary, like accidentally re-liking or not realizing he didn't delete her. The author now wants to leave but isn't sure if they're wrong for doing so.\n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong. The options are A (yes) or B (no). \n\nI think the main issue is trust. The author felt betrayed by the fianc\u00e9's inability to cut ties, even after agreements. The fianc\u00e9's actions suggest a lack of commitment to the relationship. The author's decision to leave is based on these repeated breaches of trust. Even without actual cheating, the pattern of behavior could be seen as emotionally unfaithful or disrespectful. The author might have a right to prioritize their own well-being and their son's stability by ending the relationship. \n\nHowever, some might argue that the author snooped, which isn't healthy. But the fianc\u00e9's actions forced the author into that position. The fianc\u00e9's refusal to honor agreements could be a bigger issue. So the author isn't necessarily in the wrong for leaving. Therefore, the answer might be B (not in the wrong).\n"
