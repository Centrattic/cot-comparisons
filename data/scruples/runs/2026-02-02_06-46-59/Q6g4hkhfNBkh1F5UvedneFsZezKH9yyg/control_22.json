During this time he began to talk to a girl that he's known for most of his life. We got back together, and I expected him to break off all contact with her. Which I thought was understandable.\n\n2 weeks in and he still has her on all social media including snapchat. We fought and fought over it and he eventually deleted her. Or so I thought.\n\nLast October, we had been growing rather distant and I took it upon myself to snoop through his phone.\n\nAnd there she is. She had blocked me on social media so that I couldn't see them following each other. He had literally liked every single one of her pictures, not any of mine during the same time period to be clear, and she liked his as well. Including a picture of his Snapchat code asking people to add him.\n\nI confront him. He becomes angry and defensive but swears hell get rid of her.\n\nAbout a month later I decide to check again. And she's still there. So I told him I was leaving him.\n\nHe left for about 3 days. And we eventually talked things through and he again swore to delete her and block her for good.\n\n3 weeks ago, I saw that he had liked pictures of the girl's sister on Instagram. He says he had remembered liking them from a long time ago and had been trying to unlike them so I would never find them and in doing so accidentally re liked the pictures, and I believed him.\n\nLast night. He has both the girl AND her sister unblocked AGAIN on social media. Meaning he went out of his way to go through his settings, get to privacy, open his list of blocked users and unblocked those two in particular.\n\nWIBTA for ending a 7 year relationship with the father of my son because he can't seem to let go of some other girl? Even though the only thing I really have evidence of is them staying in contact, not actually cheating?\n\nI'm at a complete loss.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the \"Will I Be the Asshole\" (WIBTA) post is in the wrong. The situation is about a 7-year engagement that's ending because the fianc\u00e9 can't cut contact with another girl, even after multiple promises to do so. The author found evidence on social media like liking the girl's photos, not their own, and even unblocking them again. There's no actual cheating mentioned, just ongoing contact.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key factors here. The main issue is the fianc\u00e9's repeated breaches of trust by maintaining contact with this other woman, despite assurances to stop. The author feels betrayed and can't trust their partner anymore. The fianc\u00e9 claims it's accidental or a mistake, but the pattern is consistent over years. \n\nIn relationships, trust is crucial. Even if there's no physical infidelity, emotional boundaries are important. The fianc\u00e9's actions suggest a lack of respect for the author's feelings and boundaries. The author has a right to feel insecure and betrayed, especially when promises are broken multiple times. The father of their child isn't just a partner but also a co-parent, so this affects their son's stability.\n\nThe author is ending the engagement because the fianc\u00e9 can't let go of this other girl. The question is whether the author is in the wrong for leaving. The fianc\u00e9 hasn't been unfaithful, but the ongoing contact is a violation of the relationship's terms. The author's actions\u2014snooping through the phone\u2014might be a point of contention, but the reason for snooping (to check on the contact) is understandable given the history.\n\nThe fianc\u00e9's behavior is the recurring issue here. Each time, he promises to cut contact but doesn't follow through. The author has tried multiple times to resolve it, and after repeated failures, leaving seems justified. The author isn't in the wrong for prioritizing their emotional well-being and the trust in the relationship. So the answer should be B (No), the author is not in the wrong.\n"
