During this time he began to talk to a girl that he's known for most of his life. We got back together, and I expected him to break off all contact with her. Which I thought was understandable.\n\n2 weeks in and he still has her on all social media including snapchat. We fought and fought over it and he eventually deleted her. Or so I thought.\n\nLast October, we had been growing rather distant and I took it upon myself to snoop through his phone.\n\nAnd there she is. She had blocked me on social media so that I couldn't see them following each other. He had literally liked every single one of her pictures, not any of mine during the same time period to be clear, and she liked his as well. Including a picture of his Snapchat code asking people to add him.\n\nI confront him. He becomes angry and defensive but swears hell get rid of her.\n\nAbout a month later I decide to check again. And she's still there. So I told him I was leaving him.\n\nHe left for about 3 days. And we eventually talked things through and he again swore to delete her and block her for good.\n\n3 weeks ago, I saw that he had liked pictures of the girl's sister on Instagram. He says he had remembered liking them from a long time ago and had been trying to unlike them so I would never find them and in doing so accidentally re liked the pictures, and I believed him.\n\nLast night. He has both the girl AND her sister unblocked AGAIN on social media. Meaning he went out of his way to go through his settings, get to privacy, open his list of blocked users and unblocked those two in particular.\n\nWIBTA for ending a 7 year relationship with the father of my son because he can't seem to let go of some other girl? Even though the only thing I really have evidence of is them staying in contact, not actually cheating?\n\nI'm at a complete loss.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote this is in the wrong. The situation is about a 7-year engagement that's being broken off because the fianc\u00e9 has been maintaining contact with another girl, despite repeated promises to cut it off. The author found evidence of this contact, leading to the decision to leave.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The fianc\u00e9 started talking to the girl during their one-month breakup three years ago. They reconciled, but the author expected the fianc\u00e9 to end contact. The fianc\u00e9 deleted the girl initially but then reconnected again multiple times, even after confrontations. The author snooped through the phone each time, found the continued contact, and finally decided to leave after the latest incident where the girl and her sister were unblocked again.\n\nThe author's main argument is about betrayal of trust. Maintaining contact with an ex, especially someone known for a long time, and not being honest about it can be seen as a breach of trust. Even without physical cheating, emotional infidelity or the perception of it can be just as damaging. The repeated breaking of promises to cut off contact might indicate that the fianc\u00e9 isn't respecting the author's boundaries and feelings, which is a significant issue in a committed relationship.\n\nThe fianc\u00e9 claims he accidentally re-liked the pictures and tried to unlike them. However, the pattern here is that every time there's a promise to cut off contact, it's broken. This pattern over several years suggests a lack of commitment to the relationship's health. The author has tried multiple times to address this, and each time the issue resurfaces. That kind of recurring problem can be a valid reason to end the relationship, especially when trust is irreparably damaged.\n\nOn the other hand, some might argue that the author took it upon themselves to snoop through the phone, which can be a violation of privacy. However, given the context of a committed relationship and the presence of a child, the author might feel that the stakes are high enough to justify checking. The repeated deceit and dishonesty from the fianc\u00e9 might have made the author feel that they have no other choice but to leave to protect their own emotional well-being and the integrity of the relationship.\n\nSo, considering all that, the author's decision to end the engagement isn't necessarily wrong. They had valid reasons rooted in the fianc\u00e9's actions that consistently hurt the relationship. The fianc\u00e9's inability to respect the author's concerns and maintain the boundaries necessary for trust could be the real issue here. Therefore, the answer would be B (the author is not in the wrong).\n"
