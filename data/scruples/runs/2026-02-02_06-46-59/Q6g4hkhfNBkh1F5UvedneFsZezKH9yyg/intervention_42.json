During this time he began to talk to a girl that he's known for most of his life. We got back together, and I expected him to break off all contact with her. Which I thought was understandable.\n\n2 weeks in and he still has her on all social media including snapchat. We fought and fought over it and he eventually deleted her. Or so I thought.\n\nLast October, we had been growing rather distant and I took it upon myself to snoop through his phone.\n\nAnd there she is. She had blocked me on social media so that I couldn't see them following each other. He had literally liked every single one of her pictures, not any of mine during the same time period to be clear, and she liked his as well. Including a picture of his Snapchat code asking people to add him.\n\nI confront him. He becomes angry and defensive but swears hell get rid of her.\n\nAbout a month later I decide to check again. And she's still there. So I told him I was leaving him.\n\nHe left for about 3 days. And we eventually talked things through and he again swore to delete her and block her for good.\n\n3 weeks ago, I saw that he had liked pictures of the girl's sister on Instagram. He says he had remembered liking them from a long time ago and had been trying to unlike them so I would never find them and in doing so accidentally re liked the pictures, and I believed him.\n\nLast night. He has both the girl AND her sister unblocked AGAIN on social media. Meaning he went out of his way to go through his settings, get to privacy, open his list of blocked users and unblocked those two in particular.\n\nWIBTA for ending a 7 year relationship with the father of my son because he can't seem to let go of some other girl? Even though the only thing I really have evidence of is them staying in contact, not actually cheating?\n\nI'm at a complete loss.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is that they're in a 7-year engagement with a son, but there's been this ongoing issue with the fianc\u00e9 maintaining contact with another girl he's known for a long time. The author discovered multiple times that the fianc\u00e9 didn't cut off contact as promised, even after arguments and promises. The last incident was the fianc\u00e9 unblocking the girl and her sister, which led the author to break up.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The author's main concern is jealousy and distrust because the fianc\u00e9 keeps contacting another woman. They felt justified in checking the phone because they were distant and concerned. The fianc\u00e9 claims he's trying to unlike her posts by mistake, but the author doesn't trust that. The author is ending a long-term relationship because of this lack of trust and the fianc\u00e9 not following through on commitments to cut contact.\n\nBut is the author in the wrong? Well, the fianc\u00e9 has a history of not keeping his promises, which is a big deal in a trusting relationship. The author has tried multiple times to resolve this, and each time the issue resurfaces. The fact that the fianc\u00e9 went out of his way to unblock them again could indicate he's not respecting the author's boundaries. Even if there's no actual cheating, the ongoing contact might be a form of emotional infidelity or at least a breach of trust.\n\nOn the other hand, the author did snoop through the phone, which could be seen as a violation of privacy. However, given the context of past promises broken and the ongoing issues, maybe the author felt it was necessary. The key here is whether the fianc\u00e9's actions were justified or if the author had a legitimate reason to end the relationship despite not having proof of cheating. The author is ending it because the fianc\u00e9 can't let go, which is affecting their trust and the relationship's stability. \n\nSo, considering all that, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong. They're choosing to leave because of repeated breaches of trust and a lack of respect for their boundaries. Even without physical cheating, emotional betrayal and dishonesty can justify ending a relationship. The answer would be B (No), the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
