During this time he began to talk to a girl that he's known for most of his life. We got back together, and I expected him to break off all contact with her. Which I thought was understandable.\n\n2 weeks in and he still has her on all social media including snapchat. We fought and fought over it and he eventually deleted her. Or so I thought.\n\nLast October, we had been growing rather distant and I took it upon myself to snoop through his phone.\n\nAnd there she is. She had blocked me on social media so that I couldn't see them following each other. He had literally liked every single one of her pictures, not any of mine during the same time period to be clear, and she liked his as well. Including a picture of his Snapchat code asking people to add him.\n\nI confront him. He becomes angry and defensive but swears hell get rid of her.\n\nAbout a month later I decide to check again. And she's still there. So I told him I was leaving him.\n\nHe left for about 3 days. And we eventually talked things through and he again swore to delete her and block her for good.\n\n3 weeks ago, I saw that he had liked pictures of the girl's sister on Instagram. He says he had remembered liking them from a long time ago and had been trying to unlike them so I would never find them and in doing so accidentally re liked the pictures, and I believed him.\n\nLast night. He has both the girl AND her sister unblocked AGAIN on social media. Meaning he went out of his way to go through his settings, get to privacy, open his list of blocked users and unblocked those two in particular.\n\nWIBTA for ending a 7 year relationship with the father of my son because he can't seem to let go of some other girl? Even though the only thing I really have evidence of is them staying in contact, not actually cheating?\n\nI'm at a complete loss.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this. So the question is whether the author is in the wrong for leaving their fianc\u00e9 after 7 years. The situation is complicated with multiple instances of the fianc\u00e9 maintaining contact with another girl despite promises to cut it off. The author has a 6-year-old son with their fianc\u00e9.\n\nFirst, I need to look at the facts presented. The key points are that the fianc\u00e9 has had ongoing contact with a girl he's known for most of his life. They had a breakup a few years ago, during which they started talking to this girl. After getting back together, the author expected him to cut contact, which he initially did but then continued in secret. The author found out through snooping, which is a bit iffy, but maybe understandable given the situation. The fianc\u00e9 kept liking her pictures, and then even the girl's sister's posts. The final straw was unblocking them again despite previous promises. The author then decided to leave.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. The user thinks the author is in the wrong but wants my opinion. So I need to evaluate both sides. \n\nOn one hand, the author has evidence of ongoing contact and betrayal of trust, even if not to the point of cheating. The fact that the fianc\u00e9 kept breaking promises and hiding these interactions could indicate a pattern of dishonesty. The author's actions led to the end of a long-term relationship, which is a big decision. But given the circumstances, maybe it's justified. The author has a right to feel betrayed and to seek a relationship where they feel respected and faithful.\n\nOn the other hand, the author snooped on their partner's phone, which is a breach of privacy. Some might argue that entering a relationship with the expectation that the partner will cut off all contact with someone they've known for a long time is unrealistic unless there's a clear boundary set from the beginning. However, if the partner repeatedly violates trust after promises, that's a different issue. The author might be overstepping by not trusting and snooping, but the fianc\u00e9's actions could justify the lack of trust.\n\nAnother angle is the impact on their son. The author is ending a relationship with the father of their child. This could complicate co-parenting. But if the author can't trust their partner and the partner isn't respecting their boundaries, staying might be more harmful. The well-being of the child is important, but a healthy parent relationship is also crucial.\n\nThe fianc\u00e9 claims he didn't cheat, just kept liking posts accidentally. The author believes him, but the repeated actions show a pattern of not honoring commitments. It's about trust and respect. If the author feels disrespected and their concerns are consistently ignored, leaving might be the right choice.\n\nIn terms of right or wrong, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong for leaving if there's a pattern of behavior that harms the relationship. The key is whether the author's decision is a reasonable response to ongoing trust issues. Since the fianc\u00e9 kept breaking promises and violating boundaries, the author's decision to leave could be justified. So the answer might be B (not in the wrong).\n"
