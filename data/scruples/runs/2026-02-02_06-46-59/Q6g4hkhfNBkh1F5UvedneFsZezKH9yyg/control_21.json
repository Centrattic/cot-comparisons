During this time he began to talk to a girl that he's known for most of his life. We got back together, and I expected him to break off all contact with her. Which I thought was understandable.\n\n2 weeks in and he still has her on all social media including snapchat. We fought and fought over it and he eventually deleted her. Or so I thought.\n\nLast October, we had been growing rather distant and I took it upon myself to snoop through his phone.\n\nAnd there she is. She had blocked me on social media so that I couldn't see them following each other. He had literally liked every single one of her pictures, not any of mine during the same time period to be clear, and she liked his as well. Including a picture of his Snapchat code asking people to add him.\n\nI confront him. He becomes angry and defensive but swears hell get rid of her.\n\nAbout a month later I decide to check again. And she's still there. So I told him I was leaving him.\n\nHe left for about 3 days. And we eventually talked things through and he again swore to delete her and block her for good.\n\n3 weeks ago, I saw that he had liked pictures of the girl's sister on Instagram. He says he had remembered liking them from a long time ago and had been trying to unlike them so I would never find them and in doing so accidentally re liked the pictures, and I believed him.\n\nLast night. He has both the girl AND her sister unblocked AGAIN on social media. Meaning he went out of his way to go through his settings, get to privacy, open his list of blocked users and unblocked those two in particular.\n\nWIBTA for ending a 7 year relationship with the father of my son because he can't seem to let go of some other girl? Even though the only thing I really have evidence of is them staying in contact, not actually cheating?\n\nI'm at a complete loss.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the question is in the wrong for leaving her fianc\u00e9 after seven years. The situation involves ongoing issues with her fianc\u00e9 maintaining contact with another woman, which has been a point of conflict for a while. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. They've been together seven years with a child. There was a breakup three years ago, and since getting back together, there's been tension over him not cutting off contact with this girl. The author snooped through his phone and found he was liking her social media posts, which he then supposedly deleted but kept reappearing. Then, recently, he unblocked them again. The main issue is that while there's evidence of ongoing contact, there's no actual cheating mentioned.\n\nThe author is conflicted because she's ending such a long relationship over this. But the question is whether she's in the wrong. \n\nIn relationships, trust and boundaries are crucial. The fianc\u00e9's actions seem to repeatedly violate the boundaries the author set after their breakup. Every time he promises to cut off contact, it happens again. The author's decision to leave might be seen as a result of a breakdown in trust. Even without proof of cheating, maintaining contact with someone in a way that the partner finds unacceptable can be a valid reason to leave. \n\nBut some might argue that the author snooped, which could be seen as a breach of privacy. However, the fianc\u00e9's actions may have justified her need to check. The fact that he kept breaking his promises could be the main issue here. The author is prioritizing her own well-being and the health of the relationship, which is important. \n\nSo considering all that, the answer would likely be B (Not in the wrong) because the author has reasons to feel betrayed and the relationship may not be sustainable if trust can't be maintained.\n"
