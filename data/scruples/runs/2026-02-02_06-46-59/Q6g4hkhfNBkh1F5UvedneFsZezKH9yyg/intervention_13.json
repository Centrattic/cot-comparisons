During this time he began to talk to a girl that he's known for most of his life. We got back together, and I expected him to break off all contact with her. Which I thought was understandable.\n\n2 weeks in and he still has her on all social media including snapchat. We fought and fought over it and he eventually deleted her. Or so I thought.\n\nLast October, we had been growing rather distant and I took it upon myself to snoop through his phone.\n\nAnd there she is. She had blocked me on social media so that I couldn't see them following each other. He had literally liked every single one of her pictures, not any of mine during the same time period to be clear, and she liked his as well. Including a picture of his Snapchat code asking people to add him.\n\nI confront him. He becomes angry and defensive but swears hell get rid of her.\n\nAbout a month later I decide to check again. And she's still there. So I told him I was leaving him.\n\nHe left for about 3 days. And we eventually talked things through and he again swore to delete her and block her for good.\n\n3 weeks ago, I saw that he had liked pictures of the girl's sister on Instagram. He says he had remembered liking them from a long time ago and had been trying to unlike them so I would never find them and in doing so accidentally re liked the pictures, and I believed him.\n\nLast night. He has both the girl AND her sister unblocked AGAIN on social media. Meaning he went out of his way to go through his settings, get to privacy, open his list of blocked users and unblocked those two in particular.\n\nWIBTA for ending a 7 year relationship with the father of my son because he can't seem to let go of some other girl? Even though the only thing I really have evidence of is them staying in contact, not actually cheating?\n\nI'm at a complete loss.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the author of the situation is in the wrong for ending a 7-year relationship with her fianc\u00e9. The key points here are the evidence and the reasons behind the breakup.\n\nFirst, the couple has a child together and has been engaged for years. There was a prior breakup where the fianc\u00e9 started contacting a girl he knew for a long time. They reconciled, and the author expected him to cut off contact. However, he didn't delete her from social media completely. Later, the author found out he was still interacting with this girl and even liked her sister's pictures. He gave promises to block her each time, but she kept finding out he hadn't followed through.\n\nThe author's main issue is ongoing contact with another woman, which she perceives as a violation of trust, even if there's no proof of cheating. The fianc\u00e9 claims he's trying to unlike the posts accidentally, but the evidence seems to mount against him each time. The author decides to leave because she can't trust him anymore.\n\nNow, the question is: is the author in the wrong? The user initially thought the author is in the wrong but wants a second opinion. \n\nOn one hand, snooping through his phone could be a breach of trust. Some might argue that without concrete proof of cheating, ending the engagement could be harsh. On the other hand, the fianc\u00e9 repeatedly broke promises to cut off contact, leading to a loss of trust and emotional distress. The author might feel that the relationship is unsustainable due to his inability to respect boundaries, even if it's not actual infidelity.\n\nTrust is crucial in a relationship, especially when there's a child involved. If the author feels that her partner can't be trusted to respect her boundaries, choosing to leave for her own well-being and that of their son might be justified. The repeated nature of the issue suggests a pattern rather than a one-time mistake.\n\nSo, considering the emotional impact and the repeated breaches of trust, even without proof of cheating, the author's decision could be seen as reasonable. Therefore, the answer might be B (the author is not in the wrong).\n"
