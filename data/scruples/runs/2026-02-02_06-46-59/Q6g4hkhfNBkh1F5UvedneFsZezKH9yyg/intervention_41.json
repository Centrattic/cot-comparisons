During this time he began to talk to a girl that he's known for most of his life. We got back together, and I expected him to break off all contact with her. Which I thought was understandable.\n\n2 weeks in and he still has her on all social media including snapchat. We fought and fought over it and he eventually deleted her. Or so I thought.\n\nLast October, we had been growing rather distant and I took it upon myself to snoop through his phone.\n\nAnd there she is. She had blocked me on social media so that I couldn't see them following each other. He had literally liked every single one of her pictures, not any of mine during the same time period to be clear, and she liked his as well. Including a picture of his Snapchat code asking people to add him.\n\nI confront him. He becomes angry and defensive but swears hell get rid of her.\n\nAbout a month later I decide to check again. And she's still there. So I told him I was leaving him.\n\nHe left for about 3 days. And we eventually talked things through and he again swore to delete her and block her for good.\n\n3 weeks ago, I saw that he had liked pictures of the girl's sister on Instagram. He says he had remembered liking them from a long time ago and had been trying to unlike them so I would never find them and in doing so accidentally re liked the pictures, and I believed him.\n\nLast night. He has both the girl AND her sister unblocked AGAIN on social media. Meaning he went out of his way to go through his settings, get to privacy, open his list of blocked users and unblocked those two in particular.\n\nWIBTA for ending a 7 year relationship with the father of my son because he can't seem to let go of some other girl? Even though the only thing I really have evidence of is them staying in contact, not actually cheating?\n\nI'm at a complete loss.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong for leaving their fianc\u00e9 after seven years because he kept maintaining contact with an ex-girlfriend, even though there's no evidence of cheating.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The couple has been together for seven years, has a child. They broke up briefly and got back together. The fianc\u00e9 had contact with a girl he's known for a long time. The author expected him to cut contact, which he did but then kept reconnecting. The author snooped on his phone and found he kept liking her photos, blocking and unblocking her. The fianc\u00e9 claims he was trying to unlike them but messed up. Now the author is leaving because of this ongoing issue.\n\nThe user thinks the author is in the wrong, but I need to decide if that's accurate. The key points here are trust, boundaries in a relationship, and what's acceptable. The fianc\u00e9's actions\u2014maintaining contact, blocking/unblocking, liking photos\u2014could be seen as a betrayal of trust even without physical infidelity. The author felt disrespected and couldn't trust the fianc\u00e9 to honor their commitments, leading to the decision to leave.\n\nIt's important to consider that while there's no evidence of cheating, emotional infidelity can be a dealbreaker. The fianc\u00e9 repeatedly broke promises, which affects the trust and stability, especially in a long-term relationship with a child. The author's decision might be based on feeling that the relationship can't move forward without that trust. So, is the author in the wrong? It's possible they had a right to leave if the trust was broken beyond repair. Alternatively, maybe the author overreacted, but given the repeated issues and the lack of progress, it might be justified. So the answer would be B (not in the wrong).\n"
