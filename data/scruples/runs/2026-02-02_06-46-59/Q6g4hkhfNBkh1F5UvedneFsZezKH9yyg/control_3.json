During this time he began to talk to a girl that he's known for most of his life. We got back together, and I expected him to break off all contact with her. Which I thought was understandable.\n\n2 weeks in and he still has her on all social media including snapchat. We fought and fought over it and he eventually deleted her. Or so I thought.\n\nLast October, we had been growing rather distant and I took it upon myself to snoop through his phone.\n\nAnd there she is. She had blocked me on social media so that I couldn't see them following each other. He had literally liked every single one of her pictures, not any of mine during the same time period to be clear, and she liked his as well. Including a picture of his Snapchat code asking people to add him.\n\nI confront him. He becomes angry and defensive but swears hell get rid of her.\n\nAbout a month later I decide to check again. And she's still there. So I told him I was leaving him.\n\nHe left for about 3 days. And we eventually talked things through and he again swore to delete her and block her for good.\n\n3 weeks ago, I saw that he had liked pictures of the girl's sister on Instagram. He says he had remembered liking them from a long time ago and had been trying to unlike them so I would never find them and in doing so accidentally re liked the pictures, and I believed him.\n\nLast night. He has both the girl AND her sister unblocked AGAIN on social media. Meaning he went out of his way to go through his settings, get to privacy, open his list of blocked users and unblocked those two in particular.\n\nWIBTA for ending a 7 year relationship with the father of my son because he can't seem to let go of some other girl? Even though the only thing I really have evidence of is them staying in contact, not actually cheating?\n\nI'm at a complete loss.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so the user is asking whether the person who wrote this situation is in the wrong. Let me read through the details carefully.\n\nThe scenario is about a 7-year engagement with a partner, they have a 6-year-old son. Three years ago, there was a month-long breakup, and during that time, the fianc\u00e9 started talking to a girl he's known for most of his life. After they reconciled, the author expected him to cut contact with that girl, which they thought was reasonable. However, over time, despite some back-and-forth, the author found out through snooping that he was still in contact with her, even liking her photos and the sister's. The fianc\u00e9 promised to delete her multiple times but kept re-adding her. Now, the author is considering breaking off the engagement because of this ongoing issue, even though there's no proof of cheating, just continued contact.\n\nSo the question is whether the author is in the wrong for ending the relationship. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the key points are: the fianc\u00e9 has a history of not cutting contact with an ex, despite promises. The author tried to address it through confrontation, but each time, the issue resurfaced. The author even had to snoop to catch him in the act. The final straw was when he unblocked them again. The author is ending a 7-year relationship over this, even without proof of cheating.\n\nNow, considering societal norms and what's considered acceptable. In a committed relationship, especially with a child, partners typically expect exclusivity. However, contact with an ex can be a sensitive issue. The fianc\u00e9's actions\u2014continuously re-contacting someone despite promises\u2014could be seen as a breach of trust. The author's actions of snooping might be questionable, but it's understandable given the situation. The fact that the fianc\u00e9 lied or failed to follow through on commitments multiple times suggests a pattern of behavior that the author can't trust.\n\nOn the other hand, some might argue that the author overreacted, especially since there's no actual cheating. But the trust is broken by repeated violations. The author's decision to leave is based on the inability to trust the fianc\u00e9, which is a valid reason in a relationship. The presence of a child complicates things, but the author is prioritizing their own well-being and the integrity of the relationship.\n\nSo, in terms of being in the wrong, the author isn't. They had a legitimate issue that the fianc\u00e9 didn't resolve, leading to the breakdown. The fianc\u00e9's actions (repeated contact, lying) are the main issues here. Therefore, the answer should be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
