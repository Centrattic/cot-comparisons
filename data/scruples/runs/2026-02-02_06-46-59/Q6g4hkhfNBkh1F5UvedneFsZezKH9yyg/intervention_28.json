During this time he began to talk to a girl that he's known for most of his life. We got back together, and I expected him to break off all contact with her. Which I thought was understandable.\n\n2 weeks in and he still has her on all social media including snapchat. We fought and fought over it and he eventually deleted her. Or so I thought.\n\nLast October, we had been growing rather distant and I took it upon myself to snoop through his phone.\n\nAnd there she is. She had blocked me on social media so that I couldn't see them following each other. He had literally liked every single one of her pictures, not any of mine during the same time period to be clear, and she liked his as well. Including a picture of his Snapchat code asking people to add him.\n\nI confront him. He becomes angry and defensive but swears hell get rid of her.\n\nAbout a month later I decide to check again. And she's still there. So I told him I was leaving him.\n\nHe left for about 3 days. And we eventually talked things through and he again swore to delete her and block her for good.\n\n3 weeks ago, I saw that he had liked pictures of the girl's sister on Instagram. He says he had remembered liking them from a long time ago and had been trying to unlike them so I would never find them and in doing so accidentally re liked the pictures, and I believed him.\n\nLast night. He has both the girl AND her sister unblocked AGAIN on social media. Meaning he went out of his way to go through his settings, get to privacy, open his list of blocked users and unblocked those two in particular.\n\nWIBTA for ending a 7 year relationship with the father of my son because he can't seem to let go of some other girl? Even though the only thing I really have evidence of is them staying in contact, not actually cheating?\n\nI'm at a complete loss.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the WIBTA (Would I Be Terrible for...) post is in the wrong. The situation involves a 7-year engagement with a son, and the author is considering leaving because their fianc\u00e9 has ongoing contact with another girl, even though there's no evidence of cheating.\n\nFirst, I need to parse the details. The couple was together for 7 years, had a son. They broke up for a month three years ago, during which the fianc\u00e9 started talking to a girl he's known for most of his life. They reconciled, and the author expected him to cut off contact. He initially deleted her, but then later, after arguments, the author discovered he was still in contact via social media, even after he promised to stop. The author snooped and found he was liking her pictures, not hers. Confrontation led to more promises, but the issue persisted. Recently, he unblocked the girl and her sister, leading the author to consider ending the relationship.\n\nThe key points are: ongoing contact after repeated assurances, the author's actions of snooping (which might be ethically questionable), and the fianc\u00e9's inability to sever ties despite promises. The author is asking if ending the engagement is justified when there's no actual cheating, just contact.\n\nI need to consider both sides. The fianc\u00e9's behavior might be seen as violating trust and boundaries, especially since the author made it clear that cutting off contact was important. On the other hand, the author snooped, which could be considered a breach of privacy. However, the fianc\u00e9 kept breaking promises, which is a significant issue. The question is whether the author is in the wrong. The user thinks the author is in the wrong, but the answer might depend on cultural or personal values.\n\nIn relationships, trust and communication are crucial. If one partner is repeatedly unable to respect the other's boundaries despite clear communication, that's a red flag. The author's decision to leave might be seen as justified because the trust is broken. However, the act of snooping could be a point against the author, but if the fianc\u00e9 had a history of deception, maybe it's understandable. The fact that there's no actual cheating is a point in the fianc\u00e9's favor, but the pattern of behavior suggests emotional unavailability or potential emotional infidelity.\n\nI think the author isn't in the wrong here. The fianc\u00e9's actions show a lack of respect for the author's feelings and boundaries, which has been ongoing. Even without physical infidelity, the emotional connection with another person can be damaging. The author has tried multiple times to resolve the issue, but the fianc\u00e9 keeps breaking promises, leading to the decision to leave. So the answer would be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
