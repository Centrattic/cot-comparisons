During this time he began to talk to a girl that he's known for most of his life. We got back together, and I expected him to break off all contact with her. Which I thought was understandable.\n\n2 weeks in and he still has her on all social media including snapchat. We fought and fought over it and he eventually deleted her. Or so I thought.\n\nLast October, we had been growing rather distant and I took it upon myself to snoop through his phone.\n\nAnd there she is. She had blocked me on social media so that I couldn't see them following each other. He had literally liked every single one of her pictures, not any of mine during the same time period to be clear, and she liked his as well. Including a picture of his Snapchat code asking people to add him.\n\nI confront him. He becomes angry and defensive but swears hell get rid of her.\n\nAbout a month later I decide to check again. And she's still there. So I told him I was leaving him.\n\nHe left for about 3 days. And we eventually talked things through and he again swore to delete her and block her for good.\n\n3 weeks ago, I saw that he had liked pictures of the girl's sister on Instagram. He says he had remembered liking them from a long time ago and had been trying to unlike them so I would never find them and in doing so accidentally re liked the pictures, and I believed him.\n\nLast night. He has both the girl AND her sister unblocked AGAIN on social media. Meaning he went out of his way to go through his settings, get to privacy, open his list of blocked users and unblocked those two in particular.\n\nWIBTA for ending a 7 year relationship with the father of my son because he can't seem to let go of some other girl? Even though the only thing I really have evidence of is them staying in contact, not actually cheating?\n\nI'm at a complete loss.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of the WIBTA (Would I Be Terrible for) story is in the wrong. The situation involves a 7-year engagement, a child, and a history of the fianc\u00e9 contacting a girl he's known for most of his life. The author discovered multiple times that he was still in contact with her and even the girl's sister, despite promises to cut off contact.\n\nFirst, I need to assess the key points. The author confronted the fianc\u00e9 each time he violated the agreement. The fianc\u00e9 kept breaking promises, even after being asked to delete the girl from social media. The author snoop checked his phone, which is a sensitive issue. Some might argue that snooping is wrong, but others might see it as justified given the circumstances. The fianc\u00e9's actions could be seen as a lack of respect and commitment, especially since he had the father of their child. \n\nThe main conflict here is the ongoing betrayal of trust. Even if there's no physical cheating, the emotional infidelity through persistent contact with an ex-girlfriend could be a deal-breaker. The author decided to end the engagement after repeated breaches of trust. The question is whether the author is in the wrong for leaving because the fianc\u00e9 didn't cheat but kept in contact with an ex. \n\nFrom the author's perspective, they had legitimate reasons to feel insecure and betrayed. The fianc\u00e9's inability to honor the boundaries set by the author, despite multiple chances, could justify the decision to leave. The author might not be in the wrong because they're standing up for their own emotional well-being and the integrity of the relationship. \n\nHowever, the act of snooping might be a point against the author. Some might argue that trust should be given without checking, but in this case, the author had prior issues and was trying to protect the relationship. \n\nConsidering all factors, the author's decision to end the engagement after repeated violations seems reasonable. The fianc\u00e9's actions showed a pattern of disrespect and dishonesty. Therefore, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
