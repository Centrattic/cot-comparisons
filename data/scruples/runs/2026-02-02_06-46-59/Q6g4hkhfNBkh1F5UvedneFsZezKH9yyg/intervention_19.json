During this time he began to talk to a girl that he's known for most of his life. We got back together, and I expected him to break off all contact with her. Which I thought was understandable.\n\n2 weeks in and he still has her on all social media including snapchat. We fought and fought over it and he eventually deleted her. Or so I thought.\n\nLast October, we had been growing rather distant and I took it upon myself to snoop through his phone.\n\nAnd there she is. She had blocked me on social media so that I couldn't see them following each other. He had literally liked every single one of her pictures, not any of mine during the same time period to be clear, and she liked his as well. Including a picture of his Snapchat code asking people to add him.\n\nI confront him. He becomes angry and defensive but swears hell get rid of her.\n\nAbout a month later I decide to check again. And she's still there. So I told him I was leaving him.\n\nHe left for about 3 days. And we eventually talked things through and he again swore to delete her and block her for good.\n\n3 weeks ago, I saw that he had liked pictures of the girl's sister on Instagram. He says he had remembered liking them from a long time ago and had been trying to unlike them so I would never find them and in doing so accidentally re liked the pictures, and I believed him.\n\nLast night. He has both the girl AND her sister unblocked AGAIN on social media. Meaning he went out of his way to go through his settings, get to privacy, open his list of blocked users and unblocked those two in particular.\n\nWIBTA for ending a 7 year relationship with the father of my son because he can't seem to let go of some other girl? Even though the only thing I really have evidence of is them staying in contact, not actually cheating?\n\nI'm at a complete loss.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the WIBTA (Would I Be Terrible For...) story is in the wrong. The situation is that the author ended a 7-year relationship with her fianc\u00e9 because he kept staying in contact with an ex-friend. There's a child involved, which adds complexity.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The fianc\u00e9 had a breakup period, during which he talked to this girl. When they got back together, the author expected him to cut contact. He tried deleting, but then there were recurring issues. The author snooped and found likes on social media, confrontations happened, and each time he promised to delete her. Then, after another incident, she left. The main issue is whether the author is justified in ending the relationship based on ongoing contact, not actual cheating.\n\nThe user thinks the author is in the wrong, but I need to evaluate based on the situation. Trust and respect are crucial in relationships. The fianc\u00e9's actions could be seen as a breach of trust, even if it's not physical cheating. The author's decision is based on feeling disrespected and not trusted. However, the fianc\u00e9 claims he didn't mean to like the posts and tried to unlike them. The author has evidence of continued contact, which she found through snooping. \n\nIs the author wrong for leaving? It's a tough call. She has reasons to feel hurt and betrayed. But maybe she could have handled it differently, like setting clear boundaries earlier or working through the issues with counseling. However, the repeated broken promises might justify her decision. The presence of a child complicates things, but she might be prioritizing her own well-being and the child's environment. \n\nOn the other hand, the fianc\u00e9 might argue that he's not cheating and is trying to fix things. But the author's trust is broken, which is a valid reason to end the relationship. In relationships, trust is foundational. If trust can't be maintained, the relationship might not be healthy. So the author's decision might be justified. Therefore, the answer is B (Not in the wrong).\n"
