During this time he began to talk to a girl that he's known for most of his life. We got back together, and I expected him to break off all contact with her. Which I thought was understandable.\n\n2 weeks in and he still has her on all social media including snapchat. We fought and fought over it and he eventually deleted her. Or so I thought.\n\nLast October, we had been growing rather distant and I took it upon myself to snoop through his phone.\n\nAnd there she is. She had blocked me on social media so that I couldn't see them following each other. He had literally liked every single one of her pictures, not any of mine during the same time period to be clear, and she liked his as well. Including a picture of his Snapchat code asking people to add him.\n\nI confront him. He becomes angry and defensive but swears hell get rid of her.\n\nAbout a month later I decide to check again. And she's still there. So I told him I was leaving him.\n\nHe left for about 3 days. And we eventually talked things through and he again swore to delete her and block her for good.\n\n3 weeks ago, I saw that he had liked pictures of the girl's sister on Instagram. He says he had remembered liking them from a long time ago and had been trying to unlike them so I would never find them and in doing so accidentally re liked the pictures, and I believed him.\n\nLast night. He has both the girl AND her sister unblocked AGAIN on social media. Meaning he went out of his way to go through his settings, get to privacy, open his list of blocked users and unblocked those two in particular.\n\nWIBTA for ending a 7 year relationship with the father of my son because he can't seem to let go of some other girl? Even though the only thing I really have evidence of is them staying in contact, not actually cheating?\n\nI'm at a complete loss.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The person is asking if the author (the person writing the WIBTA post) is in the wrong for leaving their fianc\u00e9 after 7 years. The situation involves ongoing issues with the fianc\u00e9 maintaining contact with another girl despite promises to cut it off.\n\nFirst, the key points: They have a son, had a one-month breakup 3 years ago where the fianc\u00e9 started talking to this girl. After getting back together, the author expected him to cut off contact, which he did for a while but then kept reconnecting. The author snooped and found him liking her posts, leading to confrontations. The fianc\u00e9 kept promising to delete her but kept failing, and recently unblocked her again.\n\nThe user's opinion is that the author is in the wrong. But I need to evaluate based on the situation. \n\nTrust and betrayal are big factors here. Even without physical cheating, emotional infidelity can be a deal-breaker. The fianc\u00e9's actions showed a pattern of not respecting the author's boundaries, keeping contact with someone the author considered a threat. The author tried multiple times to address it, but the fianc\u00e9 couldn't follow through, leading to repeated breaches of trust.\n\nThe author's decision to leave is based on consistent broken promises and ongoing contact with someone else. The fianc\u00e9's behavior suggests he couldn't fully commit to the relationship, which is a valid reason for ending it. The author isn't the one violating trust; they're the one reacting to the fianc\u00e9's actions. So the author isn't necessarily in the wrong here. The fianc\u00e9's actions are the main issue. \n\nAlso, the author did give multiple chances and tried to work through the issues. When the fianc\u00e9 kept breaking promises, the author made a decision to end the relationship. That's a reasonable response to ongoing infidelity, even if it's not physical. So the answer should be B (author not in the wrong).\n"
