During this time he began to talk to a girl that he's known for most of his life. We got back together, and I expected him to break off all contact with her. Which I thought was understandable.\n\n2 weeks in and he still has her on all social media including snapchat. We fought and fought over it and he eventually deleted her. Or so I thought.\n\nLast October, we had been growing rather distant and I took it upon myself to snoop through his phone.\n\nAnd there she is. She had blocked me on social media so that I couldn't see them following each other. He had literally liked every single one of her pictures, not any of mine during the same time period to be clear, and she liked his as well. Including a picture of his Snapchat code asking people to add him.\n\nI confront him. He becomes angry and defensive but swears hell get rid of her.\n\nAbout a month later I decide to check again. And she's still there. So I told him I was leaving him.\n\nHe left for about 3 days. And we eventually talked things through and he again swore to delete her and block her for good.\n\n3 weeks ago, I saw that he had liked pictures of the girl's sister on Instagram. He says he had remembered liking them from a long time ago and had been trying to unlike them so I would never find them and in doing so accidentally re liked the pictures, and I believed him.\n\nLast night. He has both the girl AND her sister unblocked AGAIN on social media. Meaning he went out of his way to go through his settings, get to privacy, open his list of blocked users and unblocked those two in particular.\n\nWIBTA for ending a 7 year relationship with the father of my son because he can't seem to let go of some other girl? Even though the only thing I really have evidence of is them staying in contact, not actually cheating?\n\nI'm at a complete loss.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the situation described is in the wrong. The scenario involves a 7-year engagement with a child, and the author left the fianc\u00e9 after multiple instances of him maintaining contact with an old friend, which the author found unacceptable.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The couple broke up once before, and during that time, the fianc\u00e9 started talking to a girl he knew for most of his life. When they got back together, the author expected him to cut off contact. He deleted her but later, the author found out he was still interacting\u2014liking her photos on social media, even after promises to delete her. There were multiple confrontations, and each time he promised to stop, but the author kept finding him still in contact. The final straw was unblocking both the girl and her sister after saying he wouldn't. The author left, and the question is whether they're in the wrong.\n\nThe user thinks the author is in the wrong, but I need to evaluate both sides. Let's consider the elements of trust and communication. In a relationship, especially a long-term one with a child, trust is crucial. The fianc\u00e9's actions of maintaining contact, even if not cheating, could be seen as a breach of trust. The author is justified in feeling betrayed and losing trust. The fianc\u00e9's inability to keep his promises about cutting off contact might indicate a pattern of dishonesty or disrespect for the author's feelings.\n\nOn the other hand, the fianc\u00e9 might argue that he's not cheating and is maintaining a friendship. However, the author's perspective is that these interactions are unacceptable and make them feel insecure. The fact that the fianc\u00e9 continued to interact despite promises suggests he might not have respected the author's boundaries. The author's decision to leave is a personal choice based on their comfort and well-being. Since there's no evidence of actual cheating, the author is making a decision based on their trust and the fianc\u00e9's actions over time.\n\nIn terms of right or wrong, it's a bit nuanced. The fianc\u00e9's behavior could be seen as wrong because he didn't respect the author's boundaries and kept breaking promises. The author's decision to leave is their right, especially in a relationship where trust is broken. So, the answer would be B (No, the author is not in the wrong). They acted based on their feelings and the lack of trust, which is a valid reason to end a relationship, even without concrete proof of cheating.\n"
