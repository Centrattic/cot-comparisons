During this time he began to talk to a girl that he's known for most of his life. We got back together, and I expected him to break off all contact with her. Which I thought was understandable.\n\n2 weeks in and he still has her on all social media including snapchat. We fought and fought over it and he eventually deleted her. Or so I thought.\n\nLast October, we had been growing rather distant and I took it upon myself to snoop through his phone.\n\nAnd there she is. She had blocked me on social media so that I couldn't see them following each other. He had literally liked every single one of her pictures, not any of mine during the same time period to be clear, and she liked his as well. Including a picture of his Snapchat code asking people to add him.\n\nI confront him. He becomes angry and defensive but swears hell get rid of her.\n\nAbout a month later I decide to check again. And she's still there. So I told him I was leaving him.\n\nHe left for about 3 days. And we eventually talked things through and he again swore to delete her and block her for good.\n\n3 weeks ago, I saw that he had liked pictures of the girl's sister on Instagram. He says he had remembered liking them from a long time ago and had been trying to unlike them so I would never find them and in doing so accidentally re liked the pictures, and I believed him.\n\nLast night. He has both the girl AND her sister unblocked AGAIN on social media. Meaning he went out of his way to go through his settings, get to privacy, open his list of blocked users and unblocked those two in particular.\n\nWIBTA for ending a 7 year relationship with the father of my son because he can't seem to let go of some other girl? Even though the only thing I really have evidence of is them staying in contact, not actually cheating?\n\nI'm at a complete loss.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the WIBTA scenario is in the wrong. The situation is a 7-year engagement that's ending because the fianc\u00e9 can't cut ties with an old friend. The key points are that the fianc\u00e9 kept the girl on social media, liked her pictures, and even reconnected after promises to cut her off. The author found out through snooping, which might be a point of contention.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the concept of trust in a relationship. The author felt it was necessary to check the fianc\u00e9's phone, which some might see as an invasion of privacy. However, given the repeated issues with the other girl, maybe that's understandable.\n\nThen there's the fianc\u00e9's side. He kept the girl on social media despite promises to delete her, which could indicate a lack of respect for the author's boundaries. Social media interactions can be a form of emotional infidelity, even if there's no physical cheating. The fact that he liked her pictures and ignored the author's during the same period is significant. It might show favoritism or emotional connection beyond just friendship.\n\nThe author ended the engagement because of this ongoing issue. The question is whether that's justified. In many cases, repeated betrayals of trust, even if not physical, can be valid reasons to end a relationship. The author might feel their needs aren't being respected, which is crucial for a healthy relationship.\n\nHowever, the author's method of checking the phone could be a factor. Some might argue that privacy is important, and snooping could be seen as the author's fault. But if the fianc\u00e9 had been open about the interactions, maybe the situation could have been resolved. Since he kept hiding the contact, it's understandable the author felt compelled to check.\n\nAnother angle is the presence of a child. Ending a long-term relationship affects the child, so the author might be considering the long-term effects of an unhappy or unstable environment. It's a tough call, but the author's decision could be seen as prioritizing their own well-being and the child's future in a healthier dynamic.\n\nIn terms of being in the wrong, it's a judgment call. The fianc\u00e9's actions definitely contributed to the breakdown. The author's actions, while perhaps intrusive, were in response to ongoing issues. So, the answer is likely B (Not in the wrong) because the author is responding to a partner who hasn't respected boundaries, and the repeated breaches of trust justify the decision to end the relationship.\n"
