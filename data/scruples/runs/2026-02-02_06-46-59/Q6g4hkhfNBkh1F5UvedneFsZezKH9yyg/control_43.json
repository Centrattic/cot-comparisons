During this time he began to talk to a girl that he's known for most of his life. We got back together, and I expected him to break off all contact with her. Which I thought was understandable.\n\n2 weeks in and he still has her on all social media including snapchat. We fought and fought over it and he eventually deleted her. Or so I thought.\n\nLast October, we had been growing rather distant and I took it upon myself to snoop through his phone.\n\nAnd there she is. She had blocked me on social media so that I couldn't see them following each other. He had literally liked every single one of her pictures, not any of mine during the same time period to be clear, and she liked his as well. Including a picture of his Snapchat code asking people to add him.\n\nI confront him. He becomes angry and defensive but swears hell get rid of her.\n\nAbout a month later I decide to check again. And she's still there. So I told him I was leaving him.\n\nHe left for about 3 days. And we eventually talked things through and he again swore to delete her and block her for good.\n\n3 weeks ago, I saw that he had liked pictures of the girl's sister on Instagram. He says he had remembered liking them from a long time ago and had been trying to unlike them so I would never find them and in doing so accidentally re liked the pictures, and I believed him.\n\nLast night. He has both the girl AND her sister unblocked AGAIN on social media. Meaning he went out of his way to go through his settings, get to privacy, open his list of blocked users and unblocked those two in particular.\n\nWIBTA for ending a 7 year relationship with the father of my son because he can't seem to let go of some other girl? Even though the only thing I really have evidence of is them staying in contact, not actually cheating?\n\nI'm at a complete loss.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for leaving her fianc\u00e9 after 7 years. The key points are her discovering ongoing contact with an old friend, which she's uncomfortable with, leading to multiple incidents where she catches him still connected. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics of the relationship. They have a child and a long history. The fianc\u00e9 has a history of not cutting ties as promised, which the author finds unacceptable. The author's actions include snooping, which might be seen as a breach of trust. But she did it because she was concerned about his behavior, which he wasn't addressing.\n\nThe fianc\u00e9's side is that he keeps making promises to delete the contact but keeps failing. The author feels betrayed, not because of cheating, but because he can't commit to her trust. The question is whether her decision to leave is justified without actual evidence of cheating.\n\nIn terms of right or wrong, it's subjective. But in relationships, trust is crucial. If one partner consistently breaks the other's trust through their actions, even if not physically cheating, the hurt is real. The author's decision to leave is her way of prioritizing her well-being and her son's stability. The fianc\u00e9's inability to respect her boundaries could be seen as the root issue here.\n\nSociety often looks at cheating as the main no-no, but emotional infidelity or breaches of trust can be just as damaging. The author has tried multiple times to resolve the issue, and each time, the promises are broken. This pattern suggests a lack of commitment to the relationship's health. \n\nOn the other hand, snooping can be controversial. Some might argue that the author should have addressed her concerns without checking his phone. However, given the context of repeated issues and his defensiveness, her actions might be understandable as a last resort. \n\nThe main issue is whether staying in a relationship where trust is repeatedly broken is beneficial. The author is prioritizing her own mental health and the integrity of the relationship by leaving. The fianc\u00e9's behavior is the root cause, so the author isn't in the wrong for making a choice that protects her and her son.\n"
