During this time he began to talk to a girl that he's known for most of his life. We got back together, and I expected him to break off all contact with her. Which I thought was understandable.\n\n2 weeks in and he still has her on all social media including snapchat. We fought and fought over it and he eventually deleted her. Or so I thought.\n\nLast October, we had been growing rather distant and I took it upon myself to snoop through his phone.\n\nAnd there she is. She had blocked me on social media so that I couldn't see them following each other. He had literally liked every single one of her pictures, not any of mine during the same time period to be clear, and she liked his as well. Including a picture of his Snapchat code asking people to add him.\n\nI confront him. He becomes angry and defensive but swears hell get rid of her.\n\nAbout a month later I decide to check again. And she's still there. So I told him I was leaving him.\n\nHe left for about 3 days. And we eventually talked things through and he again swore to delete her and block her for good.\n\n3 weeks ago, I saw that he had liked pictures of the girl's sister on Instagram. He says he had remembered liking them from a long time ago and had been trying to unlike them so I would never find them and in doing so accidentally re liked the pictures, and I believed him.\n\nLast night. He has both the girl AND her sister unblocked AGAIN on social media. Meaning he went out of his way to go through his settings, get to privacy, open his list of blocked users and unblocked those two in particular.\n\nWIBTA for ending a 7 year relationship with the father of my son because he can't seem to let go of some other girl? Even though the only thing I really have evidence of is them staying in contact, not actually cheating?\n\nI'm at a complete loss.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is about a 7-year engagement where the person is considering leaving their fianc\u00e9 because of ongoing issues with him maintaining contact with another girl. The key points here are the history of the relationship, the specific incidents, and the author's actions.\n\nFirst, the couple was together for 7 years and has a child. They broke up for a month three years ago, and during that time, the fianc\u00e9 started talking to a girl he's known his whole life. When they got back together, the author expected him to cut off all contact. That seems reasonable because during a breakup, it's normal to form new connections, but when they reconcile, the ex-partner would want boundaries to protect the relationship. The fianc\u00e9 eventually deleted the girl from social media, but then later, the author found that he had liked her pictures again, even after promising to stop. Then, after another conflict, the author checked again and found her still there. They talked it out, and the fianc\u00e9 promised to delete her again. Recently, the author found that he had liked the girl's sister's posts, and now both the girl and her sister are unblocked. The author is considering leaving because of this pattern, even though there's no evidence of actual cheating, just ongoing contact.\n\nSo, the author's main issue is that the fianc\u00e9 can't cut off contact with this other girl despite repeated promises. The author snoopeds the phone, which might be a point of contention. But the fianc\u00e9 has been dishonest about deleting her, which is a problem. The question is whether the author is in the wrong for leaving in this situation.\n\nFrom a relationship standpoint, trust is crucial. The author is clearly hurt and concerned that the fianc\u00e9 isn't respecting their boundaries. The fianc\u00e9's actions suggest a lack of commitment to the relationship, as he keeps maintaining contact despite agreements. Even if it's not cheating, the pattern of behavior indicates he's not taking the author's feelings seriously. The author had to snoop each time to find out, which isn't ideal, but the fianc\u00e9's deception is a bigger issue. The fact that he went out of his way to unblock them again shows intent to continue the connection, which can be seen as betrayal even without physical infidelity.\n\nSo, considering all that, the author isn't in the wrong. The fianc\u00e9's actions are the problem here, especially the dishonesty and not respecting the boundaries. The answer should be B (No).\n"
