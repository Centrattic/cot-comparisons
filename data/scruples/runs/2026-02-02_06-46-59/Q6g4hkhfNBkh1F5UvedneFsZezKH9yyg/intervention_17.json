During this time he began to talk to a girl that he's known for most of his life. We got back together, and I expected him to break off all contact with her. Which I thought was understandable.\n\n2 weeks in and he still has her on all social media including snapchat. We fought and fought over it and he eventually deleted her. Or so I thought.\n\nLast October, we had been growing rather distant and I took it upon myself to snoop through his phone.\n\nAnd there she is. She had blocked me on social media so that I couldn't see them following each other. He had literally liked every single one of her pictures, not any of mine during the same time period to be clear, and she liked his as well. Including a picture of his Snapchat code asking people to add him.\n\nI confront him. He becomes angry and defensive but swears hell get rid of her.\n\nAbout a month later I decide to check again. And she's still there. So I told him I was leaving him.\n\nHe left for about 3 days. And we eventually talked things through and he again swore to delete her and block her for good.\n\n3 weeks ago, I saw that he had liked pictures of the girl's sister on Instagram. He says he had remembered liking them from a long time ago and had been trying to unlike them so I would never find them and in doing so accidentally re liked the pictures, and I believed him.\n\nLast night. He has both the girl AND her sister unblocked AGAIN on social media. Meaning he went out of his way to go through his settings, get to privacy, open his list of blocked users and unblocked those two in particular.\n\nWIBTA for ending a 7 year relationship with the father of my son because he can't seem to let go of some other girl? Even though the only thing I really have evidence of is them staying in contact, not actually cheating?\n\nI'm at a complete loss.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the story is in the wrong for breaking up with their fianc\u00e9 after multiple instances of him maintaining contact with an old friend. The key points here are the duration of the relationship, the history of the issue, and the evidence of ongoing contact despite promises to cut it off.\n\nFirst, the author and fianc\u00e9 have been together for seven years with a child. That's a significant commitment. The fianc\u00e9 had a past relationship with a girl, and even after breaking up briefly, the author expected him to cut off contact. He did delete her initially, but later she was found still on social media. There were multiple instances of this, including liking her sister's posts and unblocking them. The author snooped, which might be a point of contention, but the repeated behavior seems problematic.\n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong for ending the relationship. The user thinks the author is in the wrong, but the assistant has to decide. On one hand, snooping into a partner's phone can be seen as a breach of trust. On the other hand, the fianc\u00e9 kept breaking promises to cut off contact, which could indicate a lack of commitment or respect for the author's feelings. The author might feel betrayed even without proof of cheating, as the ongoing contact could be a red flag. In a long-term relationship, trust is crucial, and if one partner repeatedly violates that trust, ending the relationship isn't necessarily wrong. The answer would likely be B (not in the wrong) because the repeated breaches of trust and dishonesty from the fianc\u00e9 justify the author's decision, even if the actions don't constitute cheating per se.\n"
