During this time he began to talk to a girl that he's known for most of his life. We got back together, and I expected him to break off all contact with her. Which I thought was understandable.\n\n2 weeks in and he still has her on all social media including snapchat. We fought and fought over it and he eventually deleted her. Or so I thought.\n\nLast October, we had been growing rather distant and I took it upon myself to snoop through his phone.\n\nAnd there she is. She had blocked me on social media so that I couldn't see them following each other. He had literally liked every single one of her pictures, not any of mine during the same time period to be clear, and she liked his as well. Including a picture of his Snapchat code asking people to add him.\n\nI confront him. He becomes angry and defensive but swears hell get rid of her.\n\nAbout a month later I decide to check again. And she's still there. So I told him I was leaving him.\n\nHe left for about 3 days. And we eventually talked things through and he again swore to delete her and block her for good.\n\n3 weeks ago, I saw that he had liked pictures of the girl's sister on Instagram. He says he had remembered liking them from a long time ago and had been trying to unlike them so I would never find them and in doing so accidentally re liked the pictures, and I believed him.\n\nLast night. He has both the girl AND her sister unblocked AGAIN on social media. Meaning he went out of his way to go through his settings, get to privacy, open his list of blocked users and unblocked those two in particular.\n\nWIBTA for ending a 7 year relationship with the father of my son because he can't seem to let go of some other girl? Even though the only thing I really have evidence of is them staying in contact, not actually cheating?\n\nI'm at a complete loss.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for leaving their fianc\u00e9 after a seven-year relationship. The situation is pretty complicated with multiple instances of conflict over the fianc\u00e9's contact with another girl. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the details provided. The relationship has been ongoing for seven years, and they have a child together. They broke up for a month three years ago, and during that time, the fianc\u00e9 talked to a girl he's known for most of his life. After getting back together, the author expected him to cut off contact, which he did initially but then reconnected later. The author snooped and found evidence of ongoing contact, which led to arguments and multiple breakups.\n\nThe key points here are the recurring pattern of the fianc\u00e9 maintaining contact with the girl despite promises to stop. The author believes this is a betrayal, even if there's no evidence of actual cheating. The fianc\u00e9 gives various excuses, like accidentally liking posts, which the author seems to believe. However, the repeated nature of the issue suggests a lack of commitment to the relationship from the fianc\u00e9's side.\n\nNow, the question is about whether the author is in the wrong. The author is ending the relationship because they feel betrayed and that the fianc\u00e9 isn't respecting the boundaries they set. The fianc\u00e9's actions\u2014maintaining contact, lying about deleting the girl, re-adding her\u2014could be seen as a breach of trust, even if it's not physical infidelity. \n\nIn many relationships, trust and communication are crucial. If one partner keeps violating the trust by not following through on promises to cut off contact with someone the other finds unacceptable, that can be a valid reason to leave. The author has tried multiple times to address the issue, and each time the fianc\u00e9 hasn't followed through. The author's decision to leave might be seen as protecting their own well-being and that of their child, especially given the long-term commitment involved.\n\nOn the other hand, some might argue that the author's decision to snoop and check the phone could be a privacy issue. However, given the context of a long-term relationship and the child involved, the author's concern might be justified. The fianc\u00e9's inability to maintain boundaries and the repeated breaches could be considered more significant than the privacy aspect.\n\nSo, considering all this, it seems the author has a valid reason to leave. The fianc\u00e9's actions have caused ongoing distress and broken trust, which are hard to reconcile in a long-term partnership. Therefore, the author isn't in the wrong for ending the relationship based on these circumstances.\n"
