During this time he began to talk to a girl that he's known for most of his life. We got back together, and I expected him to break off all contact with her. Which I thought was understandable.\n\n2 weeks in and he still has her on all social media including snapchat. We fought and fought over it and he eventually deleted her. Or so I thought.\n\nLast October, we had been growing rather distant and I took it upon myself to snoop through his phone.\n\nAnd there she is. She had blocked me on social media so that I couldn't see them following each other. He had literally liked every single one of her pictures, not any of mine during the same time period to be clear, and she liked his as well. Including a picture of his Snapchat code asking people to add him.\n\nI confront him. He becomes angry and defensive but swears hell get rid of her.\n\nAbout a month later I decide to check again. And she's still there. So I told him I was leaving him.\n\nHe left for about 3 days. And we eventually talked things through and he again swore to delete her and block her for good.\n\n3 weeks ago, I saw that he had liked pictures of the girl's sister on Instagram. He says he had remembered liking them from a long time ago and had been trying to unlike them so I would never find them and in doing so accidentally re liked the pictures, and I believed him.\n\nLast night. He has both the girl AND her sister unblocked AGAIN on social media. Meaning he went out of his way to go through his settings, get to privacy, open his list of blocked users and unblocked those two in particular.\n\nWIBTA for ending a 7 year relationship with the father of my son because he can't seem to let go of some other girl? Even though the only thing I really have evidence of is them staying in contact, not actually cheating?\n\nI'm at a complete loss.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the author of this \"Will I Be The Asshole?\" (WIBTA) post is in the wrong. The situation involves a long-term relationship with a fianc\u00e9 and a child, but ongoing issues with the fianc\u00e9 maintaining contact with an ex-friend, which is causing a lot of conflict.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the key points. The couple has been together for seven years and has a child. They broke up briefly three years ago, during which the fianc\u00e9 talked to a girl he's known for most of his life. After getting back together, the author expected him to cut off all contact, which they thought was reasonable. The fianc\u00e9 deleted her initially but later kept reconnecting, even going so far as to unblock her again after previous promises to stop. The author found evidence of ongoing contact, like liking her and her sister's posts on social media. Despite confrontations and promises to stop, the behavior continued, leading the author to end the relationship.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. The possible answers are A (Yes, the author is wrong) or B (No, not wrong). \n\nTo determine if the author is in the wrong, I need to assess the situation from a fairness and relationship ethics perspective. In a committed relationship, especially with a child, trust and mutual respect are crucial. The fianc\u00e9's actions\u2014repeatedly reconnecting with an ex-friend, despite promises to stop, and even going out of his way to unblock them\u2014could be seen as a breach of trust. The author has valid reasons to feel betrayed, especially given the repeated violations and the effort to hide the contact.\n\nHowever, some might argue that the fianc\u00e9 hasn't actually cheated, just maintained contact. But in a committed relationship, maintaining contact with someone that causes such conflict might be considered a deal-breaker. The author tried to address the issue multiple times, and the fianc\u00e9's inability to commit to cutting off all contact, even after being confronted, could be seen as willfully ignoring the partner's feelings and needs. The author's decision to leave after repeated betrayals might be justified, especially since the trust is broken and the relationship is causing significant distress.\n\nOn the other hand, some might say that the author snooped through the phone, which could be seen as invading privacy. However, given the context of the ongoing conflict and the fianc\u00e9's deceptive actions (like hiding the blocked profiles), the author might have felt it necessary to check. The key point is the repeated breaking of promises and the deliberate reconnection, which the author felt compelled to end the relationship over.\n\nIn relationships, especially long-term ones, both partners need to respect each other's boundaries. If one partner is unable or unwilling to honor those boundaries despite clear communication and consequences, it's reasonable for the other to end the relationship. The author isn't being wrong for prioritizing their emotional well-being and the stability of their family situation.\n\nSo, considering all factors, the answer is likely B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
