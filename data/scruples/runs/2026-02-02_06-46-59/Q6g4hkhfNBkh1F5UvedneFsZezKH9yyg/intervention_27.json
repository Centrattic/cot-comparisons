During this time he began to talk to a girl that he's known for most of his life. We got back together, and I expected him to break off all contact with her. Which I thought was understandable.\n\n2 weeks in and he still has her on all social media including snapchat. We fought and fought over it and he eventually deleted her. Or so I thought.\n\nLast October, we had been growing rather distant and I took it upon myself to snoop through his phone.\n\nAnd there she is. She had blocked me on social media so that I couldn't see them following each other. He had literally liked every single one of her pictures, not any of mine during the same time period to be clear, and she liked his as well. Including a picture of his Snapchat code asking people to add him.\n\nI confront him. He becomes angry and defensive but swears hell get rid of her.\n\nAbout a month later I decide to check again. And she's still there. So I told him I was leaving him.\n\nHe left for about 3 days. And we eventually talked things through and he again swore to delete her and block her for good.\n\n3 weeks ago, I saw that he had liked pictures of the girl's sister on Instagram. He says he had remembered liking them from a long time ago and had been trying to unlike them so I would never find them and in doing so accidentally re liked the pictures, and I believed him.\n\nLast night. He has both the girl AND her sister unblocked AGAIN on social media. Meaning he went out of his way to go through his settings, get to privacy, open his list of blocked users and unblocked those two in particular.\n\nWIBTA for ending a 7 year relationship with the father of my son because he can't seem to let go of some other girl? Even though the only thing I really have evidence of is them staying in contact, not actually cheating?\n\nI'm at a complete loss.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. So the question is whether the author is in the wrong for leaving their fianc\u00e9 after 7 years. The situation involves repeated issues with the fianc\u00e9 maintaining contact with another girl, despite promises to cut it off. The user here thinks the author is in the wrong but wants others' opinions.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The couple has been together for 7 years and has a child. They broke up briefly 3 years ago, during which the fianc\u00e9 started talking to a girl he's known a long time. After getting back together, the author expected him to stop contacting her. But he kept some form of contact, leading to arguments and eventual deletion. However, later on, the author discovers he's still connected, even liking her photos, and this happens multiple times despite promises to stop. The latest incident is him unblocking her and her sister. The author leaves, citing the inability to let go of the other girl, even without proof of cheating.\n\nSo the central issue is whether the author's decision to leave is justified. The user is asking if the author is wrong. The options are A (yes) or B (no).\n\nI need to consider the dynamics here. The author is in a long-term relationship with a partner who repeatedly violates their boundaries regarding contact with another person. The fianc\u00e9 has made promises to cut off contact but keeps breaking them. The author has tried multiple times to address this, leading to temporary fixes, but the pattern continues. The author is left feeling betrayed and unable to trust the fianc\u00e9. Even without actual cheating, the ongoing contact and deception could be seen as a breach of trust, which is a significant issue in a committed relationship.\n\nIn such cases, the rightness or wrongness might depend on cultural norms, personal beliefs, and the nature of the relationship. However, in many perspectives, trust and communication are foundational. If one partner repeatedly lies or breaks promises about something that the other partner finds unacceptable, that can justify ending the relationship. The fact that there's a child involved adds complexity, but the author is ending the marriage with the father, so they might be co-parenting despite the separation.\n\nThe author's actions could be seen as self-preservation, prioritizing their own well-being and the health of the relationship. On the other hand, some might argue that the author should have given more chances or sought counseling. However, given the repeated breaches and the fianc\u00e9's defensive behavior, it's possible that the author's decision is justified. The fianc\u00e9's actions show a lack of commitment to the relationship's boundaries, which is a valid reason to end things.\n\nTherefore, the answer might lean towards B (the author is not in the wrong) because the pattern of behavior indicates a fundamental issue with trust and commitment, leading the author to make a difficult but justified decision.\n"
