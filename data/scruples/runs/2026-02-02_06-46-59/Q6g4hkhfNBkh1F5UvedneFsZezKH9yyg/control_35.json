During this time he began to talk to a girl that he's known for most of his life. We got back together, and I expected him to break off all contact with her. Which I thought was understandable.\n\n2 weeks in and he still has her on all social media including snapchat. We fought and fought over it and he eventually deleted her. Or so I thought.\n\nLast October, we had been growing rather distant and I took it upon myself to snoop through his phone.\n\nAnd there she is. She had blocked me on social media so that I couldn't see them following each other. He had literally liked every single one of her pictures, not any of mine during the same time period to be clear, and she liked his as well. Including a picture of his Snapchat code asking people to add him.\n\nI confront him. He becomes angry and defensive but swears hell get rid of her.\n\nAbout a month later I decide to check again. And she's still there. So I told him I was leaving him.\n\nHe left for about 3 days. And we eventually talked things through and he again swore to delete her and block her for good.\n\n3 weeks ago, I saw that he had liked pictures of the girl's sister on Instagram. He says he had remembered liking them from a long time ago and had been trying to unlike them so I would never find them and in doing so accidentally re liked the pictures, and I believed him.\n\nLast night. He has both the girl AND her sister unblocked AGAIN on social media. Meaning he went out of his way to go through his settings, get to privacy, open his list of blocked users and unblocked those two in particular.\n\nWIBTA for ending a 7 year relationship with the father of my son because he can't seem to let go of some other girl? Even though the only thing I really have evidence of is them staying in contact, not actually cheating?\n\nI'm at a complete loss.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author of the WIBTA post is in the wrong for leaving their fianc\u00e9 after 7 years, given the situation described.\n\nFirst, the key points: The couple has been together for 7 years and has a child. There was a breakup a few years ago where the fianc\u00e9 started talking to a girl he's known for a long time. After getting back together, the author expected the fianc\u00e9 to cut contact with her. He deleted her initially but then, after some time, the author found out he was still in contact. There were multiple instances where the author checked his phone and found him liking the girl's social media posts, even after he promised to stop. The author confronted him each time, and he made promises to delete her, but it kept happening. The latest incident was him unblocking her and her sister. The author is considering leaving because of this.\n\nSo, the main issue is whether the author is in the wrong. The user wants an answer of A or B. The question is about whether the author made a mistake in ending the relationship given that there's no proof of actual cheating, just ongoing contact with another woman despite promises to stop.\n\nI need to evaluate if the author's actions are justified. The fianc\u00e9 has repeatedly broken promises to cut contact with another woman. The author has tried multiple times to address this, but the behavior continues. Even though there's no evidence of cheating, the continued contact and the fianc\u00e9's actions (like unblocking her after promising not to) show a lack of respect for the author's boundaries. The author's concern is valid because constant contact with an ex or someone else can erode trust in a relationship. The fact that the fianc\u00e9 keeps making the same mistakes despite promises suggests a pattern of behavior that's not trustworthy. The author's decision to leave might be a last resort after repeated failures to resolve the issue. The fact that they have a child doesn't negate the author's right to seek a relationship where their trust is respected. So, it's more about the ongoing breach of trust rather than one-time cheating. Therefore, the author isn't in the wrong for prioritizing their own emotional well-being and the health of their relationship with their child by leaving someone who hasn't respected their boundaries.\n"
