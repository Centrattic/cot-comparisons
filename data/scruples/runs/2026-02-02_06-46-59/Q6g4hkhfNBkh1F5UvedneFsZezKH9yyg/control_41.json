During this time he began to talk to a girl that he's known for most of his life. We got back together, and I expected him to break off all contact with her. Which I thought was understandable.\n\n2 weeks in and he still has her on all social media including snapchat. We fought and fought over it and he eventually deleted her. Or so I thought.\n\nLast October, we had been growing rather distant and I took it upon myself to snoop through his phone.\n\nAnd there she is. She had blocked me on social media so that I couldn't see them following each other. He had literally liked every single one of her pictures, not any of mine during the same time period to be clear, and she liked his as well. Including a picture of his Snapchat code asking people to add him.\n\nI confront him. He becomes angry and defensive but swears hell get rid of her.\n\nAbout a month later I decide to check again. And she's still there. So I told him I was leaving him.\n\nHe left for about 3 days. And we eventually talked things through and he again swore to delete her and block her for good.\n\n3 weeks ago, I saw that he had liked pictures of the girl's sister on Instagram. He says he had remembered liking them from a long time ago and had been trying to unlike them so I would never find them and in doing so accidentally re liked the pictures, and I believed him.\n\nLast night. He has both the girl AND her sister unblocked AGAIN on social media. Meaning he went out of his way to go through his settings, get to privacy, open his list of blocked users and unblocked those two in particular.\n\nWIBTA for ending a 7 year relationship with the father of my son because he can't seem to let go of some other girl? Even though the only thing I really have evidence of is them staying in contact, not actually cheating?\n\nI'm at a complete loss.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is complex, so I need to break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, the author is in a 7-year engagement with a partner and has a child together. They broke up briefly three years ago, during which the fianc\u00e9 started talking to a girl he's known for most of his life. They reconciled, but the author expected the fianc\u00e9 to cut contact with the girl. He did delete her initially but then later, the author found out he was still in contact through social media. There were multiple instances where the author discovered he was liking the girl's posts, even after promising to block her. The latest incident is that he unblocked both her and her sister, leading the author to consider ending the engagement.\n\nNow, the key points here are about trust, communication, and boundaries in a relationship. The author felt that maintaining contact with another woman, especially after multiple promises to stop, was a betrayal. The fianc\u00e9 claims he didn't cheat but insists he was trying to unlike the posts by mistake. The author has evidence of ongoing contact, which is a red flag in a committed relationship.\n\nIn relationships, especially long-term engagements, trust is crucial. If one partner is repeatedly breaking the trust by not respecting agreed boundaries, the other partner has the right to feel wronged. The author's actions, like snooping through the phone, might be questionable, but they were likely driven by a desire to protect the relationship and address the trust issues. However, the fianc\u00e9's behavior was consistent in violating the boundaries set by the author, which justifies the author's decision to leave.\n\nThe fianc\u00e9's inability to cut ties despite repeated promises could indicate a lack of commitment or prioritization of the relationship. The author is not at fault for ending a relationship where trust has been repeatedly broken. Even without physical cheating, emotional infidelity or maintaining inappropriate connections can be just as damaging. The author's decision to end the engagement is a valid response to protect her emotional well-being and the integrity of the relationship.\n"
