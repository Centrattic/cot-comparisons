During this time he began to talk to a girl that he's known for most of his life. We got back together, and I expected him to break off all contact with her. Which I thought was understandable.\n\n2 weeks in and he still has her on all social media including snapchat. We fought and fought over it and he eventually deleted her. Or so I thought.\n\nLast October, we had been growing rather distant and I took it upon myself to snoop through his phone.\n\nAnd there she is. She had blocked me on social media so that I couldn't see them following each other. He had literally liked every single one of her pictures, not any of mine during the same time period to be clear, and she liked his as well. Including a picture of his Snapchat code asking people to add him.\n\nI confront him. He becomes angry and defensive but swears hell get rid of her.\n\nAbout a month later I decide to check again. And she's still there. So I told him I was leaving him.\n\nHe left for about 3 days. And we eventually talked things through and he again swore to delete her and block her for good.\n\n3 weeks ago, I saw that he had liked pictures of the girl's sister on Instagram. He says he had remembered liking them from a long time ago and had been trying to unlike them so I would never find them and in doing so accidentally re liked the pictures, and I believed him.\n\nLast night. He has both the girl AND her sister unblocked AGAIN on social media. Meaning he went out of his way to go through his settings, get to privacy, open his list of blocked users and unblocked those two in particular.\n\nWIBTA for ending a 7 year relationship with the father of my son because he can't seem to let go of some other girl? Even though the only thing I really have evidence of is them staying in contact, not actually cheating?\n\nI'm at a complete loss.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user wants to know if the author of the situation is in the wrong for ending a 7-year relationship because her fianc\u00e9 can't stop contacting a girl he's known for a long time. The key points here are the ongoing issue of the fianc\u00e9 maintaining contact with this girl despite promises to cut it off, and the author's decision to leave.\n\nFirst, the author mentions they have a child together, which adds emotional weight. The fianc\u00e9 has had several instances of not following through on deleting the girl from social media, even after confrontations. The author had to snoop through his phone and found evidence multiple times. The latest incident was unblocking both the girl and her sister. \n\nThe question is whether the author is wrong for ending the relationship. The main factors here are trust and boundaries. In a relationship, especially one as long as seven years, trust is crucial. The fianc\u00e9's actions repeatedly breach the trust the author has in him. Even though there's no evidence of actual cheating, the continuous contact and the lies about blocking her might be seen as emotional infidelity or at least a violation of agreed-upon boundaries. \n\nThe author is justified in feeling that the relationship isn't healthy if the man can't respect her wishes and keep his promises. The decision to leave could be seen as a self-preservation act, protecting her own mental health and the integrity of their relationship. \n\nHowever, some might argue that the author overreacted, but given the repeated incidents and the man's inability to follow through, it's understandable. The fact that he unblocked them again after swearing to block her is a major red flag. The author isn't wrong for seeking a relationship where mutual respect and trust are present. \n\nSo, considering all that, the answer is likely B (No).\n"
