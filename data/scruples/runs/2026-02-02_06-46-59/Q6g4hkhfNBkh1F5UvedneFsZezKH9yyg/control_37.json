During this time he began to talk to a girl that he's known for most of his life. We got back together, and I expected him to break off all contact with her. Which I thought was understandable.\n\n2 weeks in and he still has her on all social media including snapchat. We fought and fought over it and he eventually deleted her. Or so I thought.\n\nLast October, we had been growing rather distant and I took it upon myself to snoop through his phone.\n\nAnd there she is. She had blocked me on social media so that I couldn't see them following each other. He had literally liked every single one of her pictures, not any of mine during the same time period to be clear, and she liked his as well. Including a picture of his Snapchat code asking people to add him.\n\nI confront him. He becomes angry and defensive but swears hell get rid of her.\n\nAbout a month later I decide to check again. And she's still there. So I told him I was leaving him.\n\nHe left for about 3 days. And we eventually talked things through and he again swore to delete her and block her for good.\n\n3 weeks ago, I saw that he had liked pictures of the girl's sister on Instagram. He says he had remembered liking them from a long time ago and had been trying to unlike them so I would never find them and in doing so accidentally re liked the pictures, and I believed him.\n\nLast night. He has both the girl AND her sister unblocked AGAIN on social media. Meaning he went out of his way to go through his settings, get to privacy, open his list of blocked users and unblocked those two in particular.\n\nWIBTA for ending a 7 year relationship with the father of my son because he can't seem to let go of some other girl? Even though the only thing I really have evidence of is them staying in contact, not actually cheating?\n\nI'm at a complete loss.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story (the author) is in the wrong for leaving her fianc\u00e9 after seven years. The situation is complicated, so I need to break it down.\n\nFirst, the couple has a 6-year-old son and been engaged for seven years. They broke up once before for a month, and during that time, the fianc\u00e9 started talking to a girl he's known for most of his life. After they got back together, the author expected him to cut contact with her, which she thought was reasonable. But he didn't delete her from social media immediately, and then later there were repeated instances of contact. The author snooped and found that he was liking the girl's pictures while not liking hers. Then she confronted him, he promised to delete her, but she found him still having her on social media again. He left for three days, came back, promised again, and then again, three weeks ago, he liked the girl's sister's pictures. Now, he unblocked both the girl and her sister.\n\nThe key here is whether the author is in the wrong for leaving. The question is about whether she's at fault, even though there's no evidence of actual cheating, just ongoing contact with another person. \n\nFrom the description, the author's main issue is trust. The fianc\u00e9 has repeatedly broken his promises to cut off contact, which has led to the author feeling that he can't commit fully to their relationship. Even though there's no proof of cheating, the pattern of behavior suggests emotional infidelity or at least a breach of trust. The author's actions (snooping) might be seen as invasive, but given the context of repeated violations, it's understandable. \n\nIn relationships, trust is fundamental. If one partner repeatedly lies or doesn't follow through on commitments, especially regarding another person, it's reasonable for the other partner to feel betrayed. The author making the decision to leave because of this ongoing issue isn't necessarily wrong. The fianc\u00e9's inability to let go and the lack of accountability could be the real problem here. \n\nSo, considering all that, the answer is likely B (the author is not in the wrong). She's making a tough decision based on repeated breaches of trust, which is a valid reason to end a relationship, even without proof of physical cheating.\n"
