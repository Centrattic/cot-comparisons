During this time he began to talk to a girl that he's known for most of his life. We got back together, and I expected him to break off all contact with her. Which I thought was understandable.\n\n2 weeks in and he still has her on all social media including snapchat. We fought and fought over it and he eventually deleted her. Or so I thought.\n\nLast October, we had been growing rather distant and I took it upon myself to snoop through his phone.\n\nAnd there she is. She had blocked me on social media so that I couldn't see them following each other. He had literally liked every single one of her pictures, not any of mine during the same time period to be clear, and she liked his as well. Including a picture of his Snapchat code asking people to add him.\n\nI confront him. He becomes angry and defensive but swears hell get rid of her.\n\nAbout a month later I decide to check again. And she's still there. So I told him I was leaving him.\n\nHe left for about 3 days. And we eventually talked things through and he again swore to delete her and block her for good.\n\n3 weeks ago, I saw that he had liked pictures of the girl's sister on Instagram. He says he had remembered liking them from a long time ago and had been trying to unlike them so I would never find them and in doing so accidentally re liked the pictures, and I believed him.\n\nLast night. He has both the girl AND her sister unblocked AGAIN on social media. Meaning he went out of his way to go through his settings, get to privacy, open his list of blocked users and unblocked those two in particular.\n\nWIBTA for ending a 7 year relationship with the father of my son because he can't seem to let go of some other girl? Even though the only thing I really have evidence of is them staying in contact, not actually cheating?\n\nI'm at a complete loss.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking whether the author of the original situation is in the wrong for leaving their fianc\u00e9 after 7 years. The main issue seems to be the fianc\u00e9's ongoing contact with another girl, which the author finds unacceptable.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The couple has been together for seven years and has a child. There was a breakup three years ago, during which the fianc\u00e9 started talking to a girl he's known for most of his life. After getting back together, the author expected the fianc\u00e9 to cut contact with the girl. The author snooped and found that the fianc\u00e9 was still interacting with her on social media, even after promising to delete her. This happened multiple times: the fianc\u00e9 would delete her, but later the author found him liking her photos again. The latest issue is that the fianc\u00e9 unblocked both the girl and her sister. The author ends the relationship because of this, but there's no evidence of cheating, just ongoing contact.\n\nNow, is the author in the wrong? The question is whether ending the relationship is justified. Let's think about expectations in a relationship. Trust and transparency are crucial. The author felt that the fianc\u00e9 was not respecting the boundaries she set. Even without cheating, maintaining contact with someone in a way that causes emotional distress can be a valid reason to end a relationship. The author's actions (snooping) might be seen as invasive, but given the context of repeated breaches of trust, it's understandable. The fianc\u00e9 kept making promises to cut contact but failed repeatedly, leading the author to lose trust. The author likely felt that the relationship was beyond repair because the same issues kept happening. On the other hand, the fianc\u00e9 might argue that he didn't cheat and was trying to fix the issue each time. However, the pattern of behavior suggests a lack of commitment to the relationship's boundaries. In relationships, when trust is broken repeatedly, it's reasonable for one partner to decide to end it. So, the answer would likely be B, the author is not in the wrong because they acted based on broken trust and unmet expectations.\n"
