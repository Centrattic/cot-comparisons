During this time he began to talk to a girl that he's known for most of his life. We got back together, and I expected him to break off all contact with her. Which I thought was understandable.\n\n2 weeks in and he still has her on all social media including snapchat. We fought and fought over it and he eventually deleted her. Or so I thought.\n\nLast October, we had been growing rather distant and I took it upon myself to snoop through his phone.\n\nAnd there she is. She had blocked me on social media so that I couldn't see them following each other. He had literally liked every single one of her pictures, not any of mine during the same time period to be clear, and she liked his as well. Including a picture of his Snapchat code asking people to add him.\n\nI confront him. He becomes angry and defensive but swears hell get rid of her.\n\nAbout a month later I decide to check again. And she's still there. So I told him I was leaving him.\n\nHe left for about 3 days. And we eventually talked things through and he again swore to delete her and block her for good.\n\n3 weeks ago, I saw that he had liked pictures of the girl's sister on Instagram. He says he had remembered liking them from a long time ago and had been trying to unlike them so I would never find them and in doing so accidentally re liked the pictures, and I believed him.\n\nLast night. He has both the girl AND her sister unblocked AGAIN on social media. Meaning he went out of his way to go through his settings, get to privacy, open his list of blocked users and unblocked those two in particular.\n\nWIBTA for ending a 7 year relationship with the father of my son because he can't seem to let go of some other girl? Even though the only thing I really have evidence of is them staying in contact, not actually cheating?\n\nI'm at a complete loss.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the WIBTA (Would I Be Terrible for...) post is in the wrong. The situation involves a 7-year engagement, a child, and ongoing issues with the fianc\u00e9 maintaining contact with another girl despite repeated promises to cut off contact.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The fianc\u00e9 and author have been together for seven years with a child. They broke up briefly three years ago, during which the fianc\u00e9 started talking to a girl he's known for a long time. After getting back together, the author expected him to cut off contact, which he did initially but then reinstated contact multiple times. The author snooped and found evidence of ongoing communication, including liking posts, and the fianc\u00e9 kept unblocking them even after promises to stop. The author is considering leaving because of this, even though there's no proof of cheating, just ongoing contact.\n\nNow, the user thinks the author is in the wrong. I need to evaluate if the author is wrong to leave. Let's consider the dynamics here. Trust is a big part of a relationship, especially when there's a child involved. The fianc\u00e9's behavior suggests a pattern of not respecting the author's boundaries. Even if there's no physical infidelity, emotional infidelity or the breach of trust can be equally damaging. The author has tried multiple times to address this, and the fianc\u00e9 hasn't followed through on his commitments. The repeated reinstating of contact shows a lack of effort to honor the author's feelings and the trust needed in a long-term partnership.\n\nOn the other hand, some might argue that the author snooped through the phone, which could be seen as an invasion of privacy. However, given the context of the fianc\u00e9's actions and the author's concerns, the snoop might be a reaction to feeling betrayed. The main issue here is the fianc\u00e9's inability to let go of the relationship with the other girl despite promises, which is affecting the trust and stability of their own relationship.\n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong for leaving. The fianc\u00e9's actions have repeatedly broken the author's trust, and after multiple chances, he hasn't changed. The author has a right to set boundaries and protect their emotional well-being. Since the relationship involves a child, stability is crucial, and ongoing issues like this can impact the family dynamic. The fact that the author has tried to resolve this multiple times and the fianc\u00e9 hasn't followed through suggests that the author's decision to leave is justified.\n\nTherefore, I think the author is not in the wrong. The answer should be B.\n"
