During this time he began to talk to a girl that he's known for most of his life. We got back together, and I expected him to break off all contact with her. Which I thought was understandable.\n\n2 weeks in and he still has her on all social media including snapchat. We fought and fought over it and he eventually deleted her. Or so I thought.\n\nLast October, we had been growing rather distant and I took it upon myself to snoop through his phone.\n\nAnd there she is. She had blocked me on social media so that I couldn't see them following each other. He had literally liked every single one of her pictures, not any of mine during the same time period to be clear, and she liked his as well. Including a picture of his Snapchat code asking people to add him.\n\nI confront him. He becomes angry and defensive but swears hell get rid of her.\n\nAbout a month later I decide to check again. And she's still there. So I told him I was leaving him.\n\nHe left for about 3 days. And we eventually talked things through and he again swore to delete her and block her for good.\n\n3 weeks ago, I saw that he had liked pictures of the girl's sister on Instagram. He says he had remembered liking them from a long time ago and had been trying to unlike them so I would never find them and in doing so accidentally re liked the pictures, and I believed him.\n\nLast night. He has both the girl AND her sister unblocked AGAIN on social media. Meaning he went out of his way to go through his settings, get to privacy, open his list of blocked users and unblocked those two in particular.\n\nWIBTA for ending a 7 year relationship with the father of my son because he can't seem to let go of some other girl? Even though the only thing I really have evidence of is them staying in contact, not actually cheating?\n\nI'm at a complete loss.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong for leaving their fianc\u00e9 after seven years. Let me go through the details carefully.\n\nFirst, the couple has been together for seven years and has a child. They broke up briefly three years ago, during which the fianc\u00e9 started talking to a girl he's known for most of his life. After getting back together, the author expected him to cut contact with the girl. He did delete her initially, but then later, the author found out he was still following her on social media, even liking her posts while not liking the author's. There were multiple instances where the author caught him still in contact, leading to arguments. The most recent incident was unblocking the girl and her sister.\n\nThe key points here are trust and betrayal. The author felt the need to snoop because there were repeated issues with the fianc\u00e9 not cutting ties. Even though there's no evidence of cheating, the ongoing contact and deception (like hiding the likes and unblocking) likely caused significant emotional distress. The fianc\u00e9's actions showed a lack of respect for the author's feelings and boundaries. The author decided to leave due to these breaches of trust, which is understandable given the repeated nature of the issues. \n\nIn relationships, trust is fundamental. If one partner is repeatedly deceitful about their actions, especially regarding someone from their past, it can be a deal-breaker. The fact that the author tried multiple times to address the issue and the fianc\u00e9 kept failing to follow through suggests that the problem wasn't just a one-time mistake but a pattern. The author had the right to prioritize their own emotional well-being and set boundaries. \n\nHowever, some might argue that the author could have handled it differently, like giving more chances or communicating better. But given the circumstances and the repeated failures to respect the author's requests, leaving could be seen as a justified decision. The absence of actual cheating is a point, but the infidelity in terms of emotional connection and deception still counts as a significant transgression in many relationships.\n\nSo, considering all that, the answer would be B (No), the author is not in the wrong. They had valid reasons to leave due to ongoing dishonesty and disrespect, which eroded trust over time.\n"
