During this time he began to talk to a girl that he's known for most of his life. We got back together, and I expected him to break off all contact with her. Which I thought was understandable.\n\n2 weeks in and he still has her on all social media including snapchat. We fought and fought over it and he eventually deleted her. Or so I thought.\n\nLast October, we had been growing rather distant and I took it upon myself to snoop through his phone.\n\nAnd there she is. She had blocked me on social media so that I couldn't see them following each other. He had literally liked every single one of her pictures, not any of mine during the same time period to be clear, and she liked his as well. Including a picture of his Snapchat code asking people to add him.\n\nI confront him. He becomes angry and defensive but swears hell get rid of her.\n\nAbout a month later I decide to check again. And she's still there. So I told him I was leaving him.\n\nHe left for about 3 days. And we eventually talked things through and he again swore to delete her and block her for good.\n\n3 weeks ago, I saw that he had liked pictures of the girl's sister on Instagram. He says he had remembered liking them from a long time ago and had been trying to unlike them so I would never find them and in doing so accidentally re liked the pictures, and I believed him.\n\nLast night. He has both the girl AND her sister unblocked AGAIN on social media. Meaning he went out of his way to go through his settings, get to privacy, open his list of blocked users and unblocked those two in particular.\n\nWIBTA for ending a 7 year relationship with the father of my son because he can't seem to let go of some other girl? Even though the only thing I really have evidence of is them staying in contact, not actually cheating?\n\nI'm at a complete loss.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The person is asking if the author of the WIBTA (Would I Be Terrible for Apologizing) post is in the wrong for leaving her fianc\u00e9 after 7 years. They have a child together. The main issue seems to be that the fianc\u00e9 kept maintaining contact with an ex-friend, liking her pictures, and even unblocking her again after promises to delete her. The author found out through snooping and ended up leaving because she couldn't trust him anymore.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The author's perspective is that she expected him to cut ties with the girl after they got back together. The repeated issues with him not deleting her, even after promises, led to her losing trust. On the other hand, the fianc\u00e9 claims he was trying to unlike the posts and accidentally re-liked them, and now unblocked them. He might argue that he didn't cheat, just kept contact with a friend.\n\nTrust is crucial in a relationship, especially in a long-term one. If someone is making promises they don't keep, especially regarding someone else they've known for a long time, that can erode trust. The author might feel that his actions, even if not cheating, show a lack of respect and commitment. The fact that he went out of his way to unblock them again could be seen as a deliberate choice to maintain that connection, which the author finds unacceptable.\n\nBut then, is she in the wrong for snooping? If she didn't confront him first and instead snoop, that could be an issue. Some might argue that trust should be there without needing to check his phone. However, after repeated breaches of trust, her actions might be seen as a last resort before making a decision.\n\nThe question is whether she is in the wrong. If the answer is A (Yes), it would mean she shouldn't have left given that there's no evidence of cheating. If B (No), it would mean her decision is justified because trust was broken through his actions.\n\nConsidering that the fianc\u00e9 didn't cheat but kept the contact despite promises, different people might view this differently. Some might say that the author overreacted, while others would support her decision to leave due to the lack of trust. The key here is that the author felt betrayed by his actions, even if there's no physical infidelity. Emotional infidelity can be a valid reason for breaking up, depending on the couple's boundaries.\n\nIn conclusion, I think the answer is B (No), the author is not in the wrong. She made a tough decision based on her fianc\u00e9's repeated actions that broke trust, even though they didn't involve cheating. Her right to leave because she can't be with someone who keeps those connections despite promises is valid.\n"
