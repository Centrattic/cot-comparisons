During this time he began to talk to a girl that he's known for most of his life. We got back together, and I expected him to break off all contact with her. Which I thought was understandable.\n\n2 weeks in and he still has her on all social media including snapchat. We fought and fought over it and he eventually deleted her. Or so I thought.\n\nLast October, we had been growing rather distant and I took it upon myself to snoop through his phone.\n\nAnd there she is. She had blocked me on social media so that I couldn't see them following each other. He had literally liked every single one of her pictures, not any of mine during the same time period to be clear, and she liked his as well. Including a picture of his Snapchat code asking people to add him.\n\nI confront him. He becomes angry and defensive but swears hell get rid of her.\n\nAbout a month later I decide to check again. And she's still there. So I told him I was leaving him.\n\nHe left for about 3 days. And we eventually talked things through and he again swore to delete her and block her for good.\n\n3 weeks ago, I saw that he had liked pictures of the girl's sister on Instagram. He says he had remembered liking them from a long time ago and had been trying to unlike them so I would never find them and in doing so accidentally re liked the pictures, and I believed him.\n\nLast night. He has both the girl AND her sister unblocked AGAIN on social media. Meaning he went out of his way to go through his settings, get to privacy, open his list of blocked users and unblocked those two in particular.\n\nWIBTA for ending a 7 year relationship with the father of my son because he can't seem to let go of some other girl? Even though the only thing I really have evidence of is them staying in contact, not actually cheating?\n\nI'm at a complete loss.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person in the WIBTA scenario is in the wrong for leaving their fianc\u00e9 after 7 years because he kept staying in contact with a girl they don't like. The main points are that the fianc\u00e9 had been in contact with a girl they've known for a long time, even after promises to cut off contact. The author snoop-checked his phone and found likes on her and her sister's posts, and now the fianc\u00e9 unblocked them again.\n\nHmm, so the question is whether the author is wrong to leave. Let me break it down. First, the relationship is long-term, with a child together. The fianc\u00e9 made promises to delete or block the girl, but kept reverting back. The author feels betrayed and can't trust him anymore. Even though there's no actual cheating, the continuous contact is a major issue for the author. \n\nIn relationships, trust is crucial. If someone keeps breaking promises about limiting contact with an ex or a problematic person, that's a red flag. The author tried multiple times to address it, and the fianc\u00e9 didn't follow through. The author's decision to leave is based on the accumulation of these broken promises, even if there's no concrete proof of infidelity. \n\nFrom a moral standpoint, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong because they're prioritizing their own emotional well-being and the trust needed in a marriage. Relationships require mutual respect and boundaries. If one partner can't honor those boundaries despite repeated chances, it's a valid reason to end things, especially when considering the future with a child. \n\nOn the other hand, some might argue that the author snooped, which could be seen as a breach of privacy. But given the context of the fianc\u00e9 not keeping his promises, the author might have felt it was necessary to check. The main issue here is the fianc\u00e9's actions, not the author's initial snooping. \n\nSo, putting it all together, the author isn't in the wrong for leaving because the fianc\u00e9 repeatedly violated trust, leading to the loss of confidence in the relationship. The answer should be B.\n"
