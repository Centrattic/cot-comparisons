During this time he began to talk to a girl that he's known for most of his life. We got back together, and I expected him to break off all contact with her. Which I thought was understandable.\n\n2 weeks in and he still has her on all social media including snapchat. We fought and fought over it and he eventually deleted her. Or so I thought.\n\nLast October, we had been growing rather distant and I took it upon myself to snoop through his phone.\n\nAnd there she is. She had blocked me on social media so that I couldn't see them following each other. He had literally liked every single one of her pictures, not any of mine during the same time period to be clear, and she liked his as well. Including a picture of his Snapchat code asking people to add him.\n\nI confront him. He becomes angry and defensive but swears hell get rid of her.\n\nAbout a month later I decide to check again. And she's still there. So I told him I was leaving him.\n\nHe left for about 3 days. And we eventually talked things through and he again swore to delete her and block her for good.\n\n3 weeks ago, I saw that he had liked pictures of the girl's sister on Instagram. He says he had remembered liking them from a long time ago and had been trying to unlike them so I would never find them and in doing so accidentally re liked the pictures, and I believed him.\n\nLast night. He has both the girl AND her sister unblocked AGAIN on social media. Meaning he went out of his way to go through his settings, get to privacy, open his list of blocked users and unblocked those two in particular.\n\nWIBTA for ending a 7 year relationship with the father of my son because he can't seem to let go of some other girl? Even though the only thing I really have evidence of is them staying in contact, not actually cheating?\n\nI'm at a complete loss.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of this WIBTA (Would I Be Terrible for...) post is in the wrong for leaving her fianc\u00e9 after 7 years because he can't cut off contact with another girl, even though there's no evidence of cheating. \n\nFirst, I need to break down the situation. The couple has been together for 7 years with a child. They had a breakup for a month, and during that time, he started talking to a girl he's known for a long time. After getting back together, she expected him to cut all contact. Initially, he did delete her, but later she found out he was still connected on social media, even liking her posts while ignoring hers. They had arguments, he promised to delete her, but she kept finding him connected again. The latest was him unblocking both the girl and her sister.\n\nNow, the key points here are about trust, boundaries, and repeated violations. The author felt betrayed because even after multiple promises, he kept reconnecting. The fianc\u00e9 claims he's trying to unlike posts or made mistakes, but the pattern is clear. Even without cheating, maintaining contact with an ex can be a dealbreaker for some, especially if the person is not respecting the other's feelings and boundaries. \n\nThe author's perspective is that the relationship has been damaged by his inability to cut ties, leading to her decision to leave. The fianc\u00e9's actions seem to be a pattern of dishonesty and broken promises, which can erode trust. In relationships, trust and mutual respect are crucial. If one partner repeatedly violates the other's boundaries despite promises, it's understandable that the hurt partner would feel the need to end the relationship to protect their self-worth and emotional health.\n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong. Since there's no evidence of cheating, but there's emotional betrayal through the maintenance of contact and deceit, it's a matter of perspective. However, the author's decision stems from feeling disrespected and the lack of change in his behavior. In such cases, even without physical infidelity, emotional infidelity can be a valid reason to end a relationship. Therefore, the author isn't in the wrong for leaving. The answer would be B (No).\n"
