During this time he began to talk to a girl that he's known for most of his life. We got back together, and I expected him to break off all contact with her. Which I thought was understandable.\n\n2 weeks in and he still has her on all social media including snapchat. We fought and fought over it and he eventually deleted her. Or so I thought.\n\nLast October, we had been growing rather distant and I took it upon myself to snoop through his phone.\n\nAnd there she is. She had blocked me on social media so that I couldn't see them following each other. He had literally liked every single one of her pictures, not any of mine during the same time period to be clear, and she liked his as well. Including a picture of his Snapchat code asking people to add him.\n\nI confront him. He becomes angry and defensive but swears hell get rid of her.\n\nAbout a month later I decide to check again. And she's still there. So I told him I was leaving him.\n\nHe left for about 3 days. And we eventually talked things through and he again swore to delete her and block her for good.\n\n3 weeks ago, I saw that he had liked pictures of the girl's sister on Instagram. He says he had remembered liking them from a long time ago and had been trying to unlike them so I would never find them and in doing so accidentally re liked the pictures, and I believed him.\n\nLast night. He has both the girl AND her sister unblocked AGAIN on social media. Meaning he went out of his way to go through his settings, get to privacy, open his list of blocked users and unblocked those two in particular.\n\nWIBTA for ending a 7 year relationship with the father of my son because he can't seem to let go of some other girl? Even though the only thing I really have evidence of is them staying in contact, not actually cheating?\n\nI'm at a complete loss.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of this scenario is in the wrong. The situation is about a 7-year engagement ending because of ongoing issues with the fianc\u00e9 not cutting off contact with an ex-girlfriend. The author found out through snooping that the fianc\u00e9 was still following her on social media, liking her pictures, etc., even after promises to stop. The key here is that there's no evidence of actual cheating, just ongoing contact despite promises.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics of the relationship. They have a child together, which adds complexity. The author took the step of snooping, which isn't ideal, but it's understandable given the circumstances and the trust issues. The fianc\u00e9 made multiple promises to end contact but didn't follow through, leading to the author's decision to break things off.\n\nIn relationships, trust is crucial. The author felt that the fianc\u00e9 couldn't move on from this other girl, which is a valid concern. Even if there's no physical infidelity, emotional unavailability or persistent contact with an ex can be damaging. The fianc\u00e9's actions show a pattern of not respecting the author's boundaries, which could justify the author's decision to end the relationship.\n\nOn the other hand, the fianc\u00e9 might argue that the contact isn't cheating and that the author is overreacting. But given the repeated broken promises and the author's reasonable concern for their relationship's health, ending it could be seen as necessary. The author isn't in the wrong for prioritizing their emotional well-being and the stability of their family, especially with a child involved.\n\nSo, considering all factors, the answer should be B (not in the wrong). The author's decision is a valid response to ongoing betrayal of trust and lack of commitment from the fianc\u00e9.\n"
