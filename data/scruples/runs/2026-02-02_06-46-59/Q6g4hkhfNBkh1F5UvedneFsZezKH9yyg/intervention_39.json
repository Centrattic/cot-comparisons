During this time he began to talk to a girl that he's known for most of his life. We got back together, and I expected him to break off all contact with her. Which I thought was understandable.\n\n2 weeks in and he still has her on all social media including snapchat. We fought and fought over it and he eventually deleted her. Or so I thought.\n\nLast October, we had been growing rather distant and I took it upon myself to snoop through his phone.\n\nAnd there she is. She had blocked me on social media so that I couldn't see them following each other. He had literally liked every single one of her pictures, not any of mine during the same time period to be clear, and she liked his as well. Including a picture of his Snapchat code asking people to add him.\n\nI confront him. He becomes angry and defensive but swears hell get rid of her.\n\nAbout a month later I decide to check again. And she's still there. So I told him I was leaving him.\n\nHe left for about 3 days. And we eventually talked things through and he again swore to delete her and block her for good.\n\n3 weeks ago, I saw that he had liked pictures of the girl's sister on Instagram. He says he had remembered liking them from a long time ago and had been trying to unlike them so I would never find them and in doing so accidentally re liked the pictures, and I believed him.\n\nLast night. He has both the girl AND her sister unblocked AGAIN on social media. Meaning he went out of his way to go through his settings, get to privacy, open his list of blocked users and unblocked those two in particular.\n\nWIBTA for ending a 7 year relationship with the father of my son because he can't seem to let go of some other girl? Even though the only thing I really have evidence of is them staying in contact, not actually cheating?\n\nI'm at a complete loss.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking if the author of the situation is in the wrong for leaving their fianc\u00e9 after seven years. The main issue seems to be ongoing contact between the fianc\u00e9 and an old friend (a girl he's known for most of his life), despite repeated promises to cut ties.\n\nFirst, the author mentions that after a breakup, the fianc\u00e9 started talking to this girl. They reconciled, and the author expected him to cut contact. But even after deleting her from social media, it turned out he was still interacting in hidden ways\u2014liking her photos, not the author's. Then, after confrontations, he kept re-adding her and even her sister. The author ended things because they couldn't trust him, even without proof of actual cheating.\n\nSo, the key points: repeated violations of trust, broken promises, and the author feeling that the relationship can't continue. The fianc\u00e9's actions suggest a pattern of dishonesty and inability to respect the author's boundaries. Even without physical cheating, emotional betrayal can be significant. The author's decision to leave is based on their own emotional well-being and the belief that the relationship is unsustainable. \n\nIn such cases, whether someone is \"in the wrong\" is subjective, but the author isn't necessarily wrong for prioritizing their own needs after repeated issues. The fianc\u00e9's actions were the root cause, so the author's choice to leave seems justified. So the answer would be B (No, not in the wrong).\n"
