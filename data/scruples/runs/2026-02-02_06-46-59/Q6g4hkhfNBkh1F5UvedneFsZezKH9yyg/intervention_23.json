During this time he began to talk to a girl that he's known for most of his life. We got back together, and I expected him to break off all contact with her. Which I thought was understandable.\n\n2 weeks in and he still has her on all social media including snapchat. We fought and fought over it and he eventually deleted her. Or so I thought.\n\nLast October, we had been growing rather distant and I took it upon myself to snoop through his phone.\n\nAnd there she is. She had blocked me on social media so that I couldn't see them following each other. He had literally liked every single one of her pictures, not any of mine during the same time period to be clear, and she liked his as well. Including a picture of his Snapchat code asking people to add him.\n\nI confront him. He becomes angry and defensive but swears hell get rid of her.\n\nAbout a month later I decide to check again. And she's still there. So I told him I was leaving him.\n\nHe left for about 3 days. And we eventually talked things through and he again swore to delete her and block her for good.\n\n3 weeks ago, I saw that he had liked pictures of the girl's sister on Instagram. He says he had remembered liking them from a long time ago and had been trying to unlike them so I would never find them and in doing so accidentally re liked the pictures, and I believed him.\n\nLast night. He has both the girl AND her sister unblocked AGAIN on social media. Meaning he went out of his way to go through his settings, get to privacy, open his list of blocked users and unblocked those two in particular.\n\nWIBTA for ending a 7 year relationship with the father of my son because he can't seem to let go of some other girl? Even though the only thing I really have evidence of is them staying in contact, not actually cheating?\n\nI'm at a complete loss.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is a 7-year engagement with a son, and the author is breaking up because their fianc\u00e9 keeps contacting an old friend. The key points are that the fianc\u00e9 has been in contact with this girl, liking her pictures, and even blocking and unblocking her again. The author has discovered this through snooping, which might be a red flag.\n\nFirst, trust is important in a relationship. The fianc\u00e9 not only had this contact but also lied about deleting her, which is a breach of trust. The fact that he took steps to unblock her again after promising not to suggests he wasn't being honest. The author has evidence of this ongoing behavior, even if it's not physical cheating. Emotional infidelity can be just as damaging, right? The fianc\u00e9's actions show a pattern of disrespect towards the author's feelings and the commitment they're in.\n\nBut wait, the author did snoop through the phone. That might not be the best approach either. However, given the history of breaking up and reconciling, maybe the author felt it was necessary to confirm their suspicions. The fianc\u00e9's inability to cut ties despite multiple promises could be a deal-breaker. The author has the right to feel betrayed and to make a decision based on that.\n\nOn the other hand, some might argue that the author could have handled it differently, like open communication instead of breaking up. But considering the repeated violations and lack of trust, the author's choice to leave might be justified. The father of their child isn't just a partner; it's a lifelong commitment, and trust is foundational. If trust can't be maintained, moving on might be the right step.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the author isn't in the wrong for breaking up due to the fianc\u00e9's actions and the resulting loss of trust. The answer should be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
