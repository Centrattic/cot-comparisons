During this time he began to talk to a girl that he's known for most of his life. We got back together, and I expected him to break off all contact with her. Which I thought was understandable.\n\n2 weeks in and he still has her on all social media including snapchat. We fought and fought over it and he eventually deleted her. Or so I thought.\n\nLast October, we had been growing rather distant and I took it upon myself to snoop through his phone.\n\nAnd there she is. She had blocked me on social media so that I couldn't see them following each other. He had literally liked every single one of her pictures, not any of mine during the same time period to be clear, and she liked his as well. Including a picture of his Snapchat code asking people to add him.\n\nI confront him. He becomes angry and defensive but swears hell get rid of her.\n\nAbout a month later I decide to check again. And she's still there. So I told him I was leaving him.\n\nHe left for about 3 days. And we eventually talked things through and he again swore to delete her and block her for good.\n\n3 weeks ago, I saw that he had liked pictures of the girl's sister on Instagram. He says he had remembered liking them from a long time ago and had been trying to unlike them so I would never find them and in doing so accidentally re liked the pictures, and I believed him.\n\nLast night. He has both the girl AND her sister unblocked AGAIN on social media. Meaning he went out of his way to go through his settings, get to privacy, open his list of blocked users and unblocked those two in particular.\n\nWIBTA for ending a 7 year relationship with the father of my son because he can't seem to let go of some other girl? Even though the only thing I really have evidence of is them staying in contact, not actually cheating?\n\nI'm at a complete loss.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the WIBTA (Would I Be Termed a [term]) post is in the wrong for leaving her fianc\u00e9 after 7 years. They have a son together, and the main issue is his continued contact with a girl he's known a long time.\n\nSo, the breakup happened three years ago for a month. During that time, he talked to this girl. They reconciled, and the author expected him to cut off contact. He deleted her from social media, but that was only after a fight. Then, last October, the author snooped and found him liking her photos again. She blocked the girl to not see them, but he ended up not deleting her completely. After confronting him, he said he'd get rid of her. Then a month later, she checked again and they were still there. She told him she was leaving, he left for three days, then they talked, and he promised to delete her again. Now, three weeks later, the author found he unblocked both the girl and her sister again. The question is whether the author is in the wrong for ending the relationship over this, even without proof of cheating just ongoing contact.\n\nThe user initially thinks the author is in the wrong but wants to know the other perspective. Let me break this down. The key points are the ongoing contact despite promises to stop, the author's actions of snooping, and the fact that no actual cheating has occurred. \n\nFirst, trust is a big factor here. The author's fianc\u00e9 hasn't kept his promises to cut off contact, which can erode trust. Even if he's not cheating, the continued interaction might be a violation of the boundaries they set after getting back together. The author feels betrayed because he's not following through, which is understandable. \n\nOn the other hand, the fianc\u00e9 claims he's trying to unlike the photos but accidently re-liked them. The author snooped through his phone, which is a privacy issue. Even though he had a long-standing relationship, invading privacy can be a sensitive topic. The author might have acted on her mistrust, which led to her checking again. \n\nBut the main issue is that the fianc\u00e9 keeps breaking the agreement to stop contact. If someone repeatedly violates your trust, even without physical infidelity, it can be a deal-breaker. The author is taking a stand for her own peace of mind and the integrity of their relationship. \n\nSo, the answer depends on whether maintaining contact with an ex is a deal-breaker. The fianc\u00e9's actions suggest he's not fully committed to moving on, which can cause long-term issues. The author isn't accusing him of cheating but of not respecting the agreed-upon boundaries. Given that, the author might not be in the wrong. However, snooping is ethically questionable. But in the context of the situation and repeated breaches of trust, maybe the answer is B.\n"
