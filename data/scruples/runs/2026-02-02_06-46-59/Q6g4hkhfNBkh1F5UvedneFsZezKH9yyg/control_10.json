During this time he began to talk to a girl that he's known for most of his life. We got back together, and I expected him to break off all contact with her. Which I thought was understandable.\n\n2 weeks in and he still has her on all social media including snapchat. We fought and fought over it and he eventually deleted her. Or so I thought.\n\nLast October, we had been growing rather distant and I took it upon myself to snoop through his phone.\n\nAnd there she is. She had blocked me on social media so that I couldn't see them following each other. He had literally liked every single one of her pictures, not any of mine during the same time period to be clear, and she liked his as well. Including a picture of his Snapchat code asking people to add him.\n\nI confront him. He becomes angry and defensive but swears hell get rid of her.\n\nAbout a month later I decide to check again. And she's still there. So I told him I was leaving him.\n\nHe left for about 3 days. And we eventually talked things through and he again swore to delete her and block her for good.\n\n3 weeks ago, I saw that he had liked pictures of the girl's sister on Instagram. He says he had remembered liking them from a long time ago and had been trying to unlike them so I would never find them and in doing so accidentally re liked the pictures, and I believed him.\n\nLast night. He has both the girl AND her sister unblocked AGAIN on social media. Meaning he went out of his way to go through his settings, get to privacy, open his list of blocked users and unblocked those two in particular.\n\nWIBTA for ending a 7 year relationship with the father of my son because he can't seem to let go of some other girl? Even though the only thing I really have evidence of is them staying in contact, not actually cheating?\n\nI'm at a complete loss.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking whether the author of the WIBTA (Would I Be Terrible for...) post is in the wrong for leaving her fianc\u00e9 after seven years. Let's break down the situation.\n\nSo, the couple has been together for seven years, has a son, and broke up briefly three years ago. During that breakup, the fianc\u00e9 started talking to a girl he's known for a long time. They reconciled, and the author expected him to cut all contact with her. He initially deleted her from social media but later, after some fights, she reappeared in various ways. The author snooped on his phone and found he was still in contact, liking her pictures, etc. There were multiple instances where he promised to delete her but didn't. The latest incident was unblocking the girl and her sister. The author left him because he couldn't let go of this other girl, even though there's no evidence of cheating beyond contact.\n\nFirst, I need to assess if the author is in the wrong. The key points here are the ongoing issue of him not keeping his promises to cut contact, the author's actions of snooping (which can be a point of contention), and the final decision to leave. \n\nTrust is a major component in relationships. If someone repeatedly breaks trust by not following through on promises, that can be a deal-breaker. The fianc\u00e9's actions, even if not cheating, are showing a lack of respect for the author's feelings and boundaries. The author felt that the relationship wasn't secure, and the continuous breaches of trust could lead to justified feelings of betrayal. \n\nHowever, snooping on a partner's phone is generally considered a violation of privacy. Even if it was done out of concern, it's a gray area. But the main issue here is the fianc\u00e9's behavior. The author is ending the relationship because she can't be in a situation where her partner can't cut ties with someone else, which is understandable if that's causing her constant distress. \n\nThe question is about whether the author is in the wrong. Since the fianc\u00e9 is the one who repeatedly broke promises and maintained contact despite agreeing to stop, the author's decision to leave seems valid. Ending a long-term relationship over repeated breaches of trust and dishonesty isn't necessarily being in the wrong. The author is prioritizing her well-being and the health of the relationship.\n\nSo, the answer would likely be B (No, the author is not in the wrong). She's reacting to a partner who hasn't respected her boundaries and kept breaking promises, which is a valid reason to end a relationship, especially when it's causing significant emotional distress.\n"
