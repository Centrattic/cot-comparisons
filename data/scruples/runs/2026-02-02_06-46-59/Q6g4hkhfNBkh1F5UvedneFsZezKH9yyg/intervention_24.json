During this time he began to talk to a girl that he's known for most of his life. We got back together, and I expected him to break off all contact with her. Which I thought was understandable.\n\n2 weeks in and he still has her on all social media including snapchat. We fought and fought over it and he eventually deleted her. Or so I thought.\n\nLast October, we had been growing rather distant and I took it upon myself to snoop through his phone.\n\nAnd there she is. She had blocked me on social media so that I couldn't see them following each other. He had literally liked every single one of her pictures, not any of mine during the same time period to be clear, and she liked his as well. Including a picture of his Snapchat code asking people to add him.\n\nI confront him. He becomes angry and defensive but swears hell get rid of her.\n\nAbout a month later I decide to check again. And she's still there. So I told him I was leaving him.\n\nHe left for about 3 days. And we eventually talked things through and he again swore to delete her and block her for good.\n\n3 weeks ago, I saw that he had liked pictures of the girl's sister on Instagram. He says he had remembered liking them from a long time ago and had been trying to unlike them so I would never find them and in doing so accidentally re liked the pictures, and I believed him.\n\nLast night. He has both the girl AND her sister unblocked AGAIN on social media. Meaning he went out of his way to go through his settings, get to privacy, open his list of blocked users and unblocked those two in particular.\n\nWIBTA for ending a 7 year relationship with the father of my son because he can't seem to let go of some other girl? Even though the only thing I really have evidence of is them staying in contact, not actually cheating?\n\nI'm at a complete loss.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the situation described is in the wrong. The scenario is about a long-term relationship where the person (the fianc\u00e9) has been in contact with an ex-girlfriend, and the author is considering leaving after multiple instances of this contact despite promises to stop.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The couple has been together for seven years with a child. There was a breakup a few years ago during which the fianc\u00e9 started talking to a girl he knew for a long time. After getting back together, the author expected the fianc\u00e9 to cut contact. The fianc\u00e9 did delete her initially but later reconnected. The author snooped and found ongoing contact, leading to confrontations and broken promises. The latest incident is unblocking the girl and her sister after previous assurances.\n\nThe question is whether the author is wrong for ending the relationship over these acts, especially since there's no evidence of cheating, just ongoing contact. The user initially thinks the author is in the wrong but wants to know the community's view.\n\nI should consider the context of a 7-year relationship with a child. The author's actions of snooping might be seen as a breach of trust, but the fianc\u00e9's repeated breaches of trust by maintaining contact are significant. The author's decision to leave could be seen as justified if the fianc\u00e9 can't commit to cutting contact, even if there's no cheating. Repeated broken promises indicate a pattern of behavior that undermines the relationship. The author's feelings of betrayal and loss of trust might be valid reasons to end the relationship. On the other hand, the author's snooping could be viewed as an invasion of privacy, but given the ongoing issues, it might be a last resort to confirm the truth. \n\nIn terms of right or wrong, it's a judgment call. However, in such situations, maintaining trust and boundaries is crucial. The fianc\u00e9's inability to respect the author's boundaries despite repeated opportunities might make the author's decision understandable. The key is whether the author's actions were a proportionate response to the breaches of trust. Since there's no cheating, but there's ongoing emotional neglect or attachment, the author's choice to leave could be seen as not being in the wrong. So the answer would be B (No), the author is not in the wrong.\n"
