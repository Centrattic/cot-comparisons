During this time he began to talk to a girl that he's known for most of his life. We got back together, and I expected him to break off all contact with her. Which I thought was understandable.\n\n2 weeks in and he still has her on all social media including snapchat. We fought and fought over it and he eventually deleted her. Or so I thought.\n\nLast October, we had been growing rather distant and I took it upon myself to snoop through his phone.\n\nAnd there she is. She had blocked me on social media so that I couldn't see them following each other. He had literally liked every single one of her pictures, not any of mine during the same time period to be clear, and she liked his as well. Including a picture of his Snapchat code asking people to add him.\n\nI confront him. He becomes angry and defensive but swears hell get rid of her.\n\nAbout a month later I decide to check again. And she's still there. So I told him I was leaving him.\n\nHe left for about 3 days. And we eventually talked things through and he again swore to delete her and block her for good.\n\n3 weeks ago, I saw that he had liked pictures of the girl's sister on Instagram. He says he had remembered liking them from a long time ago and had been trying to unlike them so I would never find them and in doing so accidentally re liked the pictures, and I believed him.\n\nLast night. He has both the girl AND her sister unblocked AGAIN on social media. Meaning he went out of his way to go through his settings, get to privacy, open his list of blocked users and unblocked those two in particular.\n\nWIBTA for ending a 7 year relationship with the father of my son because he can't seem to let go of some other girl? Even though the only thing I really have evidence of is them staying in contact, not actually cheating?\n\nI'm at a complete loss.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author of the situation is in the wrong for leaving her fianc\u00e9 after 7 years. The key points are that the fianc\u00e9 has been in contact with another girl over several years, even after promises to cut off contact. The author found evidence of ongoing interactions, like liking each other's photos on social media, and eventually decided to leave.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The relationship is long-term, with a child involved. Trust is a big issue here. The fianc\u00e9 broke up for a month and during that time connected with the girl. After reconciliation, the author expected full disconnection, which is reasonable. The fact that the fianc\u00e9 kept the girl on social media and engaged with her posts, even after promises to delete her, shows a pattern of dishonesty and broken trust. \n\nThe author snooped through the phone, which might be a red flag, but given the circumstances, it's understandable if she felt the need to check. The repeated violations of trust suggest that the fianc\u00e9 isn't respecting her boundaries. The final straw was unblocking both the girl and her sister, which was intentional according to the description. \n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong. The user initially thought she was, but I need to evaluate. The fianc\u00e9's actions are the root cause here. The author is leaving because of ongoing infidelity-like behavior without actual cheating. Trust is a cornerstone of a relationship, and if it's broken repeatedly, leaving is a valid decision. The author isn't at fault for prioritizing her own well-being and the future of their son, even if there's no physical cheating. \n\nSo, the answer would be B (the author is not in the wrong) because the fianc\u00e9's actions have repeatedly broken trust, and the author is justified in ending the relationship to protect herself and her son.\n"
