During this time he began to talk to a girl that he's known for most of his life. We got back together, and I expected him to break off all contact with her. Which I thought was understandable.\n\n2 weeks in and he still has her on all social media including snapchat. We fought and fought over it and he eventually deleted her. Or so I thought.\n\nLast October, we had been growing rather distant and I took it upon myself to snoop through his phone.\n\nAnd there she is. She had blocked me on social media so that I couldn't see them following each other. He had literally liked every single one of her pictures, not any of mine during the same time period to be clear, and she liked his as well. Including a picture of his Snapchat code asking people to add him.\n\nI confront him. He becomes angry and defensive but swears hell get rid of her.\n\nAbout a month later I decide to check again. And she's still there. So I told him I was leaving him.\n\nHe left for about 3 days. And we eventually talked things through and he again swore to delete her and block her for good.\n\n3 weeks ago, I saw that he had liked pictures of the girl's sister on Instagram. He says he had remembered liking them from a long time ago and had been trying to unlike them so I would never find them and in doing so accidentally re liked the pictures, and I believed him.\n\nLast night. He has both the girl AND her sister unblocked AGAIN on social media. Meaning he went out of his way to go through his settings, get to privacy, open his list of blocked users and unblocked those two in particular.\n\nWIBTA for ending a 7 year relationship with the father of my son because he can't seem to let go of some other girl? Even though the only thing I really have evidence of is them staying in contact, not actually cheating?\n\nI'm at a complete loss.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about a 7-year relationship with a fianc\u00e9 and a child. The main issue seems to be about the fianc\u00e9's contact with another girl he's known for a long time. The author found out through snooping that he continued to interact with her on social media even after promising to cut off contact. There were multiple instances where he didn't delete her, and the author ended up leaving because of this.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The fianc\u00e9 had a history of contacting the girl during a breakup, then after getting back together, he promised to delete her but didn't. The author checked his phone and found ongoing likes and interactions. The fianc\u00e9 claims he didn't mean to re-like the pictures of the sister and even blocked them again but later unblocked. The author left because of the ongoing issue, even without proof of actual cheating.\n\nNow, is the author in the wrong? Well, in a relationship, trust and communication are crucial. The fianc\u00e9's actions\u2014continuously maintaining contact despite promises to stop\u2014could be seen as disrespectful and a breach of trust. The author tried multiple times to address this, with the fianc\u00e9 not following through. The fact that the fianc\u00e9 went out of his way to unblock them again might indicate he's not taking the issue seriously, which could justify the author's decision to leave.\n\nOn the other hand, some might argue that the author snooped through the phone, which isn't the healthiest way to handle the situation. However, given the context of repeated issues and broken promises, the author might feel justified in checking. The main issue here isn't cheating but maintaining contact against the partner's wishes, which can still be a significant problem in a relationship.\n\nThe author is ending a long-term relationship because of consistent disrespect towards their boundaries. Even without proof of infidelity, the ongoing contact could be a deal-breaker. So, it's more about broken trust and not honoring commitments. The author's actions are a response to repeated failures from the fianc\u00e9 to address the issue. Therefore, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong.\n"
