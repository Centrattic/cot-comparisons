During this time he began to talk to a girl that he's known for most of his life. We got back together, and I expected him to break off all contact with her. Which I thought was understandable.\n\n2 weeks in and he still has her on all social media including snapchat. We fought and fought over it and he eventually deleted her. Or so I thought.\n\nLast October, we had been growing rather distant and I took it upon myself to snoop through his phone.\n\nAnd there she is. She had blocked me on social media so that I couldn't see them following each other. He had literally liked every single one of her pictures, not any of mine during the same time period to be clear, and she liked his as well. Including a picture of his Snapchat code asking people to add him.\n\nI confront him. He becomes angry and defensive but swears hell get rid of her.\n\nAbout a month later I decide to check again. And she's still there. So I told him I was leaving him.\n\nHe left for about 3 days. And we eventually talked things through and he again swore to delete her and block her for good.\n\n3 weeks ago, I saw that he had liked pictures of the girl's sister on Instagram. He says he had remembered liking them from a long time ago and had been trying to unlike them so I would never find them and in doing so accidentally re liked the pictures, and I believed him.\n\nLast night. He has both the girl AND her sister unblocked AGAIN on social media. Meaning he went out of his way to go through his settings, get to privacy, open his list of blocked users and unblocked those two in particular.\n\nWIBTA for ending a 7 year relationship with the father of my son because he can't seem to let go of some other girl? Even though the only thing I really have evidence of is them staying in contact, not actually cheating?\n\nI'm at a complete loss.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the author of the scenario is in the wrong for breaking up with her fianc\u00e9 after a seven-year relationship. The main issue seems to be about ongoing contact between the fianc\u00e9 and another girl, even after multiple promises to cut ties.\n\nFirst, I need to look at the details. The couple has a child together. They broke up briefly, then got back together. The fianc\u00e9 was in contact with a girl he knew for a long time. The author asked him to cut contact, which he initially did but then continued secretly. The author found out through snooping, which is a bit iffy, but maybe understandable given the circumstances. The fianc\u00e9 kept liking her pictures, even after being asked to stop, and later even unblocked her again. The user's question is whether the author is in the wrong for leaving.\n\nI should consider both sides. On one hand, the author is concerned about trust and fidelity. Even if there's no actual cheating, maintaining contact with someone in a way that's disrespectful to the partner can erode trust. The fact that the fianc\u00e9 kept going back on his promises is a red flag. On the other hand, the author snooped through his phone, which can be seen as a breach of privacy. However, given that they're engaged and have a child, some might understand her actions.\n\nAnother angle is the definition of cheating. Some people consider emotional infidelity as a form of cheating, even without physical contact. If the fianc\u00e9 is intentionally keeping her in his social media, liking her posts, and unblocking her despite promises, that could be seen as emotionally cheating. However, others might argue that unless there's explicit cheating, breaking up might be too harsh.\n\nAlso, the author has made multiple attempts to address the issue, giving her fianc\u00e9 chances to correct his behavior. Each time he failed to follow through, which could justify her decision. The fact that he went out of his way to unblock her recently shows a pattern of deceit. \n\nBut what about the author's actions? Snooping into his phone without consent is a privacy issue. However, in a committed relationship, especially with a child involved, the lines of privacy can be more blurred. The author might have felt it was necessary to protect her feelings and the relationship's integrity.\n\nIn terms of right or wrong, the question is whether the author overreacted. If the fianc\u00e9's behavior was a deal-breaker for her, then she's not in the wrong for leaving. The key factor here is the repeated breaking of trust and promises. Even without physical infidelity, the emotional aspect can be significant.\n\nSo, considering all that, the author might not be in the wrong. Her decision to leave is based on consistent issues that the fianc\u00e9 hasn't resolved, leading to a loss of trust. The answer would be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
