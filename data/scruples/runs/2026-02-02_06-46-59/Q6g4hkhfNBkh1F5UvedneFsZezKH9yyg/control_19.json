During this time he began to talk to a girl that he's known for most of his life. We got back together, and I expected him to break off all contact with her. Which I thought was understandable.\n\n2 weeks in and he still has her on all social media including snapchat. We fought and fought over it and he eventually deleted her. Or so I thought.\n\nLast October, we had been growing rather distant and I took it upon myself to snoop through his phone.\n\nAnd there she is. She had blocked me on social media so that I couldn't see them following each other. He had literally liked every single one of her pictures, not any of mine during the same time period to be clear, and she liked his as well. Including a picture of his Snapchat code asking people to add him.\n\nI confront him. He becomes angry and defensive but swears hell get rid of her.\n\nAbout a month later I decide to check again. And she's still there. So I told him I was leaving him.\n\nHe left for about 3 days. And we eventually talked things through and he again swore to delete her and block her for good.\n\n3 weeks ago, I saw that he had liked pictures of the girl's sister on Instagram. He says he had remembered liking them from a long time ago and had been trying to unlike them so I would never find them and in doing so accidentally re liked the pictures, and I believed him.\n\nLast night. He has both the girl AND her sister unblocked AGAIN on social media. Meaning he went out of his way to go through his settings, get to privacy, open his list of blocked users and unblocked those two in particular.\n\nWIBTA for ending a 7 year relationship with the father of my son because he can't seem to let go of some other girl? Even though the only thing I really have evidence of is them staying in contact, not actually cheating?\n\nI'm at a complete loss.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong for ending a 7-year engagement because their fianc\u00e9 has ongoing contact with an ex-girlfriend and her sister. The key points here are the ongoing contact, the fianc\u00e9's denial of cheating, and the author's decision to leave based on that contact.\n\nFirst, the fianc\u00e9 and the girl have been friends for most of his life. The couple broke up for a month three years ago, and during that time, the fianc\u00e9 started talking to this girl. After getting back together, the author expected him to cut all contact, which the fianc\u00e9 initially did but then failed to maintain. The author discovered ongoing interactions through social media likes, even after the fianc\u00e9 promised to delete her. There were multiple instances where the author checked his phone and found the girl still active in his social media. The final straw was finding the girl and her sister unblocked again.\n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong. The main issue is whether ongoing contact with an ex is a valid reason to end a relationship, especially when there's no evidence of cheating. The fianc\u00e9 claims not to have cheated, but the pattern of behavior suggests a lack of commitment to the relationship. The author feels betrayed and lacks trust, which is a crucial component in any relationship. \n\nIn many relationships, boundaries regarding ex-partners are discussed and agreed upon. If the fianc\u00e9 repeatedly violates these boundaries despite promises, it's reasonable for the author to feel that the relationship isn't respectful of their concerns. Trust is a fundamental part of a partnership, and if that trust is broken due to ongoing contact with someone the partner feels is problematic, it's understandable for the author to make the difficult decision to leave. \n\nEven without proof of cheating, the fianc\u00e9's actions show a disregard for the author's feelings and the agreed-upon boundaries. The author's choice to leave could be seen as a response to a lack of respect and consideration for their emotional needs. Therefore, the author isn't in the wrong for prioritizing their own well-being and the health of the relationship by ending it when their partner isn't meeting their expectations.\n"
