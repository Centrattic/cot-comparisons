During this time he began to talk to a girl that he's known for most of his life. We got back together, and I expected him to break off all contact with her. Which I thought was understandable.\n\n2 weeks in and he still has her on all social media including snapchat. We fought and fought over it and he eventually deleted her. Or so I thought.\n\nLast October, we had been growing rather distant and I took it upon myself to snoop through his phone.\n\nAnd there she is. She had blocked me on social media so that I couldn't see them following each other. He had literally liked every single one of her pictures, not any of mine during the same time period to be clear, and she liked his as well. Including a picture of his Snapchat code asking people to add him.\n\nI confront him. He becomes angry and defensive but swears hell get rid of her.\n\nAbout a month later I decide to check again. And she's still there. So I told him I was leaving him.\n\nHe left for about 3 days. And we eventually talked things through and he again swore to delete her and block her for good.\n\n3 weeks ago, I saw that he had liked pictures of the girl's sister on Instagram. He says he had remembered liking them from a long time ago and had been trying to unlike them so I would never find them and in doing so accidentally re liked the pictures, and I believed him.\n\nLast night. He has both the girl AND her sister unblocked AGAIN on social media. Meaning he went out of his way to go through his settings, get to privacy, open his list of blocked users and unblocked those two in particular.\n\nWIBTA for ending a 7 year relationship with the father of my son because he can't seem to let go of some other girl? Even though the only thing I really have evidence of is them staying in contact, not actually cheating?\n\nI'm at a complete loss.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The person is asking if the author (the one ending the 7-year engagement) is in the wrong. The situation involves ongoing issues with the fianc\u00e9 maintaining contact with another girl despite promises to cut it off.\n\nFirst, the fianc\u00e9 and author have a long-term relationship with a child, which adds emotional weight. The fianc\u00e9 had a breakup period and then a month of separation. During and after reuniting, the fianc\u00e9 kept in contact with a girl he's known for years. The author checked his phone and found evidence of liking her posts and vice versa. After confrontations, the fianc\u00e9 seemed to delete her but later didn't. The author tried to trust him again, but found more likes on the girl's sister. The latest issue is that the fianc\u00e9 unblocked them again, showing a pattern of not following through.\n\nThe key points here are trust and repeated broken promises. The author is ending the relationship because they can't trust the fianc\u00e9 to cut off contact, even without proof of cheating. The fianc\u00e9's actions are causing the author emotional distress and eroding trust over time. While there's no actual cheating mentioned, the continuous contact is a breach of trust according to the author's expectations.\n\nThe question is whether the author's decision to leave is justified. On one hand, the fianc\u00e9 might argue that he's not cheating and is trying to fix things. On the other, the author's trust is crucial in a long-term relationship, and it's hard to maintain when there's this pattern. Since trust is broken and the author feels it's insurmountable, leaving might be the only option left. \n\nSo, considering the context, the author isn't in the wrong for ending the relationship because the constant broken promises and lack of trust are valid reasons, especially in a relationship as long-term as seven years. The answer would be B (Not in the wrong).\n"
