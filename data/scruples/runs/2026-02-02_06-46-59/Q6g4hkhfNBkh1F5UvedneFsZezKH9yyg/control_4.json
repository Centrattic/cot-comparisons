During this time he began to talk to a girl that he's known for most of his life. We got back together, and I expected him to break off all contact with her. Which I thought was understandable.\n\n2 weeks in and he still has her on all social media including snapchat. We fought and fought over it and he eventually deleted her. Or so I thought.\n\nLast October, we had been growing rather distant and I took it upon myself to snoop through his phone.\n\nAnd there she is. She had blocked me on social media so that I couldn't see them following each other. He had literally liked every single one of her pictures, not any of mine during the same time period to be clear, and she liked his as well. Including a picture of his Snapchat code asking people to add him.\n\nI confront him. He becomes angry and defensive but swears hell get rid of her.\n\nAbout a month later I decide to check again. And she's still there. So I told him I was leaving him.\n\nHe left for about 3 days. And we eventually talked things through and he again swore to delete her and block her for good.\n\n3 weeks ago, I saw that he had liked pictures of the girl's sister on Instagram. He says he had remembered liking them from a long time ago and had been trying to unlike them so I would never find them and in doing so accidentally re liked the pictures, and I believed him.\n\nLast night. He has both the girl AND her sister unblocked AGAIN on social media. Meaning he went out of his way to go through his settings, get to privacy, open his list of blocked users and unblocked those two in particular.\n\nWIBTA for ending a 7 year relationship with the father of my son because he can't seem to let go of some other girl? Even though the only thing I really have evidence of is them staying in contact, not actually cheating?\n\nI'm at a complete loss.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for ending a 7-year relationship with their fianc\u00e9. The situation involves ongoing issues with the fianc\u00e9 maintaining contact with another girl despite promises to cut it off. The key points here are about trust, boundaries, and betrayal.\n\nFirst, the fianc\u00e9 broke up with the author for a month and during that time started talking to an old friend. When they reconciled, the author expected him to stop contact with the girl. He deleted her from social media but later reconnected. The author discovered this through snooping, which might be a point of contention. But the repeated instances of reconnecting and mutual liking of photos suggest a pattern of behavior that the author found unacceptable. \n\nThe author's main issue is that the fianc\u00e9 can't let go of this other girl, even after multiple confrontations and promises to stop. The author ends the relationship because of this, even without evidence of actual cheating. The question is whether the author's decision to leave was justified.\n\nFrom a trust perspective, maintaining contact with someone in a committed relationship can be seen as a betrayal, even if not physical. The fianc\u00e9's actions show a lack of respect for the author's boundaries. Repeatedly breaking promises to cut off contact would erode trust. The author's decision to leave after multiple violations could be seen as protecting their own emotional well-being.\n\nHowever, some might argue that the author snooped through the phone, which could be a breach of privacy. But given the context of a long-term relationship with a child, the stakes are high. The repeated actions by the fianc\u00e9 indicate a pattern that the author can't trust, leading to the difficult decision to end things.\n\nSo, considering the pattern of behavior, broken promises, and the impact on trust, it seems that the author isn't in the wrong. The answer would be B: No.\n"
