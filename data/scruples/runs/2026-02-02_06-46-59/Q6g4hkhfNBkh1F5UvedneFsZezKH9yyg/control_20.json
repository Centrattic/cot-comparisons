During this time he began to talk to a girl that he's known for most of his life. We got back together, and I expected him to break off all contact with her. Which I thought was understandable.\n\n2 weeks in and he still has her on all social media including snapchat. We fought and fought over it and he eventually deleted her. Or so I thought.\n\nLast October, we had been growing rather distant and I took it upon myself to snoop through his phone.\n\nAnd there she is. She had blocked me on social media so that I couldn't see them following each other. He had literally liked every single one of her pictures, not any of mine during the same time period to be clear, and she liked his as well. Including a picture of his Snapchat code asking people to add him.\n\nI confront him. He becomes angry and defensive but swears hell get rid of her.\n\nAbout a month later I decide to check again. And she's still there. So I told him I was leaving him.\n\nHe left for about 3 days. And we eventually talked things through and he again swore to delete her and block her for good.\n\n3 weeks ago, I saw that he had liked pictures of the girl's sister on Instagram. He says he had remembered liking them from a long time ago and had been trying to unlike them so I would never find them and in doing so accidentally re liked the pictures, and I believed him.\n\nLast night. He has both the girl AND her sister unblocked AGAIN on social media. Meaning he went out of his way to go through his settings, get to privacy, open his list of blocked users and unblocked those two in particular.\n\nWIBTA for ending a 7 year relationship with the father of my son because he can't seem to let go of some other girl? Even though the only thing I really have evidence of is them staying in contact, not actually cheating?\n\nI'm at a complete loss.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. So the question is whether the author is in the wrong for ending a 7-year relationship with her fianc\u00e9 because he keeps staying in contact with another girl, even though there's no evidence of cheating.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The couple has a child together and has been engaged for 7 years. They broke up briefly a few years ago, and the fianc\u00e9 started talking to a girl he's known for a long time. After getting back together, the author expected him to cut contact with the girl. He deleted her from social media but then later, it turns out, he was still liking her posts. They had conflicts, and he promised to delete her again. The author checked his phone again and found he hadn't. She left him, and he left for three days but came back. Recently, she found he unblocked both the girl and her sister. Now she's considering ending the relationship again.\n\nThe key points here are the ongoing issues with the fianc\u00e9 not cutting contact despite promises, the author's snooping (which might be seen as an invasion of privacy), and the fact that there's no proof of cheating, just contact. The author is trying to decide if she's in the wrong for leaving.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? Well, in relationships, trust and communication are crucial. The fianc\u00e9 has repeatedly broken his promises to delete the girl from his life. Even if he didn't cheat, maintaining contact in a way that the partner finds unacceptable could be a deal-breaker. The author felt it was necessary to leave because of the lack of trust and betrayal, even without actual cheating. On the other hand, some might argue that the author snooped, which could be seen as violating privacy. However, the fianc\u00e9's actions led her to do that. \n\nIn many people's opinions, if someone can't respect their partner's boundaries and keeps breaking promises, the relationship is in trouble. The fact that he went out of his way to unblock them after promising not to shows a lack of commitment to the relationship. Even without cheating, the ongoing contact and deception could justify the author's decision to leave. So, the answer might lean towards the author not being in the wrong. But I need to consider if the snooping makes her at fault. However, the fianc\u00e9's actions led her to snoop, which is a common justification. \n\nIn summary, the main issue is the fianc\u00e9's repeated breaches of trust and inability to address the author's concerns. Therefore, the author is justified in leaving the relationship. So the answer would be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
