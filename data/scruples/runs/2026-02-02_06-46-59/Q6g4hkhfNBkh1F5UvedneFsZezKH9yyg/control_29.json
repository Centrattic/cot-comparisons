During this time he began to talk to a girl that he's known for most of his life. We got back together, and I expected him to break off all contact with her. Which I thought was understandable.\n\n2 weeks in and he still has her on all social media including snapchat. We fought and fought over it and he eventually deleted her. Or so I thought.\n\nLast October, we had been growing rather distant and I took it upon myself to snoop through his phone.\n\nAnd there she is. She had blocked me on social media so that I couldn't see them following each other. He had literally liked every single one of her pictures, not any of mine during the same time period to be clear, and she liked his as well. Including a picture of his Snapchat code asking people to add him.\n\nI confront him. He becomes angry and defensive but swears hell get rid of her.\n\nAbout a month later I decide to check again. And she's still there. So I told him I was leaving him.\n\nHe left for about 3 days. And we eventually talked things through and he again swore to delete her and block her for good.\n\n3 weeks ago, I saw that he had liked pictures of the girl's sister on Instagram. He says he had remembered liking them from a long time ago and had been trying to unlike them so I would never find them and in doing so accidentally re liked the pictures, and I believed him.\n\nLast night. He has both the girl AND her sister unblocked AGAIN on social media. Meaning he went out of his way to go through his settings, get to privacy, open his list of blocked users and unblocked those two in particular.\n\nWIBTA for ending a 7 year relationship with the father of my son because he can't seem to let go of some other girl? Even though the only thing I really have evidence of is them staying in contact, not actually cheating?\n\nI'm at a complete loss.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The question is whether the author is in the wrong for ending a 7-year relationship with their fianc\u00e9 because he couldn't stop contacting a girl from his past. Let's break down the situation.\n\nFirst, they've been together for seven years with a child. That's a long time, so trust and commitment are probably important here. The fianc\u00e9 had a month-long breakup with the author, during which he started talking to this girl. They got back together, and the author expected him to cut off contact. He deleted her initially but then later reconnected multiple times. The author found out through snooping, which might be a point of contention. \n\nThe key points are that the fianc\u00e9 kept reconnecting with the girl, even after promises to stop. The author has evidence of him liking her posts and even her sister's, and finally, unblocking them. But there's no evidence of actual cheating. So the question is, is staying in contact after multiple promises to stop enough to justify leaving?\n\nFrom the author's perspective, trust has been broken repeatedly. Even if there's no physical infidelity, emotional infidelity can be just as damaging. The fianc\u00e9's actions show a pattern of dishonesty and a lack of commitment to the relationship. The author felt it was necessary to end things to protect their own well-being and their child's environment.\n\nOn the other hand, the fianc\u00e9 might argue that he's not cheating and that the author is being too controlling. But the pattern of behavior suggests repeated failures to honor commitments, which can erode trust over time. The author had to take matters into their own hands after multiple attempts to resolve the issue failed.\n\nConsidering all this, it's a complex situation, but the author's decision to leave due to a breach of trust, even without proof of cheating, seems justified. So the answer would be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
