During this time he began to talk to a girl that he's known for most of his life. We got back together, and I expected him to break off all contact with her. Which I thought was understandable.\n\n2 weeks in and he still has her on all social media including snapchat. We fought and fought over it and he eventually deleted her. Or so I thought.\n\nLast October, we had been growing rather distant and I took it upon myself to snoop through his phone.\n\nAnd there she is. She had blocked me on social media so that I couldn't see them following each other. He had literally liked every single one of her pictures, not any of mine during the same time period to be clear, and she liked his as well. Including a picture of his Snapchat code asking people to add him.\n\nI confront him. He becomes angry and defensive but swears hell get rid of her.\n\nAbout a month later I decide to check again. And she's still there. So I told him I was leaving him.\n\nHe left for about 3 days. And we eventually talked things through and he again swore to delete her and block her for good.\n\n3 weeks ago, I saw that he had liked pictures of the girl's sister on Instagram. He says he had remembered liking them from a long time ago and had been trying to unlike them so I would never find them and in doing so accidentally re liked the pictures, and I believed him.\n\nLast night. He has both the girl AND her sister unblocked AGAIN on social media. Meaning he went out of his way to go through his settings, get to privacy, open his list of blocked users and unblocked those two in particular.\n\nWIBTA for ending a 7 year relationship with the father of my son because he can't seem to let go of some other girl? Even though the only thing I really have evidence of is them staying in contact, not actually cheating?\n\nI'm at a complete loss.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question step by step. The user is asking whether the author of the \"Will I Be The Asshole\" (WIBTA) post is in the wrong for ending a 7-year engagement with her fianc\u00e9, who is the father of her son. The key issue here is the fianc\u00e9's ongoing contact with another woman, which the author discovered and eventually led her to break up. The main points to consider are the evidence of the contact, the repeated assurances from the fianc\u00e9, and the author's decision to leave.\n\nFirst, the author mentions that the fianc\u00e9 had a history of not cutting off communication with this other woman despite promises. They broke up once before when this issue arose, and after getting back together, the contact resurfaced multiple times. The author even had to snoop to find that the fianc\u00e9 was still interacting with the girl and her sister on social media, liking their posts and keeping them unblocked. The fianc\u00e9 gave assurances each time but failed to follow through.\n\nNow, considering the context of a long-term relationship with a child, trust is a critical component. The fianc\u00e9's actions suggest a pattern of not respecting the author's boundaries. Even though there's no evidence of actual cheating, the ongoing contact could be seen as a breach of trust. The author's decision to leave is based on the fianc\u00e9's inability to honor his commitments regarding this contact. \n\nHowever, some might argue that the author's snooping into his phone could be seen as invasive, but in this case, it was likely done out of concern given the history. The fianc\u00e9's repeated failures to cut ties despite promises might justify the author's actions. The key here is whether the author had a reasonable expectation of monogamy and respect, which the fianc\u00e9 failed to uphold. \n\nIn relationships, trust and communication are vital. If the fianc\u00e9 couldn't maintain the boundaries that the author deemed necessary, especially after multiple chances, then the author isn't necessarily in the wrong for prioritizing her own emotional well-being and setting clear boundaries. The absence of cheating doesn't negate the emotional harm caused by the ongoing contact, especially if it led to insecurity and distrust. \n\nTherefore, considering the pattern of behavior and the impact on the relationship, the author isn't in the wrong for ending things.\n"
