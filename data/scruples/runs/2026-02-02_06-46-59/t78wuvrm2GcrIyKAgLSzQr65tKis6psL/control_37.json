And there were some conflicting feelings about whether or not she was the asshole.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nYesterday, my friend remarked to a coworker that she had a hanging nail and was glad she had her nail clippers to take care of it. Coworker B was walking by and overheard. Coworker B walked into friend's cubicle and demand she NOT clip her nails at work because that was disgusting. Coworker B then retreats back to her cubicle on the other side of the floor.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy friend then clips her hanging nail in her own cubicle. And then clipped two more to \"even things out\".  She then receives a text message from Coworker B that she could hear her clipping her nails from over 100 feet away. And it was absolutely disgusting. And why would anyone do something so gross in a public place.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy friend responded, \"chill out\".\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo... Is clipping your fingernails at work as asshole thing to do? This is where the debate started last night- is it super gross as coworker B feels, or is it fine?  Is my friend the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author (my friend) is in the wrong for clipping her nails at work. The scenario is that she mentioned a hanging nail and used clippers, which Coworker B overheard and got upset. Then the friend clipped more nails, and Coworker B texted her that it was disgusting. The friend replied with \"chill out.\"\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. Clipping nails at work can be a sensitive topic because some people find the sound or the act unhygienic. The friend did it in her own cubicle, which might be considered private space, but work environments often have shared spaces. However, the friend's action of clipping three nails after the initial one might be seen as overreacting to Coworker B's complaint. \n\nCoworker B's reaction was strong\u2014called it disgusting, could hear it from 100 feet away. The friend's response of \"chill out\" could be seen as dismissive, which might escalate the conflict. \n\nCompany policies would matter here. If there's a rule against such activities, the friend would be wrong. But if there's no policy, it's more about social norms. In many workplaces, clipping nails isn't explicitly prohibited, but it's often discouraged due to noise and hygiene. The friend's actions in the cubicle might be within acceptable bounds if done quietly and not disturbing others. However, clipping more nails after being told to stop could be seen as defiant. \n\nThe key points are: Was the friend in a private enough space? Did her actions disrupt others? How did she respond to the complaint? The friend's reply might have been inappropriate, showing a lack of consideration for Coworker B's feelings. Even if the initial act isn't against the rules, the response could be seen as inconsiderate. \n\nSo, the friend might not be entirely wrong for clipping nails if it's done in a cubicle, but the response to the complaint and the act of clipping more after being told to stop could be problematic. The answer depends on whether the actions were disruptive and how the friend handled the feedback. If the friend's response was dismissive and she continued after being asked, that's where the issue lies. But the initial act alone might not be the problem. So the main issue is the response and the continuation, which could be seen as inconsiderate. Hence, the friend might be in the wrong in terms of social etiquette.\n"
