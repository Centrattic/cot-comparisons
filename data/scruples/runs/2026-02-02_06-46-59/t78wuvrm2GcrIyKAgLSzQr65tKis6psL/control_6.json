And there were some conflicting feelings about whether or not she was the asshole.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nYesterday, my friend remarked to a coworker that she had a hanging nail and was glad she had her nail clippers to take care of it. Coworker B was walking by and overheard. Coworker B walked into friend's cubicle and demand she NOT clip her nails at work because that was disgusting. Coworker B then retreats back to her cubicle on the other side of the floor.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy friend then clips her hanging nail in her own cubicle. And then clipped two more to \"even things out\".  She then receives a text message from Coworker B that she could hear her clipping her nails from over 100 feet away. And it was absolutely disgusting. And why would anyone do something so gross in a public place.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy friend responded, \"chill out\".\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo... Is clipping your fingernails at work as asshole thing to do? This is where the debate started last night- is it super gross as coworker B feels, or is it fine?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person in the story is the asshole (AITA) for clipping their nails at work. The answer options are A (yes, they're wrong) or B (no, they're not).\n\nFirst, the situation: the friend clipped a hanging nail when she had clippers. A coworker overheard her comment, got upset, and told her not to do it. Then the friend clipped two more nails, leading to another complaint from the coworker about hearing the clippers from far away. The friend responded with \"chill out.\"\n\nNow, considering typical workplace etiquette, clipping nails at work can be a divisive topic. Some people find it gross because of the noise or the visual. Others see it as a quick, harmless task that's necessary for hygiene. However, doing it in a shared space where it might disturb others could be problematic. The friend did it in her own cubicle, which might be a private area, but the noise traveled, causing a disturbance.\n\nThe key points here are: 1) Did the friend act inconsiderately? 2) Was the coworker's reaction reasonable? 3) Was the friend's response (\"chill out\") appropriate?\n\nThe friend's initial action was to clip a hanging nail, which is a minor task. However, after being asked not to do it, she continued, which could be seen as dismissive. Even in a cubicle, if the noise is a known issue, it's possible that the friend wasn't considerate enough. The coworker's reaction, while perhaps overzealous, shows that the action was indeed bothering someone. The friend's response of \"chill out\" might come off as rude, especially after being approached about it.\n\nWorkplace etiquette often emphasizes considering others' comfort. While there's no universal rule, many workplaces have informal norms. If the friend knew or should have known that clipping nails there was frowned upon, continuing after being told could make her the asshole. However, if there's no specific rule against it, she might not be wrong. The fact that she clipped three nails after the initial comment might indicate she didn't take the coworker's concern seriously.\n\nIn AITA scenarios, the balance is often on how one's actions affect others. Since the coworker was visibly upset and the friend's actions continued despite the complaint, it leans towards the friend being in the wrong. But there's also the argument that it's a personal choice unless there's a rule against it. However, the act of clipping nails can be considered gross by some standards, so the friend's actions might be seen as inconsiderate.\n"
