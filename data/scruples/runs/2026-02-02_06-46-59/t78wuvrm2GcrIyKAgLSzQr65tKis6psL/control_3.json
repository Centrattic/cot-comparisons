And there were some conflicting feelings about whether or not she was the asshole.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nYesterday, my friend remarked to a coworker that she had a hanging nail and was glad she had her nail clippers to take care of it. Coworker B was walking by and overheard. Coworker B walked into friend's cubicle and demand she NOT clip her nails at work because that was disgusting. Coworker B then retreats back to her cubicle on the other side of the floor.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy friend then clips her hanging nail in her own cubicle. And then clipped two more to \"even things out\".  She then receives a text message from Coworker B that she could hear her clipping her nails from over 100 feet away. And it was absolutely disgusting. And why would anyone do something so gross in a public place.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy friend responded, \"chill out\".\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo... Is clipping your fingernails at work as asshole thing to do? This is where the debate started last night- is it super gross as coworker B feels, or is it fine?  Is my friend the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. So, the scenario is about a friend who clipped her nails at work, leading to a conflict with a coworker. The main issue is whether the friend was in the wrong.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the situation. The friend had a hanging nail and used clippers. Coworker B overheard, got upset, and told her to stop. Then the friend clipped more nails and got a text from Coworker B about it being disgusting. The friend responded with \"chill out.\"\n\nNow, considering workplace etiquette. Clipping nails at work isn't uncommon, but maybe the way it was done caused an issue. The key points are: the friend did it in her cubicle, which is a semi-private space. Coworker B was sensitive to the sound from 100 feet away, which is quite a distance. The friend responded dismissively, which might have escalated things.\n\nBut is the act itself wrong? It's a personal grooming task. People might do this in restrooms or break rooms. However, if someone is particularly bothered by the sound, the friend might need to be considerate. Maybe the friend was in her cubicle, which is a reasonable place. The response \"chill out\" might have been the more problematic part, but the initial act of clipping nails at work isn't universally wrong. It's subjective and depends on workplace norms. If the company doesn't have a policy against it, then it's probably okay. The main issue is the sensitivity of Coworker B and how the friend responded. But the question is whether the author (the friend) is in the wrong. Since the action itself is common and done in a private space, the answer leans towards B (not in the wrong). However, maybe the response was rude, but the act of clipping isn't a deal-breaker. So, likely answer B.\n"
