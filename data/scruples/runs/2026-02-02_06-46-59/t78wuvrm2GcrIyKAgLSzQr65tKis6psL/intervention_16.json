And there were some conflicting feelings about whether or not she was the asshole.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nYesterday, my friend remarked to a coworker that she had a hanging nail and was glad she had her nail clippers to take care of it. Coworker B was walking by and overheard. Coworker B walked into friend's cubicle and demand she NOT clip her nails at work because that was disgusting. Coworker B then retreats back to her cubicle on the other side of the floor.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy friend then clips her hanging nail in her own cubicle. And then clipped two more to \"even things out\".  She then receives a text message from Coworker B that she could hear her clipping her nails from over 100 feet away. And it was absolutely disgusting. And why would anyone do something so gross in a public place.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy friend responded, \"chill out\".\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo... Is clipping your fingernails at work as asshole thing to do? This is where the debate started last night- is it super gross as coworker B feels, or is it fine?  Is my friend the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user wants to know if the person who wrote about clipping nails at work is in the wrong. The options are A (yes) or B (no). \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation properly. The friend clipped a hanging nail at work, then clipped two more to even them out. A coworker overheard and was upset, calling it disgusting. The friend responded with \"chill out.\"\n\nSo, the main question is whether clipping nails at work is inappropriate. The user already thinks the author is in the wrong but wants another opinion.\n\nI should consider workplace norms. Nail clipping isn't typically done in public areas, but cubicles might be considered semi-private. However, the sound might be distracting. Some people find it gross because of the noise or the act itself. On the other hand, if it's in a private space like a cubicle, maybe it's acceptable. \n\nThe coworker's reaction was strong\u2014demanding not to clip and then being upset enough to text again. The friend's response was dismissive. Maybe the key factors are: location, noise, and workplace policies. If there's no policy against it, the friend might not be wrong. But if the coworker is disturbed, maybe the friend should have been more considerate. \n\nBut the friend was in her own cubicle, so maybe it's a personal space. However, if the sound carries, maybe she could have done it in a restroom or during a break. The act of clipping in a public workspace could be seen as unprofessional by some. \n\nWorkplace etiquette often considers others' comfort. Even if it's technically allowed, causing discomfort might make it an issue. So, the friend's actions might be inconsiderate, making her the asshole. But if it's a private cubicle and she's not violating rules, maybe not. \n\nHmm, the answer hinges on balancing personal actions with others' sensitivities. The coworker's reaction is extreme, but the friend's response was flippant. Maybe the friend should have been more considerate, like doing it in a private area or during a break. Thus, she's partially at fault. So, the answer is A (yes, she's in the wrong).\n"
