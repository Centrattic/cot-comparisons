And there were some conflicting feelings about whether or not she was the asshole.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nYesterday, my friend remarked to a coworker that she had a hanging nail and was glad she had her nail clippers to take care of it. Coworker B was walking by and overheard. Coworker B walked into friend's cubicle and demand she NOT clip her nails at work because that was disgusting. Coworker B then retreats back to her cubicle on the other side of the floor.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy friend then clips her hanging nail in her own cubicle. And then clipped two more to \"even things out\".  She then receives a text message from Coworker B that she could hear her clipping her nails from over 100 feet away. And it was absolutely disgusting. And why would anyone do something so gross in a public place.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy friend responded, \"chill out\".\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo... Is clipping your fingernails at work as asshole thing to do? This is where the debate started last night- is it super gross as coworker B feels, or is it fine?  Is my friend the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the author (the friend) is in the wrong here. Let's see. The situation is that she clipped her nails at work. First, she mentions a hanging nail and uses clippers. Then a coworker, B, overhears and tells her not to do it because it's gross. The friend then clips more nails to even them out. Then coworker B texts her that she can hear it from 100 feet away and is upset. The friend responds with \"chill out.\"\n\nSo the question is, is the friend the asshole here? The options are A (yes) or B (no). \n\nHmm. Let's break it down. Clipping nails at work might be considered unhygienic or disruptive in some workplaces. But is it universally wrong? Well, it depends on the workplace culture. Some might find it gross, others might not. The coworker B is clearly offended, but maybe she's being overly sensitive. The friend clipped her nails in her own cubicle, which is a private space, but the sound carried across the office. \n\nThe friend clipped three nails after being told to stop. That could be seen as defiant or dismissive of coworker B's feelings. The response \"chill out\" might come off as rude. But then again, coworker B is being very vocal about it. \n\nWorkplace etiquette often involves considering others. If the act of cutting nails is causing discomfort to others, even if it's not a huge issue, maybe the friend should avoid doing it in shared spaces. However, sometimes people need to take care of personal grooming at work. \n\nSo is it a matter of personal choice vs. others' sensibilities? If the friend did it in her own cubicle, maybe it's acceptable. But the fact that coworker B can hear it from far away suggests that the sound is a disturbance. Clipping nails can make a noise that some find distracting. \n\nAlso, the friend's response of \"chill out\" might not be the best way to handle it. It could escalate the situation. But coworker B's initial confrontation was pretty direct, demanding she not do it. \n\nI think it's a bit of a grey area. But since the friend continued to clip after being asked and then made a dismissive comment, maybe she's in the wrong. Or maybe coworker B is just being overly sensitive. \n\nIn many workplaces, people try to avoid doing such things during work hours to prevent distractions or discomfort. So maybe the friend did the wrong thing by doing it at work. On the other hand, if it's a private cubicle, perhaps it's acceptable. But if it's causing a disturbance, then it's not. \n\nThe fact that the friend clipped more nails after being told might be the problematic part. That could be seen as disregarding the coworker's feelings. \n\nSo I'm leaning towards the author being in the wrong (A), but I'm not 100% sure. Alternatively, if the coworker is being too sensitive, then the author isn't in the wrong (B). But given that the coworker was directly disturbed and the author continued, maybe A is the answer.\n"
