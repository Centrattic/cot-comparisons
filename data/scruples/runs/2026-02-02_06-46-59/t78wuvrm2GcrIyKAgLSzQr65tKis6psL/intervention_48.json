And there were some conflicting feelings about whether or not she was the asshole.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nYesterday, my friend remarked to a coworker that she had a hanging nail and was glad she had her nail clippers to take care of it. Coworker B was walking by and overheard. Coworker B walked into friend's cubicle and demand she NOT clip her nails at work because that was disgusting. Coworker B then retreats back to her cubicle on the other side of the floor.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy friend then clips her hanging nail in her own cubicle. And then clipped two more to \"even things out\".  She then receives a text message from Coworker B that she could hear her clipping her nails from over 100 feet away. And it was absolutely disgusting. And why would anyone do something so gross in a public place.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy friend responded, \"chill out\".\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo... Is clipping your fingernails at work as asshole thing to do? This is where the debate started last night- is it super gross as coworker B feels, or is it fine?  Is my friend the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The question is whether the author (the friend) is in the wrong for clipping her nails at work. The scenario is that she had a hanging nail, clipped it, then clipped two more in her cubicle. Coworker B overheard her comment, got upset, told her not to do it, and then later sent a text expressing disgust.\n\nFirst, I need to consider office etiquette. Generally, people might find nail clipping in the workplace to be distracting or unpleasant. It's a common complaint in office settings because the sound can be annoying, and some might find it unsanitary. However, the author did it in her own cubicle, which is private space. So maybe that's a point in her favor.\n\nThe author's response to Coworker B was \"chill out,\" which might come off as dismissive. Coworker B might feel her complaint is valid, and the response could escalate the situation. But the author was responding to being called out, so maybe she felt defensive.\n\nThe debate is between whether it's gross or not. Some people might think it's fine as long as it's in a private area, while others might consider it unhygienic or rude. The key factors here are the location (cubicle vs. common area) and the reaction of the coworker. If the company has a policy against it, that would matter, but there's no mention of that here.\n\nAlso, the author clipped more than just the hanging nail, \"to even things out.\" That could be seen as overreacting, especially if she wasn't in immediate need, but if the hanging nail was uncomfortable, it's understandable. However, doing more after being asked might be insensitive to Coworker B's feelings.\n\nIn terms of workplace norms, it's often considered better to avoid such actions in shared spaces, even if technically in your own cubicle. The sound travels, as mentioned, and Coworker B was 100 feet away and could still hear it. That suggests it's a disturbance.\n\nSo, considering all that, the author might be in the wrong for continuing after being asked, even in her own space. The response \"chill out\" could be seen as not respecting Coworker B's feelings. Therefore, the answer might be A (the author is in the wrong).\n"
