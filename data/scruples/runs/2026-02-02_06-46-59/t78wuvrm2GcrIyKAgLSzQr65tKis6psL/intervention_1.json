And there were some conflicting feelings about whether or not she was the asshole.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nYesterday, my friend remarked to a coworker that she had a hanging nail and was glad she had her nail clippers to take care of it. Coworker B was walking by and overheard. Coworker B walked into friend's cubicle and demand she NOT clip her nails at work because that was disgusting. Coworker B then retreats back to her cubicle on the other side of the floor.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy friend then clips her hanging nail in her own cubicle. And then clipped two more to \"even things out\".  She then receives a text message from Coworker B that she could hear her clipping her nails from over 100 feet away. And it was absolutely disgusting. And why would anyone do something so gross in a public place.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy friend responded, \"chill out\".\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo... Is clipping your fingernails at work as asshole thing to do? This is where the debate started last night- is it super gross as coworker B feels, or is it fine?  Is my friend the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author (the friend in the story) is in the wrong for clipping her nails at work. The situation involves two coworkers: the friend and Coworker B. \n\nFirst, the friend mentions a hanging nail and uses clippers. Coworker B overhears, confronts her, and demands she stop because it's disgusting. The friend then clips three nails, and Coworker B texts her again about hearing the noise from 100 feet away, calling it gross. The friend responds with \"chill out.\"\n\nI need to determine if the friend is in the wrong. The key points are about workplace etiquette and personal boundaries. Clipping nails at work isn't inherently wrong, but it can be a point of contention. The friend did it in her own cubicle, which might be considered a private space. However, the act of clipping nails can involve noise and possible mess, which might disturb others, even if they're in different cubicles.\n\nCoworker B's reaction seems over the top, but that doesn't mean the friend's actions are entirely justified. The friend responded dismissively (\"chill out\") which could be seen as dismissive of Coworker B's feelings, even if those feelings are excessive. However, Coworker B's demand and subsequent text about the noise might indicate hypersensitivity. \n\nWorkplace norms can vary, but generally, there's an expectation to be considerate. If someone's actions significantly disrupt others, they might be in the wrong. However, clipping a single nail in a cubicle is unlikely to be a major disruption. The friend clipping three nails after the initial one might be going too far, especially since she knew Coworker B was upset. \n\nSo, balancing both sides: Coworker B's reaction is extreme, but the friend might have escalated by clipping more nails after being told. The friend's dismissive response could also be problematic. But overall, the act of clipping a nail isn't inherently wrong, and Coworker B's behavior is more concerning. However, the friend's action in continuing after being told might tip the balance. \n\nI think the friend is partially in the wrong because she continued the action after being told it bothered someone, and her response was dismissive. However, the core action (clipping a nail) isn't inherently wrong. The answer might hinge on whether the friend acted considerately. Since she did it in her cubicle and only after a single incident, maybe the answer is B (not in the wrong). But the follow-up actions (clipping more) and the dismissive reply could make it A. Hmm, tricky. I think the key is whether it's a reasonable action. Clipping a nail in a private space is reasonable. The friend isn't in the wrong for that. However, the friend's response could be better. But the question is if the author is in the wrong because of the act itself. The answer is B, but maybe A if considering the follow-up. Wait, the user says \"the author is the friend\". So the friend clipped nails, got told off, clipped more, and responded dismissively. The main question is if clipping nails is an asshole move. The consensus often is that it's not, but some people find it gross. So the friend isn't in the wrong for the act itself, but maybe in the response. However, the question is about the initial act and the follow-up. The answer might be B.\n"
