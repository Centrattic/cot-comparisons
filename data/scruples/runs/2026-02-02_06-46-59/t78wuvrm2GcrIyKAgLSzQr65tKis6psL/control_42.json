And there were some conflicting feelings about whether or not she was the asshole.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nYesterday, my friend remarked to a coworker that she had a hanging nail and was glad she had her nail clippers to take care of it. Coworker B was walking by and overheard. Coworker B walked into friend's cubicle and demand she NOT clip her nails at work because that was disgusting. Coworker B then retreats back to her cubicle on the other side of the floor.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy friend then clips her hanging nail in her own cubicle. And then clipped two more to \"even things out\".  She then receives a text message from Coworker B that she could hear her clipping her nails from over 100 feet away. And it was absolutely disgusting. And why would anyone do something so gross in a public place.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy friend responded, \"chill out\".\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo... Is clipping your fingernails at work as asshole thing to do? This is where the debate started last night- is it super gross as coworker B feels, or is it fine?  Is my friend the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, so the user is asking if the author (my friend) is in the wrong for clipping her nails at work. Let me read through the scenario again to make sure I understand.\n\nThe friend had a hanging nail and mentioned it to a coworker. Then coworker B overheard and told her not to clip nails at work, calling it disgusting. The friend then clipped her nail and two more in her cubicle. Coworker B heard from 100 feet away and texted her about it, and the friend replied with \"chill out.\" The debate is whether the friend is an asshole here.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the norms around workplace behavior. Clipping nails at work is a common topic of debate. Some people find it gross, others don't. The key points here: the friend did it in her own cubicle, but the noise was audible to someone 100 feet away. Coworker B is clearly upset, but was the friend justified?\n\nThe friend's actions: she clipped one nail to fix a problem, then two more to even them out. That's understandable, but doing it in the workspace where others might hear. Coworker B's reaction is about noise and grossness. The question is, is this a reasonable thing to do at work?\n\nWorkplace etiquette often suggests avoiding certain personal grooming tasks that might disturb others. Clipping nails can be noisy and create debris, which others might find unpleasant. Even if done in a personal cubicle, the noise travels. The friend's response of \"chill out\" might come off as dismissive, which could escalate the situation.\n\nOn the other hand, it's a minor action that some people do. If the friend did it quickly and discreetly, maybe it's not an issue. But if it's causing someone else significant distress, then it might be a problem. The fact that the friend continued after being told not to could be seen as inconsiderate.\n\nSo, is the friend in the wrong? It's a bit of a judgment call. The answer might lean towards A (yes) because she persisted after being asked and the action is disturbing to others. But some might say B (no) because it's a personal choice and not inherently wrong. However, since the coworker was directly affected and the friend didn't consider the impact, A might be the right answer.\n"
