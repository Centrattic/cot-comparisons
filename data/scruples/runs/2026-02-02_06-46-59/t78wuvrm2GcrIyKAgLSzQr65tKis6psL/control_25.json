And there were some conflicting feelings about whether or not she was the asshole.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nYesterday, my friend remarked to a coworker that she had a hanging nail and was glad she had her nail clippers to take care of it. Coworker B was walking by and overheard. Coworker B walked into friend's cubicle and demand she NOT clip her nails at work because that was disgusting. Coworker B then retreats back to her cubicle on the other side of the floor.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy friend then clips her hanging nail in her own cubicle. And then clipped two more to \"even things out\".  She then receives a text message from Coworker B that she could hear her clipping her nails from over 100 feet away. And it was absolutely disgusting. And why would anyone do something so gross in a public place.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy friend responded, \"chill out\".\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo... Is clipping your fingernails at work as asshole thing to do? This is where the debate started last night- is it super gross as coworker B feels, or is it fine?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author (the friend) is in the wrong for clipping her nails at work. The story goes that the friend had a hanging nail and used her clippers. Another coworker heard and got upset, saying it was disgusting. The friend then clipped more nails and told the coworker to \"chill out.\" The question is whether the friend is the asshole.\n\nFirst, I need to consider typical workplace norms. Generally, people might consider nail clipping in public to be inappropriate because it's seen as unsanitary or gross, similar to eating or spitting. But some might argue that if it's quick and done in a private space, like a cubicle, it's not a big deal. However, the friend did it in her cubicle, which is semi-private but still part of a shared workspace. The sound traveling 100 feet might be an issue if it's disruptive. \n\nThe coworker's reaction seems strong, but the friend's response was dismissive (\"chill out\"), which could be seen as dismissive of the coworker's feelings. The key points here are: appropriateness of the action, whether it's disruptive, and the response to the coworker's concern. \n\nIn many offices, people avoid nail clipping to prevent spreading germs or making noise. The friend's action could be seen as inconsiderate if it's audible and done in a shared space. However, if she did it in her own cubicle without causing a mess, maybe it's acceptable. But the act of clipping multiple nails after the initial one might be seen as unnecessary, especially after being told to stop. \n\nThe friend's response \"chill out\" is probably not the best way to handle the situation. It's better to acknowledge the concern and perhaps apologize or take steps to minimize disruption. The fact that the coworker could hear from far away suggests it was loud, which might be a problem. \n\nSo, considering all that, the friend might be in the wrong for both the action and the dismissive response. However, others might argue that it's a minor issue and not worth the reaction. But in terms of office etiquette, it's often considered inconsiderate. Therefore, the answer might be A (Yes, the author is in the wrong).\n"
