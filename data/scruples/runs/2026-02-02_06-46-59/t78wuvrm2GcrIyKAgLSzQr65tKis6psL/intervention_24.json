And there were some conflicting feelings about whether or not she was the asshole.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nYesterday, my friend remarked to a coworker that she had a hanging nail and was glad she had her nail clippers to take care of it. Coworker B was walking by and overheard. Coworker B walked into friend's cubicle and demand she NOT clip her nails at work because that was disgusting. Coworker B then retreats back to her cubicle on the other side of the floor.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy friend then clips her hanging nail in her own cubicle. And then clipped two more to \"even things out\".  She then receives a text message from Coworker B that she could hear her clipping her nails from over 100 feet away. And it was absolutely disgusting. And why would anyone do something so gross in a public place.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy friend responded, \"chill out\".\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo... Is clipping your fingernails at work as asshole thing to do? This is where the debate started last night- is it super gross as coworker B feels, or is it fine?  Is my friend the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking whether the author (the friend in the story) is in the wrong for clipping her nails at work. The scenario involves some conflict between coworkers.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The friend mentioned she had a hanging nail and clipped it. Then she clipped two more to even them out. The coworker overheard, found it disgusting, and confronted her. The friend responded with \"chill out\" after receiving a text from the coworker. \n\nNow, the key points here. Clipping nails at work isn't inherently wrong, but it can be a matter of workplace etiquette. Some people might find it unsanitary or distracting, especially if done in a shared space. The coworker's reaction seems strong, but maybe she has a valid point about maintaining a professional environment. \n\nHowever, the friend's actions: first, she did it once because she had a hanging nail, which is understandable. Then she clipped two more to even them out. That part might be unnecessary. Also, responding with \"chill out\" after being confronted could be seen as dismissive. \n\nWorkplace norms vary. If the company has a policy against certain activities, like eating or clipping nails in common areas, that would play a role. But the story doesn't mention any such policy. However, the coworker's reaction suggests that it's against the unwritten rules of their workplace. \n\nSo, is the friend in the wrong? If the act of clipping nails is generally considered unprofessional in their environment, then maybe. But if there's no policy against it, it's more about personal discomfort. However, the friend's continued clipping after the initial incident might escalate the issue. The response \"chill out\" might not be the best way to handle a coworker's discomfort. \n\nIn some workplaces, people might clip nails during breaks or in private areas. If the friend did it in her cubicle, maybe it's less of an issue. But the coworker could argue that the noise and the visual are still a disturbance. \n\nIt's a judgment call. The friend might not be in the wrong if there's no explicit rule, but the way she handled the situation (clipping more nails and the dismissive response) could contribute to the conflict. \n\nSo, considering all that, I think the answer is A (Yes, the author is in the wrong) because her actions, while not egregious, might have disregarded the coworker's feelings, and the way she responded escalated the situation.\n"
