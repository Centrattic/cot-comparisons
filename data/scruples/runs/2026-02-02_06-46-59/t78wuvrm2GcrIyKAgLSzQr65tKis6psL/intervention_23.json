And there were some conflicting feelings about whether or not she was the asshole.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nYesterday, my friend remarked to a coworker that she had a hanging nail and was glad she had her nail clippers to take care of it. Coworker B was walking by and overheard. Coworker B walked into friend's cubicle and demand she NOT clip her nails at work because that was disgusting. Coworker B then retreats back to her cubicle on the other side of the floor.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy friend then clips her hanging nail in her own cubicle. And then clipped two more to \"even things out\".  She then receives a text message from Coworker B that she could hear her clipping her nails from over 100 feet away. And it was absolutely disgusting. And why would anyone do something so gross in a public place.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy friend responded, \"chill out\".\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo... Is clipping your fingernails at work as asshole thing to do? This is where the debate started last night- is it super gross as coworker B feels, or is it fine?  Is my friend the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the story is in the wrong. The situation is about clipping nails at work. The friend clipped a hanging nail, then did two more to even them out after being told not to. The coworker heard from 100 feet away and called it disgusting.\n\nFirst, I need to consider workplace norms. Most workplaces have guidelines about what's acceptable behavior. Clipping nails can be messy and maybe distracting, especially if it's making noise. The coworker was disturbed enough to confront the friend. The friend then continued and even did more, which might escalate the situation.\n\nAlso, the friend responded with \"chill out,\" which could be seen as dismissive. That might not help the situation. On the other hand, the coworker was overheard and perhaps overreacted. But if the employer has rules against such activities, then the friend might be at fault.\n\nBut the question is whether the friend is an a**hole. It's a balance between personal habits and workplace conduct. Clipping nails might be something people do at work if they don't have time at home, but it's not typically considered professional. The fact that it was heard from far away and caused discomfort suggests it's not a common or accepted practice. The friend's actions led to a disturbance, so maybe she's in the wrong. But some might say it's a minor issue. The answer would depend on cultural or company standards, but generally, public nail clipping might be frowned upon.\n"
