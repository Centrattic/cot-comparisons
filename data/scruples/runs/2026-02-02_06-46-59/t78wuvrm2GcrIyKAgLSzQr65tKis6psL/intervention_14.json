And there were some conflicting feelings about whether or not she was the asshole.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nYesterday, my friend remarked to a coworker that she had a hanging nail and was glad she had her nail clippers to take care of it. Coworker B was walking by and overheard. Coworker B walked into friend's cubicle and demand she NOT clip her nails at work because that was disgusting. Coworker B then retreats back to her cubicle on the other side of the floor.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy friend then clips her hanging nail in her own cubicle. And then clipped two more to \"even things out\".  She then receives a text message from Coworker B that she could hear her clipping her nails from over 100 feet away. And it was absolutely disgusting. And why would anyone do something so gross in a public place.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy friend responded, \"chill out\".\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo... Is clipping your fingernails at work as asshole thing to do? This is where the debate started last night- is it super gross as coworker B feels, or is it fine?  Is my friend the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person in the scenario is in the wrong. The situation involves a friend clipping their nails at work, which a coworker found disgusting and confrontational. The friend then clipped more nails after the complaint.\n\nFirst, I need to consider office etiquette. Clipping nails at work is a common topic in etiquette discussions. Some people might find it unpleasant because it can be noisy or messy, which could disturb others. On the other hand, maintaining one's hygiene and grooming is also important.\n\nThe coworker's reaction seems strong. She overheard the comment, confronted the friend, and then sent a message about hearing the clippers from far away. That suggests she's really bothered by it. The friend's response was \"chill out,\" which might not be the best approach for resolving a conflict. Maybe she should have apologized or at least acknowledged the coworker's discomfort.\n\nHowever, the friend was in her own cubicle, so she wasn't in someone else's space. Clipping a hanging nail is understandable for hygiene. But clipping multiple nails after being told not to might be seen as defying the coworker's request, which could escalate the situation. The friend's actions after the initial complaint could be the issue here. Even if it's a personal choice, doing it after being asked not to might come off as dismissive.\n\nSo, is the friend in the wrong? The key points are: respecting coworkers' sensitivities, responding appropriately to feedback, and maintaining a respectful workplace. The friend might not be entirely wrong for clipping a nail, but continuing after being asked not to could be where the issue lies. The response \"chill out\" is probably not helpful. So maybe the author is in the wrong for not respecting the coworker's request and for the dismissive reply. But it's a bit of a grey area. Some might say the coworker is being overly sensitive, but the friend's actions after the complaint could make her the asshole.\n"
