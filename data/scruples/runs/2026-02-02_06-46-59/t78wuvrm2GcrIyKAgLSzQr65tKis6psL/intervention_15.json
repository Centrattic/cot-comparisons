And there were some conflicting feelings about whether or not she was the asshole.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nYesterday, my friend remarked to a coworker that she had a hanging nail and was glad she had her nail clippers to take care of it. Coworker B was walking by and overheard. Coworker B walked into friend's cubicle and demand she NOT clip her nails at work because that was disgusting. Coworker B then retreats back to her cubicle on the other side of the floor.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy friend then clips her hanging nail in her own cubicle. And then clipped two more to \"even things out\".  She then receives a text message from Coworker B that she could hear her clipping her nails from over 100 feet away. And it was absolutely disgusting. And why would anyone do something so gross in a public place.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy friend responded, \"chill out\".\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo... Is clipping your fingernails at work as asshole thing to do? This is where the debate started last night- is it super gross as coworker B feels, or is it fine?  Is my friend the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking if the author (the friend) is in the wrong for clipping her nails at work. The scenario involves a coworker getting upset about it.\n\nFirst, I need to consider office etiquette. Clipping nails at work isn't typically a common practice. People usually do that at home or break times. Doing it at your desk might be seen as unhygienic or distracting. But maybe some people might do it if they're in a hurry or forget.\n\nCoworker B overheard the comment about the hanging nail and demanded she not clip it. Then after the author did clip them, including more to even out, Coworker B texts her about hearing it from 100 feet away. The author responded with \"chill out.\"\n\nSo, the main points are: Is clipping nails in the workplace acceptable? The friend's actions: clipping a hanging nail, then two more. The response from Coworker B was strong, but the friend dismissed it. \n\nWorkplace norms vary, but generally, nail clipping is discouraged because it can be seen as unprofessional or unsanitary. Also, doing it in a shared space might be considered impolite. The fact that the author clipped two more after the initial one might be seen as going beyond just fixing the problem, possibly to spite the coworker's reaction, which could be seen as a bit immature. The response \"chill out\" might have come off as dismissive or not taking the coworker's feelings into account.\n\nHowever, Coworker B's reaction might be over-the-top. Not everyone finds nail clipping gross, so it's subjective. But the question is whether the author is the asshole. If the workplace doesn't have a specific rule against it, maybe the author isn't in the wrong. But generally, in professional settings, it's better to avoid such actions that could be perceived as unhygienic or disruptive, even if they aren't explicitly forbidden.\n\nThe author's actions might have been inconsiderate, especially considering the coworker's sensitivity. Even if clipping nails isn't a rule violation, it's a matter of respecting others' comfort levels. The follow-up action of clipping two more nails after being asked could be seen as disrespectful or defiant, leading to more conflict.\n\nSo, weighing both sides: The author might be in the wrong for not considering the coworker's feelings and escalating the situation by clipping more nails. The coworker was within their rights to express discomfort, but the author's response and actions could have been more respectful. Therefore, the answer would be A (Yes, the author is in the wrong).\n"
