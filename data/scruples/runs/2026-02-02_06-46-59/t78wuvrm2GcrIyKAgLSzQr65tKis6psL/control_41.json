And there were some conflicting feelings about whether or not she was the asshole.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nYesterday, my friend remarked to a coworker that she had a hanging nail and was glad she had her nail clippers to take care of it. Coworker B was walking by and overheard. Coworker B walked into friend's cubicle and demand she NOT clip her nails at work because that was disgusting. Coworker B then retreats back to her cubicle on the other side of the floor.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy friend then clips her hanging nail in her own cubicle. And then clipped two more to \"even things out\".  She then receives a text message from Coworker B that she could hear her clipping her nails from over 100 feet away. And it was absolutely disgusting. And why would anyone do something so gross in a public place.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy friend responded, \"chill out\".\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo... Is clipping your fingernails at work as asshole thing to do? This is where the debate started last night- is it super gross as coworker B feels, or is it fine?  Is my friend the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let me try to figure this out. The situation is about a friend clipping her nails at work and a coworker getting upset about it. The question is whether the friend is in the wrong.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. Clipping nails can be a normal activity, but doing it in a workplace might depend on the environment. If it's a shared space or an open office, maybe it's more disruptive. The friend mentioned having a hanging nail, which probably needed trimming to avoid discomfort or injury. That seems reasonable.\n\nBut then, Coworker B reacted strongly, calling it disgusting and even hearing it from 100 feet away. The friend clipped more nails after the initial incident, which might have made the situation worse. The friend's response of \"chill out\" could come off as dismissive, not taking the coworker's feelings into account.\n\nWorkplace etiquette often involves being considerate of others. If the act of clipping nails is loud or causes discomfort to others, maybe it's better to do it before or after work. However, sometimes people might not realize the noise or impact. But in this case, the friend continued after being told to stop, which could be seen as inconsiderate.\n\nOn the other hand, Coworker B might have overreacted, but the friend's actions did escalate by clipping more nails. The key points are the reaction of the coworker and the friend's response. The friend might be at fault for not heeding the request and continuing the behavior, causing further disruption. So, considering both sides, the friend might be in the wrong.\n"
