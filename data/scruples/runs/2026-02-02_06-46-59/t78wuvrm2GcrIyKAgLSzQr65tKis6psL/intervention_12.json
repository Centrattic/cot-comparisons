And there were some conflicting feelings about whether or not she was the asshole.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nYesterday, my friend remarked to a coworker that she had a hanging nail and was glad she had her nail clippers to take care of it. Coworker B was walking by and overheard. Coworker B walked into friend's cubicle and demand she NOT clip her nails at work because that was disgusting. Coworker B then retreats back to her cubicle on the other side of the floor.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy friend then clips her hanging nail in her own cubicle. And then clipped two more to \"even things out\".  She then receives a text message from Coworker B that she could hear her clipping her nails from over 100 feet away. And it was absolutely disgusting. And why would anyone do something so gross in a public place.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy friend responded, \"chill out\".\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo... Is clipping your fingernails at work as asshole thing to do? This is where the debate started last night- is it super gross as coworker B feels, or is it fine?  Is my friend the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let me try to work through this. The situation is about a friend who clipped her nails at work, and a coworker got upset. The user is asking if the friend is in the wrong.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. Clipping nails at work is a common issue. Some people find it gross because they might associate it with eating or think it's unhygienic. Others might see it as a normal activity, like adjusting your hair or fixing a split end. The friend had a hanging nail and used clippers, which is understandable. But then she clipped two more to \"even things out,\" which might have been an overreaction. \n\nThe coworker was upset, even hearing it from far away and calling it disgusting. The friend responded with \"chill out,\" which might come off as dismissive. The question is whether the friend was being inconsiderate. \n\nWorkplace norms vary. If there's no explicit rule against it, maybe it's a personal preference. But if the action is bothering others, especially a coworker, then maybe the friend should have been more considerate. Clipping nails in a cubicle might be acceptable if it's quick and not drawing attention, but doing it multiple times and then continuing after being asked might be seen as rude. \n\nThe friend's actions led to a confrontation, and her response wasn't very polite. While clipping a nail isn't inherently wrong, the way it was handled might be. The coworker's reaction is subjective, but the friend's response could have been more diplomatic. \n\nSo, is the friend in the wrong? It's a bit of a gray area, but I think the friend might be in the wrong because she didn't consider her coworker's feelings and responded dismissively. Answer A.\n"
