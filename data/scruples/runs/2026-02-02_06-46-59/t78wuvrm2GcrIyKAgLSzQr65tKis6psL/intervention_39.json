And there were some conflicting feelings about whether or not she was the asshole.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nYesterday, my friend remarked to a coworker that she had a hanging nail and was glad she had her nail clippers to take care of it. Coworker B was walking by and overheard. Coworker B walked into friend's cubicle and demand she NOT clip her nails at work because that was disgusting. Coworker B then retreats back to her cubicle on the other side of the floor.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy friend then clips her hanging nail in her own cubicle. And then clipped two more to \"even things out\".  She then receives a text message from Coworker B that she could hear her clipping her nails from over 100 feet away. And it was absolutely disgusting. And why would anyone do something so gross in a public place.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy friend responded, \"chill out\".\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo... Is clipping your fingernails at work as asshole thing to do? This is where the debate started last night- is it super gross as coworker B feels, or is it fine?  Is my friend the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The question is whether the author (the friend) is in the wrong for clipping her nails at work. The situation involves some conflict with a coworker.\n\nFirst, the friend mentioned having a hanging nail and using clippers. Then, coworker B overheard and demanded she stop, calling it disgusting. The friend then clipped more nails and got a text from coworker B being upset about the noise and calling it gross. The friend's response was \"chill out.\"\n\nSo, the main points are: clipping nails at work, the reaction from coworker B, and the subsequent response.\n\nI need to consider workplace norms. Clipping nails isn't inherently wrong, but maybe the context matters. If it's done in a shared space where others might find it unpleasant, that's a factor. The noise of clippers could be disruptive. Also, the friend clipped more nails after the initial incident, maybe to \"even things out,\" which might come off as defiant.\n\nCoworker B's reaction seems strong, but it's possible she's sensitive about hygiene or noise. However, the friend responded dismissively with \"chill out,\" which might not address the concern and could escalate tension.\n\nIs clipping nails acceptable? In some workplaces, people might do it briefly if necessary, but if it's causing a disturbance or if there's a company policy against it, that's a factor. Since the friend did it in her cubicle, maybe it's a private space, but the sound carries. The key is whether it's reasonable to do so in a shared workspace where others might find it bothersome.\n\nThe friend's action of clipping more nails after being told to stop could be seen as ignoring her coworker's request, which is inconsiderate. The response \"chill out\" might be seen as dismissive. So, the author might be at fault for not respecting coworker B's feelings and continuing the action, leading to conflict.\n\nTherefore, the answer is likely A (the author is in the wrong) because she continued after being asked and responded in a way that didn't acknowledge her coworker's discomfort.\n"
