And there were some conflicting feelings about whether or not she was the asshole.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nYesterday, my friend remarked to a coworker that she had a hanging nail and was glad she had her nail clippers to take care of it. Coworker B was walking by and overheard. Coworker B walked into friend's cubicle and demand she NOT clip her nails at work because that was disgusting. Coworker B then retreats back to her cubicle on the other side of the floor.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy friend then clips her hanging nail in her own cubicle. And then clipped two more to \"even things out\".  She then receives a text message from Coworker B that she could hear her clipping her nails from over 100 feet away. And it was absolutely disgusting. And why would anyone do something so gross in a public place.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy friend responded, \"chill out\".\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo... Is clipping your fingernails at work as asshole thing to do? This is where the debate started last night- is it super gross as coworker B feels, or is it fine?  Is my friend the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author (the friend) is in the wrong for clipping her nails at work. The story goes that the friend had a hanging nail and used clippers. A coworker overheard her comment, then confronted her, saying it's disgusting. The friend clipped more nails after, and then the coworker texted her again, upset about the noise. The friend told her to \"chill out.\"\n\nSo, the main question is: Is clipping nails at work an asshole move? The user wants to know if the author is wrong here. Let me think about the factors here.\n\nFirst, workplace etiquette. Some people find clipping nails in the workplace to be unhygienic or distracting. Others might see it as a quick fix for a minor issue, especially if done discreetly. The friend did it in her own cubicle, so maybe not in a shared space. But the coworker was clearly bothered by both the action and the noise.\n\nThe friend's response of \"chill out\" might have been dismissive. That could come off as rude, especially if the coworker was genuinely uncomfortable. But the coworker directly confronted and then followed up with a text, which could be seen as overreacting.\n\nIs there a company policy about this? The scenario doesn't mention any, so maybe it's not explicitly forbidden. However, common courtesy suggests that if a colleague is uncomfortable, even if the action isn't against the rules, it's better to adjust to avoid conflict. The friend clipped more nails after the initial confrontation, possibly escalating the issue. That might be seen as ignoring the coworker's discomfort, which isn't considerate.\n\nOn the other hand, clipping a nail to prevent injury (like a split) could be necessary. But doing it in a way that's not disruptive is key. The noise and the act itself being visible might be the problem. The friend's response was dismissive, which could make the situation worse.\n\nSo, considering all that, the friend might not be the asshole because the action isn't inherently wrong, but the response and continued clipping after being told to stop could make her the asshole. However, the coworker's reaction was also intense. It's a bit of a gray area, but maybe the friend is at fault for not respecting the coworker's feelings after being made aware of them. Hence, answer A (yes, in the wrong) might be appropriate. But some might say B (not in the wrong) since it's not against the rules. Hmm. The question is whether the author is in the wrong. The key is whether their actions crossed into disrespecting others' comfort. The friend continued despite the complaint, which is a problem. So likely answer A.\n"
