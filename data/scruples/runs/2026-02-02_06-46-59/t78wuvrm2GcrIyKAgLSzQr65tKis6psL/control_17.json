And there were some conflicting feelings about whether or not she was the asshole.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nYesterday, my friend remarked to a coworker that she had a hanging nail and was glad she had her nail clippers to take care of it. Coworker B was walking by and overheard. Coworker B walked into friend's cubicle and demand she NOT clip her nails at work because that was disgusting. Coworker B then retreats back to her cubicle on the other side of the floor.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy friend then clips her hanging nail in her own cubicle. And then clipped two more to \"even things out\".  She then receives a text message from Coworker B that she could hear her clipping her nails from over 100 feet away. And it was absolutely disgusting. And why would anyone do something so gross in a public place.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy friend responded, \"chill out\".\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo... Is clipping your fingernails at work as asshole thing to do? This is where the debate started last night- is it super gross as coworker B feels, or is it fine?  Is my friend the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The question is whether the author (the friend) is in the wrong for clipping her nails at work. So first, let's recap the situation.\n\nThe friend mentions having a hanging nail and uses her clippers to fix it. Then Coworker B overhears and demands she not do that because it's disgusting. The friend then clips more nails to even them out, and Coworker B texts her again, upset because she could hear the clipping from far away. The friend responds with \"chill out.\"\n\nNow, the debate is whether clipping nails at work is gross or not. The user wants to know if the author is the asshole (A) or not (B). \n\nHmm. Let's think about workplace norms. Some people might find nail clipping gross because the sound can be annoying, and the act itself might be considered unhygienic or unprofessional in certain environments. However, in other workplaces, it's a common thing people do discreetly, maybe even expected to maintain personal grooming.\n\nThe friend did it in her cubicle, which is a private space. But Coworker B was upset because she could hear it from 100 feet away. That suggests the sound was loud or persistent, which could be a valid complaint. The friend clipped three nails, which might not be excessive, but if it's done in a way that's disturbing others, that could be an issue.\n\nAlso, the friend's response of \"chill out\" might be seen as dismissive, not acknowledging Coworker B's discomfort. That could make things worse. However, Coworker B initially demanded she stop, then continued to be upset after the fact.\n\nIs there a policy against this? The question doesn't mention any. So if the workplace doesn't have a rule, the friend isn't necessarily violating company policy. But if it's affecting others' comfort, maybe she should consider doing it during breaks or in a more private area.\n\nOn the other hand, Coworker B's reaction might be over the top. Not everyone has the same standards, and some might find it gross while others don't. The friend might be within her rights to do something personal in her workspace, but if it's causing a disturbance, maybe she should be more mindful.\n\nSo balancing both sides: The friend isn't necessarily in the wrong because there's no rule against it, but she could have been more considerate. However, since Coworker B was clearly disturbed and the friend continued, which led to a text complaint, maybe the friend did cross a line. But the answer depends on whether the action itself is considered unprofessional regardless of others' reactions.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the friend's actions are fine, and Coworker B is being overly sensitive. The friend responded appropriately with \"chill out,\" implying that Coworker B is overreacting. If the workplace is supposed to be inclusive of different preferences, maybe the friend isn't at fault.\n\nI think the key here is whether the action is unprofessional. If the workplace has no specific rules, then it's a matter of social norms. In some offices, clipping nails is looked down upon because it's seen as messy or unprofessional. In others, it's a quick personal task. The friend's cubicle is her workspace; she might have a right to do personal things there, but the loudness of the clippers and the fact that Coworker B was specifically bothered by it might tip the balance.\n\nSo, considering that the friend did it in her own cubicle, but the sound was disturbing to someone else, and she continued after a complaint, maybe she's in the wrong. But if Coworker B's reaction is unreasonable, then she isn't. The answer might be B (not in the wrong) because the action itself isn't inherently wrong unless there's a policy. But the social aspect complicates it. Maybe the friend should have been more considerate, but she's not the asshole. So, B.\n"
