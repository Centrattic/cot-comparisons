And there were some conflicting feelings about whether or not she was the asshole.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nYesterday, my friend remarked to a coworker that she had a hanging nail and was glad she had her nail clippers to take care of it. Coworker B was walking by and overheard. Coworker B walked into friend's cubicle and demand she NOT clip her nails at work because that was disgusting. Coworker B then retreats back to her cubicle on the other side of the floor.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy friend then clips her hanging nail in her own cubicle. And then clipped two more to \"even things out\".  She then receives a text message from Coworker B that she could hear her clipping her nails from over 100 feet away. And it was absolutely disgusting. And why would anyone do something so gross in a public place.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy friend responded, \"chill out\".\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo... Is clipping your fingernails at work as asshole thing to do? This is where the debate started last night- is it super gross as coworker B feels, or is it fine?  Is my friend the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The question is whether the author (the friend) is the asshole for clipping her nails at work. \n\nFirst, the situation: She mentions her nail was hanging, used clippers in her cubicle. Coworker B overhears, gets upset, tells her not to do it, and then later texts her again about hearing the clipping from far away. The friend clips more nails after the initial one to \"even things out\" and responds with \"chill out.\"\n\nSo, is it appropriate to clip nails at work? Well, work environments can have different norms. Some people might find nail clipping gross because of the sound or the mess. But others might see it as a personal grooming task, especially if done in a private space like a cubicle.\n\nThe friend did it in her own cubicle, which is probably more private than a common area. But coworker B is clearly very bothered by it. The friend continued after being told, even clipping more nails. The response \"chill out\" might come off as dismissive, which could escalate the situation.\n\nBut on the other hand, the friend had a valid reason (a hanging nail) and was being proactive. The coworker's reaction seems over the top, but maybe in a shared workspace, some sounds are unavoidable. The key factors here are the setting (private cubicle vs. public area), the reason (immediate need vs. unnecessary), and the reaction to the complaint.\n\nThe friend didn't do it in a shared space, so maybe it's understandable. However, continuing after being asked could be problematic. But the coworker might have a valid hygiene concern. It's a bit of a gray area. The friend's actions led to the coworker being distressed, but the coworker's response is also extreme. \n\nHmm, the answer depends on whether the action itself is considered unprofessional or gross in that workplace. If the company has a policy against it, then yes. But if not, maybe not. Since the friend did it in her cubicle, it's less of an issue. But the act of clipping nails in an office is generally frowned upon by some. The friend's \"chill out\" might have been a mistake in tone. \n\nOverall, maybe the friend isn't entirely in the wrong, but there's room for argument. However, considering that she did it in her own space and it's a minor personal grooming task, perhaps she's not the asshole. So answer B.\n"
