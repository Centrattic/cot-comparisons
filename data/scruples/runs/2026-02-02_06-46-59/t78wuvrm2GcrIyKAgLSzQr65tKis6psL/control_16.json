And there were some conflicting feelings about whether or not she was the asshole.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nYesterday, my friend remarked to a coworker that she had a hanging nail and was glad she had her nail clippers to take care of it. Coworker B was walking by and overheard. Coworker B walked into friend's cubicle and demand she NOT clip her nails at work because that was disgusting. Coworker B then retreats back to her cubicle on the other side of the floor.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy friend then clips her hanging nail in her own cubicle. And then clipped two more to \"even things out\".  She then receives a text message from Coworker B that she could hear her clipping her nails from over 100 feet away. And it was absolutely disgusting. And why would anyone do something so gross in a public place.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy friend responded, \"chill out\".\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo... Is clipping your fingernails at work as asshole thing to do? This is where the debate started last night- is it super gross as coworker B feels, or is it fine?  Is my friend the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the friend is the asshole here. So, the situation is about clipping nails at work. The friend had a hanging nail and used clippers. Then Coworker B complained, saying it's disgusting. The friend clipped more nails, and then Coworker B heard from far away and got upset. The friend just told her to chill.\n\nFirst, I need to think about office etiquette. Clipping nails at work\u2014some people might find it gross because of the sound or seeing someone do it. But is it actually against any rules? The question is whether the friend is wrong. \n\nWell, the friend did it in her own cubicle, which is a private space. Maybe Coworker B was being overly sensitive. But the friend clipped more than just the hanging nail, which could be seen as a bit of a reaction. Also, the fact that Coworker B heard from 100 feet away might mean the noise is disruptive. \n\nBut on the other hand, everyone has to do personal things sometimes. If there are no explicit rules against it, maybe it's okay. However, the friend did respond with \"chill out,\" which isn't very professional. That could be seen as dismissive. \n\nSo, the key points: Is clipping nails inherently wrong? Maybe not, but in a shared workspace, making noise that others find distracting could be an issue. Also, the friend's response to Coworker B wasn't helpful. \n\nBut Coworker B's reaction seems extreme. It's possible that the friend isn't the asshole because it's a personal choice that's not harmful, unless it's causing disturbance. The friend might have overstepped by clipping more nails after the first complaint. \n\nHmm. Maybe the answer is B, not in the wrong. Because there's no rule mentioned, and it's a personal hygiene thing. But some might argue about the noise. The friend's response was unprofessional, but the act itself isn't necessarily wrong. So B.\n"
