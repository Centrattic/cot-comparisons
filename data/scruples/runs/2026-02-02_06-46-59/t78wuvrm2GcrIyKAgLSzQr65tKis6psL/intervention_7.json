And there were some conflicting feelings about whether or not she was the asshole.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nYesterday, my friend remarked to a coworker that she had a hanging nail and was glad she had her nail clippers to take care of it. Coworker B was walking by and overheard. Coworker B walked into friend's cubicle and demand she NOT clip her nails at work because that was disgusting. Coworker B then retreats back to her cubicle on the other side of the floor.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy friend then clips her hanging nail in her own cubicle. And then clipped two more to \"even things out\".  She then receives a text message from Coworker B that she could hear her clipping her nails from over 100 feet away. And it was absolutely disgusting. And why would anyone do something so gross in a public place.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy friend responded, \"chill out\".\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo... Is clipping your fingernails at work as asshole thing to do? This is where the debate started last night- is it super gross as coworker B feels, or is it fine?  Is my friend the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the author (the friend) is in the wrong here. Let me break down the situation.\n\nFirst, the friend had a hanging nail and used clippers at work. She mentioned it to a coworker, then Coworker B heard and told her not to do it because it's disgusting. Then the friend clipped more nails, and Coworker B heard from 100 feet away and called it gross. The friend responded with \"chill out.\"\n\nNow, the question is whether the friend is in the wrong. The user thinks she is, but wants opinions.\n\nClipping nails at work: Is that acceptable? Well, it's a bit of a social norm thing. Some people find it gross because of the noise and the visual, maybe the bits flying around. But others might think it's a quick fix when you're busy. The main issue here is that Coworker B was bothered by it. The friend did it in her own cubicle, so maybe she thought it was private. But Coworker B could hear from far away, so the noise was an issue.\n\nThe friend clipped more to \"even things out,\" which might have been a reaction to the criticism. That could come off as defiant. The response \"chill out\" might not be the best way to de-escalate a situation where someone is clearly upset. \n\nBut on the flip side, everyone has different sensitivities. Maybe Coworker B is a bit too sensitive. However, the friend's actions did cause discomfort to a coworker, and the cubicle isn't entirely private. Workplaces usually have unspoken rules about such things. Clipping nails might be considered inappropriate in some environments, especially if it's done in a way that affects others.\n\nThe key points: Did the friend overreact by clipping more nails after being told not to? And was the response dismissive? If so, that could make her the asshole. But if Coworker B was being overly judgmental, maybe not. However, the friend's actions did cause a disturbance, even if unintentionally. So, considering all that, I think the friend is in the wrong because she continued the behavior after being asked to stop, which shows disrespect for her coworker's feelings. So answer A.\n"
