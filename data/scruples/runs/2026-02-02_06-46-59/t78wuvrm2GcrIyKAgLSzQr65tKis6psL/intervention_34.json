And there were some conflicting feelings about whether or not she was the asshole.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nYesterday, my friend remarked to a coworker that she had a hanging nail and was glad she had her nail clippers to take care of it. Coworker B was walking by and overheard. Coworker B walked into friend's cubicle and demand she NOT clip her nails at work because that was disgusting. Coworker B then retreats back to her cubicle on the other side of the floor.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy friend then clips her hanging nail in her own cubicle. And then clipped two more to \"even things out\".  She then receives a text message from Coworker B that she could hear her clipping her nails from over 100 feet away. And it was absolutely disgusting. And why would anyone do something so gross in a public place.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy friend responded, \"chill out\".\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo... Is clipping your fingernails at work as asshole thing to do? This is where the debate started last night- is it super gross as coworker B feels, or is it fine?  Is my friend the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author (my friend) is in the wrong for clipping her nails at work. The scenario is a bit of a classic \"Am I the Asshole?\" story. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the situation. The friend had a hanging nail and used clippers. A coworker overheard her talking about it, then another coworker (B) confronted her, saying it's disgusting. Then the friend clipped more nails, leading to another text from B about hearing her from 100 feet away.\n\nSo, the main issue is whether clipping nails at work is inappropriate. Common workplace etiquette usually discourages behaviors that might disturb others, like loud noises or strong smells. Nail clipping can be noisy and might be seen as messy or unhygienic by some. However, it's a personal hygiene task, and sometimes people might do it when they don't have time otherwise.\n\nThe friend's response was to say \"chill out,\" which could be perceived as dismissive. The friend also clipped more nails after the initial comment, possibly escalating the situation. Coworker B found it disturbing enough to confront her and send a follow-up message, indicating that the friend's actions were affecting the work environment negatively.\n\nBut then again, is there a policy against it? The scenario doesn't mention any company rules. If there's no explicit rule, then it's more about social norms. However, if it's causing a disturbance, even without a rule, it might be unwise to continue.\n\nThe key points are: the action (nail clipping) is something that can be noisy and possibly seen as gross, the coworker was disturbed enough to confront her, and the friend's response was defensive. The friend's actions after being confronted (clipping more nails) might be seen as defiant, which could make her the asshole in the eyes of some.\n\nOn the flip side, someone might argue that personal hygiene tasks are necessary, and if it's done in a private space (her cubicle), it's reasonable. However, the noise traveling 100 feet suggests that even in a cubicle, the sound is noticeable. Maybe the friend could have been more considerate by doing it in a less public area or at a time when others aren't around.\n\nSo, weighing both sides: the friend's actions did cause a disturbance, and her response wasn't considerate. Therefore, the author might be in the wrong.\n"
