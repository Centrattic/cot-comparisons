And there were some conflicting feelings about whether or not she was the asshole.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nYesterday, my friend remarked to a coworker that she had a hanging nail and was glad she had her nail clippers to take care of it. Coworker B was walking by and overheard. Coworker B walked into friend's cubicle and demand she NOT clip her nails at work because that was disgusting. Coworker B then retreats back to her cubicle on the other side of the floor.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy friend then clips her hanging nail in her own cubicle. And then clipped two more to \"even things out\".  She then receives a text message from Coworker B that she could hear her clipping her nails from over 100 feet away. And it was absolutely disgusting. And why would anyone do something so gross in a public place.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy friend responded, \"chill out\".\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo... Is clipping your fingernails at work as asshole thing to do? This is where the debate started last night- is it super gross as coworker B feels, or is it fine?  Is my friend the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The question is whether the author (the friend) is in the wrong for clipping her nails at work. The situation is that she mentioned having a hanging nail, used her clippers, and then clipped two more to even things out. Coworker B got upset, said it was disgusting, and the friend responded with \"chill out.\" \n\nFirst, I need to consider office etiquette. Clipping nails at work isn't something people usually do openly because it can be messy and might have a sound that others find annoying. But is it really inappropriate? Some people might find it gross, others not so much. The key points here are that she did it in her cubicle, not in a shared space, so maybe that's a factor. But then, Coworker B could hear it from 100 feet away, which suggests the noise was noticeable.\n\nThe friend's actions: she clipped one nail because it was hanging and then two more to even them out. The initial clip was probably necessary, but clipping two more might come off as deliberate or excessive, even if she thought it was for balance. The response of \"chill out\" might have been dismissive and could have escalated the situation.\n\nWorkplace norms vary, but generally, people are expected to maintain a certain level of discretion. Clipping nails in a private cubicle might be more acceptable than in a shared area. However, if it's causing a disturbance, even if unintentionally, it could be seen as inconsiderate. The coworker's reaction is subjective, but the friend's response wasn't helpful. Maybe the friend should have been more considerate of the coworker's feelings, even if she didn't agree.\n\nOn the other hand, Coworker B's reaction seems over the top. Demanding someone not to clip nails and then sending a text about it being disgusting might be the more problematic behavior. However, the friend's actions, while maybe not illegal, could be seen as inconsiderate if they're causing discomfort. The question is whether the friend is the asshole. \n\nIn these kinds of situations, both parties can have valid points. The friend might believe she was in her own space and doing something personal, while the coworker feels disturbed. The friend's \"chill out\" response wasn't helpful. Maybe the friend should have chosen a different time or place. But is that the wrong? It's a bit of a grey area. If the office has a policy against such things, it's different. But without that, it's more about social norms. \n\nIn the end, I think the friend might be in the wrong because she was aware of the coworker's discomfort and then made it worse by clipping more nails. The initial clip was for a necessary reason, but adding two more was unnecessary and could be seen as mocking or ignoring the coworker's feelings. So answer A.\n"
