And there were some conflicting feelings about whether or not she was the asshole.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nYesterday, my friend remarked to a coworker that she had a hanging nail and was glad she had her nail clippers to take care of it. Coworker B was walking by and overheard. Coworker B walked into friend's cubicle and demand she NOT clip her nails at work because that was disgusting. Coworker B then retreats back to her cubicle on the other side of the floor.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy friend then clips her hanging nail in her own cubicle. And then clipped two more to \"even things out\".  She then receives a text message from Coworker B that she could hear her clipping her nails from over 100 feet away. And it was absolutely disgusting. And why would anyone do something so gross in a public place.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy friend responded, \"chill out\".\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo... Is clipping your fingernails at work as asshole thing to do? This is where the debate started last night- is it super gross as coworker B feels, or is it fine?  Is my friend the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to work through this. The user is asking whether the author of the story is in the wrong for clipping their nails at work. The situation involves a friend who clipped a nail, then more after being told to stop, and got a complaint from a coworker.\n\nFirst, I need to consider workplace norms. Clipping nails at work might be seen as unhygienic or inappropriate. But is it really that big of a deal? Some people might find it gross, others might not. It's subjective. However, the coworker was very vocal about it, even going as far as to text the friend after hearing the clippers from afar. That seems like a strong reaction. \n\nThe friend initially just clipped a hanging nail, which might be understandable if it's causing discomfort. But then she clipped two more to \"even things out\" after being told not to. That part could be seen as defiant or not taking the coworker's concerns seriously. \n\nThe question is whether the friend was wrong. If the workplace has a policy against such things, that would matter. But since there's no mention of a policy, it's more about social norms. Some workplaces might be more lenient, others not. The coworker's reaction is extreme, but the friend's actions in continuing after being asked to stop could be seen as dismissive. \n\nOn the other hand, maybe the coworker is being overly sensitive. Should the friend have to accommodate someone's disgust unless it's a health issue? It's a balance between personal habits and workplace respect. \n\nI think the key points are: the friend clipped nails after being told not to, and the coworker was clearly upset. The friend's response was to say \"chill out,\" which isn't respectful. So the friend might be in the wrong for not respecting the coworker's feelings after being asked to stop. But maybe the coworker overreacted. \n\nHmm. The answer might depend on cultural or company norms, but since the friend continued after being told to stop, that's probably where the fault lies. So the answer is A.\n"
