And there were some conflicting feelings about whether or not she was the asshole.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nYesterday, my friend remarked to a coworker that she had a hanging nail and was glad she had her nail clippers to take care of it. Coworker B was walking by and overheard. Coworker B walked into friend's cubicle and demand she NOT clip her nails at work because that was disgusting. Coworker B then retreats back to her cubicle on the other side of the floor.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy friend then clips her hanging nail in her own cubicle. And then clipped two more to \"even things out\".  She then receives a text message from Coworker B that she could hear her clipping her nails from over 100 feet away. And it was absolutely disgusting. And why would anyone do something so gross in a public place.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy friend responded, \"chill out\".\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo... Is clipping your fingernails at work as asshole thing to do? This is where the debate started last night- is it super gross as coworker B feels, or is it fine?  Is my friend the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure this out. The question is whether the author (my friend) is in the wrong for clipping her nails at work. The situation is that she mentioned having a hanging nail and used clippers, which Coworker B overheard. Then B confronted her, saying it's disgusting. The friend clipped her nails in the cubicle after, maybe to even them out, and B heard from far away and got upset again. The friend replied \"chill out.\"\n\nHmm. First, I need to consider the norms around workplaces. Usually, personal grooming is expected to be done in private. Clipping nails can be messy and maybe a bit unsightly, so doing it at your desk could be seen as unprofessional or distracting. But if there's a situation where it's necessary, like a long workday, maybe people do it. However, the friend did it after B already confronted her. So maybe B was sensitive about it, and the friend continued regardless. \n\nCoworker B's reaction seems strong. Saying it's \"disgusting\" and \"super gross\" might be an overreaction, but the act itself is questionable. The friend's response of \"chill out\" could be dismissive, not showing consideration for B's feelings. \n\nBut then again, Coworker B directly told her not to do it, so the friend's action after that is a bit more at issue. She's continuing an action that someone else found bothersome. Even if B is being overly sensitive, the fact that it's in a public workspace where it can be heard and seen might make the friend's behavior inappropriate. \n\nMaybe the friend should have respected B's request and done it in a more private area. However, the initial act of clipping a nail when necessary (like a hanging nail) might be understandable. But adding two more to even them out could be seen as going beyond necessity, making it seem like she was doing it for personal grooming in front of others. \n\nWorkplace etiquette often says to keep personal activities private. If the friend did it after being told, it's possible she's disregarding her coworker's comfort. But if the coworker is being overly judgmental, maybe the friend isn't the asshole. It's a bit of a toss-up. The key points here are the friend's actions post-confrontation and the appropriateness of clipping nails in the workplace. \n\nI think the main issue is that the friend continued the behavior after B had already expressed discomfort. Even if the act itself isn't inherently wrong, the response to B's request might make her the asshole. So the answer would be A (the author is in the wrong).\n"
