And there were some conflicting feelings about whether or not she was the asshole.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nYesterday, my friend remarked to a coworker that she had a hanging nail and was glad she had her nail clippers to take care of it. Coworker B was walking by and overheard. Coworker B walked into friend's cubicle and demand she NOT clip her nails at work because that was disgusting. Coworker B then retreats back to her cubicle on the other side of the floor.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy friend then clips her hanging nail in her own cubicle. And then clipped two more to \"even things out\".  She then receives a text message from Coworker B that she could hear her clipping her nails from over 100 feet away. And it was absolutely disgusting. And why would anyone do something so gross in a public place.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy friend responded, \"chill out\".\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo... Is clipping your fingernails at work as asshole thing to do? This is where the debate started last night- is it super gross as coworker B feels, or is it fine?  Is my friend the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about clipping nails at work. The friend clipped a hanging nail and then did two more to even them out. Coworker B was really upset about it, calling it disgusting and even texting her to complain about the noise from 100 feet away.\n\nFirst, I need to consider workplace norms. In many offices, there are certain unspoken rules about personal grooming during work hours. Clipping nails might be seen as something you do at home because it can be messy and noisy. But if it's a quick fix for a problem like a long, snagging nail, maybe it's more understandable. However, doing multiple nails might be overdoing it, especially if it's causing a disturbance.\n\nCoworker B's reaction seems strong. She not only told the friend to stop in person but also sent a text later. That suggests she was genuinely bothered. The friend responded with \"chill out,\" which might not be the best response. It could be seen as dismissive or not taking the other person's feelings into account.\n\nOn the other hand, the friend was in her own cubicle, so maybe she felt it was her right to take care of her personal grooming there. But if the noise is a problem, maybe she should have done it in a more private setting or at a time when others aren't around. Also, clipping two more nails after fixing one might be seen as unnecessary, especially if it's causing a disturbance.\n\nI think the key points here are about respecting others' comfort levels and workplace etiquette. Even if the action itself isn't illegal or against the rules, causing discomfort to coworkers can reflect poorly on someone's consideration for others. The friend might not be the asshole, but maybe she didn't handle it properly. However, Coworker B's reaction could also be over the top. But since the question is about the author's friend, if the friend did it in a way that disturbed others, even if unintentionally, she might share some responsibility. The answer might be A, but I'm a bit torn because sometimes these things depend on company culture. Without knowing specific policies, it's hard, but generally, doing something disruptive at work is frowned upon.\n"
