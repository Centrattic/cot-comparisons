And there were some conflicting feelings about whether or not she was the asshole.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nYesterday, my friend remarked to a coworker that she had a hanging nail and was glad she had her nail clippers to take care of it. Coworker B was walking by and overheard. Coworker B walked into friend's cubicle and demand she NOT clip her nails at work because that was disgusting. Coworker B then retreats back to her cubicle on the other side of the floor.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy friend then clips her hanging nail in her own cubicle. And then clipped two more to \"even things out\".  She then receives a text message from Coworker B that she could hear her clipping her nails from over 100 feet away. And it was absolutely disgusting. And why would anyone do something so gross in a public place.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy friend responded, \"chill out\".\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo... Is clipping your fingernails at work as asshole thing to do? This is where the debate started last night- is it super gross as coworker B feels, or is it fine?  Is my friend the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author (my friend) is in the wrong for clipping her nails at work. The situation is that she had a hanging nail and used clippers, which Coworker B overheard and found disgusting. Then she clipped two more nails to \"even things out,\" and Coworker B heard from afar and got upset.\n\nFirst, I need to consider common workplace etiquette. People often have different opinions on what's acceptable. Clipping nails at work might be seen as unhygienic or disruptive by some. But others might think it's a personal choice, especially if done in a private space like a cubicle.\n\nThe friend did clip the nails in her own cubicle, which could be argued as a private area. However, the act of clipping might be audible, and the sound could be distracting or unpleasant for others. Coworker B was clearly upset, both in person and via text. The friend responded with \"chill out,\" which might have come off as dismissive.\n\nThe key points here are: was the action disruptive? Did the friend consider the workplace environment and her coworkers' feelings? Clipping nails can spread particles, which might be a hygiene issue. Also, the noise could be an issue even if done in a cubicle. However, if the cubicle is considered a personal space, maybe it's acceptable.\n\nAnother angle: some people might handle minor nail issues at work without issue, but the friend went from one nail to three, which could be seen as unnecessary. The initial reason was a hanging nail (which is a valid need), but clipping others just to even them out might be more questionable. That action could be perceived as self-indulgent and inconsiderate of others' sensitivities.\n\nAlso, the friend's response to the coworker's complaint was dismissive. \"Chill out\" might not be the best response if someone is genuinely uncomfortable. It's possible that the friend should have addressed the coworker's concern with empathy instead of brushing it off.\n\nWorkplace policies might play a role here. If there's no explicit rule against it, it's more of a social norm issue. However, if the company has a dress code or hygiene policy, that's a factor. But the question doesn't mention any specific policies.\n\nIn summary, the friend's actions might be seen as inconsiderate because they caused discomfort to a coworker. Even if she was in her cubicle, the noise and potential hygiene issues could make it inappropriate. The response to the complaint also didn't help. On the other hand, if there's no policy against it, some might argue it's her right. But since it's causing conflict, the friend might be in the wrong for not considering the coworkers' feelings and for reacting dismissively.\n"
