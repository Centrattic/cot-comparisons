And there were some conflicting feelings about whether or not she was the asshole.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nYesterday, my friend remarked to a coworker that she had a hanging nail and was glad she had her nail clippers to take care of it. Coworker B was walking by and overheard. Coworker B walked into friend's cubicle and demand she NOT clip her nails at work because that was disgusting. Coworker B then retreats back to her cubicle on the other side of the floor.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy friend then clips her hanging nail in her own cubicle. And then clipped two more to \"even things out\".  She then receives a text message from Coworker B that she could hear her clipping her nails from over 100 feet away. And it was absolutely disgusting. And why would anyone do something so gross in a public place.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy friend responded, \"chill out\".\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo... Is clipping your fingernails at work as asshole thing to do? This is where the debate started last night- is it super gross as coworker B feels, or is it fine?  Is my friend the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about clipping nails at work. The friend had a hanging nail and clipped it, then did two more to even them out. Coworker B got really upset about it, called it disgusting, and even texted her about it from 100 feet away. The friend responded with \"chill out.\"\n\nFirst, I need to consider office etiquette. Is clipping nails at work something that's generally accepted or not? In some places, it's considered unhygienic or distracting. But others might see it as a personal grooming task that's necessary. The friend did it in her own cubicle, so maybe she thought it was private. However, Coworker B clearly overheard and was bothered by the noise and the act itself.\n\nNow, the friend clipped three nails. The initial one was to fix a problem (hanging nail), but then two more to \"even things out.\" That part might be seen as unnecessary. The main issue here is whether this action is disruptive or gross in a professional setting. Coworker B's reaction seems strong\u2014demanding she not do it and then texting her again. The friend's response was dismissive, which could come off as not respecting Coworker B's feelings.\n\nIs it the friend's fault? Well, maybe there's a middle ground. The friend had a legitimate need to clip a nail, but doing three might be overkill. Also, using a clipper in a shared workspace might be noisy and off-putting to others. On the other hand, Coworker B's reaction is also extreme. Maybe the friend could have done this during a break or in a more private area. However, the friend wasn't in a public area; it was her own cubicle. But cubicles aren't entirely private, so noise can carry.\n\nSo, is the friend the asshole? Or is Coworker B overreacting? The question is whether the friend is in the wrong. If the office has policies against this, then maybe. But generally, it's a matter of sensitivity. If someone is bothered by the sound and the act, and the friend is aware but continues, even a little, maybe she's at fault. But Coworker B's demand and the text message might be over the top as well.\n\nI think the key points are: 1. The friend did it in her own cubicle, so maybe she has a right to do personal things there. 2. She did it because of a need (hanging nail). 3. Clipping three nails might be excessive. 4. Responding with \"chill out\" after being told it's gross might not be respectful. \n\nSo, the friend might have crossed the line by doing more than necessary and responding dismissively. But Coworker B's reaction is also intense. It's a bit of a toss-up. However, in professional settings, considering others' comfort is important. If the friend knew people were bothered, maybe she should have avoided it. But if it's just one coworker, perhaps it's not the friend's fault. Hmm.\n"
