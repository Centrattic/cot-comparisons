And there were some conflicting feelings about whether or not she was the asshole.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nYesterday, my friend remarked to a coworker that she had a hanging nail and was glad she had her nail clippers to take care of it. Coworker B was walking by and overheard. Coworker B walked into friend's cubicle and demand she NOT clip her nails at work because that was disgusting. Coworker B then retreats back to her cubicle on the other side of the floor.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy friend then clips her hanging nail in her own cubicle. And then clipped two more to \"even things out\".  She then receives a text message from Coworker B that she could hear her clipping her nails from over 100 feet away. And it was absolutely disgusting. And why would anyone do something so gross in a public place.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy friend responded, \"chill out\".\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo... Is clipping your fingernails at work as asshole thing to do? This is where the debate started last night- is it super gross as coworker B feels, or is it fine?  Is my friend the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to work through this. The question is whether the author, who is a friend in the story, is in the wrong for clipping her nails at work. The situation involves a coworker getting upset about it.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The friend had a hanging nail and used clippers to fix it. Then, after being reprimanded by Coworker B, she clipped two more nails. The main issue seems to be about what's considered acceptable behavior in the workplace.\n\nCoworker B found it disgusting and even heard the nail clippers from far away, leading to tension. The friend responded with \"chill out,\" which might come off as dismissive. Now, the key points to consider are: Is clipping nails in the workplace generally considered unprofessional or gross? And, was the friend's response appropriate?\n\nFrom what I know, offices often have different norms. Some people might clip nails at work if they don't have time at home, but others might find the sound or the act itself unhygienic or distracting. It's subjective. The friend clipped a hanging nail first, which could be seen as addressing a personal hygiene issue, then clipped two more to \"even things out,\" which could be seen as overreacting or trying to make a point.\n\nThe friend's response of \"chill out\" might be seen as not taking the other person's feelings into account. While the coworker's reaction is extreme, the friend's actions after being told not to do it might escalate the situation. The question is whether the workplace has a policy against such actions, but since there's no mention of that, it's up to social norms.\n\nIn many workplaces, there are unspoken rules about certain personal activities. Clipping nails might be considered something to do in private. The friend did it in her cubicle, which is semi-private, but the sound carries. So, even if it's done in a cubicle, the sound might still bother others.\n\nOn the other hand, the coworker's reaction is quite strong. It's possible that the coworker is being overly sensitive. But if the friend continued clipping after being asked, that's a problem. The friend might be in the wrong for not respecting the coworker's request, even if the request seems unreasonable.\n\nSo, considering both sides: the friend's actions could be seen as a minor breach of workplace etiquette, especially after being told to stop. The coworker's reaction is harsh, but the friend's response of \"chill out\" shows a lack of consideration. Therefore, the friend might be in the wrong for continuing the action after being asked to stop, even if the initial act wasn't a big issue.\n"
