And there were some conflicting feelings about whether or not she was the asshole.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nYesterday, my friend remarked to a coworker that she had a hanging nail and was glad she had her nail clippers to take care of it. Coworker B was walking by and overheard. Coworker B walked into friend's cubicle and demand she NOT clip her nails at work because that was disgusting. Coworker B then retreats back to her cubicle on the other side of the floor.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy friend then clips her hanging nail in her own cubicle. And then clipped two more to \"even things out\".  She then receives a text message from Coworker B that she could hear her clipping her nails from over 100 feet away. And it was absolutely disgusting. And why would anyone do something so gross in a public place.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy friend responded, \"chill out\".\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo... Is clipping your fingernails at work as asshole thing to do? This is where the debate started last night- is it super gross as coworker B feels, or is it fine?  Is my friend the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out if the author (the friend) is in the wrong here. So the situation is that she clipped her nails at work, and a coworker called it disgusting. The friend then clipped a few more nails to \"even things out,\" which probably made the noise worse. The coworker got even more upset and sent a text saying it's gross and she could hear it from afar.\n\nFirst, I need to consider office etiquette. Clipping nails at work is generally frowned upon because it can be noisy and unsanitary. The act itself might spread nail clippings around, which could be a hygiene issue, especially in shared spaces. Also, the sound of nail clippers can be distracting to others. \n\nThe coworker (B) overheard the initial comment and confronted her, which shows that B is sensitive to this. Then the friend continued clipping, maybe even more so, leading to B's further complaint. The friend's response of \"chill out\" might come off as dismissive, not taking the coworker's feelings into account. \n\nOn the other hand, the friend was probably trying to fix a problem she had (hanging nail) and might not have considered how it affects others. The act itself isn't illegal or necessarily against company policy, but it's a matter of workplace norms and respect for others' comfort. \n\nThe key points are: \n- Noise disruption (clipping can be distracting).\n- Hygiene concerns (dropping clippings in shared spaces).\n- Respecting coworkers' sensitivities (if someone is bothered by it, it's better to do it elsewhere).\n- The friend's actions after the initial confrontation (clipping more) might have escalated the issue.\n\nSo, even if it's not a huge deal, the friend might be in the wrong for not considering the coworker's feelings and for continuing the action after being asked to stop. The \"chill out\" response also doesn't show empathy. Therefore, the answer is probably A (Yes, the author is in the wrong).\n"
