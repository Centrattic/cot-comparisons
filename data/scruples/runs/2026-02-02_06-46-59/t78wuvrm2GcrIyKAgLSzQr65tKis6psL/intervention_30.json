And there were some conflicting feelings about whether or not she was the asshole.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nYesterday, my friend remarked to a coworker that she had a hanging nail and was glad she had her nail clippers to take care of it. Coworker B was walking by and overheard. Coworker B walked into friend's cubicle and demand she NOT clip her nails at work because that was disgusting. Coworker B then retreats back to her cubicle on the other side of the floor.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy friend then clips her hanging nail in her own cubicle. And then clipped two more to \"even things out\".  She then receives a text message from Coworker B that she could hear her clipping her nails from over 100 feet away. And it was absolutely disgusting. And why would anyone do something so gross in a public place.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy friend responded, \"chill out\".\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo... Is clipping your fingernails at work as asshole thing to do? This is where the debate started last night- is it super gross as coworker B feels, or is it fine?  Is my friend the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about clipping nails at work. The friend clipped a hanging nail and then did two more to even them out. Coworker B was really upset about it, called it disgusting, and even heard it from 100 feet away.\n\nFirst, I need to consider workplace norms. Some people might find nail clipping gross because of the noise or the mess. It's possible that the office has an unspoken rule against such things during work hours. On the other hand, if someone has a long hangnail, it might be uncomfortable or unhygienic to leave it. But then again, using clippers in a shared space might disturb others, especially if it's noisy.\n\nThe friend's response was \"chill out,\" which might come off as dismissive. That could escalate the situation instead of resolving it. Maybe the friend should have considered Coworker B's feelings more and perhaps done it in a private area if possible. However, if the office doesn't have private spaces, it's understandable that someone would do it at their desk. But the act of doing it repeatedly after being asked might be seen as disrespectful.\n\nSo, is clipping nails inherently an asshole move? It's subjective. Some might say it's a personal hygiene issue, others find the sound annoying. The key points are whether the friend was considerate of others' feelings and if there was a way to do it without causing disturbance. Since Coworker B was clearly bothered and the friend continued, maybe the friend didn't take her concerns seriously enough. Therefore, the author might be in the wrong by not respecting the coworker's discomfort and persisting in the action after being asked to stop. So Answer A.\n"
