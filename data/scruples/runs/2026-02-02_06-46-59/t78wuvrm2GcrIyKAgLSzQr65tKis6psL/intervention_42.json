And there were some conflicting feelings about whether or not she was the asshole.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nYesterday, my friend remarked to a coworker that she had a hanging nail and was glad she had her nail clippers to take care of it. Coworker B was walking by and overheard. Coworker B walked into friend's cubicle and demand she NOT clip her nails at work because that was disgusting. Coworker B then retreats back to her cubicle on the other side of the floor.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy friend then clips her hanging nail in her own cubicle. And then clipped two more to \"even things out\".  She then receives a text message from Coworker B that she could hear her clipping her nails from over 100 feet away. And it was absolutely disgusting. And why would anyone do something so gross in a public place.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy friend responded, \"chill out\".\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo... Is clipping your fingernails at work as asshole thing to do? This is where the debate started last night- is it super gross as coworker B feels, or is it fine?  Is my friend the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The question is whether the author (the friend) is in the wrong for clipping her nails at work. \n\nFirst, the situation: a friend mentions having a hanging nail and uses clippers. Coworker B overhears and tells her not to do it because it's disgusting. The friend then clips her nails in her cubicle, even trimming two more to even things out. Coworker B texts her that she could hear it from 100 feet away and calls it gross. The friend responds with \"chill out.\"\n\nThe key points here are about workplace etiquette and personal boundaries. Clipping nails might be a common task, but doing it at work could be seen as unprofessional or disruptive. The friend did it in her cubicle, which is semi-private, but the sound traveled, causing Coworker B to complain. The friend's response of \"chill out\" might be seen as dismissive, especially if Coworker B is genuinely disturbed by it.\n\nIn many workplaces, there are informal norms about personal grooming. If Coworker B found it gross and the friend continued, maybe the friend is disregarding her colleague's feelings. Even if it's not against any formal policy, causing discomfort through noise or perceived unprofessionalism might make the friend the asshole. However, some might argue that it's a minor issue and the friend isn't at fault. But given that Coworker B was clearly upset and the friend's response was confrontational, it tilts towards the friend being in the wrong.\n"
