And there were some conflicting feelings about whether or not she was the asshole.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nYesterday, my friend remarked to a coworker that she had a hanging nail and was glad she had her nail clippers to take care of it. Coworker B was walking by and overheard. Coworker B walked into friend's cubicle and demand she NOT clip her nails at work because that was disgusting. Coworker B then retreats back to her cubicle on the other side of the floor.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy friend then clips her hanging nail in her own cubicle. And then clipped two more to \"even things out\".  She then receives a text message from Coworker B that she could hear her clipping her nails from over 100 feet away. And it was absolutely disgusting. And why would anyone do something so gross in a public place.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy friend responded, \"chill out\".\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo... Is clipping your fingernails at work as asshole thing to do? This is where the debate started last night- is it super gross as coworker B feels, or is it fine?  Is my friend the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story (the author) is in the wrong. The scenario involves a friend who clipped her nails at work, and a coworker got upset about it. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The friend had a hanging nail, which might be uncomfortable or unsanitary if left. She used nail clippers in her cubicle, which is her workspace. The coworker overheard the comment, walked over, and told her not to do it, then later complained via text that she could hear it from far away.\n\nNow, is clipping nails at work inherently wrong? It's a common practice, but some people find it gross. The key points here are: the friend was in her own cubicle, didn't do it in a shared space, and after the initial reprimand, she did it again. The coworker seems particularly sensitive, maybe to the sound or the act itself.\n\nWorkplace norms can vary. Some offices might have policies against certain behaviors. But if there's no explicit rule, then maybe it's a matter of personal preference. The friend's action was in her cubicle, so she wasn't disturbing others directly, except for the sound. The coworker reacted strongly, which might suggest a personal issue rather than a professional one. However, the friend did continue after being told not to, which could be seen as dismissive or not respecting the coworker's feelings.\n\nThe response \"chill out\" might not be the best approach, as it could be perceived as antagonistic. However, the coworker's initial reaction might be over the top. The question is whether the friend overstepped or if the coworker was being unreasonable. \n\nIn terms of workplace etiquette, some people might clip nails during breaks or in restrooms, but if it's a minor action in a private space, maybe it's acceptable. The friend's reasoning was to \"even things out,\" implying she felt the need to fix other nails after the first one, which could be seen as necessary. \n\nSo, is the friend in the wrong? It depends on the workplace culture. If the coworker is particularly bothered, maybe the friend should consider doing it elsewhere. But since it was in her cubicle and not a shared area, maybe it's acceptable. The friend's actions might not be the main issue, but the coworker's reaction is excessive. However, the friend's response was dismissive, which might contribute to the problem. \n\nOverall, I think the answer is B (No, the author is not in the wrong), because the action was in a private space and not overtly disruptive beyond the sound, which others might find annoying but isn't a universal issue. The coworker's reaction is more the problem here.\n"
