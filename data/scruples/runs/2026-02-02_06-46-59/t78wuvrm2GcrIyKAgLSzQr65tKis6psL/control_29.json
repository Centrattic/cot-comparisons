And there were some conflicting feelings about whether or not she was the asshole.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nYesterday, my friend remarked to a coworker that she had a hanging nail and was glad she had her nail clippers to take care of it. Coworker B was walking by and overheard. Coworker B walked into friend's cubicle and demand she NOT clip her nails at work because that was disgusting. Coworker B then retreats back to her cubicle on the other side of the floor.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy friend then clips her hanging nail in her own cubicle. And then clipped two more to \"even things out\".  She then receives a text message from Coworker B that she could hear her clipping her nails from over 100 feet away. And it was absolutely disgusting. And why would anyone do something so gross in a public place.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy friend responded, \"chill out\".\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo... Is clipping your fingernails at work as asshole thing to do? This is where the debate started last night- is it super gross as coworker B feels, or is it fine?  Is my friend the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The question is whether the author (the friend) is in the wrong for clipping her nails at work. The situation involves a coworker getting upset about it.\n\nFirst, the friend had a hanging nail and clipped it. The coworker overheard, confronted her, and later sent a text expressing disgust. The friend then clipped two more nails after the initial one, leading to more complaints.\n\nSo, is clipping nails at work inherently wrong? It's a common activity people do when they're on the go. Some might find the sound annoying, especially if they're nearby. But is it gross or inappropriate? It depends on the workplace culture. In many offices, doing quick personal grooming like clipping nails isn't unheard of, as long as it's done discreetly. However, if it's causing disturbance or discomfort to others, that could be an issue.\n\nThe key points here are the reaction of Coworker B. She was upset enough to confront the friend and send a text. The friend's response was \"chill out,\" which might come off as dismissive. The friend clipping more nails after the initial complaint could be seen as insensitive, as she continued despite knowing it bothered someone else.\n\nBut the original action\u2014clipping a hanging nail\u2014is practical. However, doing it in a shared workspace might not consider others' sensitivities. The friend's decision to clip more nails after being told to stop might tip the balance towards her being in the wrong. She didn't take the other person's feelings into account and continued the behavior that was causing distress. \n\nOn the other hand, Coworker B's reaction might be over the top. Not everyone would find nail clipping gross, and some might think it's a normal thing to do. The workplace should ideally accommodate minor personal tasks unless they're disruptive. But if the sound is particularly loud or persistent, it can be an issue.\n\nIn this case, the friend did clip nails after being asked to stop, which shows a lack of consideration for the coworker's feelings. So, the author might be in the wrong for continuing the action that was bothering someone else. Therefore, the answer is A (Yes, the author is in the wrong).\n"
