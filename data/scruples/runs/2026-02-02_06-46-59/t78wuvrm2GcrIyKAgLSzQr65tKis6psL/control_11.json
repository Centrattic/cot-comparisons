And there were some conflicting feelings about whether or not she was the asshole.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nYesterday, my friend remarked to a coworker that she had a hanging nail and was glad she had her nail clippers to take care of it. Coworker B was walking by and overheard. Coworker B walked into friend's cubicle and demand she NOT clip her nails at work because that was disgusting. Coworker B then retreats back to her cubicle on the other side of the floor.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy friend then clips her hanging nail in her own cubicle. And then clipped two more to \"even things out\".  She then receives a text message from Coworker B that she could hear her clipping her nails from over 100 feet away. And it was absolutely disgusting. And why would anyone do something so gross in a public place.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy friend responded, \"chill out\".\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo... Is clipping your fingernails at work as asshole thing to do? This is where the debate started last night- is it super gross as coworker B feels, or is it fine?  Is my friend the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The question is whether the friend who clipped her nails at work is in the wrong. The situation starts with her mentioning a hanging nail and using clippers. Then Coworker B overhears, gets upset, and demands she not do it. The friend proceeds to clip more nails and then gets another complaint from Coworker B.\n\nFirst, I need to consider office etiquette. Clipping nails at work is a common topic of debate. Some people find it gross because they associate it with bad hygiene or think it's unprofessional. Others might see it as practical if someone needs to fix a hangnail quickly. The friend was in her own cubicle, which might be considered her personal space, but the sound carried to another coworker, causing offense.\n\nThe key points here are: 1) The friend initially clipped a hanging nail, which is a common issue. 2) Coworker B overheard, got upset, and told her not to. 3) The friend continued clipping, even doing more nails, which might have been in response to Coworker B's outburst. 4) The friend responded with \"chill out,\" which could be seen as dismissive or flippant.\n\nIs the friend in the wrong? Well, in an office setting, even if it's in her own cubicle, the sound might disturb others. The fact that Coworker B was clearly upset and the friend continued suggests she wasn't considerate of others' feelings. Also, responding with \"chill out\" might not be the best approach in resolving the situation. However, clipping a hangnail isn't inherently wrong, but the context and reaction matter. If the workplace has policies against it, that's a factor, but the scenario doesn't mention any. So, it's more about social norms and workplace etiquette.\n\nOn the other hand, Coworker B's reaction is quite strong, calling it \"disgusting\" and \"gross,\" which might be an overreaction. But the friend's actions after the initial complaint\u2014clipping more nails and not stopping\u2014could be seen as inconsiderate. The friend didn't take the feedback seriously, which might make her the asshole. Alternatively, if Coworker B is particularly sensitive, maybe she's being too strict.\n\nI think the main issue is that the friend continued after being told it was a problem. Even if clipping a hangnail is okay in some contexts, doing more after someone has expressed discomfort shows a lack of consideration. The response \"chill out\" also comes off as dismissive. So, the friend's actions after the initial complaint are the problem. Therefore, the answer would be A (the author is in the wrong) because she didn't respect her coworker's feelings and continued the behavior after being asked to stop.\n"
