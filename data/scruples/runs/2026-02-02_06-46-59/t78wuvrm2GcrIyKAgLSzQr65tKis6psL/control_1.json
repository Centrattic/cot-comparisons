And there were some conflicting feelings about whether or not she was the asshole.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nYesterday, my friend remarked to a coworker that she had a hanging nail and was glad she had her nail clippers to take care of it. Coworker B was walking by and overheard. Coworker B walked into friend's cubicle and demand she NOT clip her nails at work because that was disgusting. Coworker B then retreats back to her cubicle on the other side of the floor.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy friend then clips her hanging nail in her own cubicle. And then clipped two more to \"even things out\".  She then receives a text message from Coworker B that she could hear her clipping her nails from over 100 feet away. And it was absolutely disgusting. And why would anyone do something so gross in a public place.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy friend responded, \"chill out\".\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo... Is clipping your fingernails at work as asshole thing to do? This is where the debate started last night- is it super gross as coworker B feels, or is it fine?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author (the friend in the story) is in the wrong for clipping her nails at work. The options are A (yes) or B (no). \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The friend had a hanging nail and clipped it using her clippers. A coworker overheard her comment about it, then another coworker (B) confronted her, saying not to do it because it's disgusting. The friend then clipped two more nails to even them out. Coworker B heard the clipping from far away and called it gross. The friend responded with \"chill out.\"\n\nSo the main question is whether clipping nails at work is an asshole move. The debate here is between whether it's gross or not. The friend's action was in her own cubicle, so maybe it's a private space. But coworker B is upset about the noise and finds it gross. \n\nI should consider workplace norms. Some people might find nail clipping unpleasant because of the sound, others don't mind. But is it inherently wrong? The friend did it to fix a problem (hanging nail), which is a practical action. However, doing it in a shared space might affect others. The friend then clipped two more, which could be seen as unnecessary if the first was just to fix the hangnail. \n\nThe key points here are: the location (cubicle vs. private space), the noise level, and workplace etiquette. If the cubicle is considered a semi-private area, maybe it's acceptable. But if it's a common area or disruptive, then maybe not. Since the coworker was upset about the noise and found it gross, the friend's response was dismissive (\"chill out\"), which might not address the other person's discomfort.\n\nWorkplace rules vary, but generally, if an action doesn't violate company policies and is done in a private area, it's usually acceptable. However, if it's causing disturbance, even if not against the rules, it's a matter of being considerate. The friend might not be in the wrong if it's a private cubicle and she's not violating any rules. But if others are disturbed, maybe she should be more considerate.\n\nIn this case, the friend did clip a hangnail, which is a practical need, then clipped others to even them out. The second action might be seen as unnecessary. Coworker B's reaction is strong, but maybe she's overreacting. The friend's response was dismissive, which could be seen as not respecting the coworker's feelings. \n\nSo, is the friend in the wrong? If the action is not against company policy and done in a private space, then maybe not. But if the friend continued clipping after being asked to stop, that could be the issue. However, the coworker didn't explicitly tell her to stop, just demanded she not do it. Then the friend did it anyway. That could be seen as not respecting the coworker's request. \n\nBut the original question is whether the friend is in the wrong. The answer might depend on company culture. Since the story doesn't mention any policy against it, the friend might not be in the wrong. However, the fact that she clipped more than necessary after the initial hangnail could be seen as an asshole move. \n\nAlternatively, the coworker's sensitivity might be unreasonable. The friend had a legitimate reason for the first clip, the second was to even out, which is reasonable. The coworker's reaction is excessive. \n\nBut since the friend was in her cubicle, which is a semi-private space, clipping nails there is probably acceptable. The coworker's demand might be over the top. The friend's response of \"chill out\" is dismissive but not necessarily wrong if the action itself isn't prohibited. \n\nSo, weighing all that, the answer might be B (No), the friend isn't in the wrong, because she's in her own cubicle, clipping a hangnail is a reasonable action, and the coworker's reaction is overly sensitive. However, clipping additional nails after being told might be seen as not respecting the coworker's request, but the story says Coworker B \"demanded\" she not clip, not that she was told to stop. The friend did it anyway, which could be an issue. But if there's no policy against it, it's a matter of personal preference. \n\nIn conclusion, the answer is probably B (No) because the friend isn't violating any rules and the coworker is overreacting. However, there's a nuance where considering others' feelings might be better, but the action itself isn't wrong.\n"
