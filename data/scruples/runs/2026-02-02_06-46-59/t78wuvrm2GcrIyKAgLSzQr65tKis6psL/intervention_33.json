And there were some conflicting feelings about whether or not she was the asshole.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nYesterday, my friend remarked to a coworker that she had a hanging nail and was glad she had her nail clippers to take care of it. Coworker B was walking by and overheard. Coworker B walked into friend's cubicle and demand she NOT clip her nails at work because that was disgusting. Coworker B then retreats back to her cubicle on the other side of the floor.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy friend then clips her hanging nail in her own cubicle. And then clipped two more to \"even things out\".  She then receives a text message from Coworker B that she could hear her clipping her nails from over 100 feet away. And it was absolutely disgusting. And why would anyone do something so gross in a public place.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy friend responded, \"chill out\".\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo... Is clipping your fingernails at work as asshole thing to do? This is where the debate started last night- is it super gross as coworker B feels, or is it fine?  Is my friend the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author (the friend in the story) is in the wrong for clipping her nails at work. The situation is that she had a hanging nail, mentioned it to a coworker, and then another coworker, B, overheard and told her not to do it because it's disgusting. The friend then clipped her nail, then two more, and got a text from coworker B about hearing the clippers from far away again.\n\nFirst, I need to consider what's considered acceptable workplace behavior. Clipping nails at work isn't something I've heard of being explicitly prohibited in most workplaces unless there are specific policies against it. But there's also the aspect of being considerate to others. If coworker B finds it gross and is disturbed by the sound, the friend might be inconsiderate by continuing, especially after being asked to stop.\n\nThe friend did clip her nails in her own cubicle, which might be considered a private space, but the sound travels. The initial act of clipping a hanging nail might be seen as necessary, but then clipping two more \"to even things out\" seems unnecessary and possibly done to spite coworker B's reaction. That could come off as defiant or not respecting the other person's feelings. \n\nHowever, coworkers also have unreasonable expectations sometimes. If coworker B is overly sensitive about sounds and cleanliness, maybe the friend isn't entirely at fault. But the friend did respond with \"chill out,\" which shows a dismissive attitude towards coworker B's feelings. That might be where the issue is. \n\nWorkplace etiquette often involves balancing personal needs with the comfort of others. If there's no policy against it, but someone is being disturbed, maybe the solution is to clip nails during times when others aren't around, like during lunch or breaks. But in this case, the friend did it in her own cubicle, so it's a bit of a gray area. However, continuing after being explicitly told it's disturbing could tip the balance towards the friend being inconsiderate. \n\nSo, considering all that, the friend might be in the wrong because she didn't take into account coworker B's discomfort after being made aware of it. Clipping nails in an enclosed space might be acceptable, but ignoring the other person's reaction and escalating by clipping more nails could be seen as inconsiderate. Therefore, the answer might be A.\n"
