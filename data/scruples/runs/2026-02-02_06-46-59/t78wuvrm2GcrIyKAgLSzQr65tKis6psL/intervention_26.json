And there were some conflicting feelings about whether or not she was the asshole.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nYesterday, my friend remarked to a coworker that she had a hanging nail and was glad she had her nail clippers to take care of it. Coworker B was walking by and overheard. Coworker B walked into friend's cubicle and demand she NOT clip her nails at work because that was disgusting. Coworker B then retreats back to her cubicle on the other side of the floor.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy friend then clips her hanging nail in her own cubicle. And then clipped two more to \"even things out\".  She then receives a text message from Coworker B that she could hear her clipping her nails from over 100 feet away. And it was absolutely disgusting. And why would anyone do something so gross in a public place.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy friend responded, \"chill out\".\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo... Is clipping your fingernails at work as asshole thing to do? This is where the debate started last night- is it super gross as coworker B feels, or is it fine?  Is my friend the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The question is whether the author (the friend) is in the wrong for clipping her nails at work. \n\nFirst, the situation: the friend had a hanging nail and used clippers. Coworker B overheard her comment, then approached and told her not to do it in the office. Then the friend clipped two more nails, probably to make them even. Coworker B heard the clipping from 100 feet away and found it disgusting. The friend responded with \"chill out.\"\n\nNow, considering workplace norms. Nail clipping can be seen as unhygienic or disruptive, depending on the workplace culture. Some offices might have policies against it because of the noise or mess, while others might allow it. The key points here are:\n\n1. Coworker B directly confronted the friend, indicating that this behavior isn't acceptable in their workplace. The friend then continued, which might show a lack of consideration for others' feelings or workplace rules.\n2. Clipping nails in a shared space can be disruptive\u2014noise (which Coworker B specifically mentions) and possible debris. The friend's response of \"chill out\" might be seen as dismissive of Coworker B's concerns.\n3. The friend might argue that it's a personal hygiene issue and that Coworker B is being overly sensitive. However, if the workplace has certain expectations, not following them could be seen as inconsiderate.\n\nOn the other hand, the friend was probably trying to take care of a minor issue quickly. But if the workplace has unspoken rules or if coworkers are clearly bothered, then she might be at fault for continuing after being asked to stop.\n\nSo, balancing these factors, the friend's actions after being told to stop could be seen as inconsiderate. Therefore, the author might be in the wrong.\n"
