And there were some conflicting feelings about whether or not she was the asshole.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nYesterday, my friend remarked to a coworker that she had a hanging nail and was glad she had her nail clippers to take care of it. Coworker B was walking by and overheard. Coworker B walked into friend's cubicle and demand she NOT clip her nails at work because that was disgusting. Coworker B then retreats back to her cubicle on the other side of the floor.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy friend then clips her hanging nail in her own cubicle. And then clipped two more to \"even things out\".  She then receives a text message from Coworker B that she could hear her clipping her nails from over 100 feet away. And it was absolutely disgusting. And why would anyone do something so gross in a public place.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy friend responded, \"chill out\".\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo... Is clipping your fingernails at work as asshole thing to do? This is where the debate started last night- is it super gross as coworker B feels, or is it fine?  Is my friend the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about clipping nails at work. Let me go through the details again.\n\nThe author's friend mentioned having a hanging nail and using clippers. Then coworker B overheard and told her not to clip nails at work because it's disgusting. The friend did clip her nail, then clipped two more to \"even things out.\" Then coworker B heard the clippers from over 100 feet away and called it gross. The friend responded with \"chill out.\" Now, the question is whether the friend (and by extension the author) is the asshole.\n\nHmm. First, is clipping nails at work inherently wrong? Some people might find it gross, others not. But work environments can vary. Maybe company policy? The question doesn't mention any rules against it, so maybe it's a cultural or personal preference issue.\n\nCoworker B seems really upset about it, even going out of her way to confront the friend and then text her again. The friend clipped her nails in her own cubicle, which is a private space. But the sound traveling 100 feet might be an issue if the workspace is open. Maybe the friend's cubicle isn't soundproof, so the noise is heard by others.\n\nBut is the friend in the wrong? If there's no explicit rule against it, maybe it's up to personal boundaries. The friend did it for a practical reason (a hanging nail) but then clipped more for balance. The response of \"chill out\" might be dismissive of coworker B's feelings. However, if coworker B's reaction is over the top, maybe the friend isn't at fault.\n\nI think it's a B (not in the wrong). Clipping nails in a private cubicle isn't inherently wrong unless it's prohibited. Coworker B's reaction is more about personal discomfort than a real harm. The friend's actions were reasonable, even if they annoyed someone. The friend responded calmly, so she's not being aggressive. The issue is more about differing sensitivities rather than a clear right or wrong.\n"
