And there were some conflicting feelings about whether or not she was the asshole.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nYesterday, my friend remarked to a coworker that she had a hanging nail and was glad she had her nail clippers to take care of it. Coworker B was walking by and overheard. Coworker B walked into friend's cubicle and demand she NOT clip her nails at work because that was disgusting. Coworker B then retreats back to her cubicle on the other side of the floor.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy friend then clips her hanging nail in her own cubicle. And then clipped two more to \"even things out\".  She then receives a text message from Coworker B that she could hear her clipping her nails from over 100 feet away. And it was absolutely disgusting. And why would anyone do something so gross in a public place.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy friend responded, \"chill out\".\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo... Is clipping your fingernails at work as asshole thing to do? This is where the debate started last night- is it super gross as coworker B feels, or is it fine?  Is my friend the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. So, the situation is about a friend clipping their nails at work and getting backlash from a coworker. The friend was initially just fixing a hanging nail, but then clipped more to even things out after being confronted. The coworker found it disgusting and complained, leading the friend to respond with \"chill out.\" The user is asking if the friend is in the wrong.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the social norms in a workplace. Nail clipping might be considered inappropriate in some offices because it's seen as unsanitary or distracting. But it's also a common, necessary task. The key points here are: the friend did it in her own cubicle, which is a semi-private space, and she did it after being told not to. The coworker was very insistent, even claiming she could hear it from 100 feet away. \n\nThe friend's response of \"chill out\" might come off as dismissive. Even if the friend felt her actions were reasonable, the coworker's reaction is valid from her perspective. In a shared work environment, respecting others' comfort levels is important. The friend escalated the situation by clipping more nails after the initial complaint, which could be seen as defiant. \n\nOn the other hand, the coworker might be overly sensitive. Some people might not mind nail clipping if it's done discreetly. But since the coworker felt it was gross and it's affecting her, the friend should consider that. The workplace should be a respectful environment where both parties can coexist without causing undue stress. \n\nSo, is the friend in the wrong? If the company has a policy against such actions, that's a factor. But assuming there's no policy, the friend might be at fault for not considering the coworker's feelings after being directly told to stop. The response of \"chill out\" doesn't show empathy. However, the coworker's reaction could also be excessive. It's a bit of a gray area, but leaning towards the friend being in the wrong because they continued the action after being asked to stop and didn't handle the situation diplomatically.\n"
