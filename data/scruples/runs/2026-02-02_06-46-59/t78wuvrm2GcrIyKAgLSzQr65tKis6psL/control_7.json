And there were some conflicting feelings about whether or not she was the asshole.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nYesterday, my friend remarked to a coworker that she had a hanging nail and was glad she had her nail clippers to take care of it. Coworker B was walking by and overheard. Coworker B walked into friend's cubicle and demand she NOT clip her nails at work because that was disgusting. Coworker B then retreats back to her cubicle on the other side of the floor.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy friend then clips her hanging nail in her own cubicle. And then clipped two more to \"even things out\".  She then receives a text message from Coworker B that she could hear her clipping her nails from over 100 feet away. And it was absolutely disgusting. And why would anyone do something so gross in a public place.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy friend responded, \"chill out\".\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo... Is clipping your fingernails at work as asshole thing to do? This is where the debate started last night- is it super gross as coworker B feels, or is it fine?  Is my friend the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The question is whether the author (the friend) is the asshole for clipping her nails at work. \n\nFirst, the situation: The friend had a hanging nail and used clippers. Coworker B overheard her comment, got upset, and told her not to do it because it's disgusting. Then the friend clipped more nails, and Coworker B texted her about hearing it from far away and being grossed out. The friend responded with \"chill out.\"\n\nSo, the main points here are about appropriateness at work. Clipping nails at work might be seen as a hygiene or etiquette issue. Some might find nail clipping in shared spaces annoying or unhygienic, especially if it's done in a way that's audible or visible. On the other hand, the friend had a valid reason (fixing a hanging nail) and did it in her own cubicle, which could be seen as being considerate by keeping it contained.\n\nCoworker B's reaction seems strong\u2014demanding she stop and then texting to complain further. But is the friend in the wrong? If the company has a policy against such activities, maybe. But if not, it's more about personal preferences. The friend's action was to clip a nail she had a reason to fix. Clipping two more to \"even out\" might be seen as maybe overdoing it, but not necessarily wrong. The response \"chill out\" could be dismissive, but if the coworker is being overly sensitive, the friend might feel justified.\n\nWorkplace norms vary. In some environments, it's acceptable, in others not. The key here is whether the friend was being considerate. She did it in her cubicle, not in common areas. The noise might be an issue, but if she was in her own space, maybe it's acceptable. The coworker's reaction is strong, but does that make the friend wrong? It's a judgment call. The friend isn't violating any obvious rules, but the coworker is expressing discomfort. However, the friend's actions were necessary and in her own space. The answer might hinge on whether the act itself is considered gross or inappropriate. If the company doesn't have a rule against it, then the friend isn't in the wrong. But if the coworker is just being overly sensitive, then the friend's response is reasonable. So probably the answer is B, the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
