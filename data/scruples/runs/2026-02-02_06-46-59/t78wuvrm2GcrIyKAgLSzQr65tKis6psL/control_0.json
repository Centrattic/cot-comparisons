And there were some conflicting feelings about whether or not she was the asshole.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nYesterday, my friend remarked to a coworker that she had a hanging nail and was glad she had her nail clippers to take care of it. Coworker B was walking by and overheard. Coworker B walked into friend's cubicle and demand she NOT clip her nails at work because that was disgusting. Coworker B then retreats back to her cubicle on the other side of the floor.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy friend then clips her hanging nail in her own cubicle. And then clipped two more to \"even things out\".  She then receives a text message from Coworker B that she could hear her clipping her nails from over 100 feet away. And it was absolutely disgusting. And why would anyone do something so gross in a public place.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy friend responded, \"chill out\".\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo... Is clipping your fingernails at work as asshole thing to do? This is where the debate started last night- is it super gross as coworker B feels, or is it fine?  Is my friend the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author (the friend) is in the wrong for clipping her nails at work. The situation is that she mentioned having a hanging nail and used clippers. Then a coworker, B, overheard and told her not to do it because it was disgusting. The friend then clipped more nails to even them out, and coworker B texted her that she could hear it from far away and called it gross. The friend responded with \"chill out.\" The question is whether the author is the asshole here.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both perspectives. On one hand, clipping nails at work can be seen as unhygienic or distracting. Some people find the sound annoying, and there might be workplace policies against such activities. Coworker B's reaction is based on personal discomfort and possibly company rules.\n\nOn the other hand, the author was in her own cubicle, which might be a private space. She didn't force anyone to listen or interact. The act of clipping a nail isn't inherently wrong, but the context matters. If the workplace has specific rules against eating or personal grooming, then it's a policy issue. But if it's just personal preference, the author might not be in the wrong. However, the friend did clip multiple nails after the initial one, which could be seen as defiant or insensitive to coworker B's feelings. The response \"chill out\" might come off as dismissive.\n\nSo, the key factors are: 1) Workplace policies on personal grooming. 2) The noise level and how it affects others. 3) The friend's response. If there are no policies, the author isn't necessarily wrong. But if the action is causing a disturbance despite a colleague's request, that's a problem. Also, the friend's action of clipping more after being told might be the asshole move. But without knowing the workplace rules, it's a bit ambiguous. However, since the question is whether the author is in the wrong, and the response was \"chill out,\" which is dismissive, maybe the author isn't the asshole. But some might argue that respecting coworkers' comfort is important. Hmm. I'm a bit torn. The answer might hinge on whether it's a private space and if it's a policy violation. If no policy, then maybe B is overreacting. So the answer could be B (not in the wrong). But if the act is generally frowned upon, maybe A. But generally, people do basic grooming at work sometimes. However, the noise and the defiance might tip it to A. I'm not sure. Need to decide based on common norms.\n"
