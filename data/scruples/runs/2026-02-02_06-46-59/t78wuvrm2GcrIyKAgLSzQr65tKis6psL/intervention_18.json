And there were some conflicting feelings about whether or not she was the asshole.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nYesterday, my friend remarked to a coworker that she had a hanging nail and was glad she had her nail clippers to take care of it. Coworker B was walking by and overheard. Coworker B walked into friend's cubicle and demand she NOT clip her nails at work because that was disgusting. Coworker B then retreats back to her cubicle on the other side of the floor.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy friend then clips her hanging nail in her own cubicle. And then clipped two more to \"even things out\".  She then receives a text message from Coworker B that she could hear her clipping her nails from over 100 feet away. And it was absolutely disgusting. And why would anyone do something so gross in a public place.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy friend responded, \"chill out\".\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo... Is clipping your fingernails at work as asshole thing to do? This is where the debate started last night- is it super gross as coworker B feels, or is it fine?  Is my friend the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author (the friend) is in the wrong here. So the situation is that she clipped her nails at work after mentioning it to a coworker. Then another coworker, B, overheard and confronted her, saying it was disgusting. The friend then clipped more nails, and B was even more upset, leading to a text message complaint.\n\nFirst, I need to consider common workplace etiquette. Clipping nails at work might be seen as unhygienic or distracting to others. Some people might find the sound annoying, as B did. But is there a policy against it? The question doesn't mention any company rules, so maybe it's not prohibited. However, even without a policy, disturbing others could be an issue.\n\nThe friend's actions: She clipped a nail when she had a problem, then clipped two more to \"even things out.\" That might be crossing a line if she realized it bothered someone but continued. The response \"chill out\" could be dismissive, not showing consideration for B's feelings.\n\nCoworker B's reaction seems strong, but maybe she's being overly sensitive. However, the key point is whether the friend's actions were inconsiderate. Since she continued after B's complaint, that suggests she didn't respect her coworker's discomfort. Even if clipping isn't against the rules, creating a hostile environment by being inconsiderate could make her the asshole.\n\nSo, is it the friend's fault? She might be at fault for not considering others' feelings after being told to stop. Answer A.\n"
