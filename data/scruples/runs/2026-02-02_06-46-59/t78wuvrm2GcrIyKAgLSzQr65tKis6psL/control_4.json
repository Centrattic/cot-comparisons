And there were some conflicting feelings about whether or not she was the asshole.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nYesterday, my friend remarked to a coworker that she had a hanging nail and was glad she had her nail clippers to take care of it. Coworker B was walking by and overheard. Coworker B walked into friend's cubicle and demand she NOT clip her nails at work because that was disgusting. Coworker B then retreats back to her cubicle on the other side of the floor.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy friend then clips her hanging nail in her own cubicle. And then clipped two more to \"even things out\".  She then receives a text message from Coworker B that she could hear her clipping her nails from over 100 feet away. And it was absolutely disgusting. And why would anyone do something so gross in a public place.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy friend responded, \"chill out\".\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo... Is clipping your fingernails at work as asshole thing to do? This is where the debate started last night- is it super gross as coworker B feels, or is it fine?  Is my friend the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

Let me read through the situation again carefully.\n\nThe friend clipped a hanging nail at work and mentioned it to a coworker. Then another coworker, B, overheard and demanded she not clip her nails because it's disgusting. The friend then clipped the hanging nail and did two more to even them out. Coworker B heard the clippers from 100 feet away and called it gross. Friend responded with \"chill out.\"\n\nThe main question is whether clipping nails at work is an asshole move. The user is asking if the author (the friend) is in the wrong.\n\nFirst, I should consider office etiquette. Some people find nail clipping gross because of the sound or the mess. If someone is doing it in a shared space, it can be annoying. But if it's in their own cubicle, maybe it's less of an issue. However, the fact that coworker B was directly told not to do it and then did it anyway might be a problem.\n\nThe friend clipped the nail after being asked not to. That could be seen as disregarding someone else's discomfort. Also, doing two more to \"even things out\" suggests she might have taken it as a challenge or ignored the request, which is not considerate.\n\nOn the other hand, maybe coworker B overreacted. The initial act of clipping a hanging nail isn't necessarily wrong. But the friend did clip more nails after being asked, which escalated the situation. The response of \"chill out\" might be dismissive of coworker B's feelings.\n\nSo, the friend did clip her nails when asked not to, which could be inconsiderate. The act itself isn't inherently wrong, but ignoring a coworker's request for their comfort might be. Therefore, the author might be at fault for continuing after being asked and responding dismissively.\n"
