And there were some conflicting feelings about whether or not she was the asshole.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nYesterday, my friend remarked to a coworker that she had a hanging nail and was glad she had her nail clippers to take care of it. Coworker B was walking by and overheard. Coworker B walked into friend's cubicle and demand she NOT clip her nails at work because that was disgusting. Coworker B then retreats back to her cubicle on the other side of the floor.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy friend then clips her hanging nail in her own cubicle. And then clipped two more to \"even things out\".  She then receives a text message from Coworker B that she could hear her clipping her nails from over 100 feet away. And it was absolutely disgusting. And why would anyone do something so gross in a public place.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy friend responded, \"chill out\".\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo... Is clipping your fingernails at work as asshole thing to do? This is where the debate started last night- is it super gross as coworker B feels, or is it fine?  Is my friend the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this problem. So the question is whether the friend who clipped her nails at work is the asshole here. The user wants a yes or no answer based on the situation provided.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the scenario. The friend mentions she had a hanging nail and used her clippers at work. A coworker, B, overheard this and then confronted her, saying not to clip nails at work because it's disgusting. Then the friend clips her nail in her cubicle, even after being told not to. She then clippers two more nails to \"even things out,\" which seems like she's doing it more after the initial reprimand. Then coworker B texts her again, upset that she can hear the clipping from 100 feet away and finds it gross. The friend responds with \"chill out.\"\n\nThe main points of contention here are: Is clipping nails at work inappropriate? Did the friend overreact by clipping more after being told not to? And is responding with \"chill out\" dismissive?\n\nClipping nails in public spaces can be seen as unhygienic or distracting by some people. However, it's a common activity that people do in private, but doing it in a shared workspace might cause discomfort to others. The friend's action of doing it in her cubicle might be considered inconsiderate if the noise and the act itself are disturbing others. The coworker B's reaction is based on finding it disgusting, which is a personal opinion, but when it affects others, like the noise being heard from afar, it becomes a workplace issue.\n\nThe friend continued the behavior even after being told not to, which shows she wasn't respecting coworker B's feelings. Then she clipped two more nails, possibly escalating the situation. The response \"chill out\" is dismissive and doesn't acknowledge the other person's discomfort. That could come off as rude or not taking their feelings seriously.\n\nBut on the other hand, coworker B might have an unreasonable sensitivity here. Clipping nails isn't illegal, but in a workplace, maintaining a respectful environment is important. The friend's actions might not be the worst thing, but they did ignore a colleague's request and continued the behavior, which could make her at fault.\n\nIn some workplaces, there might be unspoken rules about such things. If the majority find it gross, then the friend isn't considering others' feelings. However, if it's a minor issue, coworker B might be overreacting. The key here is that the friend continued after being told to stop, which is inconsiderate.\n\nSo considering all that, the friend was in her cubicle, which is a semi-private space, but the noise traveled. She persisted after a direct request, which is a problem. Her response was dismissive. Therefore, it's likely that the friend is in the wrong here.\n"
