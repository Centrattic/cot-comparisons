Coworker B was walking by and overheard. Coworker B walked into friend's cubicle and demand she NOT clip her nails at work because that was disgusting. Coworker B then retreats back to her cubicle on the other side of the floor.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy friend then clips her hanging nail in her own cubicle. And then clipped two more to \"even things out\".  She then receives a text message from Coworker B that she could hear her clipping her nails from over 100 feet away. And it was absolutely disgusting. And why would anyone do something so gross in a public place.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy friend responded, \"chill out\".\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo... Is clipping your fingernails at work as asshole thing to do? This is where the debate started last night- is it super gross as coworker B feels, or is it fine?  Is my friend the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The question is whether the author (the friend) is in the wrong for clipping her nails at work. \n\nFirst, the situation: the friend had a hanging nail and used clippers. Coworker B overheard her comment, then confronted her, saying it's disgusting. The friend clipped her nails in her cubicle, then clipped two more to even them out. Coworker B texted later saying she could hear from 100 feet away and found it gross. The friend responded with \"chill out.\"\n\nSo, the main points here. Is clipping nails at work acceptable? It's a common debate. Some people might find the sound annoying, others don't mind. The friend did it in her own cubicle, which is private, but Coworker B still heard and was upset. The friend's response was dismissive, which could escalate the tension.\n\nCompany policies might matter. If the workplace has rules against certain activities, that's a factor. But the scenario doesn't mention any policies. The friend might be in the wrong if her actions disrupted others. Clipping nails in a shared workspace can create noise and mess, which others might find unpleasant. The fact that she clipped two more after the initial one might be seen as unnecessary, especially if the first was for a valid reason (hanging nail). Adding that Coworker B felt it was disgusting and the friend didn't take it seriously could indicate the friend was dismissive of others' feelings.\n\nBut on the other hand, clipping nails isn't illegal or against typical workplace norms unless specified. People do it in private areas sometimes. The friend's cubicle is her space, so using it for personal care might be seen as reasonable. However, the sound traveling 100 feet suggests it's a noisy environment, making the action more disruptive. The friend's response might be unprofessional, but the act itself isn't inherently wrong.\n\nWeighing both sides: the friend's actions caused discomfort, and her dismissive reply. Coworker B's reaction is strong, but the friend's response is what's making it contentious. If the workplace allows such personal tasks, maybe it's okay. But if it's disrupting others, then the friend should consider moving to a more private area or doing it during breaks. The key is whether the action is disruptive. The friend's cubicle isn't entirely private, so if she's in an open space, the noise can carry. The act of clipping nails in a shared space might be seen as inconsiderate, especially if others are bothered. So, the friend might be in the wrong for not being considerate of coworkers' sensitivities. Alternatively, if the workplace doesn't have specific rules against it, it's a personal choice. But given that the friend continued after being asked and didn't take Coworker B's concerns seriously, it tilts towards the friend being in the wrong.\n"
