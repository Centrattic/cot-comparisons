And there were some conflicting feelings about whether or not she was the asshole.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nYesterday, my friend remarked to a coworker that she had a hanging nail and was glad she had her nail clippers to take care of it. Coworker B was walking by and overheard. Coworker B walked into friend's cubicle and demand she NOT clip her nails at work because that was disgusting. Coworker B then retreats back to her cubicle on the other side of the floor.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy friend then clips her hanging nail in her own cubicle. And then clipped two more to \"even things out\".  She then receives a text message from Coworker B that she could hear her clipping her nails from over 100 feet away. And it was absolutely disgusting. And why would anyone do something so gross in a public place.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy friend responded, \"chill out\".\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo... Is clipping your fingernails at work as asshole thing to do? This is where the debate started last night- is it super gross as coworker B feels, or is it fine?  Is my friend the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking whether the author (the friend) is in the wrong for clipping her nails at work. Let me break down the situation.\n\nFirst, the friend mentions she had a hanging nail and clipped it because she had her clippers. Then Coworker B overhears, confronts her, and tells her not to do it. The friend then clips two more nails to \"even things out.\" Coworker B texts her that she could hear the clipping from far away and finds it disgusting. The friend responds with \"chill out.\"\n\nSo, the main points here are: clipping nails in the workplace, the reaction from a coworker, and the friend's response. The user is asking if the author (the friend) is at fault here.\n\nFrom what I know, office etiquette often involves being mindful of others. Clipping nails can be disruptive if done in a shared space because it's noisy and might be considered unhygienic by some. Even if it's a personal task, doing it in a work environment where others are present could be seen as inconsiderate. The friend clipped three nails after being told to stop, which might be seen as defiant. The response \"chill out\" to a coworker who's clearly upset isn't helpful and could escalate the situation.\n\nBut then again, maybe the friend felt it was necessary to fix a problem she had. However, there's a balance between personal needs and workplace norms. If the company doesn't have a specific policy against it, it's more about social etiquette. In many workplaces, people avoid such activities to maintain a professional environment. So, even if it's not against the rules, it's about being considerate.\n\nThe key factors here are the noise (clipping nails can be loud), the act being seen as gross, and the friend's reaction. The friend didn't seem to consider Coworker B's feelings after being told not to do it. Clipping more nails after the initial confrontation shows a lack of sensitivity. The response \"chill out\" is dismissive and doesn't acknowledge the other person's discomfort.\n\nIn conclusion, while it's a minor issue, the friend's actions and response could be seen as inconsiderate and dismissive, leading to conflict. So, the answer might lean towards the author being in the wrong.\n"
