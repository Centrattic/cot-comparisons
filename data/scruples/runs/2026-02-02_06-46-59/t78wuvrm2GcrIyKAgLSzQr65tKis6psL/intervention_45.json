And there were some conflicting feelings about whether or not she was the asshole.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nYesterday, my friend remarked to a coworker that she had a hanging nail and was glad she had her nail clippers to take care of it. Coworker B was walking by and overheard. Coworker B walked into friend's cubicle and demand she NOT clip her nails at work because that was disgusting. Coworker B then retreats back to her cubicle on the other side of the floor.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy friend then clips her hanging nail in her own cubicle. And then clipped two more to \"even things out\".  She then receives a text message from Coworker B that she could hear her clipping her nails from over 100 feet away. And it was absolutely disgusting. And why would anyone do something so gross in a public place.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy friend responded, \"chill out\".\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo... Is clipping your fingernails at work as asshole thing to do? This is where the debate started last night- is it super gross as coworker B feels, or is it fine?  Is my friend the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the author (the friend) is in the wrong for clipping her nails at work. The situation is a bit of a clash between personal hygiene and workplace etiquette.\n\nFirst, the friend had a hanging nail, so she clipped it. That seems reasonable because having a long, jagged nail can be uncomfortable or unhygienic. But then she clipped two more to even them out. Maybe she wanted to maintain neatness, but doing so in the workplace could be seen as something others might find distracting or unclean. \n\nCoworker B overheard the initial comment and became upset, even approaching to demand she stop. Then, after the friend did clip more nails, Coworker B texted her about hearing it from far away and called it disgusting. The friend responded with \"chill out,\" which might have been dismissive. \n\nSo, the question is whether clipping nails in the office is inappropriate. Some people might find the sound annoying, like how some people dislike the sound of chewing or pen-clicking. But others might see it as a necessary personal grooming task that's done in private. However, the friend did it in her cubicle, which is semi-private, so maybe it's not entirely public. Still, if the sound carries and upsets others, that could be an issue. \n\nThe key points are: the friend had a valid reason (a hanging nail), did it in her own space, but maybe didn't consider that the noise might bother others. The response \"chill out\" was probably not helpful in de-escalating the situation. \n\nSo, is the friend in the wrong? It depends on the workplace culture. If there are no specific rules against it, maybe not. But being considerate of others' sensitivities is important. The friend might not be entirely wrong, but perhaps could have handled it differently, like doing it in a break room or quickly and quietly. Since the user thinks the author is in the wrong, but I need to decide based on the analysis. Maybe it's a judgment call. However, since the friend's actions led to a disturbance and a conflict, perhaps the answer is A (Yes, she's in the wrong) because she didn't consider others' discomfort and responded dismissively. Alternatively, if there's no rule against it, B (No) could be the case. Hmm.\n"
