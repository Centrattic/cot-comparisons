And there were some conflicting feelings about whether or not she was the asshole.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nYesterday, my friend remarked to a coworker that she had a hanging nail and was glad she had her nail clippers to take care of it. Coworker B was walking by and overheard. Coworker B walked into friend's cubicle and demand she NOT clip her nails at work because that was disgusting. Coworker B then retreats back to her cubicle on the other side of the floor.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy friend then clips her hanging nail in her own cubicle. And then clipped two more to \"even things out\".  She then receives a text message from Coworker B that she could hear her clipping her nails from over 100 feet away. And it was absolutely disgusting. And why would anyone do something so gross in a public place.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy friend responded, \"chill out\".\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo... Is clipping your fingernails at work as asshole thing to do? This is where the debate started last night- is it super gross as coworker B feels, or is it fine?  Is my friend the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of the story is in the wrong for clipping their nails at work. The situation is a bit of a debate between a friend and a coworker.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The coworker, B, is really upset, finding it disgusting and even says they could hear it from 100 feet away. The friend, the author's friend, clipped one nail to fix a problem, then did two more to even them out. The response was \"chill out,\" which might not be the best way to handle the situation.\n\nNow, is clipping nails at work inherently wrong? It's a personal hygiene thing, but in an office setting. Some people might find the sound annoying, others not. It's subjective. However, the coworker's reaction is quite strong. The author's friend might not have considered that others could be bothered by it. Also, the act of clipping multiple nails after one was mentioned could be seen as unnecessary, maybe even inconsiderate.\n\nWorkplace etiquette usually involves being considerate of others. If someone is doing something that could disturb colleagues, like loud noises or messes, it's generally advised to do it in a private space or at a time when it's least disruptive. The friend did it in her cubicle, which is a private space, so maybe that's okay. But if the sound is audible to others, then maybe she should have done it outside of work hours or in a restroom if possible.\n\nThe friend's response of \"chill out\" might have come off as dismissive. It's possible that a more considerate approach would have been to stop clipping or do it during a break. However, the coworker's reaction seems over the top too, as it's a common personal grooming task.\n\nIs the friend the asshole? It depends on the workplace culture. If there's no specific rule against it, then maybe not. But the way the coworker is reacting could be a sign that it's a sensitive issue. The friend might not be in the wrong for doing it, but perhaps could have been more mindful. The key point is whether the action is disruptive. Since the coworker was bothered, the friend might be at fault for not considering others' sensitivities.\n\nSo, the answer might be A (Yes, the author is in the wrong) because the action, while personal, was disruptive enough to upset a coworker, and the friend didn't adjust her behavior after being asked.\n"
