And there were some conflicting feelings about whether or not she was the asshole.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nYesterday, my friend remarked to a coworker that she had a hanging nail and was glad she had her nail clippers to take care of it. Coworker B was walking by and overheard. Coworker B walked into friend's cubicle and demand she NOT clip her nails at work because that was disgusting. Coworker B then retreats back to her cubicle on the other side of the floor.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy friend then clips her hanging nail in her own cubicle. And then clipped two more to \"even things out\".  She then receives a text message from Coworker B that she could hear her clipping her nails from over 100 feet away. And it was absolutely disgusting. And why would anyone do something so gross in a public place.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy friend responded, \"chill out\".\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo... Is clipping your fingernails at work as asshole thing to do? This is where the debate started last night- is it super gross as coworker B feels, or is it fine?  Is my friend the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is a friend clipped her nails at work, and a coworker got upset about it. The friend was just doing it because she had a hanging nail and wanted to fix it. But then she clipped two more to even them out. The coworker heard her clippers from 100 feet away and called it disgusting. The friend said \"chill out\" in response.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. On one hand, clipping nails in the workplace might be seen as unhygienic or disruptive. Some people might find the sound annoying or the act itself gross, especially if they're sensitive. Also, the coworker was clearly upset and confronted the friend, so the friend's action did affect someone else.\n\nOn the other hand, the friend was addressing a personal hygiene issue. She had a hanging nail, which can be painful or unsightly. It's a common task people do at home, so doing it at work might be necessary if they don't have time otherwise. The friend didn't try to hide it when she first did it, but after the confrontation, she continued, leading the coworker to hear it again.\n\nThe key points here are workplace etiquette and respect for others. Even if clipping nails isn't inherently wrong, doing it in a shared space where others might find it unpleasant could be a problem. The friend's response of \"chill out\" might come off as dismissive, not acknowledging the coworker's feelings. Also, clipping more nails after the initial complaint could be seen as not heeding the coworker's concerns, which might escalate the issue.\n\nWorkplace policies might be a factor too. If there's a rule against certain activities in common areas, that could tip the scale. But since there's no mention of a policy, it's more about social norms. Some workplaces have an unspoken rule that certain personal tasks should be done in private, like the restroom or break room. Clipping nails in a cubicle might be within the friend's space, but the noise and potential mess could affect others.\n\nAnother angle is the coworker's reaction. Maybe she overreacted, but the friend's actions did cause a disturbance. The friend's response wasn't very respectful, which could make her the asshole. However, if the coworker is overly sensitive, maybe the friend isn't entirely wrong. But in professional settings, it's usually better to be considerate of others' comfort levels. If someone is bothered by a colleague's actions, even if those actions aren't against any rules, it's good to adjust to avoid conflict.\n\nSo, putting it all together: The friend might not be in the wrong for clipping a single nail to fix a problem, but doing more after a complaint and responding dismissively could make her the asshole. The key is balancing personal needs with respect for coworkers' comfort. Since the coworker was clearly disturbed and the friend continued, the answer might lean towards the author being in the wrong. But it's a bit of a gray area. However, given the response and the follow-up action, the friend's behavior might not be appropriate in a professional setting.\n"
