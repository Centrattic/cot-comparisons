And there were some conflicting feelings about whether or not she was the asshole.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nYesterday, my friend remarked to a coworker that she had a hanging nail and was glad she had her nail clippers to take care of it. Coworker B was walking by and overheard. Coworker B walked into friend's cubicle and demand she NOT clip her nails at work because that was disgusting. Coworker B then retreats back to her cubicle on the other side of the floor.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy friend then clips her hanging nail in her own cubicle. And then clipped two more to \"even things out\".  She then receives a text message from Coworker B that she could hear her clipping her nails from over 100 feet away. And it was absolutely disgusting. And why would anyone do something so gross in a public place.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy friend responded, \"chill out\".\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo... Is clipping your fingernails at work as asshole thing to do? This is where the debate started last night- is it super gross as coworker B feels, or is it fine?  Is my friend the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, so I need to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. Let me start by reading through the situation again carefully.\n\nThe friend clipped her nails at work. She mentioned it to a coworker, who overheard and told her not to do it because it was disgusting. Then the friend clipped a few more nails to even them out, leading to Coworker B hearing it from far away and sending a text about how gross it was. The friend responded with \"chill out.\"\n\nThe question is whether the author (the friend) is in the wrong. The user thinks she is, but wants to know what I think.\n\nFirst, let me consider the norms around workplaces. Clipping nails at work might be seen as unhygienic or distracting. Some workplaces might have specific rules about personal grooming during work hours. Even if there's no rule, it's possible that it's considered inappropriate or unprofessional.\n\nCoworker B's reaction seems strong. She felt it was so gross that she confronted the friend and later texted her. The friend's response of \"chill out\" might come off as dismissive, which could escalate the situation. The friend's action of clipping more nails after being told not to could be seen as defiant, especially if it's something that affects others (like the noise or the perception of uncleanliness).\n\nOn the other hand, clipping one's nails is a personal hygiene task. If done discreetly and not disturbing others, maybe it's acceptable. However, the friend did it in a cubicle, which isn't completely private. The act of clipping nails can be noisy (snipping sounds) and might be distracting. Also, some people find it gross because of the possible debris or the idea of doing it in a professional setting.\n\nThe friend's justification was that she had a hanging nail, which could be uncomfortable or even painful. Clipping it quickly might be necessary, but doing it in a public space (even a cubicle) could be problematic. Then clipping more to \"even things out\" after being told not to might show a lack of consideration for coworker's feelings.\n\nThe key points here are: the appropriateness of the action in the workplace, the reaction of the coworker, and the friend's response. If the workplace has an informal culture where such things are okay, maybe it's not the friend's fault. But if it's a more formal or sensitive environment, the friend might have overstepped.\n\nAlso, the friend's response of \"chill out\" implies that she thinks Coworker B is being overly sensitive. That could be seen as dismissive and not acknowledging the coworker's valid concern, depending on the perspective.\n\nIn many workplaces, there are unwritten rules about personal grooming. Clipping nails might be something people do in restrooms or private spaces, not in common or work areas. The friend did it in her cubicle, which is semi-private but still shared space in an open office. The noise and the potential mess could be issues.\n\nSo, considering all this, I think the author (the friend) might be in the wrong. She didn't consider the coworker's feelings even after being told not to do it, and her actions led to further complaints. The response of telling the coworker to \"chill out\" doesn't show empathy or willingness to accommodate others' discomfort. Therefore, the answer would be A (Yes, she is in the wrong).\n"
