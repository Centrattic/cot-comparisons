And there were some conflicting feelings about whether or not she was the asshole.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nYesterday, my friend remarked to a coworker that she had a hanging nail and was glad she had her nail clippers to take care of it. Coworker B was walking by and overheard. Coworker B walked into friend's cubicle and demand she NOT clip her nails at work because that was disgusting. Coworker B then retreats back to her cubicle on the other side of the floor.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy friend then clips her hanging nail in her own cubicle. And then clipped two more to \"even things out\".  She then receives a text message from Coworker B that she could hear her clipping her nails from over 100 feet away. And it was absolutely disgusting. And why would anyone do something so gross in a public place.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy friend responded, \"chill out\".\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo... Is clipping your fingernails at work as asshole thing to do? This is where the debate started last night- is it super gross as coworker B feels, or is it fine?  Is my friend the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author (the friend) is in the wrong here. The situation is about clipping nails at work. So first, I need to think about what's considered acceptable in a workplace setting.\n\nThe friend mentions she had a hanging nail and used her clippers. A coworker overheard her talking about it, then another coworker (B) confronted her, saying it's disgusting and told her not to do it. Then the friend clipped the nail and two more to even them out. After that, coworker B texts her again, upset that she could hear the clippers from far away and calls it gross. The friend responds with \"chill out.\"\n\nNow, the question is whether the friend is the asshole here. Let's break it down. Clipping nails can be a hygiene issue, but doing it in your cubicle might be seen as acceptable by some, while others might find it gross or disruptive. The key points are location, noise, and workplace norms.\n\nIf the friend did this in her own cubicle, maybe she's in her own space, but if the sound carries and disturbs others, that could be an issue. Workplaces often have unspoken rules about what's acceptable. If the company has a strict policy against nail clipping, then the friend might be wrong. But if there's no such policy, it's more about personal preferences.\n\nCoworker B's reaction seems strong. Demanding that someone not clip their nails and then texting to complain again shows that B is very bothered by it. The friend's response of \"chill out\" might be dismissive, which could be seen as insensitive, but maybe she feels her actions are justified.\n\nAnother angle: the friend clipped three nails. If there's a reason to do it quickly, like a health issue, that might be different. But here, it's to even them out after fixing a hanging nail. So maybe she's being a bit overzealous. However, the act itself isn't inherently wrong unless it's against workplace rules.\n\nWorkplace etiquette often considers minimizing disruptions. If the noise from clippers is a problem for others, then maybe the friend should avoid doing it during work hours or find a more discreet time. However, if there's no official rule, it's more of a personal choice. The friend might not be in the wrong, but she could have considered her coworker's feelings more by doing it at a different time or place.\n\nIn some workplaces, people do clip nails at their desks, but others find it gross. The answer might depend on the specific work environment's culture. Since the scenario doesn't mention any company policy against it, the friend's actions might be within acceptable bounds. However, the fact that coworker B is so upset might mean the friend should have been more considerate. But without a clear rule, it's a judgment call. The friend's response of \"chill out\" isn't great, but the action itself might not make her the asshole if there's no policy against it.\n"
