And there were some conflicting feelings about whether or not she was the asshole.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nYesterday, my friend remarked to a coworker that she had a hanging nail and was glad she had her nail clippers to take care of it. Coworker B was walking by and overheard. Coworker B walked into friend's cubicle and demand she NOT clip her nails at work because that was disgusting. Coworker B then retreats back to her cubicle on the other side of the floor.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy friend then clips her hanging nail in her own cubicle. And then clipped two more to \"even things out\".  She then receives a text message from Coworker B that she could hear her clipping her nails from over 100 feet away. And it was absolutely disgusting. And why would anyone do something so gross in a public place.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy friend responded, \"chill out\".\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo... Is clipping your fingernails at work as asshole thing to do? This is where the debate started last night- is it super gross as coworker B feels, or is it fine?  Is my friend the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the friend (the author's friend) who clipped her nails at work is in the wrong. The options are A (yes) or B (no). \n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The friend had a hanging nail and used clippers to fix it. Then, when another coworker complained, she clipped two more nails to \"even things out.\" The coworker was upset, calling it gross and hearing the clippers from 100 feet away.\n\nSo, the main issues here are office etiquette and others' perceptions. Clipping nails in a shared workspace can be seen as unhygienic or disruptive. However, doing it in one's own cubicle might be considered more acceptable than in common areas. The friend's response of \"chill out\" might be seen as dismissive, which could add to the tension.\n\nBut the friend was in her own cubicle, not a common area. Maybe she didn't realize the noise or the potential for others to find it gross. However, after being asked not to do it, continuing to clip nails might be seen as disrespectful. The coworker was clearly disturbed, so the friend might have crossed a line by continuing, even in her own space.\n\nOn the other hand, some people might argue that it's a personal choice and that the coworker is being overly sensitive. The friend was just trying to manage her nails in a private area. But the fact that she did it after being told not to could make her the asshole, as she didn't consider her coworker's feelings once brought to her attention.\n\nSo, the key points are: location (private vs. public), noise, and the response after receiving a complaint. If the friend continued after being asked to stop, that's probably where the issue lies. Therefore, she might be at fault for not respecting the coworker's discomfort once it was communicated.\n"
