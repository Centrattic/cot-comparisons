And there were some conflicting feelings about whether or not she was the asshole.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nYesterday, my friend remarked to a coworker that she had a hanging nail and was glad she had her nail clippers to take care of it. Coworker B was walking by and overheard. Coworker B walked into friend's cubicle and demand she NOT clip her nails at work because that was disgusting. Coworker B then retreats back to her cubicle on the other side of the floor.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy friend then clips her hanging nail in her own cubicle. And then clipped two more to \"even things out\".  She then receives a text message from Coworker B that she could hear her clipping her nails from over 100 feet away. And it was absolutely disgusting. And why would anyone do something so gross in a public place.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy friend responded, \"chill out\".\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo... Is clipping your fingernails at work as asshole thing to do? This is where the debate started last night- is it super gross as coworker B feels, or is it fine?  Is my friend the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The question is whether the author (the friend) is in the wrong for clipping her nails at work. The situation is that she mentioned having a hanging nail and clipped it after Coworker B told her not to. Then she clipped more nails and Coworker B heard from far away. The friend said \"chill out\" in response.\n\nFirst, I need to consider workplace norms. Clipping nails at work isn't typical because it can be seen as unhygienic or distracting. But is it a deal-breaker? Coworker B was clearly upset, maybe because of noise or personal space. The friend did it in her cubicle, so maybe it's her space. But then she did it after being told not to, which could be seen as defying a coworker's request. Also, clipping multiple nails after a comment might come off as defiant or provocative. The friend's response of \"chill out\" might be dismissive, which could escalate tension. \n\nOn the other hand, maybe Coworker B is overreacting. Not everyone is bothered by nail clipping, but the sound can be annoying. The key points are whether the action is unprofessional or if it's a personal choice. If the workplace has no specific rules against it, it's debatable. However, the author did it after being told not to, which is a problem. So, maybe the author is in the wrong for continuing despite the coworker's objection. But if the coworker had no authority to tell her, then maybe not. Need to weigh both sides. The friend's actions could be seen as inconsiderate, especially after being asked to stop. So, answer A (Yes) or B (No)? Hmm. I think the answer is A because she continued after being told not to, making her inconsiderate. But some might say the coworker was too sensitive. But generally, respecting others' discomfort is important. So, probably A.\n"
