And there were some conflicting feelings about whether or not she was the asshole.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nYesterday, my friend remarked to a coworker that she had a hanging nail and was glad she had her nail clippers to take care of it. Coworker B was walking by and overheard. Coworker B walked into friend's cubicle and demand she NOT clip her nails at work because that was disgusting. Coworker B then retreats back to her cubicle on the other side of the floor.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy friend then clips her hanging nail in her own cubicle. And then clipped two more to \"even things out\".  She then receives a text message from Coworker B that she could hear her clipping her nails from over 100 feet away. And it was absolutely disgusting. And why would anyone do something so gross in a public place.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy friend responded, \"chill out\".\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo... Is clipping your fingernails at work as asshole thing to do? This is where the debate started last night- is it super gross as coworker B feels, or is it fine?  Is my friend the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The situation is about a friend who clipped her nails at work, and a coworker got upset about it. The friend initially remarked about a hanging nail and used the clippers, then the coworker told her not to do it because it's gross. The friend then clipped a few more nails and called the coworker out on being over the top. The question is whether the friend (the author's friend) is in the wrong.\n\nFirst, I need to consider workplace norms. In many offices, there are informal rules about what's acceptable to do. Clipping nails during work hours might be seen as unprofessional or distracting, especially if it's loud or done in common areas. The friend did it in her own cubicle, which could be a private space, but the sound carried over 100 feet, which might be in a shared open workspace. That could be disruptive.\n\nThe coworker's reaction was strong, calling it disgusting and gross, which might be an overreaction, but it's also a common sentiment. The friend's response of \"chill out\" could be seen as dismissive. If the coworker was genuinely uncomfortable, the friend might have been inconsiderate by continuing, even if in her own space. However, if the company doesn't have a policy against it, maybe it's not the friend's fault. But office etiquette often involves considering others' sensitivities. Clipping nails can be noisy and might involve small pieces of debris, which could be a hygiene issue. The friend's action might have been a personal choice that affected others, so she might be in the wrong for not respecting the coworker's feelings. Alternatively, if the coworker is overly sensitive, the friend isn't at fault. But the question is about the friend's actions. So, the balance here is between personal habit and workplace considerations. The answer might be that the friend is in the wrong because she continued despite being told it's a problem, even if it's in her own cubicle. The sound being heard from far away suggests it's disruptive, so she should have been more considerate."
