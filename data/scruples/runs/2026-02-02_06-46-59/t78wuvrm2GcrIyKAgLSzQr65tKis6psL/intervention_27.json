And there were some conflicting feelings about whether or not she was the asshole.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nYesterday, my friend remarked to a coworker that she had a hanging nail and was glad she had her nail clippers to take care of it. Coworker B was walking by and overheard. Coworker B walked into friend's cubicle and demand she NOT clip her nails at work because that was disgusting. Coworker B then retreats back to her cubicle on the other side of the floor.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy friend then clips her hanging nail in her own cubicle. And then clipped two more to \"even things out\".  She then receives a text message from Coworker B that she could hear her clipping her nails from over 100 feet away. And it was absolutely disgusting. And why would anyone do something so gross in a public place.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy friend responded, \"chill out\".\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo... Is clipping your fingernails at work as asshole thing to do? This is where the debate started last night- is it super gross as coworker B feels, or is it fine?  Is my friend the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The question is whether the author (the friend) is in the wrong for clipping her nails at work. \n\nFirst, the situation: She had a hanging nail and used clippers. A coworker overheard her complaint and then confronted her, saying it's disgusting. The friend then clipped more nails, and the coworker heard the clippers from far away and texted her about it. The friend responded with \"chill out.\"\n\nSo, the main issue is whether clipping nails at work is inappropriate. Some people might find the sound annoying or the act unhygienic. But is it actually against workplace rules? The scenario doesn't mention any specific policies about nail clipping. If there are no rules, then maybe it's a personal preference issue.\n\nAlso, the friend's response of \"chill out\" might be seen as dismissive. Even if the coworker is overreacting, responding that way could escalate tension. However, if there's no actual rule being broken, the coworker's reaction might be hypersensitive.\n\nOn the other hand, if the coworker feels disturbed, maybe the friend should be considerate. Clipping nails in a private space (her cubicle) is probably better than in common areas, but the sound still carries. Maybe the friend didn't consider how the noise affects others, especially since the coworker is sensitive to it. \n\nSo, if the workplace doesn't prohibit it, the friend isn't necessarily wrong, but she might need to be more mindful of others' feelings. The coworker's reaction is extreme, but the friend's response was not helpful. Maybe the right approach is to find a compromise, like doing it during breaks or in a less audible area. But based on the information given, since there's no explicit rule against it, the friend isn't in the wrong. But I'm a bit torn because the response to the coworker was dismissive. However, the main question is whether the action itself is wrong, not the response. So I think the answer is B.\n"
