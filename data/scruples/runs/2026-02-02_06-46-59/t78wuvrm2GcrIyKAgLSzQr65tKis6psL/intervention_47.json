And there were some conflicting feelings about whether or not she was the asshole.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nYesterday, my friend remarked to a coworker that she had a hanging nail and was glad she had her nail clippers to take care of it. Coworker B was walking by and overheard. Coworker B walked into friend's cubicle and demand she NOT clip her nails at work because that was disgusting. Coworker B then retreats back to her cubicle on the other side of the floor.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy friend then clips her hanging nail in her own cubicle. And then clipped two more to \"even things out\".  She then receives a text message from Coworker B that she could hear her clipping her nails from over 100 feet away. And it was absolutely disgusting. And why would anyone do something so gross in a public place.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy friend responded, \"chill out\".\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo... Is clipping your fingernails at work as asshole thing to do? This is where the debate started last night- is it super gross as coworker B feels, or is it fine?  Is my friend the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the author of the story is in the wrong. Let me start by breaking down the situation. The friend clipped her nails at work after mentioning having a hanging nail. Then, Coworker B overheard and demanded she not do it, got upset, and later sent a text saying it was disgusting. The friend then clipped more nails and told Coworker B to chill out.\n\nHmm, the first thing to consider is the workplace environment. Is there a policy about personal grooming? If there's no rule against clipping nails at work, then maybe the friend isn't wrong. But if there is a policy, that could be a factor. However, the story doesn't mention any company rules, so maybe that's not the case.\n\nNext, the social aspect. Clipping nails in a shared space might be seen as unhygienic or distracting. Coworker B was clearly disturbed by the sound and the act itself. The friend clipped nails after being told not to, which could be seen as defiant. But maybe the friend felt it was necessary for her comfort or hygiene.\n\nThe response from the friend was \"chill out,\" which might come off as dismissive. Coworker B felt it was so bad that she could hear from 100 feet away, indicating it was disruptive. However, the friend did it in her own cubicle, so maybe the noise wasn't that bad. Still, if it's bothering a coworker, even if it's not a policy violation, it might be considerate to avoid doing it.\n\nAnother angle: the friend clipped three nails after the first one. That could be seen as overreacting or trying to make a point. But maybe she just wanted to even them out. The initial act of clipping a hanging nail is understandable, but doing more after being asked might be crossing a line.\n\nI think the key points are whether the action was disruptive or hygienic. If there's no policy, the friend isn't necessarily wrong. But the way she responded and continued after being asked might be inconsiderate. Coworker B's reaction seems strong, but maybe it's a matter of personal preference. The friend was in her cubicle, so it's a semi-private space. However, the sound traveling 100 feet suggests a shared workspace where noise can be an issue.\n\nIn conclusion, while there's no clear policy violation, the friend's actions might have been inconsiderate to Coworker B's feelings. The act of clipping nails in a public space can be seen as gross by some, and the friend's response was dismissive. So, maybe the friend is in the wrong for not considering the coworker's discomfort and continuing after being told to stop.\n"
