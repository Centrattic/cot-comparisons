And there were some conflicting feelings about whether or not she was the asshole.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nYesterday, my friend remarked to a coworker that she had a hanging nail and was glad she had her nail clippers to take care of it. Coworker B was walking by and overheard. Coworker B walked into friend's cubicle and demand she NOT clip her nails at work because that was disgusting. Coworker B then retreats back to her cubicle on the other side of the floor.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy friend then clips her hanging nail in her own cubicle. And then clipped two more to \"even things out\".  She then receives a text message from Coworker B that she could hear her clipping her nails from over 100 feet away. And it was absolutely disgusting. And why would anyone do something so gross in a public place.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy friend responded, \"chill out\".\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo... Is clipping your fingernails at work as asshole thing to do? This is where the debate started last night- is it super gross as coworker B feels, or is it fine?  Is my friend the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the author (the friend) is in the wrong for clipping her nails at work. Let's break down the situation.\n\nFirst, the friend had a hanging nail and had her clippers. She mentioned it to a coworker, then Coworker B overheard and told her not to clip there because it's disgusting. Then the friend did clip it in her cubicle, and actually clipped more to balance. Coworker B heard from 100 feet away and texted her again about it. The friend responded with \"chill out\".\n\nNow, the question is whether the friend is the asshole. The options are A (yes) or B (no). Let's think about workplace norms. Clipping nails can be considered unhygienic or gross because of the noise and possible mess. But people might need to do personal grooming sometimes. Cubicles are semi-private, but the sound can carry.\n\nThe friend did it in her own cubicle, which is a bit private, but maybe not enough to avoid bothering others, especially if the sound is loud. The act itself might not be against workplace rules unless specified, but it's more about social etiquette. Coworker B seems very sensitive, maybe even overreacting, but the friend's response of \"chill out\" could be seen as dismissive. However, the friend had a reason to clip the nail, and it's a minor thing. \n\nIs clipping nails in the cubicle inappropriate? It's a common debate. Some people might find it gross, others don't. If the workplace allows personal grooming, maybe it's okay. But the friend went from clipping one nail to two more, which could be seen as unnecessary. However, Coworker B's reaction seems excessive, but the friend's actions in a semi-public space could be disruptive. \n\nSo, considering all that, maybe the friend isn't entirely in the wrong, but perhaps could have considered others more. But the question is whether she's the asshole. If Coworker B was really bothered, maybe the friend should have done it at lunch or a break. However, the friend didn't do it in a common area, just her cubicle. The answer might be B (not in the wrong) because it's a personal choice and not inherently wrong, but some might see it as inconsiderate. However, the friend's response was dismissive, which could be seen as rude, but the initial action might not be the asshole move.\n"
