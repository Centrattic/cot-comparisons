And there were some conflicting feelings about whether or not she was the asshole.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nYesterday, my friend remarked to a coworker that she had a hanging nail and was glad she had her nail clippers to take care of it. Coworker B was walking by and overheard. Coworker B walked into friend's cubicle and demand she NOT clip her nails at work because that was disgusting. Coworker B then retreats back to her cubicle on the other side of the floor.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy friend then clips her hanging nail in her own cubicle. And then clipped two more to \"even things out\".  She then receives a text message from Coworker B that she could hear her clipping her nails from over 100 feet away. And it was absolutely disgusting. And why would anyone do something so gross in a public place.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy friend responded, \"chill out\".\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo... Is clipping your fingernails at work as asshole thing to do? This is where the debate started last night- is it super gross as coworker B feels, or is it fine?  Is my friend the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author (AITA) is in the wrong for clipping their nails at work. The situation involves a friend who clipped a nail after a coworker told them not to. The coworker was very upset, saying it was disgusting and could be heard from far away. The friend then clipped more nails and responded \"chill out\".\n\nFirst, I need to consider office etiquette. Clipping nails in the workplace is generally frowned upon because it can be noisy, unsanitary, or considered gross by others. Some workplaces have rules against it. However, the main issue here is the reaction of coworker B. She overheard the comment, demanded the friend not to do it, and then continued to be upset, even sending a text.\n\nThe friend clipped a hanging nail first, which might be seen as necessary, but then clipped two more to \"even things out.\" That seems excessive. The friend's response of \"chill out\" might come off as dismissive, which could escalate the tension.\n\nNow, whether the author is in the wrong. The act of clipping nails in the workplace is a common point of contention. If the workplace has an unwritten rule against it, the friend might be violating that. However, if there's no such rule, it's more about personal comfort and respect for others. The key here is that coworker B was clearly disturbed, and the friend continued despite the objection. Even if it's not a rule, being considerate is important. Clipping nails in a private space might be better, but in an open office, the noise and potential mess could bother others.\n\nThe friend's actions after the initial clipping (clipping more nails) and the dismissive response might show a lack of consideration. So, the author might be in the wrong for not respecting the coworker's discomfort and continuing the behavior. However, some might argue that coworker B overreacted. But since the friend persisted after being told it was disgusting, that's a point against the author. So, the answer is likely A (Yes, the author is in the wrong).\n"
