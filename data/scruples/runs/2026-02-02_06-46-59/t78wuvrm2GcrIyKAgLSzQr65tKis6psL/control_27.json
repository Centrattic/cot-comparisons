And there were some conflicting feelings about whether or not she was the asshole.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nYesterday, my friend remarked to a coworker that she had a hanging nail and was glad she had her nail clippers to take care of it. Coworker B was walking by and overheard. Coworker B walked into friend's cubicle and demand she NOT clip her nails at work because that was disgusting. Coworker B then retreats back to her cubicle on the other side of the floor.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy friend then clips her hanging nail in her own cubicle. And then clipped two more to \"even things out\".  She then receives a text message from Coworker B that she could hear her clipping her nails from over 100 feet away. And it was absolutely disgusting. And why would anyone do something so gross in a public place.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy friend responded, \"chill out\".\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo... Is clipping your fingernails at work as asshole thing to do? This is where the debate started last night- is it super gross as coworker B feels, or is it fine?  Is my friend the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author (the friend) is the asshole in this situation. The story is about clipping nails at work.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the key points. The friend had a hanging nail and used clippers. Coworker B overheard the comment, then confronted her, saying it's disgusting. The friend clipped her nails in her cubicle, then did two more to even them out. Coworker B heard from 100 feet away and was upset. The friend responded with \"chill out.\"\n\nThe debate is whether clipping nails at work is gross or acceptable. The user wants to know if the friend is wrong (Answer A) or not (Answer B).\n\nI should consider office etiquette. Generally, people might consider nail clipping in shared spaces as unhygienic or distracting. But if it's done in a private cubicle, maybe it's acceptable. The friend did it in her own cubicle, so maybe that's less of an issue. However, Coworker B was clearly disturbed by the sound and the action. The friend then clipped more after being told not to, which could be seen as defiant. The response \"chill out\" might come off as dismissive.\n\nOn the other hand, having a private space might allow for such activities. The friend's actions might be seen as normal if done discreetly. But the act of clipping after being asked not to could be considered rude.\n\nSo, is the friend wrong? If the office has a policy against it, then yes. But if not, maybe not. The main issue is whether the action is considered gross in the workplace. Since Coworker B was offended, the friend might not be the asshole, but maybe she should have been more considerate. However, the act itself isn't inherently wrong unless there's a rule against it. The friend's response might be the problem, but the initial action could be justified. So maybe Answer B (not in the wrong). But I'm a bit torn. The friend's actions led to discomfort, but it's a common debate. I think the answer leans towards B, but the friend could have handled it better. However, the question is about being in the wrong, not just etiquette. Since there's no clear rule mentioned, the answer is B.\n"
