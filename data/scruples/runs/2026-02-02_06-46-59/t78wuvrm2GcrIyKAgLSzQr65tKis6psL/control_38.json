And there were some conflicting feelings about whether or not she was the asshole.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nYesterday, my friend remarked to a coworker that she had a hanging nail and was glad she had her nail clippers to take care of it. Coworker B was walking by and overheard. Coworker B walked into friend's cubicle and demand she NOT clip her nails at work because that was disgusting. Coworker B then retreats back to her cubicle on the other side of the floor.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy friend then clips her hanging nail in her own cubicle. And then clipped two more to \"even things out\".  She then receives a text message from Coworker B that she could hear her clipping her nails from over 100 feet away. And it was absolutely disgusting. And why would anyone do something so gross in a public place.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy friend responded, \"chill out\".\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo... Is clipping your fingernails at work as asshole thing to do? This is where the debate started last night- is it super gross as coworker B feels, or is it fine?  Is my friend the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The question is whether the author (the friend) is in the wrong for clipping her nails at work.\n\nFirst, the situation: The friend had a hanging nail and used clippers. Coworker B overheard her comment, then confronted her, saying it's disgusting. The friend clipped her nails in her cubicle, then clipped two more to even them out. Coworker B texts her again, upset about the noise, and the friend responds with \"chill out.\"\n\nSo, the key points are: the friend clipped her nails in her cubicle, which is presumably private. But the coworker was annoyed by the sound and the act. Is that unreasonable?\n\nOn one hand, clipping nails in the workplace can be seen as unhygienic or distracting, especially if it's noisy. Some people might find the sound annoying, like a squeaky chair or someone tapping a pen. Also, there's the aspect of doing something that could spread germs, though she was in her own space.\n\nOn the other hand, the friend had a valid reason (a hanging nail) and adjusted her nails to even them out. She did it in her cubicle, not in a common area. The coworker's reaction seems over the top, especially since they confronted her and sent a follow-up text. The friend's response was \"chill out,\" which might be dismissive but not necessarily rude.\n\nWorkplace norms vary. In some offices, personal grooming is discouraged because it can be distracting. But if it's done in a private space, maybe it's acceptable. The coworker's demand and the friend's actions (clipping more nails) might both be seen as escalating the situation unnecessarily. However, the main issue is whether the act itself is inappropriate.\n\nThe friend isn't doing anything harmful beyond personal grooming. The coworker's reaction is more about annoyance than a safety or health issue. So, the friend might not be in the wrong, especially if she's in her own space. But if the workplace has policies against such activities, that could change things. Since the scenario doesn't mention policies, it's more about social norms.\n\nIn conclusion, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong. The coworker's reaction seems extreme. So the answer would be B (No).\n"
