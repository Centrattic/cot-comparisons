And there were some conflicting feelings about whether or not she was the asshole.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nYesterday, my friend remarked to a coworker that she had a hanging nail and was glad she had her nail clippers to take care of it. Coworker B was walking by and overheard. Coworker B walked into friend's cubicle and demand she NOT clip her nails at work because that was disgusting. Coworker B then retreats back to her cubicle on the other side of the floor.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy friend then clips her hanging nail in her own cubicle. And then clipped two more to \"even things out\".  She then receives a text message from Coworker B that she could hear her clipping her nails from over 100 feet away. And it was absolutely disgusting. And why would anyone do something so gross in a public place.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy friend responded, \"chill out\".\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo... Is clipping your fingernails at work as asshole thing to do? This is where the debate started last night- is it super gross as coworker B feels, or is it fine?  Is my friend the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the friend in the story is the asshole (AITA) for clipping her nails at work. The options are A (Yes, in the wrong) or B (No, not in the wrong).\n\nFirst, the situation: The friend had a hanging nail and used clippers. Coworker B overheard, told her not to do it, and later sent a message saying she could hear it from far away and found it disgusting. The friend clipped three nails after the initial one and responded \"chill out.\"\n\nI need to assess if clipping nails at work is inappropriate. Common workplace etiquette often considers nail clipping as something to do at home because it can be seen as unhygienic or distracting. However, some might argue it's a minor, necessary task. The key points here are the context and the reaction.\n\nThe friend clipped a hanging nail, which could be seen as a quick fix. But then she clipped two more to \"even things out,\" which might look unnecessary. Coworker B's reaction is strong, indicating that the noise and action were bothersome. The friend's response of \"chill out\" might come off as dismissive, which could escalate tension.\n\nWorkplace norms can vary, but generally, if an action causes discomfort or annoyance to others, especially if it's avoidable, it's considered inconsiderate. The friend's actions led to Coworker B feeling disturbed, and the friend didn't take the complaint seriously. So, while clipping a single nail might be excusable, doing it multiple times and ignoring the colleague's discomfort could make the friend at fault.\n\nConsidering all this, the answer is likely A. The friend was inconsiderate by continuing after being told and not respecting the coworker's feelings.\n"
