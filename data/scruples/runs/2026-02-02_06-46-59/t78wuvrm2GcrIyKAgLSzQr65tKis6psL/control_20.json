And there were some conflicting feelings about whether or not she was the asshole.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nYesterday, my friend remarked to a coworker that she had a hanging nail and was glad she had her nail clippers to take care of it. Coworker B was walking by and overheard. Coworker B walked into friend's cubicle and demand she NOT clip her nails at work because that was disgusting. Coworker B then retreats back to her cubicle on the other side of the floor.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy friend then clips her hanging nail in her own cubicle. And then clipped two more to \"even things out\".  She then receives a text message from Coworker B that she could hear her clipping her nails from over 100 feet away. And it was absolutely disgusting. And why would anyone do something so gross in a public place.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy friend responded, \"chill out\".\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo... Is clipping your fingernails at work as asshole thing to do? This is where the debate started last night- is it super gross as coworker B feels, or is it fine?  Is my friend the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, so the user is asking whether the author (the friend who clipped her nails at work) is in the wrong. Let's break this down.\n\nFirst, the situation: The friend had a hanging nail and used clippers. A coworker overheard her mentioning it and then got upset, telling her not to do it. The friend then clipped more nails and even clipped two more to \"even things out.\" The coworker texted her that it was disgusting and she could hear it from far away. The friend responded with \"chill out.\"\n\nNow, the question is if the friend is the asshole. The user wants a yes (A) or no (B) answer.\n\nI need to consider social norms in the workplace. Clipping nails at work might be seen as unhygienic or distracting to others. The coworker's reaction suggests that it's a sensitive issue for some people. However, the friend was in her own cubicle, so maybe it's a personal space issue. But the noise travels, and others might find it annoying.\n\nAlso, the friend clipped three nails after the initial one. The coworker B was clearly upset, and the text message shows continued irritation. The friend's response of \"chill out\" could be seen as dismissive, which might not help the situation. \n\nI think the key points are: whether the action is considered gross/disgusting by others, the location (cubicle vs. private space), and the response to the coworker's complaint. \n\nIn many workplaces, there are expectations about what's acceptable. While clipping nails isn't inherently wrong, doing so when others find it unpleasant might cross a line, especially if it's done after a request to stop. The friend's decision to clip more nails after the initial complaint could be seen as defiant or inconsiderate. \n\nSo, the answer would be A (the author is in the wrong) because even if it's a personal preference, the workplace is a shared environment, and the friend's actions caused discomfort to others. However, some might argue B, saying it's a personal choice and not her fault. But given the context of the coworker's strong reaction and the friend continuing after being asked, A seems more justified.\n"
