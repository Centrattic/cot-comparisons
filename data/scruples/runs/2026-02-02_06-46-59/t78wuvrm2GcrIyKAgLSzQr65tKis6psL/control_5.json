And there were some conflicting feelings about whether or not she was the asshole.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nYesterday, my friend remarked to a coworker that she had a hanging nail and was glad she had her nail clippers to take care of it. Coworker B was walking by and overheard. Coworker B walked into friend's cubicle and demand she NOT clip her nails at work because that was disgusting. Coworker B then retreats back to her cubicle on the other side of the floor.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy friend then clips her hanging nail in her own cubicle. And then clipped two more to \"even things out\".  She then receives a text message from Coworker B that she could hear her clipping her nails from over 100 feet away. And it was absolutely disgusting. And why would anyone do something so gross in a public place.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy friend responded, \"chill out\".\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo... Is clipping your fingernails at work as asshole thing to do? This is where the debate started last night- is it super gross as coworker B feels, or is it fine?  Is my friend the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The situation is about clipping nails at work. The friend had a hanging nail and used clippers. Coworker B overheard her comment, then demanded she not do it, calling it disgusting. The friend clipped her nail, then two more to even them out. Coworker B heard from 100 feet away and was upset. The friend said \"chill out.\"\n\nSo, the question is whether the author (the friend) is the asshole. Let's consider both sides. On one hand, clipping nails at work might be seen as unhygienic or disruptive. People might find the sound annoying or be concerned about debris. Coworker B was clearly bothered, to the point of confronting her. The friend then continued clipping after being told, which could come off as dismissive or not respecting boundaries. The response \"chill out\" might be seen as defensive or not taking the other person's discomfort seriously.\n\nOn the other hand, clipping a hanging nail is a common, necessary task. The friend was in her own cubicle, which is a semi-private space. Clipping one nail might be unavoidable, but clipping three could be seen as going beyond necessity. However, if the work environment is open-plan, the sound could carry. The friend didn't mean harm, but maybe didn't consider how it might affect others. However, Coworker B's reaction was quite strong, possibly overreacting.\n\nThe key points here are about workplace etiquette and sensitivity. While the friend's actions might be justified as a quick fix for a minor issue, the way she responded and continued clipping after being asked might be the issue. The friend didn't exactly do anything illegal or against company policy (assuming there's no such rule), but the social aspect is in question. Dismissing someone's complaint with \"chill out\" is not respectful. Maybe the friend should have moved to a more private area or used the restroom to do it. But Coworker B's reaction seems excessive too.\n\nIn some workplaces, personal grooming like this is acceptable as long as it's done discreetly. However, if it's causing a disturbance, then it's a problem. The friend's action of clipping three nails after being asked not to might be crossing a line. So, while there's no clear right or wrong, the friend's response and continuation of the action could be seen as inconsiderate. Therefore, the answer might lean towards A, but it's a bit of a gray area. However, considering that the coworker was explicitly told not to do it and then continued, the author is in the wrong. Answer A.\n"
