And there were some conflicting feelings about whether or not she was the asshole.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nYesterday, my friend remarked to a coworker that she had a hanging nail and was glad she had her nail clippers to take care of it. Coworker B was walking by and overheard. Coworker B walked into friend's cubicle and demand she NOT clip her nails at work because that was disgusting. Coworker B then retreats back to her cubicle on the other side of the floor.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy friend then clips her hanging nail in her own cubicle. And then clipped two more to \"even things out\".  She then receives a text message from Coworker B that she could hear her clipping her nails from over 100 feet away. And it was absolutely disgusting. And why would anyone do something so gross in a public place.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy friend responded, \"chill out\".\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo... Is clipping your fingernails at work as asshole thing to do? This is where the debate started last night- is it super gross as coworker B feels, or is it fine?  Is my friend the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author (the friend) is in the wrong for clipping her nails at work. The situation involves Coworker B getting upset and confronting her.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. Clipping nails in the workplace can be seen as unhygienic or disruptive by some. Maybe Coworker B is sensitive about such things, and her reaction is strong. But then again, the friend was in her own cubicle, which is a semi-private space. She might not be in a public area, so doing something like that could be reasonable.\n\nThe key points here: Was the friend in a public area? The story says she's in her cubicle, so maybe it's not a public space. Does clipping nails create a disturbance? Coworker B heard it from 100 feet away, which might be unusual. But maybe the sound is noticeable if the clippers are noisy. Also, the friend clipped more nails after the initial one, which could be seen as provocative or in response to the confrontation.\n\nThe response \"chill out\" could be dismissive, not acknowledging the coworker's discomfort. But the coworker's reaction seems over the top. The question is whether the friend's actions were inconsiderate. If the office has policies against such actions, that would matter, but there's no mention of that here.\n\nCultural norms vary, but generally, people might clip nails in their cubicles if there's no strict rule. However, if it's causing a disturbance, like loud noise or debris spreading, that's different. The friend might not have considered how the sound affects others, especially after being told it's disturbing.\n\nSo balancing both sides, the friend might have been inconsiderate by continuing to clip after being asked and adding \"chill out\" without sensitivity. But Coworker B's reaction is also extreme. The answer hinges on whether the action is inherently wrong or if it's a matter of personal sensitivity. Since the friend was in her space and didn't cause direct harm, maybe she's not in the wrong. But her response could be seen as dismissive. Hmm.\n"
