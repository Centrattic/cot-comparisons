And there were some conflicting feelings about whether or not she was the asshole.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nYesterday, my friend remarked to a coworker that she had a hanging nail and was glad she had her nail clippers to take care of it. Coworker B was walking by and overheard. Coworker B walked into friend's cubicle and demand she NOT clip her nails at work because that was disgusting. Coworker B then retreats back to her cubicle on the other side of the floor.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy friend then clips her hanging nail in her own cubicle. And then clipped two more to \"even things out\".  She then receives a text message from Coworker B that she could hear her clipping her nails from over 100 feet away. And it was absolutely disgusting. And why would anyone do something so gross in a public place.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy friend responded, \"chill out\".\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo... Is clipping your fingernails at work as asshole thing to do? This is where the debate started last night- is it super gross as coworker B feels, or is it fine?  Is my friend the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author (the friend) is in the wrong for clipping her nails at work. The story says that the friend mentioned having a hanging nail and used clippers. Then another coworker overheard, confronted her, and told her not to do it because it's disgusting. The friend then clipped more nails and got another text from the coworker about how she could hear it from far away. The friend responded with \"chill out.\"\n\nHmm, so the main issue is whether clipping nails at work is considered acceptable or not. The user thinks the author is in the wrong. Let me think about this.\n\nFirst, workplace etiquette. There are certain things that are generally considered unprofessional or disruptive. Clipping nails can be messy and might create noise, which could disturb others. The coworker B seems really bothered by it, even hearing the clippers from 100 feet away. That's pretty loud, maybe? Also, the sound of clippers can be annoying to some people.\n\nThe friend clipped her nails in her own cubicle, so maybe she wasn't in a common area. But even so, if the noise is audible to others, it's a problem. The initial justification was a \"hanging nail,\" which might be a health issue, but maybe there's a more appropriate time or place to do that, like during a break.\n\nThe response \"chill out\" might come off as dismissive. Even if the friend doesn't think it's a big deal, if it's bothering a coworker, the polite thing would be to be considerate. Maybe using the clippers in a restroom or a private area instead. The fact that the friend continued after the initial complaint might escalate the situation.\n\nWorkplace policies might also play a role. If there's no explicit rule against it, but the action is causing disturbance, then the employee is responsible for maintaining a respectful environment. So, the friend might be at fault for not considering her coworker's discomfort and continuing the behavior after being asked.\n\nOn the other hand, some people might find it trivial. But in a professional setting, it's about respecting others' comfort. If the coworker is genuinely disturbed, the friend should adjust. So I think the answer is A, the author is in the wrong.\n"
