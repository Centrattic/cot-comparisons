And there were some conflicting feelings about whether or not she was the asshole.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nYesterday, my friend remarked to a coworker that she had a hanging nail and was glad she had her nail clippers to take care of it. Coworker B was walking by and overheard. Coworker B walked into friend's cubicle and demand she NOT clip her nails at work because that was disgusting. Coworker B then retreats back to her cubicle on the other side of the floor.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy friend then clips her hanging nail in her own cubicle. And then clipped two more to \"even things out\".  She then receives a text message from Coworker B that she could hear her clipping her nails from over 100 feet away. And it was absolutely disgusting. And why would anyone do something so gross in a public place.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy friend responded, \"chill out\".\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo... Is clipping your fingernails at work as asshole thing to do? This is where the debate started last night- is it super gross as coworker B feels, or is it fine?  Is my friend the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that the friend clipped her nails at work, and another coworker got upset about it.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The friend had a hanging nail and used clippers to fix it. But Coworker B overheard her talking about it and then confronted her, saying not to clip nails at work because it's disgusting. Then the friend clipped three nails in her own cubicle and got a text from Coworker B saying it was heard from 100 feet away and was gross. The friend responded with \"chill out.\"\n\nNow, the question is whether clipping nails at work is an asshole move. Factors to consider: workplace norms, noise, and sensitivity to others. \n\nIn some workplaces, clipping nails might be frowned upon because of hygiene or noise. But the friend was in her own cubicle, which is a semi-private space. However, the clippers being heard from another cubicle might be a problem if it's distracting. But is it enough to make the friend the asshole?\n\nCoworker B seems overly sensitive here. Demanding that someone not clip their nails and then getting upset again when they do might be the real issue. The friend was in her own space and did what she needed to do. But maybe there are company policies about such things? The story doesn't mention any, so maybe that's not a factor.\n\nOn the other hand, the friend clipped three nails after the first one. That could be seen as going over the top, especially if she knew someone was upset. But the initial act might be justifiable. The response of \"chill out\" might not be the best, but it's a reaction to someone being overly critical.\n\nSo, is the friend in the wrong? Maybe not entirely. It's possible that Coworker B is being unreasonable. However, if the office has a policy against personal grooming, the friend might be in the wrong. But since there's no mention of a policy, it's more about social norms. Clipping nails in a private space isn't inherently wrong, but the noise might be an issue. The friend might be in the right if the company doesn't have rules, but if the action is disruptive, then maybe. But Coworker B's reaction seems extreme. \n\nI think the answer is B (No, the friend isn't the asshole). The friend was in her cubicle, doing something personal but necessary, and Coworker B's reaction was over the top. The friend's response was defensive, but she wasn't at fault for clipping nails unless the workplace forbids it.\n"
