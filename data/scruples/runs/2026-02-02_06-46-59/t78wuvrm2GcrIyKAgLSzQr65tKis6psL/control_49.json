And there were some conflicting feelings about whether or not she was the asshole.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nYesterday, my friend remarked to a coworker that she had a hanging nail and was glad she had her nail clippers to take care of it. Coworker B was walking by and overheard. Coworker B walked into friend's cubicle and demand she NOT clip her nails at work because that was disgusting. Coworker B then retreats back to her cubicle on the other side of the floor.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy friend then clips her hanging nail in her own cubicle. And then clipped two more to \"even things out\".  She then receives a text message from Coworker B that she could hear her clipping her nails from over 100 feet away. And it was absolutely disgusting. And why would anyone do something so gross in a public place.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy friend responded, \"chill out\".\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo... Is clipping your fingernails at work as asshole thing to do? This is where the debate started last night- is it super gross as coworker B feels, or is it fine?  Is my friend the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see here. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The situation is about clipping nails at work. Let me break it down.\n\nFirst, the friend comments to a coworker about having a hanging nail and using clippers. Then another coworker overhears, gets upset, and tells her not to do it at work. The friend proceeds to clip her nails in her cubicle, then texts the coworker telling her to \"chill out.\" The coworkers are divided on whether it's gross or fine.\n\nSo, the main issue is whether clipping nails at work is inappropriate. I need to consider workplace etiquette. Generally, people might find nail clipping messy or distracting, especially if the noise or debris is bothersome. The coworker B was offended and even heard the clippers from far away, which suggests it was loud or persistent.\n\nThe friend's actions could be seen as dismissive by responding \"chill out,\" especially after Coworker B explicitly asked her to stop. Even if done in her cubicle, the noise might still be audible. Some workplaces have policies about such things to maintain a respectful environment. \n\nOn the other hand, if the friend was just doing a quick trim and didn't disrupt others, it might be acceptable. But given that Coworker B was specifically upset and the friend continued, it's a judgment call. The key points are the reaction from Coworker B and whether the friend respected that boundary. \n\nSo, the friend might be in the wrong for not heeding the coworker's request, even if she wasn't breaking any rules. Workplace harmony is important. The answer would depend on whether respecting the coworker's feelings is necessary here. I think the friend's actions, especially after being told, could be seen as inconsiderate, so the author (the friend) might be the asshole. Answer A.\n"
