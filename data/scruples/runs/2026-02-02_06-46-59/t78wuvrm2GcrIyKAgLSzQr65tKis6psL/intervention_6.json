And there were some conflicting feelings about whether or not she was the asshole.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nYesterday, my friend remarked to a coworker that she had a hanging nail and was glad she had her nail clippers to take care of it. Coworker B was walking by and overheard. Coworker B walked into friend's cubicle and demand she NOT clip her nails at work because that was disgusting. Coworker B then retreats back to her cubicle on the other side of the floor.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy friend then clips her hanging nail in her own cubicle. And then clipped two more to \"even things out\".  She then receives a text message from Coworker B that she could hear her clipping her nails from over 100 feet away. And it was absolutely disgusting. And why would anyone do something so gross in a public place.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy friend responded, \"chill out\".\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo... Is clipping your fingernails at work as asshole thing to do? This is where the debate started last night- is it super gross as coworker B feels, or is it fine?  Is my friend the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author (the friend) is in the wrong for clipping her nails at work. The situation involves a coworker getting upset about the noise and considering it gross.\n\nFirst, I need to consider company policies. If there's a rule against clipping nails at work, then the friend is definitely in the wrong. But if there's no such policy, it's more about social norms and workplace etiquette. \n\nNext, the context of the action. Clipping a single hanging nail might be seen as a quick fix to avoid discomfort, which is understandable. However, clipping multiple nails after the initial correction could be seen as unnecessary and possibly provocative, especially since it was done after the coworker expressed disapproval. \n\nThe coworker's reaction is also important. If Coworker B is particularly sensitive, maybe she's overreacting. But if the noise was loud and disruptive, then the friend's action might be inconsiderate. The friend's response of \"chill out\" seems dismissive and could escalate tensions. \n\nPublic vs. private spaces matter here. If the cubicle is considered a semi-private space, maybe it's acceptable. But if the office culture is more formal or sensitive to such things, clipping nails might be frowned upon. \n\nSocial norms vary. In some workplaces, personal grooming is expected to be done outside of work hours or in restrooms. However, in others, it might be more lenient. The key is whether it's disruptive. If the noise was heard from 100 feet away, that's a clear disruption. \n\nIntentions of the friend: she did it to fix a problem but then went further. The friend might not have intended to annoy, but the result was disruptive. The coworker's health concerns (if any) aren't mentioned, so maybe that's not a factor here.\n\nIn summary, even if it's not a policy violation, the friend's action was disruptive and the response to the coworker was dismissive, which could make her the asshole. However, if there's no policy and it's a minor issue, the friend might not be at fault. But considering the disruption and the coworker's reasonable complaint, the answer leans towards A.\n"
