And there were some conflicting feelings about whether or not she was the asshole.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nYesterday, my friend remarked to a coworker that she had a hanging nail and was glad she had her nail clippers to take care of it. Coworker B was walking by and overheard. Coworker B walked into friend's cubicle and demand she NOT clip her nails at work because that was disgusting. Coworker B then retreats back to her cubicle on the other side of the floor.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy friend then clips her hanging nail in her own cubicle. And then clipped two more to \"even things out\".  She then receives a text message from Coworker B that she could hear her clipping her nails from over 100 feet away. And it was absolutely disgusting. And why would anyone do something so gross in a public place.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy friend responded, \"chill out\".\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo... Is clipping your fingernails at work as asshole thing to do? This is where the debate started last night- is it super gross as coworker B feels, or is it fine?  Is my friend the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about clipping nails at work. The friend clipped a hanging nail and then did two more to even things out. Coworker B overheard the initial comment and then got upset, even texting that she could hear the clippers from far away and found it gross.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. Clipping nails in an office setting usually depends on the workplace's norms. Some places might consider it unprofessional or unhygienic, while others might not mind. The key here is whether the action is disruptive or against company policies.\n\nThe friend clipped the nails in her own cubicle, so she wasn't in a shared space. But Coworker B heard it from 100 feet away, which suggests it's audible. That could be a problem if it's distracting. However, the friend had a valid reason to clip a hanging nail, which might be uncomfortable or unhygienic if left. But she went on to clip two more, which might be unnecessary. That could be seen as overdoing it, maybe just to spite the comment or to even things out, which could be petty.\n\nThe response \"chill out\" might not be the best way to handle the situation. It's dismissive and could escalate tension. However, Coworker B's reaction seems over the top, being called \"disgusting\" and demanding that the friend not clip nails. But maybe there's a cultural or personal sensitivity here. The question is whether the friend overstepped by continuing to clip after being asked, even if indirectly, not to. If the coworker's complaint was about the noise and hygiene, the friend's action of clipping more could be seen as ignoring the complaint, hence the wrong.\n\nOn the other hand, clipping a single nail to fix a problem isn't inherently wrong. The extra two might be the issue. Also, the initial reaction of Coworker B is aggressive, maybe unwarranted. But the friend's response was dismissive, which isn't helpful. Workplaces require mutual respect, so even if the action isn't a big deal, the way the friend handled it could contribute to a hostile environment.\n\nSo, is the friend in the wrong? It's a bit of a gray area. The friend didn't follow up to address Coworker B's concerns, which might be necessary. Clipping nails in a cubicle might be acceptable, but if it's causing a disturbance, the friend should consider that. The fact that she clipped extra nails after being told it's gross might be seen as defiance, which is unwise. Therefore, the friend might be at fault for not being considerate of Coworker B's feelings, even if the act itself isn't inherently wrong. So the answer might be A (Yes, the author is in the wrong).\n"
