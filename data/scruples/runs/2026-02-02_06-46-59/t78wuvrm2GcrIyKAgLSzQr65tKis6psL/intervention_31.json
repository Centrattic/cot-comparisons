And there were some conflicting feelings about whether or not she was the asshole.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nYesterday, my friend remarked to a coworker that she had a hanging nail and was glad she had her nail clippers to take care of it. Coworker B was walking by and overheard. Coworker B walked into friend's cubicle and demand she NOT clip her nails at work because that was disgusting. Coworker B then retreats back to her cubicle on the other side of the floor.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy friend then clips her hanging nail in her own cubicle. And then clipped two more to \"even things out\".  She then receives a text message from Coworker B that she could hear her clipping her nails from over 100 feet away. And it was absolutely disgusting. And why would anyone do something so gross in a public place.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy friend responded, \"chill out\".\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo... Is clipping your fingernails at work as asshole thing to do? This is where the debate started last night- is it super gross as coworker B feels, or is it fine?  Is my friend the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the \"Am I the Asshole\" post is in the wrong. The situation involves a friend who clipped her nails at work after a coworker told her not to, and then the coworker got upset again.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the key points. The friend first clipped a hanging nail, mentioned it to a coworker, then another coworker (B) overheard, got upset, and told her not to do it. The friend then clipped more nails, and coworker B texted her about how loud and gross it was. The friend responded with \"chill out.\"\n\nThe user thinks the author (the friend) is in the wrong. I need to evaluate both sides. \n\nFrom the coworker B's perspective, clipping nails in a shared workspace might be seen as inconsiderate. Nail clippers can be loud and unsanitary. It's common for workplaces to have unspoken rules about personal grooming to avoid disturbing others. The fact that coworker B could hear it from 100 feet away suggests it's disruptive. The friend's response of \"chill out\" might come off as dismissive, not acknowledging the coworker's discomfort.\n\nOn the other hand, the friend might argue that it's a minor action. Clipping a hanging nail could be necessary for comfort and hygiene. Maybe she did it in her cubicle, so it's contained. However, the act of doing it in the workplace, especially after being told not to, could be seen as disregarding the coworker's feelings. Also, clipping more nails after being asked might be seen as provoking.\n\nWorkplace etiquette often emphasizes consideration for others. Even if something is legal or allowed, it might still be socially inappropriate if it bothers others. The friend's actions after being warned could be seen as inconsiderate. The \"chill out\" response might indicate a lack of empathy.\n\nSo, considering the disruption caused, the response from the coworker, and the friend's actions post-warning, it seems the friend might be in the wrong. Answer A (Yes) might be appropriate. But maybe there's a middle ground. However, the question is whether the author (friend) is in the wrong. Given the context, the answer is likely A.\n"
