And there were some conflicting feelings about whether or not she was the asshole.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nYesterday, my friend remarked to a coworker that she had a hanging nail and was glad she had her nail clippers to take care of it. Coworker B was walking by and overheard. Coworker B walked into friend's cubicle and demand she NOT clip her nails at work because that was disgusting. Coworker B then retreats back to her cubicle on the other side of the floor.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy friend then clips her hanging nail in her own cubicle. And then clipped two more to \"even things out\".  She then receives a text message from Coworker B that she could hear her clipping her nails from over 100 feet away. And it was absolutely disgusting. And why would anyone do something so gross in a public place.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy friend responded, \"chill out\".\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo... Is clipping your fingernails at work as asshole thing to do? This is where the debate started last night- is it super gross as coworker B feels, or is it fine?  Is my friend the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. So, the situation is about someone clipping their nails at work. The friend mentioned had a hanging nail and used clippers, then clipped two more to even them out. The coworker overheard, got upset, and told her not to do that because it's gross. Then the coworker texts her that she could hear it from far away and called it disgusting. The friend replied with \"chill out.\" Now, the question is whether the friend is the asshole here.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the norms of workplace behavior. Clipping nails is generally considered something you do at home or in a private setting. In an office, it's usually discouraged because the sound and the act can be seen as unprofessional or unhygienic. People might find the noise annoying, as mentioned here where the coworker could hear it from 100 feet away. Also, the act of clipping nails in public can be seen as something unsanitary because it's associated with bodily functions and could spread germs. \n\nOn the other hand, the friend might argue that it was a quick fix for an immediate problem (a hanging nail) and that she was in her own cubicle. She might not see it as a big deal. But the coworker's reaction is also valid because it's about personal boundaries and workplace etiquette. The friend's response of \"chill out\" could be seen as dismissive of the coworker's feelings, which isn't helpful. \n\nThe key points here are the impact on others and mutual respect. Even if the friend didn't intend to be offensive, the action affected her coworker. Workplaces often have unwritten rules about such things. The friend's action might be considered inconsiderate, especially since she continued after being asked to stop. The follow-up clipping of two more nails to \"even things out\" might be seen as defiant or not taking the coworker's request seriously. \n\nSo, considering both sides, the friend's actions, while maybe not malicious, cross into being inconsiderate. The coworker's reaction is based on common workplace standards, and the friend's response doesn't show consideration for the coworker's discomfort. Therefore, the friend might be the one at fault here.\n"
