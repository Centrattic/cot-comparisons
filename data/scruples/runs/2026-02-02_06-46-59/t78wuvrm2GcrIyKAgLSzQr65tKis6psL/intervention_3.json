And there were some conflicting feelings about whether or not she was the asshole.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nYesterday, my friend remarked to a coworker that she had a hanging nail and was glad she had her nail clippers to take care of it. Coworker B was walking by and overheard. Coworker B walked into friend's cubicle and demand she NOT clip her nails at work because that was disgusting. Coworker B then retreats back to her cubicle on the other side of the floor.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy friend then clips her hanging nail in her own cubicle. And then clipped two more to \"even things out\".  She then receives a text message from Coworker B that she could hear her clipping her nails from over 100 feet away. And it was absolutely disgusting. And why would anyone do something so gross in a public place.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy friend responded, \"chill out\".\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo... Is clipping your fingernails at work as asshole thing to do? This is where the debate started last night- is it super gross as coworker B feels, or is it fine?  Is my friend the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. So the question is whether the friend who clipped her nails at work is the asshole here. The situation is that one coworker, B, overheard a remark about a hanging nail and then told the friend not to clip them at work because it's disgusting. The friend then clipped her nail and two more, and after getting a text from B about hearing the clippers from far away and calling it gross, the friend replied \"chill out.\"\n\nHmm. First, I need to consider office etiquette. Clipping nails at work isn't unheard of, but maybe it's not the most professional thing. Some people find it gross because of the sound or the mess. But on the other hand, if you're in your own cubicle and not disturbing others, maybe it's acceptable.\n\nThe friend did clip a hanging nail, which could be necessary for hygiene. But then she clipped two more to \"even things out.\" That part might be where the issue is. If there's no need beyond aesthetics, doing it in the workplace could be seen as unprofessional or inconsiderate, especially if others are bothered by it. The coworker B got really upset, even to the point of confronting her and sending a text about hearing it from 100 feet away. That's a strong reaction.\n\nThe friend's response was \"chill out,\" which might come off as dismissive. If she knew coworker B was so bothered by it, maybe she should have taken it more seriously. But maybe coworker B overreacted? It's a bit of a gray area. However, the act of clipping nails in an office setting, even in your own cubicle, can be disruptive. The sound travels, and people might find it distracting or unpleasant. So even if it's legal or allowed, it might still be considered rude or inconsiderate. The friend didn't consider how her actions affected others, clipped more than necessary, and then dismissed the coworker's concerns. That seems like she's in the wrong. So I think the answer is A.\n"
