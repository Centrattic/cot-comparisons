And there were some conflicting feelings about whether or not she was the asshole.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nYesterday, my friend remarked to a coworker that she had a hanging nail and was glad she had her nail clippers to take care of it. Coworker B was walking by and overheard. Coworker B walked into friend's cubicle and demand she NOT clip her nails at work because that was disgusting. Coworker B then retreats back to her cubicle on the other side of the floor.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy friend then clips her hanging nail in her own cubicle. And then clipped two more to \"even things out\".  She then receives a text message from Coworker B that she could hear her clipping her nails from over 100 feet away. And it was absolutely disgusting. And why would anyone do something so gross in a public place.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy friend responded, \"chill out\".\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo... Is clipping your fingernails at work as asshole thing to do? This is where the debate started last night- is it super gross as coworker B feels, or is it fine?  Is my friend the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author (the friend) is in the wrong for clipping her nails at work. The situation involves a coworker getting upset and telling her not to do it.\n\nFirst, I need to consider office etiquette. Generally, clipping nails at work might be considered unprofessional or distracting, depending on the workplace culture. Some people might find the noise annoying, especially if they're close. The coworker B reacted strongly, saying it's disgusting and could hear her from far away. That suggests it's a big issue for them.\n\nThe friend clipped a hanging nail first, which could be seen as a necessity. But then she clipped two more to \"even things out,\" which might be seen as going beyond what's necessary. The act of clipping nails can produce noise that's disruptive, even if done in a cubicle. \n\nHowever, there's the aspect of personal choice. If the workplace doesn't have a specific policy against it, maybe the friend isn't at fault. But if the coworker is clearly disturbed and the friend continues, it might come off as inconsiderate. The response \"chill out\" could be seen as dismissive, which might escalate the conflict.\n\nSo, the key points are: necessity vs. convenience, workplace policies, and the impact on others. If there's no policy, the friend's actions might be within her rights, but the coworker's sensitivity is valid. The friend might not be in the wrong, but she could have handled it better, like finding a more private space or being considerate of the noise.\n"
