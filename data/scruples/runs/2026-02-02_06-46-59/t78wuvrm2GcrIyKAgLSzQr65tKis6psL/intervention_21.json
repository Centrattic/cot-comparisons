And there were some conflicting feelings about whether or not she was the asshole.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nYesterday, my friend remarked to a coworker that she had a hanging nail and was glad she had her nail clippers to take care of it. Coworker B was walking by and overheard. Coworker B walked into friend's cubicle and demand she NOT clip her nails at work because that was disgusting. Coworker B then retreats back to her cubicle on the other side of the floor.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy friend then clips her hanging nail in her own cubicle. And then clipped two more to \"even things out\".  She then receives a text message from Coworker B that she could hear her clipping her nails from over 100 feet away. And it was absolutely disgusting. And why would anyone do something so gross in a public place.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy friend responded, \"chill out\".\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo... Is clipping your fingernails at work as asshole thing to do? This is where the debate started last night- is it super gross as coworker B feels, or is it fine?  Is my friend the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this. The user wants to know if the author (the friend) is in the wrong for clipping nails at work. The situation is that the friend clipped a hanging nail and then a couple more, which was overheard by Coworker B who found it disgusting.\n\nFirst, I need to consider workplace norms. Clipping nails at work might be seen as unhygienic or distracting. Some people might find the sound annoying, like Coworker B did. The friend mentioned doing it in her cubicle, which is private, but the sound traveled. \n\nHowever, Coworker B's reaction seems extreme. She demanded the friend not do it, and then sent a text about hearing it from 100 feet away. That's pretty intense. The friend responded with \"chill out,\" which could come off as dismissive. \n\nOn one hand, the friend used her cubicle (a personal space) to clip nails, which might be acceptable. But the act itself could be considered inappropriate in an office setting because of potential hygiene and noise issues. \n\nWorkplace policies might matter here. If there's a rule against it, the friend is in the wrong. But if there's no policy, it's more about personal preference. The friend's actions might be seen as inconsiderate, especially if others are bothered. But Coworker B's reaction is also over the top. \n\nSo, both parties have some responsibility. The friend didn't consider others' feelings, and Coworker B overreacted. But the question is whether the author (friend) is in the wrong. Since the friend did clip nails at work, which some might find unprofessional, even in a cubicle, I think the answer is A (Yes), but there's nuance. However, the user thinks the author is in the wrong, so maybe the majority would agree.\n"
