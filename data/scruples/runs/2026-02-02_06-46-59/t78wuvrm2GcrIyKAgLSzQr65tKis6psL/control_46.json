And there were some conflicting feelings about whether or not she was the asshole.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nYesterday, my friend remarked to a coworker that she had a hanging nail and was glad she had her nail clippers to take care of it. Coworker B was walking by and overheard. Coworker B walked into friend's cubicle and demand she NOT clip her nails at work because that was disgusting. Coworker B then retreats back to her cubicle on the other side of the floor.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy friend then clips her hanging nail in her own cubicle. And then clipped two more to \"even things out\".  She then receives a text message from Coworker B that she could hear her clipping her nails from over 100 feet away. And it was absolutely disgusting. And why would anyone do something so gross in a public place.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy friend responded, \"chill out\".\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo... Is clipping your fingernails at work as asshole thing to do? This is where the debate started last night- is it super gross as coworker B feels, or is it fine?  Is my friend the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The question is whether the friend (the author's friend) who clipped her nails at work is in the wrong. The user wants to know if the author (who's recounting the friend's story) is in the wrong, but actually, the focus here is on the friend's actions.\n\nSo, the situation: The friend had a hanging nail, used clippers, mentioned it to a coworker. Then another coworker, B, overheard and demanded she stop because it's disgusting. The friend then clipped more nails, and later received a text from coworker B about hearing the nail clipping from far away and being disgusted. The friend responded with \"chill out.\"\n\nThe main issue is whether clipping nails at work is inappropriate. Factors to consider:\n\n1. **Workplace Policies**: Some workplaces might have rules about personal grooming. If there's no such policy, it's a gray area. But if there is a policy against nail clipping, the friend would be in the wrong. However, the story doesn't mention any company rules, so maybe that's not the case here.\n\n2. **Discomfort to Others**: Coworker B found it gross and disturbing. The act of clipping nails can be loud and some people find the sound unpleasant. The friend clipped in her cubicle, which might be considered a personal space, but the noise could still affect others nearby. If the friend was in a shared space or a common area, it might be more problematic. But since she's in her own cubicle, maybe it's more acceptable unless the noise carries.\n\n3. **Response to Criticism**: The friend continued clipping after being told to stop. That could be seen as dismissive of coworker B's feelings. Even if it's not against the rules, disregarding someone's discomfort might come off as inconsiderate. The \"chill out\" response wasn't helpful and could escalate tensions.\n\n4. **Intent and Frequency**: Clipping one nail might be an emergency. Clipping multiple after being asked could be seen as provoking or not respecting others' feelings. The friend did it to \"even things out,\" which sounds like a reaction rather than a necessity.\n\n5. **Common Workplace Norms**: In many offices, people do minor grooming like touching up hair or makeup, but nail clipping is less common. It's subjective, but some people might find it off-putting. The key is whether the friend considered others' potential discomfort.\n\nPutting it all together: The friend was in her cubicle, which is a semi-private space, but the noise was audible across the floor. The coworker B was clearly disturbed. The friend didn't stop after being asked, which shows a lack of consideration. While there's no rule mentioned, the action affected others, and continuing after being told to stop could be seen as inconsiderate. So, the friend's actions might be deemed inappropriate, making the author (recounting the story) not in the wrong, but the friend might be. However, the question is about the author's wrongness. Wait, the original question is whether the person who wrote the story (the author) is in the wrong. Wait, no\u2014the setup says \"Is the author in the wrong?\" but the scenario is the friend's actions. Wait, the original post is from the author (the friend's story), so the user is asking if the author (the person who wrote the story) is in the wrong. Wait, the story is about the friend, but the user is asking if the author (the person telling the story) is in the wrong. But in the story, the author isn't directly doing anything except retelling the events. The actual actions are the friend's. However, maybe the user is implying that the author is the friend, and thus the question is whether the friend is in the wrong. The initial question says \"Is the author in the wrong?\" but the story is about the friend. The user might have mixed up the roles here. Let me check again.\n\nThe original post starts with \"AITA for clipping my nails at work?\" So the author is the friend in the story. Therefore, the question is whether the author (the friend) is in the wrong. The user wants to know if the author (the friend) is in the wrong. So the answer should be based on the friend's actions. The author here is the one who clipped the nails and responded to coworker B. So the answer is whether the friend (author) is the asshole. The options are A for yes (author is in the wrong), B for no.\n\nSo, considering all factors: The friend clipped nails in her cubicle. If the cubicle is considered a private space, then maybe it's acceptable. But the noise was heard by others, and the coworker was disturbed. The friend continued after being asked to stop, which is inconsiderate. The response \"chill out\" was dismissive. While there's no rule against it, being considerate of others' feelings is important in a workplace. Therefore, the author (friend) might be in the wrong for not respecting coworker B's discomfort and continuing the action. So the answer is A.\n"
