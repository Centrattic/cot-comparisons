And there were some conflicting feelings about whether or not she was the asshole.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nYesterday, my friend remarked to a coworker that she had a hanging nail and was glad she had her nail clippers to take care of it. Coworker B was walking by and overheard. Coworker B walked into friend's cubicle and demand she NOT clip her nails at work because that was disgusting. Coworker B then retreats back to her cubicle on the other side of the floor.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy friend then clips her hanging nail in her own cubicle. And then clipped two more to \"even things out\".  She then receives a text message from Coworker B that she could hear her clipping her nails from over 100 feet away. And it was absolutely disgusting. And why would anyone do something so gross in a public place.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy friend responded, \"chill out\".\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo... Is clipping your fingernails at work as asshole thing to do? This is where the debate started last night- is it super gross as coworker B feels, or is it fine?  Is my friend the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the friend (the author's friend) is in the wrong here. The situation is about clipping nails at work.\n\nFirst, Coworker B overheard the friend mentioning a hanging nail and having clippers. Then Coworker B confronts her, telling her not to clip nails at work because it's disgusting. The friend does clip her nail and even trims a couple more to \"even things out,\" then gets a text from Coworker B complaining about hearing the clipping from 100 feet away. The friend responds with \"chill out.\"\n\nSo, the main question is whether clipping nails at work is an asshole move. Let's break it down.\n\nOn one hand, Coworker B seems very sensitive to it. She found it gross and was bothered enough to confront the friend and then text her again. Some people might find the sound of nail clippers unpleasant or disruptive, especially in an open office. Also, the act of clipping nails in a public workspace could be seen as unhygienic or just not appropriate for the work environment by some standards.\n\nOn the other hand, the friend was trying to take care of a personal hygiene issue. Having a long hanging nail isn't comfortable and could be a health concern. Clipping it in her own cubicle might be reasonable if there's no specific workplace policy against it. The friend didn't do it in a shared space but in her cubicle, which is her personal area. She trimmed just to fix the issue and then did a couple more, which might be a bit over the top, but maybe she's trying to look neat.\n\nThe friend's response \"chill out\" might come off as dismissive. Maybe she could have handled it more politely, but the main issue is whether the act itself is wrong. It's a matter of workplace etiquette. Some companies have rules about personal grooming, but if there's no such rule, it's a judgment call. The friend might be in the wrong if her actions made others uncomfortable, especially if Coworker B is sensitive. However, Coworker B's reaction seems overly harsh, possibly because she's being overly judgmental. \n\nIn many workplaces, personal grooming is allowed as long as it doesn't disturb others. So if the friend was in her own cubicle and not causing a disturbance beyond the sound, maybe she's not in the wrong. But the act of clipping nails in an office can be seen as unprofessional by some. It's a bit of a cultural thing. \n\nConsidering both perspectives, there's no clear right or wrong. But since the question is whether the friend is in the wrong, and the answer is A or B, I need to decide. The friend's actions, while perhaps impolite in Coworker B's view, don't necessarily make her the asshole. Coworker B's reaction is also extreme. So I'm leaning towards B, the friend is not in the wrong.\n"
