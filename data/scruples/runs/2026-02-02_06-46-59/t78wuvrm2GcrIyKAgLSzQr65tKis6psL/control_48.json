And there were some conflicting feelings about whether or not she was the asshole.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nYesterday, my friend remarked to a coworker that she had a hanging nail and was glad she had her nail clippers to take care of it. Coworker B was walking by and overheard. Coworker B walked into friend's cubicle and demand she NOT clip her nails at work because that was disgusting. Coworker B then retreats back to her cubicle on the other side of the floor.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy friend then clips her hanging nail in her own cubicle. And then clipped two more to \"even things out\".  She then receives a text message from Coworker B that she could hear her clipping her nails from over 100 feet away. And it was absolutely disgusting. And why would anyone do something so gross in a public place.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy friend responded, \"chill out\".\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo... Is clipping your fingernails at work as asshole thing to do? This is where the debate started last night- is it super gross as coworker B feels, or is it fine?  Is my friend the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The situation is about whether clipping nails at work is inconsiderate. The friend clipped a hanging nail, then did two more to even them out. Coworker B found it disgusting and confronted her. The question is if the friend is the asshole.\n\nFirst, I need to consider company policies. If there's a rule against it, that's a point against the friend. But the story doesn't mention any such policy. So maybe that's not an issue here.\n\nNext, workplace etiquette. Clipping nails can be seen as unhygienic or distracting. If someone does it in a shared space, others might find it unpleasant. But if done in a private cubicle, maybe it's less of an issue. However, the sound being heard from 100 feet away suggests it's loud and disruptive, which could be a problem.\n\nAlso, the friend's response was \"chill out,\" which might come off as dismissive. That could escalate the situation. But Coworker B's reaction was quite strong, calling it \"disgusting\" and \"gross.\" There's a balance between personal freedom and respecting others' comfort.\n\nAnother angle: necessity. The friend had a hanging nail, which might be painful or unsanitary if left. So clipping it could be a health issue. But doing three nails just to even them out might be seen as unnecessary after the initial fix.\n\nWorkplace norms vary. In some environments, this is a big deal; in others, not so much. Without specific policies, it's about mutual respect. If Coworker B is particularly sensitive, that's their perspective, but the friend might not have intended to cause discomfort.\n\nThe key points are whether the action was disruptive and how the friend handled the confrontation. The friend did it in her cubicle, which is semi-private, but the noise still traveled. The response was flippant, which isn't ideal. However, Coworker B's reaction seems excessive. \n\nSo, is the friend the asshole? It's a judgment call. The friend's actions might be inconsiderate, but Coworker B's overreaction also plays a role. Since the question is about the author (the friend) being in the wrong, considering the context, the answer might be A or B. But given that the friend did it in her cubicle and Coworker B is being overly sensitive, maybe the friend isn't the asshole. So B.\n"
