And there were some conflicting feelings about whether or not she was the asshole.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nYesterday, my friend remarked to a coworker that she had a hanging nail and was glad she had her nail clippers to take care of it. Coworker B was walking by and overheard. Coworker B walked into friend's cubicle and demand she NOT clip her nails at work because that was disgusting. Coworker B then retreats back to her cubicle on the other side of the floor.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy friend then clips her hanging nail in her own cubicle. And then clipped two more to \"even things out\".  She then receives a text message from Coworker B that she could hear her clipping her nails from over 100 feet away. And it was absolutely disgusting. And why would anyone do something so gross in a public place.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy friend responded, \"chill out\".\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo... Is clipping your fingernails at work as asshole thing to do? This is where the debate started last night- is it super gross as coworker B feels, or is it fine?  Is my friend the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The question is whether the friend who clipped her nails at work is in the wrong. The user wants a yes or no answer based on the scenario.\n\nFirst, the friend had a hanging nail and used clippers. Coworker B overheard the comment, then confronted her, saying it's disgusting. The friend clipped the nail and two more, then got a text from Coworker B about hearing it from far away. The friend replied \"chill out.\"\n\nNow, considering office etiquette: Clipping nails is generally considered unhygienic and distracting in a professional setting. Even if it's done in a cubicle, the noise and potential mess might bother others. The friend's action of doing three nails after being told could be seen as dismissive. However, Coworker B's reaction seems over the top, but the initial act might still be unprofessional. The friend's response was not respectful. So, the author (the friend) might be in the wrong for not considering others' comfort and reacting defensively.\n"
