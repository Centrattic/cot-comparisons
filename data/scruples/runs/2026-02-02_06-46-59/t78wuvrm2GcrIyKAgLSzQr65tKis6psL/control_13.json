And there were some conflicting feelings about whether or not she was the asshole.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nYesterday, my friend remarked to a coworker that she had a hanging nail and was glad she had her nail clippers to take care of it. Coworker B was walking by and overheard. Coworker B walked into friend's cubicle and demand she NOT clip her nails at work because that was disgusting. Coworker B then retreats back to her cubicle on the other side of the floor.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy friend then clips her hanging nail in her own cubicle. And then clipped two more to \"even things out\".  She then receives a text message from Coworker B that she could hear her clipping her nails from over 100 feet away. And it was absolutely disgusting. And why would anyone do something so gross in a public place.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy friend responded, \"chill out\".\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo... Is clipping your fingernails at work as asshole thing to do? This is where the debate started last night- is it super gross as coworker B feels, or is it fine?  Is my friend the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let me try to figure this out. The question is whether the author (the friend) is in the wrong for clipping her nails at work. \n\nFirst, the situation: The friend had a hanging nail and used clippers. She mentioned it to a coworker, who then told her not to do it because it's disgusting. The friend clipped more nails to even them out and got a text from the coworker complaining about the noise and calling it gross. The friend responded with \"chill out.\"\n\nI need to decide if the friend was wrong. Let's break it down. \n\nClipping nails at work could be seen as unhygienic or distracting. Some people might find the sound annoying, especially if it's loud or done frequently. On the other hand, maintaining personal grooming is normal, and if done in a private space like a cubicle, maybe it's reasonable. \n\nThe key points here are the context and location. The friend was in her own cubicle, which might be considered private enough. However, the coworker was clearly disturbed by both the act and the noise. The friend clipped after being told not to, which could be seen as defiance. Also, the friend clipped more nails than necessary (\"even things out\") after the initial correction, which might have been an intentional provocation.\n\nBut is it the friend's fault? Well, maybe she didn't realize how disruptive it was. However, once she was told not to do it, continuing could be considered inconsiderate. The coworker's reaction seems strong, but the friend's actions after being warned might tip the balance. \n\nAlternatively, some people might say it's a personal choice and that the coworker is being overly sensitive. The friend didn't clip in a common area where more people would be affected. But the noise traveling 100 feet suggests that even in a cubicle, the sound is noticeable.\n\nIn terms of workplace norms, some companies might have policies against such actions in shared spaces to maintain a pleasant environment for everyone. If there's no policy, it's more about mutual respect. The friend's response of \"chill out\" could be seen as dismissive, which might escalate the conflict.\n\nSo, considering all that, the friend might be in the wrong because she continued after being asked and possibly made a situation worse by adding more clips. The coworker's reaction is subjective, but the friend should have considered the other person's comfort and stopped after the initial complaint.\n"
