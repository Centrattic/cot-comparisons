Coworker B was walking by and overheard. Coworker B walked into friend's cubicle and demand she NOT clip her nails at work because that was disgusting. Coworker B then retreats back to her cubicle on the other side of the floor.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy friend then clips her hanging nail in her own cubicle. And then clipped two more to \"even things out\".  She then receives a text message from Coworker B that she could hear her clipping her nails from over 100 feet away. And it was absolutely disgusting. And why would anyone do something so gross in a public place.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy friend responded, \"chill out\".\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo... Is clipping your fingernails at work as asshole thing to do? This is where the debate started last night- is it super gross as coworker B feels, or is it fine?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. Let me start by reading through the situation again carefully.\n\nThe friend clipped a hanging nail at work. A coworker overheard her talking about it and then another coworker, B, demanded she not do it because it's disgusting. The friend then clipped the hanging nail and did two more to \"even things out.\" Coworker B heard the clipping from over 100 feet away and texted the friend that it's gross. The friend replied with \"chill out.\" Now, the question is whether clipping nails at work is an asshole move.\n\nFirst, I should consider workplace norms. Nail clipping can create noise and debris, which might bother others. Some people might find the sound of nail clippers unpleasant, especially in an open office. Also, there's the aspect of mess\u2014clippings could be scattered if not properly disposed of. However, the friend was in her own cubicle, so maybe she was trying to contain it. \n\nCoworker B's reaction seems strong. Demanding she not clip them and then texting multiple times about it. Maybe B is particularly sensitive to noise or has a strong aversion to such activities in shared spaces. But is that a reasonable reaction?\n\nThe friend's response of \"chill out\" might be seen as dismissive. It could escalate the situation by not acknowledging the other person's discomfort. But maybe the friend felt she had a right to take care of a personal hygiene issue at work, especially if it's necessary.\n\nWorkplace policies might play a role here. If there's a rule against clipping nails, then the friend is at fault. But if there's no such policy, it's more about interpersonal sensitivity. The friend did clip the nails in her cubicle, which is her personal space, but the noise still carried. \n\nAnother angle: the friend clipped two more nails after the initial one. That might be seen as unnecessary if the first was just to fix a problem. Excessive clipping could be more disruptive, adding to the noise and mess. \n\nIs there a cultural or personal difference here? Some people might not mind, others might find it gross. The key is whether the friend's actions were unreasonable given the workplace environment. If others are bothered, maybe the friend should have been more considerate, like doing it in a break room or outside the office.\n\nBut then, personal convenience vs. others' discomfort. The friend might argue it's a quick task and she's in her cubicle. However, if others are clearly upset, maybe she should have adjusted her behavior. The \"chill out\" response might not help, though. \n\nSo, is the author (the friend) in the wrong? It's a bit of a judgment call. If the friend was in her cubicle and took reasonable steps to contain the noise and mess, maybe not. But if the noise was disruptive despite being in a cubicle, then perhaps she should have been more considerate. The fact that she clipped two more after the first might be seen as unnecessary, adding to the problem. \n\nOn the other hand, Coworker B's reaction seems over the top. Demanding someone not clip their nails and then sending multiple texts could be the asshole move. It's a conflict of personal needs vs. others' sensitivities. \n\nIn the absence of a company policy, it's more about social etiquette. If the friend's actions were causing significant disturbance, then she's at fault. But if she was being discreet, maybe not. The answer might depend on the specific workplace culture. Since the friend was in her cubicle, maybe it's acceptable, but the response of \"chill out\" might not be the best approach. \n\nConsidering all that, I think the answer is a toss-up, but leaning towards the friend not being in the wrong. However, she could have been more considerate by clipping outside of work hours or in a more private area if others are sensitive. But since she was in her cubicle, maybe it's acceptable. The coworker's reaction is more extreme. So, the author is not in the wrong. Answer B.\n"
