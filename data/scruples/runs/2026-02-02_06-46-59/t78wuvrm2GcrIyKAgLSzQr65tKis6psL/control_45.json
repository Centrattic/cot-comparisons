And there were some conflicting feelings about whether or not she was the asshole.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nYesterday, my friend remarked to a coworker that she had a hanging nail and was glad she had her nail clippers to take care of it. Coworker B was walking by and overheard. Coworker B walked into friend's cubicle and demand she NOT clip her nails at work because that was disgusting. Coworker B then retreats back to her cubicle on the other side of the floor.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy friend then clips her hanging nail in her own cubicle. And then clipped two more to \"even things out\".  She then receives a text message from Coworker B that she could hear her clipping her nails from over 100 feet away. And it was absolutely disgusting. And why would anyone do something so gross in a public place.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy friend responded, \"chill out\".\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo... Is clipping your fingernails at work as asshole thing to do? This is where the debate started last night- is it super gross as coworker B feels, or is it fine?  Is my friend the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The question is whether the friend (the author) was in the wrong for clipping her nails at work. The scenario is that she mentioned having a hanging nail and used clippers in her cubicle. Coworker B overheard, confronted her, and later complained about hearing the clipping from far away. The friend then clipped two more nails to even them out and told Coworker B to \"chill out.\"\n\nFirst, I need to consider company policies. If the workplace has rules against certain activities like nail clipping, then the friend might be in the wrong. But the story doesn't mention any such policies. So maybe that's not the case here.\n\nNext, think about the social norms in the workplace. Nail clipping can be considered unhygienic or distracting by some. However, doing it in a private cubicle might mitigate that. The friend was in her own space, so it's not like she was doing it in a common area. The fact that Coworker B heard her from 100 feet away could be an issue, but that depends on how open the office is. If it's an open-plan office, maybe some noise is expected. But if clipping nails creates a noticeable noise, that could bother others. \n\nThe friend's response was \"chill out,\" which might come off as dismissive. Coworker B's reaction is about being disturbed and finding it gross. The friend clipped more nails after being told not to, which could be seen as defiance. But maybe she was just trying to fix an imbalance after the initial clip. \n\nIs it reasonable to clip nails at work? Some people might do it if necessary, especially in a private space. However, the act of doing it in a workspace where others can hear might be problematic. The key points are privacy and noise. If the cubicle is considered a private space, maybe it's okay. But if the noise is disruptive, even from a distance, that's an issue. \n\nAlso, the friend's reaction to Coworker B's complaint by clipping more nails might have been a bit of a provocation. It could be seen as not respecting the coworker's feelings. But the original act of clipping a hanging nail might be necessary for hygiene or comfort. \n\nIn terms of being the \"asshole,\" it's about whose actions were more inconsiderate. The friend might not be wrong if she was in her private cubicle and clipped one nail for a legitimate reason. However, continuing to clip more after being told could be seen as inconsiderate. The coworker's reaction might be over the top, but the friend's response isn't helpful either. \n\nSo, it's a bit of a gray area. If the office has open policies, maybe the friend isn't wrong. If the coworker is overly sensitive, then maybe not. But if the noise was disruptive despite being in a cubicle, the friend might be at fault. Considering all that, I think the answer is B (the author is not in the wrong) because she was in her cubicle and addressed a personal hygiene issue, but her response might have been better if she avoided clipping more after the initial complaint. However, the main issue is whether the action itself is wrong. Since it's in a private space and a necessary act, maybe it's not wrong.\n"
