And there were some conflicting feelings about whether or not she was the asshole.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nYesterday, my friend remarked to a coworker that she had a hanging nail and was glad she had her nail clippers to take care of it. Coworker B was walking by and overheard. Coworker B walked into friend's cubicle and demand she NOT clip her nails at work because that was disgusting. Coworker B then retreats back to her cubicle on the other side of the floor.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy friend then clips her hanging nail in her own cubicle. And then clipped two more to \"even things out\".  She then receives a text message from Coworker B that she could hear her clipping her nails from over 100 feet away. And it was absolutely disgusting. And why would anyone do something so gross in a public place.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy friend responded, \"chill out\".\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo... Is clipping your fingernails at work as asshole thing to do? This is where the debate started last night- is it super gross as coworker B feels, or is it fine?  Is my friend the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user wants to know if the author (the friend) is in the wrong for clipping her nails at work. The situation is that the friend had a hanging nail and used clippers. A coworker overheard her comment, then Coworker B confronted her, saying it was disgusting. The friend then clipped more nails and got another message from Coworker B complaining about the noise and calling it gross. The friend responded with \"chill out.\"\n\nSo, the debate is whether clipping nails at work is an asshole move. Let's break it down.\n\nFirst, the friend clipped her nails because there was a hanging nail. That's probably a reasonable action to maintain personal hygiene. But Coworker B found it disgusting and confrontational. The friend then clipped two more nails, which might have been unnecessary once the immediate problem was solved. The noise traveling 100 feet is a bit extreme, but maybe in an open office, sounds can carry.\n\nIs the friend wrong? Well, people have different sensibilities. Clipping nails isn't inherently wrong, but maybe in a shared workspace, it's considerate to avoid doing it at times or places where it might bother others. However, the friend wasn't in a common area; she was in her cubicle. That's a private space, so she might have a right to do it there. The initial clipping was to fix a problem, but clipping more to \"even things out\" might have been an overreaction, especially after Coworker B's complaint. The \"chill out\" response could be seen as dismissive, which might escalate the conflict.\n\nBut Coworker B's reaction seems over the top. Demanding someone not clip nails and then being upset about the noise is a bit much. It's possible that the friend wasn't entirely wrong, but maybe she could have handled it better. However, the question is whether she's in the wrong.\n\nIn some workplaces, there might be unwritten rules about such things. Since the friend was in her cubicle, it's a semi-private space. Clipping nails there might be acceptable. However, the noise traveling 100 feet suggests that Coworker B is very sensitive, which might not be the friend's fault. The friend's actions were for personal care, which is necessary. The clipping of two more nails after the initial fix could be seen as unnecessary, but maybe just to keep her nails even.\n\nIn conclusion, while Coworker B's reaction is extreme, the friend might not be entirely at fault. However, maybe she could have been more considerate by doing it in a private area or at a different time. But since she was in her cubicle, it's debatable. The answer might lean towards B (not the wrong) because personal hygiene is important, and doing it in a private space isn't inherently wrong. Coworker B's reaction is more out of line.\n"
