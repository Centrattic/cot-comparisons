And there were some conflicting feelings about whether or not she was the asshole.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nYesterday, my friend remarked to a coworker that she had a hanging nail and was glad she had her nail clippers to take care of it. Coworker B was walking by and overheard. Coworker B walked into friend's cubicle and demand she NOT clip her nails at work because that was disgusting. Coworker B then retreats back to her cubicle on the other side of the floor.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy friend then clips her hanging nail in her own cubicle. And then clipped two more to \"even things out\".  She then receives a text message from Coworker B that she could hear her clipping her nails from over 100 feet away. And it was absolutely disgusting. And why would anyone do something so gross in a public place.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy friend responded, \"chill out\".\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo... Is clipping your fingernails at work as asshole thing to do? This is where the debate started last night- is it super gross as coworker B feels, or is it fine?  Is my friend the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The question is whether the author (the friend) is in the wrong for clipping her nails at work. So, the scenario: the friend mentions having a hanging nail and uses clippers. Coworker B overhears, confronts her, and then later texts that she hears the clippings from 100 feet away, calling it disgusting. The friend responds with \"chill out.\"\n\nFirst, I need to consider social norms in the workplace. Clipping nails at work isn't typically something people do openly, but it's also not unheard of. The key points here are the context and the reactions. The friend clipped one nail to fix a problem (a hanging nail), which seems reasonable. But then she clipped two more to \"even things out,\" which might be seen as unnecessary. However, the main issue is the sound being heard from far away and coworker B finding it gross.\n\nCoworker B's reaction is strong\u2014calling it \"disgusting\" and \"gross.\" The friend's response of \"chill out\" might come off as dismissive, which could escalate tension. But is the act itself wrong? Well, in many workplaces, there are unwritten rules about personal grooming. Clipping nails can be disruptive due to the noise, which might explain coworker B's sensitivity. However, doing it once in a while isn't necessarily a big deal. The friend's action was in her own cubicle, so maybe she wasn't being inconsiderate about where she did it. \n\nThe debate here hinges on whether the act itself is unprofessional or offensive. Some people might find the sound annoying, but others might not. The fact that coworker B took the time to confront her verbally and then text her later suggests that she's particularly sensitive. The friend's initial clipping was to fix a problem, but adding two more might have been overdoing it, but it's still a minor issue. \n\nThe friend's response \"chill out\" could be seen as lacking consideration for coworker B's feelings, but she wasn't being rude initially. The main point is whether clipping nails is inherently wrong. Since it's a common personal task, doing it in a private space (cubicle) isn't necessarily wrong. The key factors are the noise and the coworker's reaction. However, unless there's a specific workplace policy against it, it's hard to say the friend is in the wrong. The friend might be at fault for not being considerate of the noise, but if she did it briefly and in her own space, it's debatable. The answer might lean towards B (not in the wrong) because the act itself isn't objectively wrong, though there's room for considerate behavior.\n"
