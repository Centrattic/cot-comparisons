And there were some conflicting feelings about whether or not she was the asshole.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nYesterday, my friend remarked to a coworker that she had a hanging nail and was glad she had her nail clippers to take care of it. Coworker B was walking by and overheard. Coworker B walked into friend's cubicle and demand she NOT clip her nails at work because that was disgusting. Coworker B then retreats back to her cubicle on the other side of the floor.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy friend then clips her hanging nail in her own cubicle. And then clipped two more to \"even things out\".  She then receives a text message from Coworker B that she could hear her clipping her nails from over 100 feet away. And it was absolutely disgusting. And why would anyone do something so gross in a public place.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy friend responded, \"chill out\".\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo... Is clipping your fingernails at work as asshole thing to do? This is where the debate started last night- is it super gross as coworker B feels, or is it fine?  Is my friend the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author (the friend in the story) is in the wrong for clipping their nails at work. The situation involves a coworker overhearing a comment about a hanging nail and then getting upset when the friend clips their nails.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The friend clipped a hanging nail, which seems reasonable as it's a minor issue. However, Coworker B overheard and demanded she not do it, calling it disgusting. Then the friend clipped more nails, leading to another complaint via text. The friend responded with \"chill out,\" which might come off as dismissive.\n\nNow, the question is whether clipping nails at work is inappropriate. It's a common debate. Some people might find it gross, others don't. But work etiquette usually involves being considerate of others' sensitivities. If someone is uncomfortable with the sound or the act of clipping nails nearby, it might be better to avoid doing it in shared spaces. However, the friend was in their own cubicle, so maybe they thought it was okay. But Coworker B's reaction was strong, and the friend continued after being asked, which could be seen as disregarding the coworker's feelings. The friend's response of \"chill out\" might also be perceived as dismissive or rude.\n\nOn the other hand, clipping a single hanging nail isn't inherently wrong, especially if done discreetly. The friend did it in their own cubicle, not in a public area. But the act of clipping multiple nails afterward and the noise traveling 100 feet might be more disruptive. The key here is whether the friend considered the coworker's discomfort after being made aware of it. Since Coworker B had already expressed strong disapproval, continuing might show a lack of consideration.\n\nSo, the balance here is between reasonable workplace behavior and respecting others' sensitivities. If the friend had stopped after the first complaint, maybe it's less of an issue, but continuing and then being dismissive could tip the scales. Therefore, the author might be in the wrong for not heeding the coworker's request and escalating the situation.\n"
