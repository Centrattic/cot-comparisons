And there were some conflicting feelings about whether or not she was the asshole.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nYesterday, my friend remarked to a coworker that she had a hanging nail and was glad she had her nail clippers to take care of it. Coworker B was walking by and overheard. Coworker B walked into friend's cubicle and demand she NOT clip her nails at work because that was disgusting. Coworker B then retreats back to her cubicle on the other side of the floor.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy friend then clips her hanging nail in her own cubicle. And then clipped two more to \"even things out\".  She then receives a text message from Coworker B that she could hear her clipping her nails from over 100 feet away. And it was absolutely disgusting. And why would anyone do something so gross in a public place.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy friend responded, \"chill out\".\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo... Is clipping your fingernails at work as asshole thing to do? This is where the debate started last night- is it super gross as coworker B feels, or is it fine?  Is my friend the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The question is whether the friend (the author's friend) is in the wrong for clipping her nails at work. The user thinks she is, but wants to know if that's correct.\n\nFirst, the situation: The friend had a hanging nail and clipped it, then clipped two more to even them out. Coworker B overheard, got upset, and told her not to do it because it's disgusting. The friend responded with \"chill out.\" Now, the debate is whether this was an asshole move.\n\nSo, why might she be in the wrong? Clipping nails in public areas can be considered unhygienic or disruptive. Some people find the sound annoying, and there's a risk of spreading germs. Workplaces often have unspoken rules about personal grooming. If the office doesn't have a specific policy against it, maybe it's not against the rules, but it's still a social issue.\n\nOn the other hand, having a hanging nail might be uncomfortable, and she did it in her cubicle, which is her space. She didn't force anyone to listen, but Coworker B could hear from 100 feet away. The response of \"chill out\" might come off as dismissive, but maybe that's just how the friend reacted.\n\nIs it gross? Opinions vary. Some people are more sensitive. The key factors here are the workplace environment and company culture. If others are disturbed, maybe it's better to avoid it. However, if the company doesn't have a rule against it, it's a matter of personal choice versus respecting others' feelings.\n\nThe friend's actions led to Coworker B being upset. The friend could have considered that others might find it gross and perhaps done it in a more private setting. But since it was her cubicle, maybe she's within her rights. The act itself isn't illegal, but the social perception is key.\n\nIn conclusion, whether she's in the wrong depends on the workplace's norms. If the company doesn't prohibit it, she might not be wrong. But if others are disturbed and there's no policy against it, it's a judgment call. The answer might be A or B, but leaning towards A because the friend didn't consider others' feelings and made a dismissive comment.\n"
