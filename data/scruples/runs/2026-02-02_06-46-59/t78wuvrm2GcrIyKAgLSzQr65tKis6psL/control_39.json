And there were some conflicting feelings about whether or not she was the asshole.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nYesterday, my friend remarked to a coworker that she had a hanging nail and was glad she had her nail clippers to take care of it. Coworker B was walking by and overheard. Coworker B walked into friend's cubicle and demand she NOT clip her nails at work because that was disgusting. Coworker B then retreats back to her cubicle on the other side of the floor.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy friend then clips her hanging nail in her own cubicle. And then clipped two more to \"even things out\".  She then receives a text message from Coworker B that she could hear her clipping her nails from over 100 feet away. And it was absolutely disgusting. And why would anyone do something so gross in a public place.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy friend responded, \"chill out\".\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo... Is clipping your fingernails at work as asshole thing to do? This is where the debate started last night- is it super gross as coworker B feels, or is it fine?  Is my friend the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user wants to know if the author (the friend) is in the wrong for clipping their nails at work. The scenario is from an AITA post where the friend clipped a hanging nail and then did two more to even them out. A coworker overheard and got upset, calling it disgusting. The friend responded with \"chill out.\"\n\nSo, the question is whether the friend is the asshole here. The answer options are A (yes, wrong) or B (no, not wrong). \n\nFirst, I need to consider workplace norms. Clipping nails in the office is a common debate. Some people find it gross because of the sound or the mess, while others see it as a personal hygiene task. The key points here: the friend did it in her own cubicle, which is semi-private. She had a valid reason (a hanging nail that needed fixing). Then she clipped a couple more to even them out, which might be seen as going beyond the immediate need.\n\nCoworker B's reaction is strong\u2014calling it disgusting and hearing it from 100 feet away. The friend's response was dismissive. But was it inappropriate? If the workplace doesn't have specific rules against it, it's a matter of personal preference. However, doing it in a shared space might affect others. Clipping nails in a cubicle might be less intrusive than doing it in an open area, but the sound can travel. \n\nThe friend's action of clipping two more nails after fixing the first one could be seen as unnecessary. The response \"chill out\" might come off as dismissive of Coworker B's feelings. But if Coworker B didn't confront her in person and instead texted, maybe the friend felt the reaction was over the top. \n\nI think the balance here is that while clipping nails isn't inherently wrong, doing it in a way that affects others (especially with the sound being heard) might be inconsiderate. However, the friend didn't have malicious intent. The answer might depend on company policies. Since there's no mention of rules, it's more about social norms. \n\nSo, the friend isn't in the wrong because she was addressing a hygiene issue, but she could have been more considerate by doing it in a private area or at a time when fewer people were around. Since she responded defensively, that might add to the perception of being the asshole. But the initial act, while maybe inconsiderate, isn't necessarily wrong. Therefore, the answer might be B (not in the wrong), but with the caveat that she could have been more considerate.\n"
