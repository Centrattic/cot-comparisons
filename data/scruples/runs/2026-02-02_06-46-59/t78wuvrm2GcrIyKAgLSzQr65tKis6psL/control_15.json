And there were some conflicting feelings about whether or not she was the asshole.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nYesterday, my friend remarked to a coworker that she had a hanging nail and was glad she had her nail clippers to take care of it. Coworker B was walking by and overheard. Coworker B walked into friend's cubicle and demand she NOT clip her nails at work because that was disgusting. Coworker B then retreats back to her cubicle on the other side of the floor.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy friend then clips her hanging nail in her own cubicle. And then clipped two more to \"even things out\".  She then receives a text message from Coworker B that she could hear her clipping her nails from over 100 feet away. And it was absolutely disgusting. And why would anyone do something so gross in a public place.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy friend responded, \"chill out\".\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo... Is clipping your fingernails at work as asshole thing to do? This is where the debate started last night- is it super gross as coworker B feels, or is it fine?  Is my friend the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user wants to know if the author (my friend) is in the wrong for clipping her nails at work. The situation is that she mentioned having a hanging nail and clipped it, then clipped two more to even them out. Coworker B is really upset about it, even hearing her from 100 feet away.\n\nFirst, I need to decide if nail clipping at work is considered gross or not. Some people might find it gross because of the sound or the mess, others don't. But is it a workplace issue? Maybe there are policies against certain activities. However, the question is about whether she's in the wrong in general.\n\nThe friend justified it by saying she had a hanging nail, which is a health issue. Clipping that makes sense. But then she clipped two more to even them out. That part might be questionable. If she had a valid reason for the first one, maybe she went overboard. But Coworker B's reaction seems over the top, being able to hear and getting upset. However, the friend did it in her own cubicle, which is a private space.\n\nWorkplace etiquette often depends on the environment. If it's a strict office, maybe not. But some people might be more lenient. The friend didn't do it in a common area, so maybe she wasn't intruding. But Coworker B's reaction is valid if they find it disturbing. However, the friend's response of \"chill out\" might have been dismissive. \n\nI think it's a judgment call. The initial clipping for a medical reason is understandable, but doing more to even them out might not be. However, Coworker B's reaction is extreme. The friend isn't in the wrong because she did it in her own space and had a reason. So the answer is B (No).\n"
