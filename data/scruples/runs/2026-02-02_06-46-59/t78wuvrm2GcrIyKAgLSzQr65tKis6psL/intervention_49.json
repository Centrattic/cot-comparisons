And there were some conflicting feelings about whether or not she was the asshole.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nYesterday, my friend remarked to a coworker that she had a hanging nail and was glad she had her nail clippers to take care of it. Coworker B was walking by and overheard. Coworker B walked into friend's cubicle and demand she NOT clip her nails at work because that was disgusting. Coworker B then retreats back to her cubicle on the other side of the floor.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy friend then clips her hanging nail in her own cubicle. And then clipped two more to \"even things out\".  She then receives a text message from Coworker B that she could hear her clipping her nails from over 100 feet away. And it was absolutely disgusting. And why would anyone do something so gross in a public place.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy friend responded, \"chill out\".\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo... Is clipping your fingernails at work as asshole thing to do? This is where the debate started last night- is it super gross as coworker B feels, or is it fine?  Is my friend the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The question is whether the author's friend is in the wrong for clipping her nails at work. So, first, what's the situation? She was talking about a hanging nail and used her clippers. Then a coworker heard her and told her not to do it because it's disgusting. The friend then clipped two more nails to make them even. The coworker sent a text saying she could hear it from far away and called it gross. The friend responded with \"chill out.\"\n\nHmm, the main issue here is about workplace appropriateness. Clipping nails at work\u2014some people might find it gross, others might think it's a normal thing to do. Companies usually have dress codes or workplace conduct policies. If there's no explicit rule against it, maybe it's a judgment call. But even if there's no rule, some people might be sensitive to the sound or the act itself.\n\nSo, is it the friend's fault? She did clip her nails in her cubicle. If she's in a private space, maybe it's acceptable. But if the sound is disturbing others, even if she's in her own cubicle, it could be an issue. The coworker reacted strongly, even confronting her and then texting her. The friend's response of \"chill out\" might have been dismissive, which could add to the problem.\n\nOn the other hand, if the friend had a legitimate need to clip her nails and did it in a reasonable way, maybe she's not at fault. But she continued clipping after the coworker had already expressed discomfort. That might show a lack of consideration for the coworker's feelings. Also, the act of clipping multiple nails after being told not to could be seen as provocative or ignoring the other person's feelings.\n\nSo the factors to consider: workplace policies, the sensitivity of others, and the friend's response. If there's no policy against it, maybe it's not the friend's fault entirely, but her actions after the coworker's complaint might have crossed a line. The coworker's reaction is extreme, but the friend's response was also dismissive. It's a bit of a gray area. Maybe the friend did something that some people find gross, but others don't. So, is the friend the asshole? It depends on the context. If the workplace allows for such personal grooming, then maybe not. But if the friend knew or should have known that others found it disturbing and still did it, she might be in the wrong. The answer could be A or B, but I'm leaning towards A because she continued after being told to stop, which shows she didn't respect the coworker's feelings. Hence, she's the asshole.\n"
