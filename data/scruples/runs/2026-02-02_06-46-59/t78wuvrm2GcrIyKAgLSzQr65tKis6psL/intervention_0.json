And there were some conflicting feelings about whether or not she was the asshole.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nYesterday, my friend remarked to a coworker that she had a hanging nail and was glad she had her nail clippers to take care of it. Coworker B was walking by and overheard. Coworker B walked into friend's cubicle and demand she NOT clip her nails at work because that was disgusting. Coworker B then retreats back to her cubicle on the other side of the floor.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy friend then clips her hanging nail in her own cubicle. And then clipped two more to \"even things out\".  She then receives a text message from Coworker B that she could hear her clipping her nails from over 100 feet away. And it was absolutely disgusting. And why would anyone do something so gross in a public place.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy friend responded, \"chill out\".\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo... Is clipping your fingernails at work as asshole thing to do? This is where the debate started last night- is it super gross as coworker B feels, or is it fine?  Is my friend the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is about clipping nails at work. The friend clipped a hanging nail, then did two more to even it out. Coworker B overheard the friend talking about it and then went over to tell her not to do it because it's disgusting. Then the friend clipped more nails, and Coworker B got even more upset.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the social norms around nail clipping. In many workplaces, people might find certain things gross or inappropriate. Clipping nails can create noise and there's also the possible mess of clippings. Some people might think it's okay if done discreetly, but if it's audible and maybe in an open space, others could find it distracting or unpleasant. \n\nThe friend did it in her own cubicle, which is a private space, but the sound still traveled 100 feet. That seems like a long distance, so maybe the workplace layout allows for that. The friend's action was to \"even things out\" after the first clip. Maybe she felt the need to do all three, but expanding beyond the initial need could be seen as unnecessary. \n\nCoworker B's reaction seems strong. She went to confront the friend, then sent a text later. The friend responded with \"chill out,\" which might come off as dismissive. That could escalate the situation. \n\nOn the other hand, everyone has different standards of what's gross. If the friend didn't realize it was a problem, maybe it's not her fault. But since Coworker B made it a point to confront her, the friend should have considered the workplace environment. \n\nIs there a workplace policy on this? The question doesn't mention any, so we can assume it's not explicitly forbidden. However, common courtesy would suggest avoiding actions that might disturb others if possible. Using the clippers in a way that's less noticeable or doing it during a break might be better.\n\nSo, the friend probably isn't the asshole entirely, but maybe she could have been more considerate. Clipping a single nail in an emergency is understandable, but doing three after being told it's disturbing others might cross a line. The response of \"chill out\" isn't helpful either. \n\nIn conclusion, the author (who is the friend's perspective) might be at fault for continuing after the coworker's complaint and not addressing the disturbance caused. So, answer A.\n"
