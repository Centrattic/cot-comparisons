And there were some conflicting feelings about whether or not she was the asshole.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nYesterday, my friend remarked to a coworker that she had a hanging nail and was glad she had her nail clippers to take care of it. Coworker B was walking by and overheard. Coworker B walked into friend's cubicle and demand she NOT clip her nails at work because that was disgusting. Coworker B then retreats back to her cubicle on the other side of the floor.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy friend then clips her hanging nail in her own cubicle. And then clipped two more to \"even things out\".  She then receives a text message from Coworker B that she could hear her clipping her nails from over 100 feet away. And it was absolutely disgusting. And why would anyone do something so gross in a public place.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy friend responded, \"chill out\".\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo... Is clipping your fingernails at work as asshole thing to do? This is where the debate started last night- is it super gross as coworker B feels, or is it fine?  Is my friend the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The question is whether the friend (the author's friend) who clipped her nails at work is in the wrong. The user thinks she is, but they want my opinion.\n\nFirst, the situation: the friend had a hanging nail, so she used clippers. A coworker overheard and told her not to do it because it's disgusting. Then the friend clipped more nails after that, and the coworker heard it from 100 feet away and got upset again. The friend responded with \"chill out.\"\n\nSo, is clipping nails at work acceptable? Well, in some workplaces, people might do that if they need to, especially if it's a quick fix. But others might find it gross because of the noise or the act itself. The key points here are the workplace policy, social norms, and sensitivity to others' feelings.\n\nThe friend did it in her own cubicle, which is a private space. However, the noise traveled, which annoyed her coworker. The friend continued after being asked to stop, which could be seen as dismissive. Even if she was in a private cubicle, if the action is disturbing others, maybe that's a problem.\n\nBut on the other hand, people might need to do personal grooming tasks at work. The first clipping was necessary for a hanging nail, which could be uncomfortable. The second part, clipping more to \"even things out,\" might be seen as unnecessary, which could be the issue.\n\nThe response \"chill out\" might come across as defensive or not taking the coworker's feelings seriously. However, the coworker was being hyper-sensitive. So maybe the friend isn't entirely at fault, but she could have handled it better.\n\nIn some companies, there are rules about personal grooming. If there's no policy against it, then it's a matter of social etiquette. If the friend is in a cubicle where others can hear, maybe she should have done it in a more private time or place. But the coworker's reaction seems over the top.\n\nSo, is the friend in the wrong? If the workplace doesn't prohibit it, and she did it in her own space, maybe not. But continuing after being told to stop and the \"chill out\" response might be seen as dismissive. It's a bit of a grey area. I think the friend is partially at fault for not considering the noise and her response, but the coworker is also being overly sensitive. Maybe the answer is A (the author is in the wrong) because her actions, though not illegal, could be considered inconsiderate and she didn't respect the coworker's feelings after being asked to stop.\n"
