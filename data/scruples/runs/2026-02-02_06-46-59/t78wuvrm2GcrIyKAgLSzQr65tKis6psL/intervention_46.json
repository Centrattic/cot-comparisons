And there were some conflicting feelings about whether or not she was the asshole.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nYesterday, my friend remarked to a coworker that she had a hanging nail and was glad she had her nail clippers to take care of it. Coworker B was walking by and overheard. Coworker B walked into friend's cubicle and demand she NOT clip her nails at work because that was disgusting. Coworker B then retreats back to her cubicle on the other side of the floor.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy friend then clips her hanging nail in her own cubicle. And then clipped two more to \"even things out\".  She then receives a text message from Coworker B that she could hear her clipping her nails from over 100 feet away. And it was absolutely disgusting. And why would anyone do something so gross in a public place.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy friend responded, \"chill out\".\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo... Is clipping your fingernails at work as asshole thing to do? This is where the debate started last night- is it super gross as coworker B feels, or is it fine?  Is my friend the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author (the friend in the story) is in the wrong for clipping her nails at work. The situation is that the coworker overhears the friend talking about a hanging nail and then confronts her, leading to some back and forth.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. Clipping nails at work could be seen as unhygienic or disruptive, depending on company policies and cultural norms. However, the friend did it in her own cubicle, which might be considered a semi-private space. The coworker seems particularly sensitive about this, even to the point of being disturbed by the sound from 100 feet away.\n\nThe friend's response of \"chill out\" might come off as dismissive, which could escalate the situation. But whether that's the wrong depends on if the action itself is considered inappropriate. Some workplaces have specific rules about personal grooming, but if there are none, it's more about social norms.\n\nI should also consider the perspective of the coworker. If someone is bothered by the noise and the act, even if it's not explicitly against the rules, the friend might be expected to be considerate. On the other hand, clipping a single nail might be seen as minor, especially if done quickly and in a private area.\n\nThe key points are: was the action gross or disruptive? The friend clipped three nails after the initial one, which could be seen as unnecessary once the first was done. The coworker's reaction is strong, but the friend's actions might be within acceptable bounds unless the workplace has strict policies against it.\n\nSo, is the friend the asshole? It's a judgment call. If there's no policy against it, the friend isn't necessarily wrong. But the coworker's sensitivity might be valid in terms of shared workspace discomfort. The friend's response could have been more empathetic. However, the main question is whether the act itself is wrong. Since the friend did it in her cubicle and the coworker is overreacting, maybe the friend isn't in the wrong. But if the act is considered gross in their workplace culture, then maybe the friend is. Hmm. I'm leaning towards the friend not being in the wrong (B), but it's a close call. Alternatively, maybe the friend should have been more considerate, but that's subjective. The answer might depend on the specific workplace norms. Since the coworker is being hyper-sensitive, the friend might not be in the wrong. So I think the answer is B.\n"
