And there were some conflicting feelings about whether or not she was the asshole.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nYesterday, my friend remarked to a coworker that she had a hanging nail and was glad she had her nail clippers to take care of it. Coworker B was walking by and overheard. Coworker B walked into friend's cubicle and demand she NOT clip her nails at work because that was disgusting. Coworker B then retreats back to her cubicle on the other side of the floor.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy friend then clips her hanging nail in her own cubicle. And then clipped two more to \"even things out\".  She then receives a text message from Coworker B that she could hear her clipping her nails from over 100 feet away. And it was absolutely disgusting. And why would anyone do something so gross in a public place.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy friend responded, \"chill out\".\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo... Is clipping your fingernails at work as asshole thing to do? This is where the debate started last night- is it super gross as coworker B feels, or is it fine?  Is my friend the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author (my friend) is in the wrong for clipping her nails at work. The scenario is from an AITA (Am I the Asshole) story.\n\nFirst, the friend mentioned a hanging nail and used clippers. Coworker B overheard, then confronted her, demanding she not do that because it's disgusting. The friend then clipped three nails in her cubicle and got another text from coworker B complaining about the noise from 100 feet away. The friend replied \"chill out.\"\n\nI need to determine if the friend is in the wrong. Let's consider workplace norms. Clipping nails at work might be seen as unhygienic or disruptive. Some people might find the sound annoying, especially if it's loud or done frequently. The friend did it in her cubicle, which is a semi-private space, but the sound still carried. \n\nHowever, coworker B's reaction seems overly aggressive. Confronting someone in person and then sending a follow-up text to complain about the noise might be overstepping. The friend's response of \"chill out\" could be seen as dismissive, but maybe she felt justified given the initial demand.\n\nWorkplace etiquette often depends on company policies. If there's no rule against it, the friend might not be in the wrong. But if the action is disruptive, even in a cubicle, it could be problematic. The key points are whether the action is disruptive and how the parties handled the conflict.\n\nIn some workplaces, nail clipping is considered inappropriate because of hygiene and noise. However, if it's a one-time thing and in a private area, maybe it's acceptable. The fact that coworker B was so adamant might indicate a sensitive environment. But the friend's response could have been more diplomatic instead of \"chill out,\" which might come off as rude.\n\nSo, is the friend the asshole? It's a bit of a toss-up. If the company allows it and the friend didn't make a big show of it, maybe not. But if the coworker has valid concerns about noise and hygiene, the friend could be at fault for not considering others. However, coworker B's aggressive reaction might also be at issue here. The friend's act of clipping three nails after being told might be seen as defiance, which could tip the scales. But maybe the friend felt justified in maintaining her hygiene.\n\nConsidering all factors, I think the friend is partially at fault for causing disruption, but coworker B's reaction is also excessive. The question is whether the friend is the asshole. Since the friend continued after being asked, and the act itself is considered by some as gross, the answer might lean towards yes. But if the workplace doesn't have a policy against it, maybe not. Hmm. I'm a bit torn, but leaning towards yes because of the disruption and the response after being asked to stop.\n"
