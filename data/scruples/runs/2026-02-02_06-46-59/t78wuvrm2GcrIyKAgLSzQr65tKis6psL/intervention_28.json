And there were some conflicting feelings about whether or not she was the asshole.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nYesterday, my friend remarked to a coworker that she had a hanging nail and was glad she had her nail clippers to take care of it. Coworker B was walking by and overheard. Coworker B walked into friend's cubicle and demand she NOT clip her nails at work because that was disgusting. Coworker B then retreats back to her cubicle on the other side of the floor.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy friend then clips her hanging nail in her own cubicle. And then clipped two more to \"even things out\".  She then receives a text message from Coworker B that she could hear her clipping her nails from over 100 feet away. And it was absolutely disgusting. And why would anyone do something so gross in a public place.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy friend responded, \"chill out\".\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo... Is clipping your fingernails at work as asshole thing to do? This is where the debate started last night- is it super gross as coworker B feels, or is it fine?  Is my friend the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author (the friend in the story) is in the wrong for clipping their nails at work. The situation involves a coworker getting upset about it and then the author continuing to clip more nails after being told to stop. \n\nFirst, I need to consider workplace etiquette. Clipping nails at work isn't unheard of, but there might be unspoken rules about privacy and cleanliness. The coworker B overheard the friend talking about a hanging nail, then approached to tell her not to do it, perhaps because it's considered unsanitary or disruptive.\n\nThe friend clipped her nail in her cubicle, then clipped two more to \"even things out.\" That part is interesting. Maybe she felt defensive or wanted to make a point, which could come off as dismissive. Then, after Coworker B texts her again, the friend responds with \"chill out,\" which might be seen as rude or not taking the other person's feelings seriously.\n\nSo, the key points are: Was the friend's action unprofessional? Did she overstep by continuing after being asked? Did her response exacerbate the situation? \n\nOn the other hand, maybe Coworker B is overreacting. Clipping nails is a personal hygiene thing, and if done in a private space like a cubicle, it's reasonable. But the noise might be an issue in an open office setting. The friend's response of \"chill out\" could be seen as not respecting Coworker B's feelings.\n\nIn most workplaces, there's an expectation to be considerate. If the act of clipping nails is causing disturbance or creating a mess, then it's a problem. The friend might have done it in her own cubicle, but the noise traveled, which Coworker B found disturbing. The fact that Coworker B heard from 100 feet away suggests it's a noisy environment, so the friend's actions might be disruptive. \n\nAlso, the friend clipped an extra two nails after being told not to. That seems like a deliberate action to go against Coworker B's request, which could be seen as rude. The response \"chill out\" isn't very diplomatic and might have made things worse.\n\nSo, considering all that, the friend might be in the wrong because she continued the action after being asked to stop, and her response was dismissive. Even if clipping nails isn't inherently wrong, the way she handled the situation\u2014by continuing and responding poorly\u2014could make her the asshole here.\n"
