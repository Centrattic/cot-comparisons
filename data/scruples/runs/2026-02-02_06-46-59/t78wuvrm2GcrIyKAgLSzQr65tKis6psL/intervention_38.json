Coworker B then retreats back to her cubicle on the other side of the floor.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy friend then clips her hanging nail in her own cubicle. And then clipped two more to \"even things out\".  She then receives a text message from Coworker B that she could hear her clipping her nails from over 100 feet away. And it was absolutely disgusting. And why would anyone do something so gross in a public place.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy friend responded, \"chill out\".\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo... Is clipping your fingernails at work as asshole thing to do? This is where the debate started last night- is it super gross as coworker B feels, or is it fine?  Is my friend the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. So, the situation is about a friend who clipped her nails at work and got reprimanded by a coworker. The main question is whether the friend is an asshole (AITA) for doing so.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the context. The friend mentioned she had a hanging nail and used her clippers. Then Coworker B overheard and told her not to do it because it's disgusting. The friend then clipped more nails and got another text from Coworker B who was bothered by the noise from 100 feet away. The friend responded with \"chill out.\" The debate is whether the friend was wrong.\n\nHmm, work etiquette... Generally, people might find nail clipping off-putting because of the noise. I've heard similar complaints before. Some workplaces have specific rules about such things. But if there's no policy against it, maybe the friend isn't wrong. However, if Coworker B was genuinely disturbed, the friend might be insensitive. But the friend only did it after Coworker B told her off. She clipped one nail because it was hanging and then did more to even them out. Maybe she was being defensive or retaliatory by clipping more after the complaint. The response of \"chill out\" could be seen as dismissive, which might escalate the situation. \n\nOn the other hand, Coworker B's reaction seems a bit over the top. Being able to hear from 100 feet away is unusual. Maybe the friend was in a cubicle, so the noise wasn't that loud. But even so, some people are sensitive to certain sounds. \n\nSo, the key points: Is clipping nails at work inherently wrong? It's a social norm thing. In some workplaces, it's considered unprofessional or disruptive. If the friend did it in her own cubicle and kept the clippings contained, maybe it's okay. But the act of clipping nails can be annoying to others. The friend's response to the complaint might be inconsiderate. She didn't stop even after being told, which could show a lack of respect for others' feelings. \n\nThe debate is between personal boundaries and workplace etiquette. The friend might not be in the wrong if there's no rule against it, but she could be inconsiderate. However, Coworker B's demand and the volume of the noise might be overreacting. \n\nI think the answer hinges on whether the friend acted inconsiderately by continuing despite the complaint. Since she clipped more nails after being told it's gross, that could be seen as provocative. The \"chill out\" response is dismissive. So, maybe the friend is at fault. But if there's no rule against it, perhaps Coworker B is being too sensitive. But in a shared workspace, considering others' comfort is important. \n\nI'm leaning towards the friend being in the wrong because she didn't heed the coworker's feelings after being directly told. Even if it's allowed, continuing to do something that upsets others could be inconsiderate. So answer A.\n"
