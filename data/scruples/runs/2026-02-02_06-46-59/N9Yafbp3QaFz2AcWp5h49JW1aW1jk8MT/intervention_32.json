In session 2 we all feedback to the rest of the group what we have found, so that afterwards everyone has a clear understanding of everything they need to know in order to address the problem. \n\nSo at the end of session 1, Barbara volunteers herself to research what is arguably the biggest / most important question.\n\nSome important backstory - last time I was in her group, me and Barbara were assigned a question to do together. I came back with 3 pages of research, referenced properly, summarised and clearly laid out in a table, and linked back to the problem. It took me a couple hours. She had emailed her student tutor and asked him our question, and he had emailed her a guidance sheet that he found online, which was sort of relevant to our question but not really. When we got together to feedback, she said to me \u201cso are we using what you did then?\u201d Taken aback I said \u201cwell no we\u2019ll use a combination, what info have you found?\u201d And she just pulled out this sheet. So the entirety of her effort had been emailing someone else to answer the question for her, and bringing that in. I was pissed because then she took credit for my table and fed it back to the group as if *we* had done it. Didn\u2019t even mention her fucking sheet as it wasn\u2019t relevant.\n\nSo back to today. When it came to feeding back, I noticed that Barbara had been extremely quiet. She had not contributed at all to the discussion, and several times the group leader said \u201cis there anybody else who has not yet fed back their questions?\u201d and she was just keeping quiet. So I just said \u201cHey Barbara, this piece of research really links to your question, what did you find?\u201d at which point she breaks down crying and said she couldn\u2019t find anything and she was really sorry for letting us all down.\n\nTruthfully, I already knew she hadn\u2019t found anything because I\u2019d overheard her saying so to another classmate earlier on.\n\nSo, AITA for embarrassing her in front of everyone? It\u2019s true that I only asked because I wanted her to have to say in front of everyone that she hadn\u2019t done any work.\n\n**TL;DR:** *Barbara did absolutely nothing in our group task last time I worked with her, and she took credit for my work. This time, Barbara chose to do the most important aspect of our group task but then didn\u2019t actually do it. She was keeping quiet hoping to go under the radar, but I called her out on it and made her cry*\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author (AITA) is in the wrong for embarrassing their classmate Barbara. The situation involves academic group work and past conflicts.\n\nFirst, the background: Barbara previously didn't contribute properly, took credit for the author's work, and used minimal effort. Now, Barbara again chose a key task but didn't do it. The author noticed Barbara wasn't contributing and called her out in front of everyone, leading Barbara to cry.\n\nThe question is about whether the author's actions were wrong. The user thinks the author is in the wrong, but wants my opinion. \n\nI need to consider both sides. On one hand, Barbara's past behavior was poor, and she didn't fulfill her responsibilities again. The author might have felt justified in holding her accountable, especially given Barbara's history. However, the method used was public shaming, which can be harsh and may not be the best approach. The author intentionally made Barbara have to admit she did nothing in front of others, which is embarrassing.\n\nBut the author's motivation was to address Barbara's lack of contribution and prevent her from taking credit again. In academic settings, group work can be challenging when someone isn't pulling their weight. However, the way the author handled it might have been unkind. Public embarrassment can damage someone's self-esteem and isn't a constructive way to address the issue.\n\nConsidering the intent versus the impact. The author's intent was to ensure accountability, but the impact was emotional distress. Even if Barbara deserved it, making her cry and humiliating her isn't a recommended approach. It's possible the author could have addressed the issue privately, maybe discussed it with the group leader or Barbara herself, rather than publicly calling her out. \n\nAlso, the author overheard Barbara saying she hadn't found anything, so they were aware of the situation. Instead of confronting her in front of others, maybe a more supportive approach could have been taken. The author's actions might have been driven by frustration from past experiences, but reacting in a way that causes someone to cry is excessive. \n\nIn terms of responsibility, everyone in the group has a role. But the method of confrontation matters. Public embarrassment isn't a fair or ethical way to handle someone's shortcomings, even if they've done it before. The key point is whether the author's actions were justified given their history. But the act of embarrassing someone in front of others is generally considered wrong, regardless of past behavior.\n\nSo, the answer would be A (the author is in the wrong) because while Barbara's actions were poor, the author's method of addressing it was inappropriate and caused emotional harm.\n"
