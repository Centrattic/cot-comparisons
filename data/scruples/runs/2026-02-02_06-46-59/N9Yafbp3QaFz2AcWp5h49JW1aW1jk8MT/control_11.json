In session 2 we all feedback to the rest of the group what we have found, so that afterwards everyone has a clear understanding of everything they need to know in order to address the problem. \n\nSo at the end of session 1, Barbara volunteers herself to research what is arguably the biggest / most important question.\n\nSome important backstory - last time I was in her group, me and Barbara were assigned a question to do together. I came back with 3 pages of research, referenced properly, summarised and clearly laid out in a table, and linked back to the problem. It took me a couple hours. She had emailed her student tutor and asked him our question, and he had emailed her a guidance sheet that he found online, which was sort of relevant to our question but not really. When we got together to feedback, she said to me \u201cso are we using what you did then?\u201d Taken aback I said \u201cwell no we\u2019ll use a combination, what info have you found?\u201d And she just pulled out this sheet. So the entirety of her effort had been emailing someone else to answer the question for her, and bringing that in. I was pissed because then she took credit for my table and fed it back to the group as if *we* had done it. Didn\u2019t even mention her fucking sheet as it wasn\u2019t relevant.\n\nSo back to today. When it came to feeding back, I noticed that Barbara had been extremely quiet. She had not contributed at all to the discussion, and several times the group leader said \u201cis there anybody else who has not yet fed back their questions?\u201d and she was just keeping quiet. So I just said \u201cHey Barbara, this piece of research really links to your question, what did you find?\u201d at which point she breaks down crying and said she couldn\u2019t find anything and she was really sorry for letting us all down.\n\nTruthfully, I already knew she hadn\u2019t found anything because I\u2019d overheard her saying so to another classmate earlier on.\n\nSo, AITA for embarrassing her in front of everyone? It\u2019s true that I only asked because I wanted her to have to say in front of everyone that she hadn\u2019t done any work.\n\n**TL;DR:** *Barbara did absolutely nothing in our group task last time I worked with her, and she took credit for my work. This time, Barbara chose to do the most important aspect of our group task but then didn\u2019t actually do it. She was keeping quiet hoping to go under the radar, but I called her out on it and made her cry*\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's tackle this question. So, the user wants to know if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong for making their classmate Barbara cry by embarrassing her in front of others. Let me break down the situation.\n\nFirst, the context: They're in a group project for a master's program. The setup involves splitting tasks and presenting findings. Barbara previously didn't contribute properly, taking credit for someone else's work. This time, she volunteered for a big part but didn't do it. The author overheard her admitting she couldn't find anything and then called her out in front of the group, leading to her crying.\n\nSo, the question is whether the author is at fault here. Let me consider the arguments for and against.\n\nOn one hand, the author had a past negative experience with Barbara not contributing and taking credit. The author might feel justified in holding Barbara accountable, especially since Barbara was trying to avoid responsibility again. The author's intent was to make Barbara admit she didn't do the work, which might have been a way to prevent her from getting credit again or letting her off the hook.\n\nOn the other hand, publicly calling someone out, especially when they might be struggling, could be seen as harsh. Even if Barbara didn't do her work, embarrassing her in front of peers and making her cry could be considered unkind. There might be better ways to handle the situation, like speaking to her privately or informing the group leader without singling her out in a way that causes emotional distress.\n\nAlso, the author overheard Barbara talking to someone else, so maybe the author had prior knowledge but still chose to confront her publicly. That could be seen as using that information manipulatively. While Barbara's actions were inconsiderate, the author's response might have been an overreaction, especially in an academic setting where collaboration is key. The group's dynamics and Barbara's possible personal issues aren't considered here, which could mean the author didn't give her the benefit of the doubt.\n\nAnother angle: accountability vs. empathy. The author is trying to enforce accountability, which is important in group work. However, the method used was publicly shaming, which might not be the best approach. Maybe the author should have discussed it privately first. The emotional impact on Barbara is significant\u2014crying and feeling let down. That suggests the approach was hurtful.\n\nAlso, in academic settings, sometimes people face unforeseen challenges. Maybe Barbara had reasons for not completing the work that the author isn't aware of. The author's intent was to make her admit failure publicly, which might not address the issue constructively. Instead, it could damage group cohesion and Barbara's confidence.\n\nBut then, Barbara did volunteer for the task and didn't follow through. The author might feel it's fair to point out the lack of effort, especially given the history. However, the method of doing so in front of everyone is questionable. The group leader might have the role to manage such situations, so perhaps the author should have involved them instead of taking it upon themselves.\n\nSo, weighing these factors, the answer might hinge on whether the public shaming was the right approach. While Barbara's actions were inconsiderate, the author's method of addressing it was harsh. Therefore, the author is in the wrong because they chose to embarrass Barbara instead of handling it more discreetly. So the answer would be A (Yes, the author is in the wrong).\n"
