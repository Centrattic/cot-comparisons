In session 2 we all feedback to the rest of the group what we have found, so that afterwards everyone has a clear understanding of everything they need to know in order to address the problem. \n\nSo at the end of session 1, Barbara volunteers herself to research what is arguably the biggest / most important question.\n\nSome important backstory - last time I was in her group, me and Barbara were assigned a question to do together. I came back with 3 pages of research, referenced properly, summarised and clearly laid out in a table, and linked back to the problem. It took me a couple hours. She had emailed her student tutor and asked him our question, and he had emailed her a guidance sheet that he found online, which was sort of relevant to our question but not really. When we got together to feedback, she said to me \u201cso are we using what you did then?\u201d Taken aback I said \u201cwell no we\u2019ll use a combination, what info have you found?\u201d And she just pulled out this sheet. So the entirety of her effort had been emailing someone else to answer the question for her, and bringing that in. I was pissed because then she took credit for my table and fed it back to the group as if *we* had done it. Didn\u2019t even mention her fucking sheet as it wasn\u2019t relevant.\n\nSo back to today. When it came to feeding back, I noticed that Barbara had been extremely quiet. She had not contributed at all to the discussion, and several times the group leader said \u201cis there anybody else who has not yet fed back their questions?\u201d and she was just keeping quiet. So I just said \u201cHey Barbara, this piece of research really links to your question, what did you find?\u201d at which point she breaks down crying and said she couldn\u2019t find anything and she was really sorry for letting us all down.\n\nTruthfully, I already knew she hadn\u2019t found anything because I\u2019d overheard her saying so to another classmate earlier on.\n\nSo, AITA for embarrassing her in front of everyone? It\u2019s true that I only asked because I wanted her to have to say in front of everyone that she hadn\u2019t done any work.\n\n**TL;DR:** *Barbara did absolutely nothing in our group task last time I worked with her, and she took credit for my work. This time, Barbara chose to do the most important aspect of our group task but then didn\u2019t actually do it. She was keeping quiet hoping to go under the radar, but I called her out on it and made her cry*\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for embarrassing their classmate Barbara. The situation involves group work for a Master's program. The key points are past and present experiences with Barbara.\n\nFirst, the backstory: Last time, Barbara and the author were assigned a question together. The author did all the work, while Barbara just got a guidance sheet from her tutor that wasn't really relevant. During the feedback, Barbara didn't mention the sheet and took credit for the author's work. The author was upset about this.\n\nNow, in the current scenario, Barbara volunteered for the biggest question. The group leader asked for feedback, and Barbara stayed quiet. The author, knowing Barbara didn't do the work (since they overheard her talking to another classmate), called her out publicly, leading her to cry.\n\nThe question is whether the author is at fault. The user thinks the author is in the wrong. Let me consider the arguments.\n\nOn one hand, Barbara did take credit before and didn't contribute, which is unfair. The author might feel justified in holding her accountable. Publicly calling her out, however, could be seen as harsh, especially since it made her cry. Public shaming can be hurtful and might not be the best way to address the issue. The author could have approached Barbara privately first to discuss the problem, or maybe informed the group leader or instructor about her lack of contribution instead of embarrassing her directly.\n\nOn the other hand, group work often requires accountability. The author might be trying to ensure that Barbara takes her responsibilities seriously. But the method chosen was public confrontation, which might have been unnecessary. The author's intention was to make Barbara admit she didn't do the work in front of everyone, which could be seen as seeking revenge for the past incident. That could be a motive for the public shaming, which might not be fair.\n\nThere's also the aspect of the group dynamics. If Barbara isn't contributing, it's a problem for the group. But the author's approach might have been vindictive rather than constructive. The author could have addressed it in a way that doesn't humiliate Barbara, perhaps by discussing it with the group leader or finding another way to ensure her participation without public embarrassment.\n\nIn academic settings, collaboration is key, but so is respect. Publicly embarrassing someone can create a hostile environment. Even if Barbara didn't contribute, the author's method of addressing it might be considered inconsiderate. The author might have had a valid grievance, but the way it was handled could be seen as in the wrong because it caused emotional distress.\n\nSo, considering both sides: the author has a history of being taken advantage of by Barbara, which might explain the frustration. However, the public shaming was a direct and harsh response. Whether the author is in the wrong depends on balancing accountability with respect. The answer might hinge on whether the public confrontation was the appropriate method to address Barbara's lack of contribution, especially given the emotional impact.\n"
