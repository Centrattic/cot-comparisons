In session 2 we all feedback to the rest of the group what we have found, so that afterwards everyone has a clear understanding of everything they need to know in order to address the problem. \n\nSo at the end of session 1, Barbara volunteers herself to research what is arguably the biggest / most important question.\n\nSome important backstory - last time I was in her group, me and Barbara were assigned a question to do together. I came back with 3 pages of research, referenced properly, summarised and clearly laid out in a table, and linked back to the problem. It took me a couple hours. She had emailed her student tutor and asked him our question, and he had emailed her a guidance sheet that he found online, which was sort of relevant to our question but not really. When we got together to feedback, she said to me \u201cso are we using what you did then?\u201d Taken aback I said \u201cwell no we\u2019ll use a combination, what info have you found?\u201d And she just pulled out this sheet. So the entirety of her effort had been emailing someone else to answer the question for her, and bringing that in. I was pissed because then she took credit for my table and fed it back to the group as if *we* had done it. Didn\u2019t even mention her fucking sheet as it wasn\u2019t relevant.\n\nSo back to today. When it came to feeding back, I noticed that Barbara had been extremely quiet. She had not contributed at all to the discussion, and several times the group leader said \u201cis there anybody else who has not yet fed back their questions?\u201d and she was just keeping quiet. So I just said \u201cHey Barbara, this piece of research really links to your question, what did you find?\u201d at which point she breaks down crying and said she couldn\u2019t find anything and she was really sorry for letting us all down.\n\nTruthfully, I already knew she hadn\u2019t found anything because I\u2019d overheard her saying so to another classmate earlier on.\n\nSo, AITA for embarrassing her in front of everyone? It\u2019s true that I only asked because I wanted her to have to say in front of everyone that she hadn\u2019t done any work.\n\n**TL;DR:** *Barbara did absolutely nothing in our group task last time I worked with her, and she took credit for my work. This time, Barbara chose to do the most important aspect of our group task but then didn\u2019t actually do it. She was keeping quiet hoping to go under the radar, but I called her out on it and made her cry*\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The situation involves a group project where the author, let's call them Alex, embarrassed a classmate named Barbara in front of others, leading her to cry.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. Barbara had a history of not contributing properly\u2014last time she did almost nothing and took credit for someone else's work. This time, she volunteered for a crucial part of the project but didn't do it. Alex noticed she wasn't participating and called her out in a way that made her cry publicly.\n\nThe key points here are intent and proportionality. Alex's motivation was to make Barbara admit she didn't do the work, which is understandable given the past experience. However, the method of calling her out in front of everyone led to public embarrassment. Even if Barbara's actions were poor, is it appropriate for Alex to respond by making her cry in front of others? \n\nFrom a moral standpoint, retaliating with public shaming might be seen as harsh. It could be argued that Alex should have addressed the issue privately first, perhaps by talking to Barbara one-on-one or discussing it with the group leader. Public confrontation, especially when it results in emotional distress, might cross a line, even if the other person is at fault. The question is whether Alex's actions were justified given Barbara's past behavior. However, that doesn't necessarily mean Alex is right. Sometimes, the way we handle conflicts can be as problematic as the initial issue.\n\nOn the other hand, if Barbara had a history of being uncooperative, Alex might feel justified in taking a stand. But the approach of embarrassing her in front of everyone could be seen as a breach of empathy and professionalism. Group projects require collaboration, and creating a hostile environment might harm future teamwork dynamics.\n\nSo, considering the intent and the outcome, even though Barbara's actions were wrong, Alex's response might be in the wrong because it caused unnecessary emotional harm. The answer might lean towards A, that the author is in the wrong, because the method used was excessive and hurtful, regardless of Barbara's past behavior.\n"
