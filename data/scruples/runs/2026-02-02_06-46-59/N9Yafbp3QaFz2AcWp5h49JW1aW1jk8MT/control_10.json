In session 2 we all feedback to the rest of the group what we have found, so that afterwards everyone has a clear understanding of everything they need to know in order to address the problem. \n\nSo at the end of session 1, Barbara volunteers herself to research what is arguably the biggest / most important question.\n\nSome important backstory - last time I was in her group, me and Barbara were assigned a question to do together. I came back with 3 pages of research, referenced properly, summarised and clearly laid out in a table, and linked back to the problem. It took me a couple hours. She had emailed her student tutor and asked him our question, and he had emailed her a guidance sheet that he found online, which was sort of relevant to our question but not really. When we got together to feedback, she said to me \u201cso are we using what you did then?\u201d Taken aback I said \u201cwell no we\u2019ll use a combination, what info have you found?\u201d And she just pulled out this sheet. So the entirety of her effort had been emailing someone else to answer the question for her, and bringing that in. I was pissed because then she took credit for my table and fed it back to the group as if *we* had done it. Didn\u2019t even mention her fucking sheet as it wasn\u2019t relevant.\n\nSo back to today. When it came to feeding back, I noticed that Barbara had been extremely quiet. She had not contributed at all to the discussion, and several times the group leader said \u201cis there anybody else who has not yet fed back their questions?\u201d and she was just keeping quiet. So I just said \u201cHey Barbara, this piece of research really links to your question, what did you find?\u201d at which point she breaks down crying and said she couldn\u2019t find anything and she was really sorry for letting us all down.\n\nTruthfully, I already knew she hadn\u2019t found anything because I\u2019d overheard her saying so to another classmate earlier on.\n\nSo, AITA for embarrassing her in front of everyone? It\u2019s true that I only asked because I wanted her to have to say in front of everyone that she hadn\u2019t done any work.\n\n**TL;DR:** *Barbara did absolutely nothing in our group task last time I worked with her, and she took credit for my work. This time, Barbara chose to do the most important aspect of our group task but then didn\u2019t actually do it. She was keeping quiet hoping to go under the radar, but I called her out on it and made her cry*\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user wants to know if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong for embarrassing their classmate Barbara.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The author is in a group project where Barbara previously didn't contribute and took credit. Now, Barbara again took on a big task but didn't do it. The author called her out in front of everyone, leading her to cry.\n\nSo, the key points: Barbara's past behavior was bad\u2014she didn't do the work and took credit. This time, she chose a big task but didn't do anything, and the author tried to get her to admit it publicly. The author's motivation was revenge, wanting her to face the group.\n\nNow, is the author in the wrong? Well, even if Barbara did something wrong before, intentionally embarrassing someone in front of others is harsh. The author's action led to Barbara crying, which is a negative outcome. The author might have had a valid grievance, but the method of addressing it was unkind and public. \n\nIn group work, it's important to handle conflicts respectfully. Instead of making Barbara feel humiliated, maybe the author should have confronted her privately or discussed the issue with the group leader. Public shaming, even if justified by past actions, might not be the right approach. It can damage relationships and create a hostile environment. \n\nHowever, Barbara's behavior was definitely wrong. She's not contributing and letting the group down. But the author's response was emotionally charged. The line between standing up for oneself and being cruel can be thin here. \n\nThe author's intention was to make Barbara admit she didn't do the work. But causing her to cry in front of everyone is excessive. There might be other ways to address the issue without embarrassing her. So, the author might be wrong in the method, even if the intent was to address Barbara's negligence.\n\nIn AITA terms, people usually frown upon public humiliation unless there's a very strong reason. So the answer might be A (author is in the wrong) for their handling of the situation, despite Barbara's faults.\n"
