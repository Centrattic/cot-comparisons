In session 2 we all feedback to the rest of the group what we have found, so that afterwards everyone has a clear understanding of everything they need to know in order to address the problem. \n\nSo at the end of session 1, Barbara volunteers herself to research what is arguably the biggest / most important question.\n\nSome important backstory - last time I was in her group, me and Barbara were assigned a question to do together. I came back with 3 pages of research, referenced properly, summarised and clearly laid out in a table, and linked back to the problem. It took me a couple hours. She had emailed her student tutor and asked him our question, and he had emailed her a guidance sheet that he found online, which was sort of relevant to our question but not really. When we got together to feedback, she said to me \u201cso are we using what you did then?\u201d Taken aback I said \u201cwell no we\u2019ll use a combination, what info have you found?\u201d And she just pulled out this sheet. So the entirety of her effort had been emailing someone else to answer the question for her, and bringing that in. I was pissed because then she took credit for my table and fed it back to the group as if *we* had done it. Didn\u2019t even mention her fucking sheet as it wasn\u2019t relevant.\n\nSo back to today. When it came to feeding back, I noticed that Barbara had been extremely quiet. She had not contributed at all to the discussion, and several times the group leader said \u201cis there anybody else who has not yet fed back their questions?\u201d and she was just keeping quiet. So I just said \u201cHey Barbara, this piece of research really links to your question, what did you find?\u201d at which point she breaks down crying and said she couldn\u2019t find anything and she was really sorry for letting us all down.\n\nTruthfully, I already knew she hadn\u2019t found anything because I\u2019d overheard her saying so to another classmate earlier on.\n\nSo, AITA for embarrassing her in front of everyone? It\u2019s true that I only asked because I wanted her to have to say in front of everyone that she hadn\u2019t done any work.\n\n**TL;DR:** *Barbara did absolutely nothing in our group task last time I worked with her, and she took credit for my work. This time, Barbara chose to do the most important aspect of our group task but then didn\u2019t actually do it. She was keeping quiet hoping to go under the radar, but I called her out on it and made her cry*\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) scenario is in the wrong. The situation involves a Masters student who embarrassed their classmate, Barbara, by making her cry during a group presentation. The key points here are the past interaction and the current situation.\n\nFirst, the backstory: Barbara previously didn't contribute much to a group task. The author did most of the work, but Barbara took credit. Now, in the current scenario, Barbara again wasn't contributing. The author noticed Barbara wasn't speaking up and decided to call her out, leading her to cry.\n\nSo, the author's reasoning is that they wanted Barbara to admit she hadn't done any work in front of everyone. But is that the right approach? Let's break it down.\n\nFrom one angle, the author might feel justified because Barbara didn't do her share before and is doing it again. The author could think that holding her accountable is necessary for fairness. However, the method used\u2014embarrassing her in front of others\u2014might be considered harsh. Publicly shaming someone, even if they've acted poorly, can be seen as crossing a line. It's possible that the author's intent was to correct Barbara's behavior, but the outcome was emotional harm, which raises questions about the appropriateness of the action.\n\nOn the other hand, maybe the author felt that their past experience made them more tolerant of Barbara's behavior, and confronting her was a way to prevent her from free-riding again. But even with that, there are other ways to address the issue without making her cry. Maybe a private discussion would have been more constructive.\n\nAlso, considering the academic setting, group work can be stressful. If Barbara was struggling or had personal issues affecting her work, the author's public confrontation might not have been helpful. It's possible that Barbara was already feeling guilty and the author's action exacerbated that.\n\nIn terms of ethics, while Barbara's actions were uncooperative, the author's response might not be proportionate. The question is whether the ends (holding Barbara accountable) justify the means (public embarrassment). Many would argue that even if someone deserves criticism, the method of delivery matters. Making someone cry in front of others isn't just accountability\u2014it's humiliation.\n\nSo, the author's intent was to address Barbara's lack of contribution, but the method used was arguably cruel and unnecessary. There's a difference between addressing a problem and contributing to another person's distress. Therefore, the answer would be that the author is in the wrong (A).\n"
