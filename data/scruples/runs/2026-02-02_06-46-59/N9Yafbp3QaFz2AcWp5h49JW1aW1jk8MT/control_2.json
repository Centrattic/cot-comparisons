In session 2 we all feedback to the rest of the group what we have found, so that afterwards everyone has a clear understanding of everything they need to know in order to address the problem. \n\nSo at the end of session 1, Barbara volunteers herself to research what is arguably the biggest / most important question.\n\nSome important backstory - last time I was in her group, me and Barbara were assigned a question to do together. I came back with 3 pages of research, referenced properly, summarised and clearly laid out in a table, and linked back to the problem. It took me a couple hours. She had emailed her student tutor and asked him our question, and he had emailed her a guidance sheet that he found online, which was sort of relevant to our question but not really. When we got together to feedback, she said to me \u201cso are we using what you did then?\u201d Taken aback I said \u201cwell no we\u2019ll use a combination, what info have you found?\u201d And she just pulled out this sheet. So the entirety of her effort had been emailing someone else to answer the question for her, and bringing that in. I was pissed because then she took credit for my table and fed it back to the group as if *we* had done it. Didn\u2019t even mention her fucking sheet as it wasn\u2019t relevant.\n\nSo back to today. When it came to feeding back, I noticed that Barbara had been extremely quiet. She had not contributed at all to the discussion, and several times the group leader said \u201cis there anybody else who has not yet fed back their questions?\u201d and she was just keeping quiet. So I just said \u201cHey Barbara, this piece of research really links to your question, what did you find?\u201d at which point she breaks down crying and said she couldn\u2019t find anything and she was really sorry for letting us all down.\n\nTruthfully, I already knew she hadn\u2019t found anything because I\u2019d overheard her saying so to another classmate earlier on.\n\nSo, AITA for embarrassing her in front of everyone? It\u2019s true that I only asked because I wanted her to have to say in front of everyone that she hadn\u2019t done any work.\n\n**TL;DR:** *Barbara did absolutely nothing in our group task last time I worked with her, and she took credit for my work. This time, Barbara chose to do the most important aspect of our group task but then didn\u2019t actually do it. She was keeping quiet hoping to go under the radar, but I called her out on it and made her cry*\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the person who wrote the \"AITA\" post is in the wrong. The situation is about a classmate, Barbara, who in the past didn't do her work and took credit for someone else's. Now, Barbara signed up for the most important part of a group task but didn't do it, and the author called her out, making her cry.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The author's perspective is that Barbara has a history of not contributing and taking credit. They felt justified in calling her out because she was trying to avoid accountability. On the other hand, embarrassing someone in front of others can be hurtful, even if the person is at fault. The question is whether the author's actions were justified.\n\nThe task mentions that the author overheard Barbara not doing the work. So they knew Barbara hadn't contributed but still decided to confront her publicly. The motivation here is important. The author says they wanted her to admit in front of everyone she didn't do the work. That might be seen as harsh, especially leading to her crying.\n\nIn academic settings, group work is collaborative, and holding peers accountable is important. However, the method of accountability matters. Public shaming can damage relationships and create a hostile environment. The author's past with Barbara is a factor\u2014they had a bad experience before. But even so, is public confrontation the right way to handle it?\n\nPossible arguments for the author not being in the wrong: Barbara's past behavior justifies the need for accountability, the author was ensuring the group's work wasn't let down, and it's a learning environment where consequences should be faced. \n\nCounterarguments: The approach taken was overly harsh, causing emotional distress. The author could have addressed it privately, maybe offering help or reporting to the instructor. Public embarrassment might be considered a disproportionate response, even if Barbara was slacking.\n\nAlso, the group's dynamics matter. If the leader didn't address Barbara's silence, the author might have felt responsible. However, the author's method could have been more constructive. \n\nI think the key here is whether the author's intent was to help the group or to retaliate for Barbara's past actions. The mention of wanting her to admit she didn't do the work in front of everyone suggests a punitive motive, which might be problematic. However, the situation is complex because Barbara had a history of not contributing.\n\nSo, considering all that, the answer might be that the author is in the wrong (A) because the public shaming was unnecessary and could have been handled more sensitively. However, some might argue the author was right to hold Barbara accountable. But since the question is whether the author is in the wrong, and the action led to emotional harm, the answer might lean towards A. But I'm a bit conflicted. Maybe the answer is A, but I'm not entirely sure. Let me check again.\n\nThe user's question is whether the author is in the wrong. If the author's actions were a justified response to Barbara's past and present inaction, then B. But if the method was too harsh and caused unnecessary harm, then A. The fact that the author already knew Barbara hadn't done the work and called her out publicly, leading to her crying, suggests that the author might be in the wrong because there could have been a better way to handle it without public embarrassment. So answer A.\n"
