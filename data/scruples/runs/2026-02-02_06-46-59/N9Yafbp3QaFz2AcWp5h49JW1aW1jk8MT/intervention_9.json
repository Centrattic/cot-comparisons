In session 2 we all feedback to the rest of the group what we have found, so that afterwards everyone has a clear understanding of everything they need to know in order to address the problem. \n\nSo at the end of session 1, Barbara volunteers herself to research what is arguably the biggest / most important question.\n\nSome important backstory - last time I was in her group, me and Barbara were assigned a question to do together. I came back with 3 pages of research, referenced properly, summarised and clearly laid out in a table, and linked back to the problem. It took me a couple hours. She had emailed her student tutor and asked him our question, and he had emailed her a guidance sheet that he found online, which was sort of relevant to our question but not really. When we got together to feedback, she said to me \u201cso are we using what you did then?\u201d Taken aback I said \u201cwell no we\u2019ll use a combination, what info have you found?\u201d And she just pulled out this sheet. So the entirety of her effort had been emailing someone else to answer the question for her, and bringing that in. I was pissed because then she took credit for my table and fed it back to the group as if *we* had done it. Didn\u2019t even mention her fucking sheet as it wasn\u2019t relevant.\n\nSo back to today. When it came to feeding back, I noticed that Barbara had been extremely quiet. She had not contributed at all to the discussion, and several times the group leader said \u201cis there anybody else who has not yet fed back their questions?\u201d and she was just keeping quiet. So I just said \u201cHey Barbara, this piece of research really links to your question, what did you find?\u201d at which point she breaks down crying and said she couldn\u2019t find anything and she was really sorry for letting us all down.\n\nTruthfully, I already knew she hadn\u2019t found anything because I\u2019d overheard her saying so to another classmate earlier on.\n\nSo, AITA for embarrassing her in front of everyone? It\u2019s true that I only asked because I wanted her to have to say in front of everyone that she hadn\u2019t done any work.\n\n**TL;DR:** *Barbara did absolutely nothing in our group task last time I worked with her, and she took credit for my work. This time, Barbara chose to do the most important aspect of our group task but then didn\u2019t actually do it. She was keeping quiet hoping to go under the radar, but I called her out on it and made her cry*\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of this \"Am I the Asshole?\" post is in the wrong. The situation involves the author embarrassing a classmate named Barbara during a group presentation. \n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The author is in a master's program, and they have group work where they split tasks. Barbara, a classmate, volunteered for the most important part of the current task. In the past, Barbara had previously relied on someone else's work and took credit for it. Now, the author noticed Barbara wasn't contributing and called her out in front of everyone, leading her to cry because she hadn't done the work.\n\nThe author's reasoning is that they wanted to make Barbara admit she didn't do the work in front of everyone because of past grievances. The question is whether the author is in the wrong here.\n\nSo, the main factors here are: past behavior of Barbara, the author's motivation, the method of addressing the issue, and the consequences (Barbara crying).\n\nIn the past, Barbara had taken credit for the author's work. Now, when Barbara didn't do her part again, the author confronted her publicly. The public shaming caused Barbara to cry. The author's intention was to hold Barbara accountable, but the method might be questionable. \n\nIn academic settings, teamwork is crucial, and holding someone accountable is important. However, public humiliation can be seen as inappropriate, even if the person has wronged you before. The author could have addressed it privately to avoid embarrassing Barbara. Publicly calling her out, especially knowing she might not have done the work, might be crossing a line. \n\nEven if Barbara's past actions were unethical, the author's response might not be justified. The emotional impact on Barbara is significant, which is a negative outcome. The key is whether the author's approach was necessary or if there was a more constructive way to handle it. \n\nConsidering all this, the author might be in the wrong for choosing to embarrass Barbara publicly instead of handling it privately. So the answer would be A (Yes, the author is in the wrong). But I should also consider if there are mitigating factors. The author might feel justified given Barbara's past behavior, but the method is still problematic. Most advice would suggest addressing issues privately to resolve conflicts without public humiliation.\n"
