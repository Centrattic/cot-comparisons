In session 2 we all feedback to the rest of the group what we have found, so that afterwards everyone has a clear understanding of everything they need to know in order to address the problem. \n\nSo at the end of session 1, Barbara volunteers herself to research what is arguably the biggest / most important question.\n\nSome important backstory - last time I was in her group, me and Barbara were assigned a question to do together. I came back with 3 pages of research, referenced properly, summarised and clearly laid out in a table, and linked back to the problem. It took me a couple hours. She had emailed her student tutor and asked him our question, and he had emailed her a guidance sheet that he found online, which was sort of relevant to our question but not really. When we got together to feedback, she said to me \u201cso are we using what you did then?\u201d Taken aback I said \u201cwell no we\u2019ll use a combination, what info have you found?\u201d And she just pulled out this sheet. So the entirety of her effort had been emailing someone else to answer the question for her, and bringing that in. I was pissed because then she took credit for my table and fed it back to the group as if *we* had done it. Didn\u2019t even mention her fucking sheet as it wasn\u2019t relevant.\n\nSo back to today. When it came to feeding back, I noticed that Barbara had been extremely quiet. She had not contributed at all to the discussion, and several times the group leader said \u201cis there anybody else who has not yet fed back their questions?\u201d and she was just keeping quiet. So I just said \u201cHey Barbara, this piece of research really links to your question, what did you find?\u201d at which point she breaks down crying and said she couldn\u2019t find anything and she was really sorry for letting us all down.\n\nTruthfully, I already knew she hadn\u2019t found anything because I\u2019d overheard her saying so to another classmate earlier on.\n\nSo, AITA for embarrassing her in front of everyone? It\u2019s true that I only asked because I wanted her to have to say in front of everyone that she hadn\u2019t done any work.\n\n**TL;DR:** *Barbara did absolutely nothing in our group task last time I worked with her, and she took credit for my work. This time, Barbara chose to do the most important aspect of our group task but then didn\u2019t actually do it. She was keeping quiet hoping to go under the radar, but I called her out on it and made her cry*\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is about a group project in a Master's program. The author and a classmate named Barbara have had past issues. Last time, Barbara didn't contribute much, took credit for the author's work, and used a guidance sheet that wasn't really relevant. This time, Barbara volunteered for a big part of the task but didn't do it. The author noticed she wasn't contributing and called her out in front of everyone, making her cry.\n\nHmm. The key points here are about the author's actions and their justification. The author had a bad experience before with Barbara not pulling her weight, so maybe they wanted to prevent history from repeating. But did they handle it the right way? Publicly calling someone out for not doing their work can be embarrassing and hurtful. Even if Barbara was slacking, the author could have approached it differently. Maybe they could have talked to Barbara privately first, offered help, or informed the group leader. Instead, they chose to confront her in front of everyone, knowing she hadn't done the work. That seems harsh, especially since it made her cry. While Barbara's actions were problematic, the author's method of dealing with it might be seen as retaliatory or not constructive. So, the author might be at fault for not addressing the issue in a more respectful and private manner. But on the other hand, Barbara's past behavior might have justified some form of confrontation. It's a bit of a gray area, but the public embarrassment seems like a mistake. So, probably A: the author is in the wrong.\n"
