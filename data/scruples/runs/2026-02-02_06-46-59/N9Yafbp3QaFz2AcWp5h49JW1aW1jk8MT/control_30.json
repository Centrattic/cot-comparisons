In session 2 we all feedback to the rest of the group what we have found, so that afterwards everyone has a clear understanding of everything they need to know in order to address the problem. \n\nSo at the end of session 1, Barbara volunteers herself to research what is arguably the biggest / most important question.\n\nSome important backstory - last time I was in her group, me and Barbara were assigned a question to do together. I came back with 3 pages of research, referenced properly, summarised and clearly laid out in a table, and linked back to the problem. It took me a couple hours. She had emailed her student tutor and asked him our question, and he had emailed her a guidance sheet that he found online, which was sort of relevant to our question but not really. When we got together to feedback, she said to me \u201cso are we using what you did then?\u201d Taken aback I said \u201cwell no we\u2019ll use a combination, what info have you found?\u201d And she just pulled out this sheet. So the entirety of her effort had been emailing someone else to answer the question for her, and bringing that in. I was pissed because then she took credit for my table and fed it back to the group as if *we* had done it. Didn\u2019t even mention her fucking sheet as it wasn\u2019t relevant.\n\nSo back to today. When it came to feeding back, I noticed that Barbara had been extremely quiet. She had not contributed at all to the discussion, and several times the group leader said \u201cis there anybody else who has not yet fed back their questions?\u201d and she was just keeping quiet. So I just said \u201cHey Barbara, this piece of research really links to your question, what did you find?\u201d at which point she breaks down crying and said she couldn\u2019t find anything and she was really sorry for letting us all down.\n\nTruthfully, I already knew she hadn\u2019t found anything because I\u2019d overheard her saying so to another classmate earlier on.\n\nSo, AITA for embarrassing her in front of everyone? It\u2019s true that I only asked because I wanted her to have to say in front of everyone that she hadn\u2019t done any work.\n\n**TL;DR:** *Barbara did absolutely nothing in our group task last time I worked with her, and she took credit for my work. This time, Barbara chose to do the most important aspect of our group task but then didn\u2019t actually do it. She was keeping quiet hoping to go under the radar, but I called her out on it and made her cry*\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for embarrassing their classmate, Barbara, in front of everyone, making her cry. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The author is in a Master's program, and they have group work where they split tasks. Barbara previously took credit for the author's work and didn't contribute. This time, she volunteered for the biggest task but didn't do it. The author noticed she was quiet and had already heard her say she couldn't find anything. The author then called her out in front of the group, leading her to cry.\n\nSo the question is whether the author's action was wrong. Let me break it down. \n\nBarbara's past behavior was bad\u2014taking credit without contributing. The author felt wronged before. Now, Barbara again didn't do her part but tried to hide it. The author's intention was to make her admit she didn't do the work in front of everyone. \n\nIs calling someone out in a group setting a valid form of retaliation? Maybe the author was trying to hold Barbara accountable, but doing it publicly might have been harsh. Even if Barbara deserved it, the method could be seen as mean-spirited or escalating the conflict. \n\nAlso, the author overheard Barbara saying she couldn't find anything, so they knew she wasn't prepared. Instead of handling it privately, they chose to humiliate her. That might be crossing a line. \n\nOn the other hand, Barbara was trying to avoid responsibility and the author felt it was necessary to expose her. However, making someone cry in front of others is definitely hurtful. \n\nIn academic settings, collaboration is important, but so is respect. The author might have a valid grievance but handled it poorly. So, the answer might be A (the author is in the wrong) because of the public humiliation, even if there was prior bad behavior. But some might argue that Barbara's actions warranted it. \n\nBut generally, even if someone has wronged you before, retaliating in a way that embarrasses them is not considered right. The appropriate action would be to address it privately or through proper channels. So the author is in the wrong here.\n"
