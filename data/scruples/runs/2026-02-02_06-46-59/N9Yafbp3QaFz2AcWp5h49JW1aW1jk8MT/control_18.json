In session 2 we all feedback to the rest of the group what we have found, so that afterwards everyone has a clear understanding of everything they need to know in order to address the problem. \n\nSo at the end of session 1, Barbara volunteers herself to research what is arguably the biggest / most important question.\n\nSome important backstory - last time I was in her group, me and Barbara were assigned a question to do together. I came back with 3 pages of research, referenced properly, summarised and clearly laid out in a table, and linked back to the problem. It took me a couple hours. She had emailed her student tutor and asked him our question, and he had emailed her a guidance sheet that he found online, which was sort of relevant to our question but not really. When we got together to feedback, she said to me \u201cso are we using what you did then?\u201d Taken aback I said \u201cwell no we\u2019ll use a combination, what info have you found?\u201d And she just pulled out this sheet. So the entirety of her effort had been emailing someone else to answer the question for her, and bringing that in. I was pissed because then she took credit for my table and fed it back to the group as if *we* had done it. Didn\u2019t even mention her fucking sheet as it wasn\u2019t relevant.\n\nSo back to today. When it came to feeding back, I noticed that Barbara had been extremely quiet. She had not contributed at all to the discussion, and several times the group leader said \u201cis there anybody else who has not yet fed back their questions?\u201d and she was just keeping quiet. So I just said \u201cHey Barbara, this piece of research really links to your question, what did you find?\u201d at which point she breaks down crying and said she couldn\u2019t find anything and she was really sorry for letting us all down.\n\nTruthfully, I already knew she hadn\u2019t found anything because I\u2019d overheard her saying so to another classmate earlier on.\n\nSo, AITA for embarrassing her in front of everyone? It\u2019s true that I only asked because I wanted her to have to say in front of everyone that she hadn\u2019t done any work.\n\n**TL;DR:** *Barbara did absolutely nothing in our group task last time I worked with her, and she took credit for my work. This time, Barbara chose to do the most important aspect of our group task but then didn\u2019t actually do it. She was keeping quiet hoping to go under the radar, but I called her out on it and made her cry*\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. So the user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for embarrassing their classmate, Barbara, by making her cry during a group presentation.\n\nFirst, let me recap the situation. The author is in a Masters program and works in groups on presentations. Last time, Barbara didn't contribute much, took credit for the author's work, and didn't even mention her own irrelevant research. This time, Barbara volunteered for the most important part of the task but didn't do any research. The author noticed she was quiet, overheard her saying she couldn't find anything, and then called her out in front of the group, leading her to cry.\n\nSo, the author's intent was to make Barbara admit she didn't do the work, based on past experiences. The question is whether the author is at fault here.\n\nHmm. Let me think about different angles. On one hand, Barbara didn't do her part, which is irresponsible. The author might feel justified in holding her accountable, especially after being taken advantage of before. But on the other hand, publicly shaming someone, even if they deserve it, can be harsh and might not be the best approach. It could lead to emotional distress, as it did here. The author's method of confronting Barbara in front of everyone might have been a way to ensure accountability but at the cost of Barbara's dignity and emotional well-being.\n\nIs there a better way to handle this? Like maybe speaking to Barbara privately first, or approaching the group leader or tutor to address the issue without public humiliation? The author might have felt frustrated and wanted immediate action, but public embarrassment could be seen as a form of retaliation rather than a constructive solution.\n\nAlso, considering group dynamics, if others in the group didn't intervene or if the group leader didn't ensure participation, maybe there's some shared responsibility. But the question is specifically about the author's actions.\n\nIn academic settings, collaboration is key. If someone isn't contributing, it's important to address it, but the method matters. The author's approach might have been effective in getting Barbara to admit she didn't do the work, but the emotional toll could be seen as unnecessary. Publicly calling someone out without giving them a chance to explain (though the author knew Barbara had done nothing) might still be harsh.\n\nSo, while Barbara's actions were indeed poor, the author's method of confrontation might have crossed a line. The intent was to hold her accountable, but the execution led to emotional harm. Therefore, the author might be at fault for not handling it more discreetly. But then again, maybe in an academic setting, accountability is important, and the author's action was a way to ensure the group's work isn't compromised. It's a bit of a gray area. However, the public humiliation aspect is a significant factor here. Even if justified in intent, the method might be in the wrong.\n"
