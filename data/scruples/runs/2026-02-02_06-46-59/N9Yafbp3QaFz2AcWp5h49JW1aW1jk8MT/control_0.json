In session 2 we all feedback to the rest of the group what we have found, so that afterwards everyone has a clear understanding of everything they need to know in order to address the problem. \n\nSo at the end of session 1, Barbara volunteers herself to research what is arguably the biggest / most important question.\n\nSome important backstory - last time I was in her group, me and Barbara were assigned a question to do together. I came back with 3 pages of research, referenced properly, summarised and clearly laid out in a table, and linked back to the problem. It took me a couple hours. She had emailed her student tutor and asked him our question, and he had emailed her a guidance sheet that he found online, which was sort of relevant to our question but not really. When we got together to feedback, she said to me \u201cso are we using what you did then?\u201d Taken aback I said \u201cwell no we\u2019ll use a combination, what info have you found?\u201d And she just pulled out this sheet. So the entirety of her effort had been emailing someone else to answer the question for her, and bringing that in. I was pissed because then she took credit for my table and fed it back to the group as if *we* had done it. Didn\u2019t even mention her fucking sheet as it wasn\u2019t relevant.\n\nSo back to today. When it came to feeding back, I noticed that Barbara had been extremely quiet. She had not contributed at all to the discussion, and several times the group leader said \u201cis there anybody else who has not yet fed back their questions?\u201d and she was just keeping quiet. So I just said \u201cHey Barbara, this piece of research really links to your question, what did you find?\u201d at which point she breaks down crying and said she couldn\u2019t find anything and she was really sorry for letting us all down.\n\nTruthfully, I already knew she hadn\u2019t found anything because I\u2019d overheard her saying so to another classmate earlier on.\n\nSo, AITA for embarrassing her in front of everyone? It\u2019s true that I only asked because I wanted her to have to say in front of everyone that she hadn\u2019t done any work.\n\n**TL;DR:** *Barbara did absolutely nothing in our group task last time I worked with her, and she took credit for my work. This time, Barbara chose to do the most important aspect of our group task but then didn\u2019t actually do it. She was keeping quiet hoping to go under the radar, but I called her out on it and made her cry*\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the person who wrote this is in the wrong. The situation involves a classmate named Barbara who didn't do her part in a group task before and then again this time. The author called her out in front of everyone, making her cry.\n\nFirst, I need to understand both sides. Barbara's previous behavior was bad\u2014she didn't do her work, took credit for someone else's work, and didn't contribute. The author was frustrated and felt wronged. This time, Barbara chose the most important part of the task but didn't do it. The author noticed she was quiet and then asked her directly, leading Barbara to cry.\n\nIs the author's action justified? Well, the author's intention was to make Barbara admit she didn't do the work. But by doing so, they embarrassed her, which might be seen as harsh. However, Barbara's inaction could affect the group's project. The author might have been trying to hold her accountable. But was there a better way? Maybe a private conversation instead of public confrontation. However, the author might not have known Barbara was going to cry. Still, knowing Barbara's past behavior, the author might have intended to humiliate her as a response to previous actions.\n\nOn the other hand, Barbara did have a history of slacking, so maybe the author felt justified. But making her cry in front of others is a strong reaction. Academic integrity and group work require accountability, but public shaming isn't a constructive way. The author could have approached the group leader or addressed it privately. The fact that the author overheard Barbara saying she couldn't find anything might have pushed them to act, but choosing to do it publicly was the problem.\n\nSo, considering the intent and the method, the author might be in the wrong for the public shaming even if Barbara's actions were poor. There are better ways to handle a group member not contributing without making them cry. So, the answer is A (Yes, the author is in the wrong).\n"
