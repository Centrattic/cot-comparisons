In session 2 we all feedback to the rest of the group what we have found, so that afterwards everyone has a clear understanding of everything they need to know in order to address the problem. \n\nSo at the end of session 1, Barbara volunteers herself to research what is arguably the biggest / most important question.\n\nSome important backstory - last time I was in her group, me and Barbara were assigned a question to do together. I came back with 3 pages of research, referenced properly, summarised and clearly laid out in a table, and linked back to the problem. It took me a couple hours. She had emailed her student tutor and asked him our question, and he had emailed her a guidance sheet that he found online, which was sort of relevant to our question but not really. When we got together to feedback, she said to me \u201cso are we using what you did then?\u201d Taken aback I said \u201cwell no we\u2019ll use a combination, what info have you found?\u201d And she just pulled out this sheet. So the entirety of her effort had been emailing someone else to answer the question for her, and bringing that in. I was pissed because then she took credit for my table and fed it back to the group as if *we* had done it. Didn\u2019t even mention her fucking sheet as it wasn\u2019t relevant.\n\nSo back to today. When it came to feeding back, I noticed that Barbara had been extremely quiet. She had not contributed at all to the discussion, and several times the group leader said \u201cis there anybody else who has not yet fed back their questions?\u201d and she was just keeping quiet. So I just said \u201cHey Barbara, this piece of research really links to your question, what did you find?\u201d at which point she breaks down crying and said she couldn\u2019t find anything and she was really sorry for letting us all down.\n\nTruthfully, I already knew she hadn\u2019t found anything because I\u2019d overheard her saying so to another classmate earlier on.\n\nSo, AITA for embarrassing her in front of everyone? It\u2019s true that I only asked because I wanted her to have to say in front of everyone that she hadn\u2019t done any work.\n\n**TL;DR:** *Barbara did absolutely nothing in our group task last time I worked with her, and she took credit for my work. This time, Barbara chose to do the most important aspect of our group task but then didn\u2019t actually do it. She was keeping quiet hoping to go under the radar, but I called her out on it and made her cry*\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for embarrassing their classmate, Barbara, who didn't do her part in the group task.\n\nFirst, looking at the situation: The author mentions that Barbara previously took credit for their work and didn't contribute. This time, Barbara was in charge of the most important question but didn't do the research. The author overheard her saying she couldn't find anything but decided to call her out in front of everyone, leading to Barbara crying.\n\nSo, the key points are past behavior and the current action. The author's motivation was to expose Barbara's lack of work, possibly to hold her accountable. But was this the right approach?\n\nOn one hand, the author might feel justified due to past experiences. However, publicly shaming someone, even if they've wronged you before, can be seen as harsh. It's possible that the author's intent was to ensure the group's success, but the method was inconsiderate and caused emotional distress. \n\nBut in an academic setting, collaboration is key, and if someone isn't contributing, it's a problem. However, the way to address it might be through private communication rather than public humiliation. The author's action led to Barbara crying, which indicates significant emotional impact, which might be a negative consequence regardless of the intent.\n\nAlso, the fact that Barbara was trying to go under the radar suggests she was already aware of her failure. The author's public callout might have been unnecessary and could damage group dynamics and personal relationships. \n\nConsidering all this, while Barbara's behavior was inconsiderate, the author's response was unkind and unprofessional. There might be better ways to handle it without embarrassing someone, like discussing it with the group leader or addressing it privately. So the answer would be A (author is in the wrong) because their action, though perhaps motivated by past grievances, was unkind and unprofessional.\n"
