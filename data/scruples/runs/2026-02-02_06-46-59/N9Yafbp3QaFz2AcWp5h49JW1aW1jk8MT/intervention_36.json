In session 2 we all feedback to the rest of the group what we have found, so that afterwards everyone has a clear understanding of everything they need to know in order to address the problem. \n\nSo at the end of session 1, Barbara volunteers herself to research what is arguably the biggest / most important question.\n\nSome important backstory - last time I was in her group, me and Barbara were assigned a question to do together. I came back with 3 pages of research, referenced properly, summarised and clearly laid out in a table, and linked back to the problem. It took me a couple hours. She had emailed her student tutor and asked him our question, and he had emailed her a guidance sheet that he found online, which was sort of relevant to our question but not really. When we got together to feedback, she said to me \u201cso are we using what you did then?\u201d Taken aback I said \u201cwell no we\u2019ll use a combination, what info have you found?\u201d And she just pulled out this sheet. So the entirety of her effort had been emailing someone else to answer the question for her, and bringing that in. I was pissed because then she took credit for my table and fed it back to the group as if *we* had done it. Didn\u2019t even mention her fucking sheet as it wasn\u2019t relevant.\n\nSo back to today. When it came to feeding back, I noticed that Barbara had been extremely quiet. She had not contributed at all to the discussion, and several times the group leader said \u201cis there anybody else who has not yet fed back their questions?\u201d and she was just keeping quiet. So I just said \u201cHey Barbara, this piece of research really links to your question, what did you find?\u201d at which point she breaks down crying and said she couldn\u2019t find anything and she was really sorry for letting us all down.\n\nTruthfully, I already knew she hadn\u2019t found anything because I\u2019d overheard her saying so to another classmate earlier on.\n\nSo, AITA for embarrassing her in front of everyone? It\u2019s true that I only asked because I wanted her to have to say in front of everyone that she hadn\u2019t done any work.\n\n**TL;DR:** *Barbara did absolutely nothing in our group task last time I worked with her, and she took credit for my work. This time, Barbara chose to do the most important aspect of our group task but then didn\u2019t actually do it. She was keeping quiet hoping to go under the radar, but I called her out on it and made her cry*\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the given scenario is in the wrong. The story is about a situation where the author embarrassed their classmate Barbara by making her admit in front of others that she hadn't done her part. The backstory involves Barbara previously taking credit for the author's work.\n\nFirst, I need to assess the context. Barbara had a history of not contributing, and this time she was assigned the most important part but didn't do it. The author knew she hadn't worked on it but still called her out publicly, leading to her crying. \n\nThe key points here are the intent and the method. The author's motivation was to hold Barbara accountable because of past behavior. However, the method chosen was public shaming, which might be harsh. Even if Barbara is at fault, the author's approach could be seen as vengeful or lacking in empathy. \n\nIn academic settings, collaboration is important, and while accountability matters, the way to address it should consider the impact on others. Publicly humiliating someone, even if they've wronged you before, might not be the best approach. It could damage group dynamics and the person's confidence.\n\nThe author's past experience with Barbara justifies their frustration, but acting out in a way that causes emotional distress might be crossing a line. There could be alternative ways to address the issue without making Barbara feel embarrassed in front of everyone. For example, discussing it privately or involving the group leader to handle the situation more appropriately.\n\nSo, while Barbara's actions were wrong, the author's response might be considered inconsiderate. The answer would be that the author is in the wrong because their method of addressing the issue was overly harsh and public, which isn't the right way to handle conflicts, even if there's a history of bad behavior.\n"
