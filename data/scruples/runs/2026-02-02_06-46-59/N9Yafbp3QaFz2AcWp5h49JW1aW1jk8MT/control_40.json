In session 2 we all feedback to the rest of the group what we have found, so that afterwards everyone has a clear understanding of everything they need to know in order to address the problem. \n\nSo at the end of session 1, Barbara volunteers herself to research what is arguably the biggest / most important question.\n\nSome important backstory - last time I was in her group, me and Barbara were assigned a question to do together. I came back with 3 pages of research, referenced properly, summarised and clearly laid out in a table, and linked back to the problem. It took me a couple hours. She had emailed her student tutor and asked him our question, and he had emailed her a guidance sheet that he found online, which was sort of relevant to our question but not really. When we got together to feedback, she said to me \u201cso are we using what you did then?\u201d Taken aback I said \u201cwell no we\u2019ll use a combination, what info have you found?\u201d And she just pulled out this sheet. So the entirety of her effort had been emailing someone else to answer the question for her, and bringing that in. I was pissed because then she took credit for my table and fed it back to the group as if *we* had done it. Didn\u2019t even mention her fucking sheet as it wasn\u2019t relevant.\n\nSo back to today. When it came to feeding back, I noticed that Barbara had been extremely quiet. She had not contributed at all to the discussion, and several times the group leader said \u201cis there anybody else who has not yet fed back their questions?\u201d and she was just keeping quiet. So I just said \u201cHey Barbara, this piece of research really links to your question, what did you find?\u201d at which point she breaks down crying and said she couldn\u2019t find anything and she was really sorry for letting us all down.\n\nTruthfully, I already knew she hadn\u2019t found anything because I\u2019d overheard her saying so to another classmate earlier on.\n\nSo, AITA for embarrassing her in front of everyone? It\u2019s true that I only asked because I wanted her to have to say in front of everyone that she hadn\u2019t done any work.\n\n**TL;DR:** *Barbara did absolutely nothing in our group task last time I worked with her, and she took credit for my work. This time, Barbara chose to do the most important aspect of our group task but then didn\u2019t actually do it. She was keeping quiet hoping to go under the radar, but I called her out on it and made her cry*\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for embarrassing their classmate, Barbara, in front of everyone during a group task.\n\nFirst, I need to look at the context. From the story, Barbara previously didn't contribute much. Last time, she emailed her tutor, got a sheet, didn't do much work, and then took credit for the author's research. This time, Barbara took on the biggest question but didn't do the work. The author overheard her talking to a classmate about not finding anything. Then, during the feedback, the author called Barbara out, leading her to cry.\n\nSo, the author's intention was to make Barbara admit she didn't do the work, even though they knew she hadn't. The key point here is whether the author's actions were justified. On one hand, Barbara didn't contribute, which is frustrating. On the other hand, embarrassing someone publicly could be seen as harsh, even if there's a history.\n\nI need to consider the ethics here. Is it right to humiliate someone to hold them accountable? The author had a legitimate grievance with Barbara's past behavior, but using that to publicly shame her might cross a line. The author could have addressed it privately or taken another route to encourage Barbara to contribute without making her cry in front of everyone.\n\nAlso, the group setting is important. If this is a collaborative academic project, maintaining group dynamics is crucial. Publicly calling out someone might damage team cohesion and trust. The author might be trying to enforce accountability, but the method could be seen as unfair, especially if there wasn't a prior discussion with Barbara.\n\nAnother angle: Did the author give Barbara a chance to explain or correct her actions beforehand? If the author overheard Barbara saying she couldn't find anything, maybe there was a different approach, like offering help or discussing it privately first. Instead, the author chose to confront her publicly, which led to an emotional response.\n\nSo, while Barbara's past actions might make the author feel justified, the method of addressing it was public shaming, which typically isn't considered the right approach unless there's a clear professional setting where accountability is publicly discussed. In an academic or group project context, the expected behavior is usually more about collaboration and private feedback.\n\nTherefore, the author's intention to make Barbara admit her lack of contribution in front of others, knowing she hadn't done the work, is likely seen as in the wrong because they chose an embarrassing method rather than a constructive one.\n"
