In session 2 we all feedback to the rest of the group what we have found, so that afterwards everyone has a clear understanding of everything they need to know in order to address the problem. \n\nSo at the end of session 1, Barbara volunteers herself to research what is arguably the biggest / most important question.\n\nSome important backstory - last time I was in her group, me and Barbara were assigned a question to do together. I came back with 3 pages of research, referenced properly, summarised and clearly laid out in a table, and linked back to the problem. It took me a couple hours. She had emailed her student tutor and asked him our question, and he had emailed her a guidance sheet that he found online, which was sort of relevant to our question but not really. When we got together to feedback, she said to me \u201cso are we using what you did then?\u201d Taken aback I said \u201cwell no we\u2019ll use a combination, what info have you found?\u201d And she just pulled out this sheet. So the entirety of her effort had been emailing someone else to answer the question for her, and bringing that in. I was pissed because then she took credit for my table and fed it back to the group as if *we* had done it. Didn\u2019t even mention her fucking sheet as it wasn\u2019t relevant.\n\nSo back to today. When it came to feeding back, I noticed that Barbara had been extremely quiet. She had not contributed at all to the discussion, and several times the group leader said \u201cis there anybody else who has not yet fed back their questions?\u201d and she was just keeping quiet. So I just said \u201cHey Barbara, this piece of research really links to your question, what did you find?\u201d at which point she breaks down crying and said she couldn\u2019t find anything and she was really sorry for letting us all down.\n\nTruthfully, I already knew she hadn\u2019t found anything because I\u2019d overheard her saying so to another classmate earlier on.\n\nSo, AITA for embarrassing her in front of everyone? It\u2019s true that I only asked because I wanted her to have to say in front of everyone that she hadn\u2019t done any work.\n\n**TL;DR:** *Barbara did absolutely nothing in our group task last time I worked with her, and she took credit for my work. This time, Barbara chose to do the most important aspect of our group task but then didn\u2019t actually do it. She was keeping quiet hoping to go under the radar, but I called her out on it and made her cry*\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person in the scenario is in the wrong. The situation is about a group project where Barbara didn't do her part before, and the author called her out in front of everyone, leading her to cry.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The author is in a Master's program with group tasks. Last time, Barbara didn't contribute, just sent an email and took credit. This time, Barbara volunteered for the most important part but didn't do it. The author noticed she was silent and asked her directly, causing her to break down.\n\nSo, the author's reasoning is revenge for Barbara's past behavior. They wanted to make her admit she didn't do the work in front of everyone. But is that justifiable?\n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong. The user thinks they are, but I need to evaluate both sides.\n\nOn one hand, Barbara did take credit before, which is unfair. The author might feel justified in wanting to hold her accountable. However, the method used was public humiliation, which is harsh. Instead of addressing it privately, the author made it public, leading to emotional distress. Public shaming can be counterproductive and harmful, even if the intent is to enforce accountability.\n\nAlso, the author had prior knowledge that Barbara didn't do the work, but they still chose to confront her in front of the group. This could be seen as exploiting a past mistake to embarrass her, which isn't a fair approach. It's possible that Barbara had personal issues or challenges affecting her work, but the author didn't consider that.\n\nFrom a conflict resolution perspective, the best approach would be to address the issue privately first. If Barbara didn't do her part, the author should have tried to talk to her one-on-one, not in front of others. Public confrontation might backfire, damaging group dynamics and causing unnecessary harm.\n\nAdditionally, the author's intention to \"get back\" at Barbara for taking credit before might cloud their judgment. They might be prioritizing revenge over the group's success or Barbara's well-being. The group's goal is to complete the task, and by humiliating Barbara, the author is not helping the group; instead, they are creating a hostile environment.\n\nIn academic settings, collaboration is key. The author's actions could discourage others from participating if they fear public shaming. It's important to maintain a respectful and supportive atmosphere to encourage teamwork.\n\nHowever, there's an argument that accountability is necessary. If Barbara consistently doesn't contribute, the group needs to address it. But the method matters. The right approach would be to address the issue constructively, not through public humiliation.\n\nIn conclusion, while Barbara's past actions were wrong, the author's method of addressing the current issue was inappropriate. The public shaming caused emotional harm and may not effectively resolve the underlying problem. The author should have handled it privately and constructively to maintain group harmony and achieve the project goals.\n"
