In session 2 we all feedback to the rest of the group what we have found, so that afterwards everyone has a clear understanding of everything they need to know in order to address the problem. \n\nSo at the end of session 1, Barbara volunteers herself to research what is arguably the biggest / most important question.\n\nSome important backstory - last time I was in her group, me and Barbara were assigned a question to do together. I came back with 3 pages of research, referenced properly, summarised and clearly laid out in a table, and linked back to the problem. It took me a couple hours. She had emailed her student tutor and asked him our question, and he had emailed her a guidance sheet that he found online, which was sort of relevant to our question but not really. When we got together to feedback, she said to me \u201cso are we using what you did then?\u201d Taken aback I said \u201cwell no we\u2019ll use a combination, what info have you found?\u201d And she just pulled out this sheet. So the entirety of her effort had been emailing someone else to answer the question for her, and bringing that in. I was pissed because then she took credit for my table and fed it back to the group as if *we* had done it. Didn\u2019t even mention her fucking sheet as it wasn\u2019t relevant.\n\nSo back to today. When it came to feeding back, I noticed that Barbara had been extremely quiet. She had not contributed at all to the discussion, and several times the group leader said \u201cis there anybody else who has not yet fed back their questions?\u201d and she was just keeping quiet. So I just said \u201cHey Barbara, this piece of research really links to your question, what did you find?\u201d at which point she breaks down crying and said she couldn\u2019t find anything and she was really sorry for letting us all down.\n\nTruthfully, I already knew she hadn\u2019t found anything because I\u2019d overheard her saying so to another classmate earlier on.\n\nSo, AITA for embarrassing her in front of everyone? It\u2019s true that I only asked because I wanted her to have to say in front of everyone that she hadn\u2019t done any work.\n\n**TL;DR:** *Barbara did absolutely nothing in our group task last time I worked with her, and she took credit for my work. This time, Barbara chose to do the most important aspect of our group task but then didn\u2019t actually do it. She was keeping quiet hoping to go under the radar, but I called her out on it and made her cry*\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the \"AITA\" post is in the wrong. The situation involves a classmate, Barbara, who previously didn't contribute and took credit for the author's work. Now, Barbara was assigned the most important part of a group task again but didn't do it. The author called her out in front of everyone, causing her to cry.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze the key points. The author's past experience with Barbara is important. Barbara had a pattern of not doing her part and taking credit. The current situation is similar: Barbara was silent during the feedback and the author confronted her, knowing she hadn't done the work. The author's intention was to force Barbara to admit she hadn't worked, which led to her crying.\n\nNow, considering the ethical aspects. Was the author justified in calling out Barbara publicly? On one hand, the author might feel wronged by Barbara's past actions and wanted to hold her accountable. Publicly embarrassing someone, however, can be seen as harsh and potentially cruel, even if justified by past behavior. It's possible that the author's actions were a reaction to previous grievances, leading to a lack of empathy in the current situation.\n\nBut the group work structure requires everyone's contribution, and Barbara's silence during the feedback might have been problematic for the group's progress. The author might have felt that the group needed her input and couldn't let Barbara avoid responsibility again. However, there could have been a more constructive way to handle it, like discussing privately or working with the group leader to address Barbara's lack of contribution without public shaming.\n\nAnother angle is the emotional impact. Making Barbara cry suggests that the confrontation was hurtful. Even if Barbara didn't do her part, the method of addressing it led to emotional distress. The author might have intended to hold Barbara accountable, but the outcome was harmful. It's possible that the author overlooked Barbara's possible struggles or reasons for not completing the task, such as personal issues or stress, especially since she was in a graduate program.\n\nSo, balancing accountability and empathy. The author has a right to expect contributions from group members, but the approach taken was confrontational and public, which might have been disproportionate. The author's previous negative experience with Barbara could have influenced their reaction, leading to a harsher response than necessary.\n\nIn conclusion, while Barbara's behavior was problematic, the author's method of addressing it might be in the wrong because they chose a public confrontation that caused emotional harm, rather than a more supportive or private approach to address the issue constructively.\n"
