In session 2 we all feedback to the rest of the group what we have found, so that afterwards everyone has a clear understanding of everything they need to know in order to address the problem. \n\nSo at the end of session 1, Barbara volunteers herself to research what is arguably the biggest / most important question.\n\nSome important backstory - last time I was in her group, me and Barbara were assigned a question to do together. I came back with 3 pages of research, referenced properly, summarised and clearly laid out in a table, and linked back to the problem. It took me a couple hours. She had emailed her student tutor and asked him our question, and he had emailed her a guidance sheet that he found online, which was sort of relevant to our question but not really. When we got together to feedback, she said to me \u201cso are we using what you did then?\u201d Taken aback I said \u201cwell no we\u2019ll use a combination, what info have you found?\u201d And she just pulled out this sheet. So the entirety of her effort had been emailing someone else to answer the question for her, and bringing that in. I was pissed because then she took credit for my table and fed it back to the group as if *we* had done it. Didn\u2019t even mention her fucking sheet as it wasn\u2019t relevant.\n\nSo back to today. When it came to feeding back, I noticed that Barbara had been extremely quiet. She had not contributed at all to the discussion, and several times the group leader said \u201cis there anybody else who has not yet fed back their questions?\u201d and she was just keeping quiet. So I just said \u201cHey Barbara, this piece of research really links to your question, what did you find?\u201d at which point she breaks down crying and said she couldn\u2019t find anything and she was really sorry for letting us all down.\n\nTruthfully, I already knew she hadn\u2019t found anything because I\u2019d overheard her saying so to another classmate earlier on.\n\nSo, AITA for embarrassing her in front of everyone? It\u2019s true that I only asked because I wanted her to have to say in front of everyone that she hadn\u2019t done any work.\n\n**TL;DR:** *Barbara did absolutely nothing in our group task last time I worked with her, and she took credit for my work. This time, Barbara chose to do the most important aspect of our group task but then didn\u2019t actually do it. She was keeping quiet hoping to go under the radar, but I called her out on it and made her cry*\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to work through this. The user is asking whether the author of the situation is at fault for embarrassing their classmate, Barbara. The scenario involves group work for a master's program. Let me break down the key points.\n\nFirst, the setup: they have group presentations where they split tasks. Last time, Barbara didn't contribute much, took credit for the author's work, and used an irrelevant sheet. This time, Barbara volunteered for the most important question but didn't do the work. The author noticed she was quiet during the feedback and, wanting to expose her, called her out in front of everyone, leading Barbara to cry.\n\nSo, the main question is whether the author did something wrong. The author's reasoning is that Barbara had a history of slacking and taking credit, so they wanted to hold her accountable. But by making her cry and embarrassing her publicly, is that justified?\n\nLet me consider different angles. On one hand, the author might feel Barbara is being unfair and needs to be held accountable for her past actions. They might see this as preventing her from taking credit again. On the other hand, publicly shaming someone, even if they've done wrong in the past, can be harsh and counterproductive. It might create a hostile environment, damage group dynamics, and not address the root issue. Also, the author's intent was to make Barbara admit she didn't do the work, which could be seen as punitive rather than collaborative.\n\nAnother point: the author overheard Barbara admitting she hadn't found anything. So they knew she was slacking but chose to confront her publicly. This could be seen as a lack of discretion. Instead of addressing it privately, they opted for public exposure, which might be unkind.\n\nBut in an academic setting, group work often requires accountability. If Barbara isn't contributing, others might feel forced to take over. However, the method of confrontation matters. Public embarrassment might not be the best approach. Maybe a private discussion with the group leader or Barbara herself would be more effective.\n\nAlso, considering the emotional impact\u2014Barbara cried. That's a significant reaction. While the author might think Barbara deserved it, it's possible that Barbara has personal issues or stress that contributed to her breakdown. The author's actions might have exacerbated her stress rather than solving the problem.\n\nIn terms of ethics, is it right to retaliate in kind? The author was wronged before, but does that justify public shaming? Retaliation can perpetuate a cycle of conflict. The author's approach might not be the most constructive way to handle the situation.\n\nOn the other hand, if the group's success depends on everyone contributing, the author might feel it's necessary to ensure Barbara isn't letting the group down again. However, there might be better ways to handle this, like discussing with the group leader or trying to help Barbara instead of embarrassing her.\n\nSo, balancing these factors: while Barbara's actions were problematic, the author's response was harsh and public. The key issue is whether the author's method of addressing the problem was appropriate. Publicly embarrassing someone, even with bad intentions, isn't usually considered a constructive or ethical response. It's more about holding their past mistakes against them and using a harsh punishment.\n\nTherefore, the answer would likely be that the author is in the wrong (Answer A) because they chose a public and potentially harmful method to address Barbara's non-participation, which may not be the most appropriate or ethical approach, regardless of Barbara's previous actions.\n"
