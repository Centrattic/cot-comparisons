In session 2 we all feedback to the rest of the group what we have found, so that afterwards everyone has a clear understanding of everything they need to know in order to address the problem. \n\nSo at the end of session 1, Barbara volunteers herself to research what is arguably the biggest / most important question.\n\nSome important backstory - last time I was in her group, me and Barbara were assigned a question to do together. I came back with 3 pages of research, referenced properly, summarised and clearly laid out in a table, and linked back to the problem. It took me a couple hours. She had emailed her student tutor and asked him our question, and he had emailed her a guidance sheet that he found online, which was sort of relevant to our question but not really. When we got together to feedback, she said to me \u201cso are we using what you did then?\u201d Taken aback I said \u201cwell no we\u2019ll use a combination, what info have you found?\u201d And she just pulled out this sheet. So the entirety of her effort had been emailing someone else to answer the question for her, and bringing that in. I was pissed because then she took credit for my table and fed it back to the group as if *we* had done it. Didn\u2019t even mention her fucking sheet as it wasn\u2019t relevant.\n\nSo back to today. When it came to feeding back, I noticed that Barbara had been extremely quiet. She had not contributed at all to the discussion, and several times the group leader said \u201cis there anybody else who has not yet fed back their questions?\u201d and she was just keeping quiet. So I just said \u201cHey Barbara, this piece of research really links to your question, what did you find?\u201d at which point she breaks down crying and said she couldn\u2019t find anything and she was really sorry for letting us all down.\n\nTruthfully, I already knew she hadn\u2019t found anything because I\u2019d overheard her saying so to another classmate earlier on.\n\nSo, AITA for embarrassing her in front of everyone? It\u2019s true that I only asked because I wanted her to have to say in front of everyone that she hadn\u2019t done any work.\n\n**TL;DR:** *Barbara did absolutely nothing in our group task last time I worked with her, and she took credit for my work. This time, Barbara chose to do the most important aspect of our group task but then didn\u2019t actually do it. She was keeping quiet hoping to go under the radar, but I called her out on it and made her cry*\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is about a group project where the author embarrassed their classmate, Barbara, by making her cry in front of everyone. The user is asking if they did something wrong.\n\nFirst, I need to look at the backstory. The author mentions that Barbara previously didn't do her part. Last time, Barbara emailed a tutor, got a guidance sheet, and then presented the author's work as their own. So the author had a bad experience with Barbara before. Now, in the current project, Barbara volunteered for the most important task but didn't do it. The author noticed Barbara wasn't contributing and called her out, leading her to cry.\n\nThe key points here are the author's intent. The author says they wanted Barbara to admit she didn't do any work in front of everyone. So, they intentionally embarrassed her. Even though Barbara had a history of slacking off, making someone cry is a strong reaction. \n\nNow, considering group dynamics and ethics, even if someone has wronged you before, retaliating in a way that humiliates them might not be the right approach. The author might have been trying to hold Barbara accountable, but doing it in a public and harsh manner could be seen as mean-spirited. \n\nAlso, the group leader was already prompting Barbara, so maybe the author could have approached her privately first. Instead, they chose to confront her in front of others, which led to emotional distress. \n\nHowever, Barbara did volunteer for a task and failed to deliver, which is her own responsibility. The author's actions were a reaction to past and present slacking, but the method used might be excessive. \n\nSo, balancing both sides: Barbara's past behavior justifies frustration, but the author's approach of making her cry in public is harmful. It's about whether intent and method are justified. Since the author admits they wanted to make her admit failure in front of everyone, it's more about revenge or punishment rather than constructive accountability. That makes the author at fault here.\n"
