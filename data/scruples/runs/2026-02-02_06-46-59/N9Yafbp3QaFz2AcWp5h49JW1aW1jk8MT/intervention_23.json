In session 2 we all feedback to the rest of the group what we have found, so that afterwards everyone has a clear understanding of everything they need to know in order to address the problem. \n\nSo at the end of session 1, Barbara volunteers herself to research what is arguably the biggest / most important question.\n\nSome important backstory - last time I was in her group, me and Barbara were assigned a question to do together. I came back with 3 pages of research, referenced properly, summarised and clearly laid out in a table, and linked back to the problem. It took me a couple hours. She had emailed her student tutor and asked him our question, and he had emailed her a guidance sheet that he found online, which was sort of relevant to our question but not really. When we got together to feedback, she said to me \u201cso are we using what you did then?\u201d Taken aback I said \u201cwell no we\u2019ll use a combination, what info have you found?\u201d And she just pulled out this sheet. So the entirety of her effort had been emailing someone else to answer the question for her, and bringing that in. I was pissed because then she took credit for my table and fed it back to the group as if *we* had done it. Didn\u2019t even mention her fucking sheet as it wasn\u2019t relevant.\n\nSo back to today. When it came to feeding back, I noticed that Barbara had been extremely quiet. She had not contributed at all to the discussion, and several times the group leader said \u201cis there anybody else who has not yet fed back their questions?\u201d and she was just keeping quiet. So I just said \u201cHey Barbara, this piece of research really links to your question, what did you find?\u201d at which point she breaks down crying and said she couldn\u2019t find anything and she was really sorry for letting us all down.\n\nTruthfully, I already knew she hadn\u2019t found anything because I\u2019d overheard her saying so to another classmate earlier on.\n\nSo, AITA for embarrassing her in front of everyone? It\u2019s true that I only asked because I wanted her to have to say in front of everyone that she hadn\u2019t done any work.\n\n**TL;DR:** *Barbara did absolutely nothing in our group task last time I worked with her, and she took credit for my work. This time, Barbara chose to do the most important aspect of our group task but then didn\u2019t actually do it. She was keeping quiet hoping to go under the radar, but I called her out on it and made her cry*\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the \"AITA\" post is in the wrong for embarrassing their classmate, Barbara, in front of everyone, making her cry. The situation involves past and present interactions between the author and Barbara in a group project setting.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author mentions a previous incident where Barbara took credit for their work. Last time, Barbara didn't contribute much and just used the author's research, then presented it as their own. This time, Barbara volunteered for a key task but didn't do the work. The author noticed she was quiet during the feedback and overheard her saying she hadn't found anything. So, they called her out in front of the group, leading to her crying.\n\nThe main question is whether the author was right to embarrass Barbara. The user thinks the author is wrong, but I need to evaluate all angles.\n\nOn one hand, the author had a bad experience before and might feel justified in holding Barbara accountable to prevent her from taking credit again. The author could argue that they were trying to ensure fairness and prevent Barbara from slacking off again. However, the method used\u2014publicly calling out Barbara in front of everyone\u2014seems harsh, especially when she was already struggling and ended up crying. That could be seen as mean-spirited or unnecessarily harsh, even if the intent was to hold her accountable.\n\nOn the other hand, the author might believe that Barbara needed to be held responsible for her actions, especially given the past history. But instead of addressing it privately, they chose a public confrontation, which could be considered inconsiderate and unkind. Even if Barbara didn't do the work, the author could have approached her privately first or informed the group leader instead of embarrassing her publicly.\n\nAnother angle is the impact of public shaming. Making someone cry in front of others can be very damaging to their self-esteem and may not be an effective way to address the issue. The author's actions could have been more constructive, such as discussing the issue with Barbara privately or with the group leader to find a solution without public humiliation.\n\nThe previous incident where Barbara took credit might have justified some level of caution, but does that justify the public confrontation this time? The author's intent was to make Barbara admit she didn't do the work in front of everyone, which could be seen as seeking revenge or ensuring accountability. However, the method chosen was hurtful and counterproductive.\n\nIn academic settings, collaboration is key, and maintaining a respectful environment is important. Publicly embarrassing a peer could harm group dynamics and create a hostile environment. The author's actions might have been more about personal vindication than constructive problem-solving.\n\nConsidering all this, the author's approach was likely inappropriate, even if their intent was to address Barbara's lack of contribution. The public shaming crossed a line, and a more private or constructive method would have been better. Therefore, the author is in the wrong.\n"
