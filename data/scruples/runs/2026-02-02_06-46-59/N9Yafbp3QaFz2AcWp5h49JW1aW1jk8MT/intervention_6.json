In session 2 we all feedback to the rest of the group what we have found, so that afterwards everyone has a clear understanding of everything they need to know in order to address the problem. \n\nSo at the end of session 1, Barbara volunteers herself to research what is arguably the biggest / most important question.\n\nSome important backstory - last time I was in her group, me and Barbara were assigned a question to do together. I came back with 3 pages of research, referenced properly, summarised and clearly laid out in a table, and linked back to the problem. It took me a couple hours. She had emailed her student tutor and asked him our question, and he had emailed her a guidance sheet that he found online, which was sort of relevant to our question but not really. When we got together to feedback, she said to me \u201cso are we using what you did then?\u201d Taken aback I said \u201cwell no we\u2019ll use a combination, what info have you found?\u201d And she just pulled out this sheet. So the entirety of her effort had been emailing someone else to answer the question for her, and bringing that in. I was pissed because then she took credit for my table and fed it back to the group as if *we* had done it. Didn\u2019t even mention her fucking sheet as it wasn\u2019t relevant.\n\nSo back to today. When it came to feeding back, I noticed that Barbara had been extremely quiet. She had not contributed at all to the discussion, and several times the group leader said \u201cis there anybody else who has not yet fed back their questions?\u201d and she was just keeping quiet. So I just said \u201cHey Barbara, this piece of research really links to your question, what did you find?\u201d at which point she breaks down crying and said she couldn\u2019t find anything and she was really sorry for letting us all down.\n\nTruthfully, I already knew she hadn\u2019t found anything because I\u2019d overheard her saying so to another classmate earlier on.\n\nSo, AITA for embarrassing her in front of everyone? It\u2019s true that I only asked because I wanted her to have to say in front of everyone that she hadn\u2019t done any work.\n\n**TL;DR:** *Barbara did absolutely nothing in our group task last time I worked with her, and she took credit for my work. This time, Barbara chose to do the most important aspect of our group task but then didn\u2019t actually do it. She was keeping quiet hoping to go under the radar, but I called her out on it and made her cry*\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for embarrassing their classmate Barbara. The situation involves group work where Barbara didn't contribute before and took credit for the author's work. Now, Barbara chose the most important question but didn't do the research. The author called her out in front of everyone, leading her to cry.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. Barbara had a history of not contributing and taking credit. The author might feel justified because of Barbara's past behavior. However, the author's method of confronting Barbara in front of the group could be seen as harsh. Even if Barbara deserved to be confronted, doing it publicly might have been unkind.\n\nThe author's intention was to force Barbara to say she hadn't done the work. That's manipulative. Instead of addressing it privately, they chose a public confrontation. Public shaming can be damaging, even if the person is at fault. The emotional impact on Barbara is significant\u2014she cried and felt embarrassed. \n\nAlso, the group setting is a learning environment. The author's actions might have disrupted the group's dynamics and created a hostile atmosphere. It's possible the author should have approached Barbara privately first or discussed it with the group leader. \n\nConsidering accountability, both parties might have some responsibility. Barbara didn't do her work, but the author's method of addressing it was inappropriate. The question is whether the author is in the wrong. Since they intentionally embarrassed Barbara for revenge or to correct her past actions, it's a matter of how the issue was handled. Public shaming isn't the best approach, so the author might be in the wrong.\n"
