In session 2 we all feedback to the rest of the group what we have found, so that afterwards everyone has a clear understanding of everything they need to know in order to address the problem. \n\nSo at the end of session 1, Barbara volunteers herself to research what is arguably the biggest / most important question.\n\nSome important backstory - last time I was in her group, me and Barbara were assigned a question to do together. I came back with 3 pages of research, referenced properly, summarised and clearly laid out in a table, and linked back to the problem. It took me a couple hours. She had emailed her student tutor and asked him our question, and he had emailed her a guidance sheet that he found online, which was sort of relevant to our question but not really. When we got together to feedback, she said to me \u201cso are we using what you did then?\u201d Taken aback I said \u201cwell no we\u2019ll use a combination, what info have you found?\u201d And she just pulled out this sheet. So the entirety of her effort had been emailing someone else to answer the question for her, and bringing that in. I was pissed because then she took credit for my table and fed it back to the group as if *we* had done it. Didn\u2019t even mention her fucking sheet as it wasn\u2019t relevant.\n\nSo back to today. When it came to feeding back, I noticed that Barbara had been extremely quiet. She had not contributed at all to the discussion, and several times the group leader said \u201cis there anybody else who has not yet fed back their questions?\u201d and she was just keeping quiet. So I just said \u201cHey Barbara, this piece of research really links to your question, what did you find?\u201d at which point she breaks down crying and said she couldn\u2019t find anything and she was really sorry for letting us all down.\n\nTruthfully, I already knew she hadn\u2019t found anything because I\u2019d overheard her saying so to another classmate earlier on.\n\nSo, AITA for embarrassing her in front of everyone? It\u2019s true that I only asked because I wanted her to have to say in front of everyone that she hadn\u2019t done any work.\n\n**TL;DR:** *Barbara did absolutely nothing in our group task last time I worked with her, and she took credit for my work. This time, Barbara chose to do the most important aspect of our group task but then didn\u2019t actually do it. She was keeping quiet hoping to go under the radar, but I called her out on it and made her cry*\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the \"AITA\" (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong for embarrassing their classmate, Barbara. The situation involves group work in a master's program, and the writer had a past bad experience with Barbara where she didn't contribute and took credit. Now, Barbara didn't do her part again, and the writer called her out in front of everyone, making her cry.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The writer had a previous negative experience with Barbara, which might have influenced their actions. They mention that Barbara previously didn't do her work, relied on someone else's guidance, and took credit. This time, Barbara was assigned the most important part but didn't contribute. The writer overheard Barbara saying she couldn't find anything, but let her go until the end when they publicly called her out, leading to her crying.\n\nThe key question is whether the writer's action of embarrassing Barbara was justified. On one hand, the writer felt Barbara wasn't contributing and wanted to hold her accountable, especially given past behavior. On the other hand, calling her out publicly, knowing that she had nothing, might have been cruel and unnecessary. Public humiliation can be hurtful, even if the person is at fault. The writer's intention was to force Barbara to admit she didn't do the work, but this approach could have been unkind, especially without giving her a chance to explain or address it privately first.\n\nGroup work dynamics are tricky. While accountability is important, the method of addressing it matters. Instead of embarrassing her in front of everyone, the writer might have chosen a more constructive approach, like discussing it with her privately or involving the group leader if necessary. Public shaming, even with intentions to correct behavior, can damage relationships and create a hostile environment. \n\nAlso, the writer's past experience with Barbara might have clouded their judgment. While it's valid to feel wronged before, reacting in a way that humiliates someone else might not be the best approach. It's possible that the writer's actions were more about getting back at Barbara for past actions rather than addressing the current situation objectively.\n\nIn academic settings, collaboration and mutual support are important. However, when someone isn't contributing, it's a problem that needs to be handled. The writer's approach here might have been too harsh, leading to emotional distress. Even if Barbara deserved criticism, the way it was delivered could be considered inconsiderate and harsh, hence making the writer at fault.\n"
