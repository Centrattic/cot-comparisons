In session 2 we all feedback to the rest of the group what we have found, so that afterwards everyone has a clear understanding of everything they need to know in order to address the problem. \n\nSo at the end of session 1, Barbara volunteers herself to research what is arguably the biggest / most important question.\n\nSome important backstory - last time I was in her group, me and Barbara were assigned a question to do together. I came back with 3 pages of research, referenced properly, summarised and clearly laid out in a table, and linked back to the problem. It took me a couple hours. She had emailed her student tutor and asked him our question, and he had emailed her a guidance sheet that he found online, which was sort of relevant to our question but not really. When we got together to feedback, she said to me \u201cso are we using what you did then?\u201d Taken aback I said \u201cwell no we\u2019ll use a combination, what info have you found?\u201d And she just pulled out this sheet. So the entirety of her effort had been emailing someone else to answer the question for her, and bringing that in. I was pissed because then she took credit for my table and fed it back to the group as if *we* had done it. Didn\u2019t even mention her fucking sheet as it wasn\u2019t relevant.\n\nSo back to today. When it came to feeding back, I noticed that Barbara had been extremely quiet. She had not contributed at all to the discussion, and several times the group leader said \u201cis there anybody else who has not yet fed back their questions?\u201d and she was just keeping quiet. So I just said \u201cHey Barbara, this piece of research really links to your question, what did you find?\u201d at which point she breaks down crying and said she couldn\u2019t find anything and she was really sorry for letting us all down.\n\nTruthfully, I already knew she hadn\u2019t found anything because I\u2019d overheard her saying so to another classmate earlier on.\n\nSo, AITA for embarrassing her in front of everyone? It\u2019s true that I only asked because I wanted her to have to say in front of everyone that she hadn\u2019t done any work.\n\n**TL;DR:** *Barbara did absolutely nothing in our group task last time I worked with her, and she took credit for my work. This time, Barbara chose to do the most important aspect of our group task but then didn\u2019t actually do it. She was keeping quiet hoping to go under the radar, but I called her out on it and made her cry*\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the story is at fault for embarrassing their classmate, Barbara. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The author is in a group project where they have two sessions. In the first session, they split tasks, and Barbara volunteered for the most important question. The author has past issues with Barbara where she didn't contribute, took credit for the author's work, and relied on someone else's guidance without adding her own research. Now, in the current session, Barbara didn't contribute during discussions, and the author called her out in front of everyone, leading her to cry.\n\nThe key points here are the past behavior of Barbara and the author's actions in the current situation. The author mentions that Barbara had a history of not doing her part and taking credit. This time, even though Barbara volunteered for the important task, she didn't do any work. The author noticed Barbara wasn't contributing and, knowing she hadn't done the research, confronted her in front of others. The author's intention was to make Barbara admit she didn't do the work, leading to her crying.\n\nNow, considering if the author is in the wrong. Factors to consider: Was the author justified in calling Barbara out based on her past behavior? Did the author handle the situation appropriately? Could there have been a better way to address Barbara's lack of contribution without embarrassing her?\n\nOn one hand, the author might feel justified because Barbara had a history of letting the group down. The author might think that holding her accountable is necessary for the group's success. However, publicly shaming someone, even if they've done it before, can be harsh and may not encourage future cooperation. It might also create a hostile environment, which isn't productive in a group setting. The author could have privately addressed the issue first or talked to the group leader instead of confronting Barbara publicly, which might have been a more constructive approach.\n\nAnother angle is the impact on Barbara. Making her cry in front of others is definitely hurtful. Even if she didn't do the work, the method of confronting her was unkind. It's possible that Barbara had other issues affecting her performance, which the author didn't consider. Public humiliation might not be the best way to handle someone's mistakes, especially if it's affecting their emotions negatively.\n\nSo, while Barbara's past actions were poor, the author's response might have been overly harsh. The intention was to hold her accountable, but the method used was inconsiderate. The author could have found a more respectful way to address the issue without causing emotional distress. Therefore, the author is partially at fault for the way they handled the situation, even if Barbara's actions were problematic.\n"
