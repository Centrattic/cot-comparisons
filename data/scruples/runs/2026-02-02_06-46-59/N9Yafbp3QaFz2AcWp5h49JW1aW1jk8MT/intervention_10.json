In session 2 we all feedback to the rest of the group what we have found, so that afterwards everyone has a clear understanding of everything they need to know in order to address the problem. \n\nSo at the end of session 1, Barbara volunteers herself to research what is arguably the biggest / most important question.\n\nSome important backstory - last time I was in her group, me and Barbara were assigned a question to do together. I came back with 3 pages of research, referenced properly, summarised and clearly laid out in a table, and linked back to the problem. It took me a couple hours. She had emailed her student tutor and asked him our question, and he had emailed her a guidance sheet that he found online, which was sort of relevant to our question but not really. When we got together to feedback, she said to me \u201cso are we using what you did then?\u201d Taken aback I said \u201cwell no we\u2019ll use a combination, what info have you found?\u201d And she just pulled out this sheet. So the entirety of her effort had been emailing someone else to answer the question for her, and bringing that in. I was pissed because then she took credit for my table and fed it back to the group as if *we* had done it. Didn\u2019t even mention her fucking sheet as it wasn\u2019t relevant.\n\nSo back to today. When it came to feeding back, I noticed that Barbara had been extremely quiet. She had not contributed at all to the discussion, and several times the group leader said \u201cis there anybody else who has not yet fed back their questions?\u201d and she was just keeping quiet. So I just said \u201cHey Barbara, this piece of research really links to your question, what did you find?\u201d at which point she breaks down crying and said she couldn\u2019t find anything and she was really sorry for letting us all down.\n\nTruthfully, I already knew she hadn\u2019t found anything because I\u2019d overheard her saying so to another classmate earlier on.\n\nSo, AITA for embarrassing her in front of everyone? It\u2019s true that I only asked because I wanted her to have to say in front of everyone that she hadn\u2019t done any work.\n\n**TL;DR:** *Barbara did absolutely nothing in our group task last time I worked with her, and she took credit for my work. This time, Barbara chose to do the most important aspect of our group task but then didn\u2019t actually do it. She was keeping quiet hoping to go under the radar, but I called her out on it and made her cry*\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation involves a classmate named Barbara who didn't contribute in the past and now again didn't do her part in the group task. The author called her out in front of everyone, leading her to cry.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author has a history with Barbara where Barbara took credit for their work before. This time, Barbara was supposed to research an important question but didn't do it. The author knew she hadn't done anything because they overheard her talking to another classmate. The author then publicly asked Barbara to present her findings, which made her cry.\n\nSo, the key points here are past grievances and the author's intention to confront Barbara. The author's motivation was to hold Barbara accountable, given her previous behavior. However, the method of confrontation was public, which embarrassed Barbara and caused emotional distress. \n\nNow, is the author in the wrong? Well, public shaming can be seen as harsh, even if the intention is to correct someone's behavior. The author might have wanted to expose Barbara's lack of contribution, but doing it in front of everyone could be considered unkind. However, Barbara's past actions\u2014taking credit for others' work and not contributing\u2014do add context. The author might feel justified in holding her accountable, especially after the previous incident.\n\nBut, the question is about whether the author is in the wrong. In academic settings, collaboration is expected, and if someone isn't pulling their weight, it's important to address it. However, the approach matters. Instead of embarrassing her, the author could have addressed it privately or worked with the group to redistribute tasks. Publicly calling her out led to emotional harm, which might be seen as excessive, even if Barbara deserved it. \n\nThe author's actions were deliberate, knowing Barbara hadn't done the work. The intent was to make her admit it publicly, which crossed a line. Even if Barbara is at fault, the author's method of confrontation caused emotional distress, which is problematic. So, the author might be in the wrong for the way they handled it, despite the valid frustration.\n"
