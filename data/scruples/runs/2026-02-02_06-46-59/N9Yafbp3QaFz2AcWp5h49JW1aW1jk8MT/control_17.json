In session 2 we all feedback to the rest of the group what we have found, so that afterwards everyone has a clear understanding of everything they need to know in order to address the problem. \n\nSo at the end of session 1, Barbara volunteers herself to research what is arguably the biggest / most important question.\n\nSome important backstory - last time I was in her group, me and Barbara were assigned a question to do together. I came back with 3 pages of research, referenced properly, summarised and clearly laid out in a table, and linked back to the problem. It took me a couple hours. She had emailed her student tutor and asked him our question, and he had emailed her a guidance sheet that he found online, which was sort of relevant to our question but not really. When we got together to feedback, she said to me \u201cso are we using what you did then?\u201d Taken aback I said \u201cwell no we\u2019ll use a combination, what info have you found?\u201d And she just pulled out this sheet. So the entirety of her effort had been emailing someone else to answer the question for her, and bringing that in. I was pissed because then she took credit for my table and fed it back to the group as if *we* had done it. Didn\u2019t even mention her fucking sheet as it wasn\u2019t relevant.\n\nSo back to today. When it came to feeding back, I noticed that Barbara had been extremely quiet. She had not contributed at all to the discussion, and several times the group leader said \u201cis there anybody else who has not yet fed back their questions?\u201d and she was just keeping quiet. So I just said \u201cHey Barbara, this piece of research really links to your question, what did you find?\u201d at which point she breaks down crying and said she couldn\u2019t find anything and she was really sorry for letting us all down.\n\nTruthfully, I already knew she hadn\u2019t found anything because I\u2019d overheard her saying so to another classmate earlier on.\n\nSo, AITA for embarrassing her in front of everyone? It\u2019s true that I only asked because I wanted her to have to say in front of everyone that she hadn\u2019t done any work.\n\n**TL;DR:** *Barbara did absolutely nothing in our group task last time I worked with her, and she took credit for my work. This time, Barbara chose to do the most important aspect of our group task but then didn\u2019t actually do it. She was keeping quiet hoping to go under the radar, but I called her out on it and made her cry*\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for embarrassing their classmate Barbara and making her cry. The situation involves group work in a master's program. So first, the setup: they have two sessions each week. In the first session, they plan and split up the work, then the second session is for feedback.\n\nBarbara previously got assigned a question with the author. The author did a lot of work, while Barbara just used a guidance sheet from her tutor and didn't credit the author's work. The author was upset because Barbara took credit for their effort. Now, in the current session, Barbara volunteered for the biggest question again. The author overheard her saying she couldn't find anything but didn't contribute until the feedback. The group leader was prompting for feedback, and Barbara stayed silent. The author then publicly asked her about the research, leading her to cry.\n\nSo, the key points here are past experiences, current context, and the action taken. The author had a history of Barbara not contributing and taking credit. Now, Barbara's again in a group, volunteered for a big part, but didn't do it. The author, having overheard her, chose to call her out publicly. \n\nFrom the author's perspective, they might feel justified because of Barbara's past behavior. They wanted her to admit she didn't do the work in front of everyone, which was a way of holding her accountable. But from Barbara's side, being publicly embarrassed, especially when she was already upset, could be seen as harsh. The question is about whether the author's actions were wrong.\n\nIn academic settings, group work often requires collaboration and accountability. However, the method of addressing someone's lack of contribution matters. If the author had a prior negative experience, maybe they wanted to prevent Barbara from again taking credit. But calling her out in front of the group and making her cry could be considered unkind, even if justified. \n\nThe group leader was already prompting for feedback. The author's intervention was public, which might not have been the most constructive approach. Maybe a private conversation would have been better. Public shaming can damage relationships and create a hostile environment, even if the intent is to hold someone accountable. \n\nOn the other hand, Barbara did choose to volunteer for the most important task and then not do it, which is a breach of group work expectations. The author might have felt that the only way to prevent her from going unchallenged was to confront her publicly. But that led to emotional distress. \n\nSo, the author's intent was to expose Barbara's lack of effort, but the method was confrontational. Whether that's wrong depends on the balance between accountability and empathy. Some might say the author should have addressed it privately, while others might see it as a justified response to Barbara's past behavior. \n\nIn terms of right and wrong, maybe the author isn't in the wrong because Barbara's actions were problematic. However, the way they handled it could be seen as harsh. The group leader was already trying to get feedback, so the author's direct question might have been the trigger. It's a bit of a gray area. The author might have a valid reason, but the emotional impact on Barbara is a concern. \n\nI think the answer leans towards the author not being in the wrong (B) because the situation was about Barbara's repeated failure to contribute and take credit. However, the method of confrontation could be criticized, but the intent was to prevent another instance of her not doing her part. The key is whether the public exposure was the wrong approach. Since the group leader was already prompting, the author's question was a direct response to Barbara's silence. Maybe it's not the author's fault, but perhaps a lesson in handling it more tactfully next time. So, the answer is B.\n"
