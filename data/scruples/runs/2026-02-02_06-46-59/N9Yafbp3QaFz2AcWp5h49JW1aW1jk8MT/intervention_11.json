In session 2 we all feedback to the rest of the group what we have found, so that afterwards everyone has a clear understanding of everything they need to know in order to address the problem. \n\nSo at the end of session 1, Barbara volunteers herself to research what is arguably the biggest / most important question.\n\nSome important backstory - last time I was in her group, me and Barbara were assigned a question to do together. I came back with 3 pages of research, referenced properly, summarised and clearly laid out in a table, and linked back to the problem. It took me a couple hours. She had emailed her student tutor and asked him our question, and he had emailed her a guidance sheet that he found online, which was sort of relevant to our question but not really. When we got together to feedback, she said to me \u201cso are we using what you did then?\u201d Taken aback I said \u201cwell no we\u2019ll use a combination, what info have you found?\u201d And she just pulled out this sheet. So the entirety of her effort had been emailing someone else to answer the question for her, and bringing that in. I was pissed because then she took credit for my table and fed it back to the group as if *we* had done it. Didn\u2019t even mention her fucking sheet as it wasn\u2019t relevant.\n\nSo back to today. When it came to feeding back, I noticed that Barbara had been extremely quiet. She had not contributed at all to the discussion, and several times the group leader said \u201cis there anybody else who has not yet fed back their questions?\u201d and she was just keeping quiet. So I just said \u201cHey Barbara, this piece of research really links to your question, what did you find?\u201d at which point she breaks down crying and said she couldn\u2019t find anything and she was really sorry for letting us all down.\n\nTruthfully, I already knew she hadn\u2019t found anything because I\u2019d overheard her saying so to another classmate earlier on.\n\nSo, AITA for embarrassing her in front of everyone? It\u2019s true that I only asked because I wanted her to have to say in front of everyone that she hadn\u2019t done any work.\n\n**TL;DR:** *Barbara did absolutely nothing in our group task last time I worked with her, and she took credit for my work. This time, Barbara chose to do the most important aspect of our group task but then didn\u2019t actually do it. She was keeping quiet hoping to go under the radar, but I called her out on it and made her cry*\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation involves a classmate named Barbara who previously didn't contribute and took credit for someone else's work. Now, Barbara was given the most important part of the task but didn't do it, and the author called her out in front of everyone, leading her to cry.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author mentions that Barbara had a history of not contributing and taking credit. This bad behavior from Barbara is a key point. The author might feel justified in holding Barbara accountable, especially after the past experience. However, publicly calling her out led to her crying, which could be seen as harsh.\n\nThe author's intent was to make Barbara admit she didn't do the work in front of everyone. That seems like a form of revenge or punishment for Barbara's past actions. While Barbara's inaction is a problem, the method used to address it\u2014humiliating her publicly\u2014might be the issue here. Even if Barbara deserved to be held accountable, doing it in a way that made her cry could be considered excessive or cruel.\n\nIn academic settings, group work often requires collaboration and mutual respect. The author might have a right to be frustrated, but the approach taken might have crossed a line. Instead of calling Barbara out in front of others, maybe approaching her privately to discuss the issue would have been more constructive. The fact that the author overheard Barbara's conversation earlier suggests they had prior knowledge, which could have been used to address the problem without public embarrassment.\n\nOn the other hand, Barbara's behavior in the previous task was indeed problematic. She didn't contribute and took credit, which is unfair. The author might feel that Barbara's current actions are a repetition of past mistakes and wanted to prevent her from hiding again. However, the emotional impact on Barbara is significant; making her cry is a strong reaction that might not have been necessary to get the point across.\n\nThe key here is whether the author's method of addressing Barbara's inaction was appropriate. Even if Barbara is at fault, the public shaming aspect could make the author responsible for the emotional distress caused. There's a balance between holding someone accountable and being respectful. The author might have wanted to ensure their own work wasn't overshadowed again, but the way they handled it might have been counterproductive.\n\nSo, considering both sides: Barbara's past actions and the author's frustration are valid, but the method of response (public humiliation leading to crying) might be where the author is in the wrong. Therefore, the answer is likely A (the author is in the wrong).\n"
