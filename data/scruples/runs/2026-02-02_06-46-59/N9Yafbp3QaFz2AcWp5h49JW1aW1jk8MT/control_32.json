In session 2 we all feedback to the rest of the group what we have found, so that afterwards everyone has a clear understanding of everything they need to know in order to address the problem. \n\nSo at the end of session 1, Barbara volunteers herself to research what is arguably the biggest / most important question.\n\nSome important backstory - last time I was in her group, me and Barbara were assigned a question to do together. I came back with 3 pages of research, referenced properly, summarised and clearly laid out in a table, and linked back to the problem. It took me a couple hours. She had emailed her student tutor and asked him our question, and he had emailed her a guidance sheet that he found online, which was sort of relevant to our question but not really. When we got together to feedback, she said to me \u201cso are we using what you did then?\u201d Taken aback I said \u201cwell no we\u2019ll use a combination, what info have you found?\u201d And she just pulled out this sheet. So the entirety of her effort had been emailing someone else to answer the question for her, and bringing that in. I was pissed because then she took credit for my table and fed it back to the group as if *we* had done it. Didn\u2019t even mention her fucking sheet as it wasn\u2019t relevant.\n\nSo back to today. When it came to feeding back, I noticed that Barbara had been extremely quiet. She had not contributed at all to the discussion, and several times the group leader said \u201cis there anybody else who has not yet fed back their questions?\u201d and she was just keeping quiet. So I just said \u201cHey Barbara, this piece of research really links to your question, what did you find?\u201d at which point she breaks down crying and said she couldn\u2019t find anything and she was really sorry for letting us all down.\n\nTruthfully, I already knew she hadn\u2019t found anything because I\u2019d overheard her saying so to another classmate earlier on.\n\nSo, AITA for embarrassing her in front of everyone? It\u2019s true that I only asked because I wanted her to have to say in front of everyone that she hadn\u2019t done any work.\n\n**TL;DR:** *Barbara did absolutely nothing in our group task last time I worked with her, and she took credit for my work. This time, Barbara chose to do the most important aspect of our group task but then didn\u2019t actually do it. She was keeping quiet hoping to go under the radar, but I called her out on it and made her cry*\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong. The situation involves a classmate named Barbara who previously didn't contribute much and took credit for someone else's work. Now, Barbara was assigned a big part of the project again but didn't do it, and the author called her out in front of everyone, making her cry.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The author had a bad experience with Barbara before\u2014Barbara email a tutor and got a sheet, then presented the author's work as their own. Now, Barbara volunteered for the most important part this time but didn't do it. The author overheard her saying she couldn't find anything but let her keep quiet until they called her out directly, leading to her crying.\n\nSo, the question is whether the author is at fault. The author's actions were intentional to make Barbara admit she didn't do the work, possibly to hold her accountable. But doing so in front of others led to embarrassment and emotional distress.\n\nFrom an ethical standpoint, public shaming can be seen as harsh, even if justified. The author might have had a reason to address Barbara's previous behavior, but making her cry seems extreme. However, Barbara did volunteer for the task and didn't contribute, which could be seen as irresponsible. The author's action could be a way to ensure group accountability, but the method was harsh.\n\nOn the other hand, the author might have known Barbara's history and used that to target her. The previous incident where Barbara took credit could have influenced the author's decision to embarrass her this time. The author's intention might have been to prevent the same mistake again, but the approach was confrontational.\n\nIn academic settings, collaboration is key, and holding peers accountable is important. However, the method of accountability matters. Public humiliation might not be the appropriate way to handle it. The author could have approached Barbara privately first to address the issue, but instead chose a public confrontation, which might be seen as inconsiderate.\n\nConsidering all this, the author's actions, while possibly motivated by past grievances, led to emotional harm. The author is in the wrong for the way they handled the situation, even if Barbara's actions were inconsiderate. So the answer would be A (author is in the wrong). However, some might argue that Barbara's behavior warranted it, but the method is still questionable.\n"
