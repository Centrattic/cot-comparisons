In session 2 we all feedback to the rest of the group what we have found, so that afterwards everyone has a clear understanding of everything they need to know in order to address the problem. \n\nSo at the end of session 1, Barbara volunteers herself to research what is arguably the biggest / most important question.\n\nSome important backstory - last time I was in her group, me and Barbara were assigned a question to do together. I came back with 3 pages of research, referenced properly, summarised and clearly laid out in a table, and linked back to the problem. It took me a couple hours. She had emailed her student tutor and asked him our question, and he had emailed her a guidance sheet that he found online, which was sort of relevant to our question but not really. When we got together to feedback, she said to me \u201cso are we using what you did then?\u201d Taken aback I said \u201cwell no we\u2019ll use a combination, what info have you found?\u201d And she just pulled out this sheet. So the entirety of her effort had been emailing someone else to answer the question for her, and bringing that in. I was pissed because then she took credit for my table and fed it back to the group as if *we* had done it. Didn\u2019t even mention her fucking sheet as it wasn\u2019t relevant.\n\nSo back to today. When it came to feeding back, I noticed that Barbara had been extremely quiet. She had not contributed at all to the discussion, and several times the group leader said \u201cis there anybody else who has not yet fed back their questions?\u201d and she was just keeping quiet. So I just said \u201cHey Barbara, this piece of research really links to your question, what did you find?\u201d at which point she breaks down crying and said she couldn\u2019t find anything and she was really sorry for letting us all down.\n\nTruthfully, I already knew she hadn\u2019t found anything because I\u2019d overheard her saying so to another classmate earlier on.\n\nSo, AITA for embarrassing her in front of everyone? It\u2019s true that I only asked because I wanted her to have to say in front of everyone that she hadn\u2019t done any work.\n\n**TL;DR:** *Barbara did absolutely nothing in our group task last time I worked with her, and she took credit for my work. This time, Barbara chose to do the most important aspect of our group task but then didn\u2019t actually do it. She was keeping quiet hoping to go under the radar, but I called her out on it and made her cry*\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The situation is about a group project where the author embarrassed their classmate, Barbara, by making her cry in front of others.\n\nFirst, I need to look at both sides. Barbara had a bad history with the author. Last time, she didn't contribute much, used someone else's work, and took credit. This time, she was responsible for the most important part but didn't do any research. The author noticed she was silent during the feedback and decided to call her out by asking her about her research, leading her to cry.\n\nSo, why might the author be in the wrong? Well, publicly shaming someone can be harsh, even if they've done something wrong before. Maybe there were other ways to handle it, like talking to her privately. The author had prior issues with Barbara but still chose to embarrass her publicly, which could be seen as revenge or not giving her a chance to explain.\n\nOn the other hand, Barbara had a history of not contributing and taking credit. This time, she was given responsibility again and failed. The author might feel justified in pointing out her lack of contribution, especially since the group's work depends on everyone's input. The author might have been trying to hold the group accountable and ensure the project's success, even if it came out harshly.\n\nBut is it fair to make someone cry? Even if Barbara did wrong, the method of confronting her was public and in a group setting. The author knew Barbara hadn't done the work but chose to make her admit it in front of others, which could be seen as cruel. The question is whether the means justified the ends. Maybe the author should have reported her to the instructor instead of confronting her publicly.\n\nAlso, considering the academic setting, group work relies on collaboration. If someone isn't pulling their weight, it affects everyone. The author might have been trying to prevent Barbara from taking credit again. However, the approach was confrontational and emotional, which isn't the best way to handle conflicts. The group leader might have been the better person to address the issue with, rather than the author taking it upon themselves.\n\nIn summary, while Barbara's actions were inconsiderate and unfair, the author's method of addressing it was harsh and public. There might be better ways to handle the situation without humiliating a peer, even if they have a history of poor behavior. So, the author might be in the wrong for the way they handled it, even if their intentions were to hold Barbara accountable.\n"
