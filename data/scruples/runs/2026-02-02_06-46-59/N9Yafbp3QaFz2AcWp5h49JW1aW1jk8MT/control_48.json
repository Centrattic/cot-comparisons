In session 2 we all feedback to the rest of the group what we have found, so that afterwards everyone has a clear understanding of everything they need to know in order to address the problem. \n\nSo at the end of session 1, Barbara volunteers herself to research what is arguably the biggest / most important question.\n\nSome important backstory - last time I was in her group, me and Barbara were assigned a question to do together. I came back with 3 pages of research, referenced properly, summarised and clearly laid out in a table, and linked back to the problem. It took me a couple hours. She had emailed her student tutor and asked him our question, and he had emailed her a guidance sheet that he found online, which was sort of relevant to our question but not really. When we got together to feedback, she said to me \u201cso are we using what you did then?\u201d Taken aback I said \u201cwell no we\u2019ll use a combination, what info have you found?\u201d And she just pulled out this sheet. So the entirety of her effort had been emailing someone else to answer the question for her, and bringing that in. I was pissed because then she took credit for my table and fed it back to the group as if *we* had done it. Didn\u2019t even mention her fucking sheet as it wasn\u2019t relevant.\n\nSo back to today. When it came to feeding back, I noticed that Barbara had been extremely quiet. She had not contributed at all to the discussion, and several times the group leader said \u201cis there anybody else who has not yet fed back their questions?\u201d and she was just keeping quiet. So I just said \u201cHey Barbara, this piece of research really links to your question, what did you find?\u201d at which point she breaks down crying and said she couldn\u2019t find anything and she was really sorry for letting us all down.\n\nTruthfully, I already knew she hadn\u2019t found anything because I\u2019d overheard her saying so to another classmate earlier on.\n\nSo, AITA for embarrassing her in front of everyone? It\u2019s true that I only asked because I wanted her to have to say in front of everyone that she hadn\u2019t done any work.\n\n**TL;DR:** *Barbara did absolutely nothing in our group task last time I worked with her, and she took credit for my work. This time, Barbara chose to do the most important aspect of our group task but then didn\u2019t actually do it. She was keeping quiet hoping to go under the radar, but I called her out on it and made her cry*\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the \"AITA\" post is in the wrong. The situation involves a classmate named Barbara who previously didn't contribute, took credit for someone else's work, and now, in a new group task, Barbara didn't do her part again. The author called her out in front of the group, leading her to cry.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze the context. Barbara had a history of not contributing. Last time, she took credit for the author's work. Now she volunteered for a big part but didn't do it. The author noticed she wasn't participating, overheard her saying she found nothing, and then asked her directly in front of everyone, causing her to break down.\n\nThe key points here are intent and consequences. The author's motivation was to make Barbara admit she didn't do the work. But by doing so in public, they embarrassed her, leading to tears. Is that acceptable?\n\nOn one hand, Barbara did nothing and the author is frustrated. On the other, public shaming can be harmful. The author might have a valid grievance, but the method of addressing it might be inappropriate. The question is whether the author overstepped despite having a reason.\n\nAlso, considering the academic setting, there might be protocols for handling such issues. Maybe the author should have addressed it privately first. Publicly calling out someone, even if justified, might not be the best approach. However, the author's past experience with Barbara taking credit might have influenced their decision to act that way.\n\nPossible factors: Barbara's past behavior vs. the author's response. The author's intention was to hold Barbara accountable, but the method caused emotional distress. The group leader was already prompting Barbara, so maybe the author's intervention wasn't necessary.\n\nIn terms of right or wrong, the author's actions were a reaction to Barbara's poor conduct. But the way they did it\u2014intentionally making her say she didn't do the work in front of others\u2014could be seen as cruel. It's a judgment call between accountability and empathy.\n\nI think the answer hinges on whether the public shaming was the right approach. Even if Barbara deserved it, the author's method might be considered wrong. So, the answer might be A (the author is in the wrong) because they chose an embarrassing method instead of a more constructive approach.\n"
