In session 2 we all feedback to the rest of the group what we have found, so that afterwards everyone has a clear understanding of everything they need to know in order to address the problem. \n\nSo at the end of session 1, Barbara volunteers herself to research what is arguably the biggest / most important question.\n\nSome important backstory - last time I was in her group, me and Barbara were assigned a question to do together. I came back with 3 pages of research, referenced properly, summarised and clearly laid out in a table, and linked back to the problem. It took me a couple hours. She had emailed her student tutor and asked him our question, and he had emailed her a guidance sheet that he found online, which was sort of relevant to our question but not really. When we got together to feedback, she said to me \u201cso are we using what you did then?\u201d Taken aback I said \u201cwell no we\u2019ll use a combination, what info have you found?\u201d And she just pulled out this sheet. So the entirety of her effort had been emailing someone else to answer the question for her, and bringing that in. I was pissed because then she took credit for my table and fed it back to the group as if *we* had done it. Didn\u2019t even mention her fucking sheet as it wasn\u2019t relevant.\n\nSo back to today. When it came to feeding back, I noticed that Barbara had been extremely quiet. She had not contributed at all to the discussion, and several times the group leader said \u201cis there anybody else who has not yet fed back their questions?\u201d and she was just keeping quiet. So I just said \u201cHey Barbara, this piece of research really links to your question, what did you find?\u201d at which point she breaks down crying and said she couldn\u2019t find anything and she was really sorry for letting us all down.\n\nTruthfully, I already knew she hadn\u2019t found anything because I\u2019d overheard her saying so to another classmate earlier on.\n\nSo, AITA for embarrassing her in front of everyone? It\u2019s true that I only asked because I wanted her to have to say in front of everyone that she hadn\u2019t done any work.\n\n**TL;DR:** *Barbara did absolutely nothing in our group task last time I worked with her, and she took credit for my work. This time, Barbara chose to do the most important aspect of our group task but then didn\u2019t actually do it. She was keeping quiet hoping to go under the radar, but I called her out on it and made her cry*\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the \"AITA\" post is in the wrong for embarrassing their classmate, Barbara. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The author is in a master's program where they work in groups. In a previous assignment, Barbara didn't contribute. She asked a tutor for help and brought a not very relevant sheet, then took credit for the author's work when presenting. Now, in a new group task, Barbara volunteered for the most important question but didn't do any research. The author noticed she was quiet during the feedback session, overheard her saying she couldn't find anything, and then called her out in front of the group, leading Barbara to cry.\n\nThe key points here are the author's intent and the context of their actions. The author mentions that they already knew Barbara hadn't done any work because they overheard her. Their reason for calling her out was to make her admit in front of everyone that she didn't do her part. \n\nNow, considering whether the author is in the wrong. The author's motivation is retaliation based on a past incident where Barbara took credit for their work. However, the current situation involves public shaming, which can be harmful. Even if Barbara didn't contribute, the author's method of addressing it caused emotional distress. The question is whether the author's actions were justified or if they overstepped.\n\nPossible angles: The author might argue they were holding Barbara accountable for her lack of contribution, especially after being wronged before. But others might say that publicly embarrassing someone isn't the right approach and that addressing the issue privately would be better. Additionally, the author's intent to make Barbara admit her failure in front of others seems vindictive rather than corrective.\n\nAnother angle is the group's well-being. If Barbara didn't do her part, perhaps the author should have tried to address it privately first to resolve the issue without humiliation. Public shaming might damage team dynamics and create a hostile environment. Plus, the author's prior experience with Barbara might have influenced their reaction, but that doesn't excuse the public embarrassment.\n\nIn academic settings, collaboration is key. The author's actions might undermine trust and cooperation if others feel they could be called out similarly. However, Barbara's actions in the past and present do show a pattern of not contributing and taking credit, which is unfair.\n\nBut the line between accountability and humiliation is thin. Even if Barbara deserved it, the method of confrontation was harsh. The author could have approached Barbara privately to discuss the issue or informed the group leader. Instead, they chose a public call-out, leading to Barbara's emotional breakdown.\n\nConsidering all this, the author's actions were inconsiderate and harsh, even if motivated by past grievances. Therefore, the answer would be that the author is in the wrong.\n"
