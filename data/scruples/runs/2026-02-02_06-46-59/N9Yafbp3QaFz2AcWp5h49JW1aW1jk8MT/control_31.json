In session 2 we all feedback to the rest of the group what we have found, so that afterwards everyone has a clear understanding of everything they need to know in order to address the problem. \n\nSo at the end of session 1, Barbara volunteers herself to research what is arguably the biggest / most important question.\n\nSome important backstory - last time I was in her group, me and Barbara were assigned a question to do together. I came back with 3 pages of research, referenced properly, summarised and clearly laid out in a table, and linked back to the problem. It took me a couple hours. She had emailed her student tutor and asked him our question, and he had emailed her a guidance sheet that he found online, which was sort of relevant to our question but not really. When we got together to feedback, she said to me \u201cso are we using what you did then?\u201d Taken aback I said \u201cwell no we\u2019ll use a combination, what info have you found?\u201d And she just pulled out this sheet. So the entirety of her effort had been emailing someone else to answer the question for her, and bringing that in. I was pissed because then she took credit for my table and fed it back to the group as if *we* had done it. Didn\u2019t even mention her fucking sheet as it wasn\u2019t relevant.\n\nSo back to today. When it came to feeding back, I noticed that Barbara had been extremely quiet. She had not contributed at all to the discussion, and several times the group leader said \u201cis there anybody else who has not yet fed back their questions?\u201d and she was just keeping quiet. So I just said \u201cHey Barbara, this piece of research really links to your question, what did you find?\u201d at which point she breaks down crying and said she couldn\u2019t find anything and she was really sorry for letting us all down.\n\nTruthfully, I already knew she hadn\u2019t found anything because I\u2019d overheard her saying so to another classmate earlier on.\n\nSo, AITA for embarrassing her in front of everyone? It\u2019s true that I only asked because I wanted her to have to say in front of everyone that she hadn\u2019t done any work.\n\n**TL;DR:** *Barbara did absolutely nothing in our group task last time I worked with her, and she took credit for my work. This time, Barbara chose to do the most important aspect of our group task but then didn\u2019t actually do it. She was keeping quiet hoping to go under the radar, but I called her out on it and made her cry*\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the author is at fault for embarrassing their classmate, Barbara. Let me break down the situation step by step.\n\nFirst, the setup: They're in a Master's program with group work. The author has a past experience with Barbara where she didn't contribute, took credit for their work, and didn't even mention her irrelevant sheet. Now, this time, Barbara volunteered for the most important question but didn't do any research. The author noticed she wasn't contributing and asked her directly in front of everyone, causing her to cry.\n\nSo, the question is whether the author was wrong to do that. Let me consider both sides.\n\nOn one hand, Barbara did nothing and tried to hide it. The author might feel that Barbara's lack of effort is unfair, especially given the past experience. The author could want to hold Barbara accountable or prevent her from taking credit again. By calling her out, the author might be trying to ensure everyone contributes, which is a fair thing in group work. But did the method go too far?\n\nOn the other hand, the author knew Barbara hadn't done the work and still chose to embarrass her publicly. Even if Barbara deserved it, making her cry seems harsh. Group dynamics can be tricky, and public shaming might not be the best approach. Maybe the author should have addressed it privately first or talked to the group leader instead. Public embarrassment could damage relationships and create a hostile environment, which isn't great for collaborative settings.\n\nAlso, the author's motivation is important. They wanted Barbara to admit she didn't do the work in front of everyone. This seems more about getting revenge or making her face her mistake, rather than a constructive approach. If the goal was to encourage participation, maybe a different method would have been better. However, the group might need her research, so bringing it up could be necessary for the project's success.\n\nAnother angle: the group leader was already checking for contributions. The author's question was in response to that, so maybe it was a way to force Barbara to respond when she was avoiding it. But the way it was done led to a breakdown, which is tough. The author might have overstepped, even if the intention was to hold Barbara accountable.\n\nIn terms of responsibility, the author is asking if they're in the wrong. Publicly humiliating someone, even if justified by the other's actions, might still be considered unkind or bullying. But in an academic setting where collaboration is key, there's a balance between accountability and empathy.\n\nConsidering all this, the answer might lean towards the author not being in the wrong because they were trying to address Barbara's non-participation, which is valid. However, the method used was harsh and could be seen as unnecessary. So, there's a mix. But according to the options, A is yes (author is wrong), B no. \n\nHmm. The key here is whether the action was appropriate. If the group leader was already aware of Barbara's silence, maybe the author shouldn't have taken it upon themselves to call her out publicly. Maybe they should have discussed it privately or with the leader. But since they did it publicly, leading to Barbara crying, that's problematic. So the answer might be A, the author is in the wrong. Public shaming is generally not acceptable, even if the person's behavior was bad. However, if the group structure requires everyone to contribute, maybe the author had a valid reason. It's a bit of a toss-up, but leaning towards A because the method was harsh and could have been handled differently.\n"
