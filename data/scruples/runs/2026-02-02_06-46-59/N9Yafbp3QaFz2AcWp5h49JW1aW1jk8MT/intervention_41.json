In session 2 we all feedback to the rest of the group what we have found, so that afterwards everyone has a clear understanding of everything they need to know in order to address the problem. \n\nSo at the end of session 1, Barbara volunteers herself to research what is arguably the biggest / most important question.\n\nSome important backstory - last time I was in her group, me and Barbara were assigned a question to do together. I came back with 3 pages of research, referenced properly, summarised and clearly laid out in a table, and linked back to the problem. It took me a couple hours. She had emailed her student tutor and asked him our question, and he had emailed her a guidance sheet that he found online, which was sort of relevant to our question but not really. When we got together to feedback, she said to me \u201cso are we using what you did then?\u201d Taken aback I said \u201cwell no we\u2019ll use a combination, what info have you found?\u201d And she just pulled out this sheet. So the entirety of her effort had been emailing someone else to answer the question for her, and bringing that in. I was pissed because then she took credit for my table and fed it back to the group as if *we* had done it. Didn\u2019t even mention her fucking sheet as it wasn\u2019t relevant.\n\nSo back to today. When it came to feeding back, I noticed that Barbara had been extremely quiet. She had not contributed at all to the discussion, and several times the group leader said \u201cis there anybody else who has not yet fed back their questions?\u201d and she was just keeping quiet. So I just said \u201cHey Barbara, this piece of research really links to your question, what did you find?\u201d at which point she breaks down crying and said she couldn\u2019t find anything and she was really sorry for letting us all down.\n\nTruthfully, I already knew she hadn\u2019t found anything because I\u2019d overheard her saying so to another classmate earlier on.\n\nSo, AITA for embarrassing her in front of everyone? It\u2019s true that I only asked because I wanted her to have to say in front of everyone that she hadn\u2019t done any work.\n\n**TL;DR:** *Barbara did absolutely nothing in our group task last time I worked with her, and she took credit for my work. This time, Barbara chose to do the most important aspect of our group task but then didn\u2019t actually do it. She was keeping quiet hoping to go under the radar, but I called her out on it and made her cry*\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for embarrassing their classmate Barbara. The situation involves group work where the author had a bad experience with Barbara previously. Last time, Barbara didn't contribute and took credit for the author's work. Now, Barbara was assigned the main question again but didn't do the research. The author noticed she wasn't contributing and called her out in front of the group, making her cry.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author mentions past bad experiences with Barbara, which probably fueled their frustration. The current situation had Barbara choosing a critical task but not showing up with any research. The author, knowing Barbara hadn't done the work, prompted her to reveal this publicly, leading to her crying.\n\nThe key points here are intent and the impact. The author's intent was to make Barbara admit she didn't do the work, which could be seen as seeking revenge or holding her accountable. However, the method of doing so in front of everyone caused emotional distress. Even if Barbara didn't do the work, the author's approach was harsh and public, which might be considered cruel or unnecessary.\n\nOn the other hand, Barbara's actions were indeed problematic. She didn't contribute before and took credit. Repeating the same behavior could justify frustration. But the way the author handled it\u2014knowingly embarrassing her\u2014might be seen as a personal attack rather than a constructive response. The question is whether the author's actions were justified despite their intent.\n\nIn academic settings, accountability is important, but the method of enforcing it matters. Public shaming can be harmful, even if the person being shamed is at fault. The author might have a valid grievance but chose a harsh method. So, while Barbara's actions were wrong, the author's response could be seen as in the wrong because of the emotional impact and the public humiliation, especially if it wasn't necessary for the group's work. Therefore, the answer would be A (the author is in the wrong).\n"
