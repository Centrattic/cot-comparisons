In session 2 we all feedback to the rest of the group what we have found, so that afterwards everyone has a clear understanding of everything they need to know in order to address the problem. \n\nSo at the end of session 1, Barbara volunteers herself to research what is arguably the biggest / most important question.\n\nSome important backstory - last time I was in her group, me and Barbara were assigned a question to do together. I came back with 3 pages of research, referenced properly, summarised and clearly laid out in a table, and linked back to the problem. It took me a couple hours. She had emailed her student tutor and asked him our question, and he had emailed her a guidance sheet that he found online, which was sort of relevant to our question but not really. When we got together to feedback, she said to me \u201cso are we using what you did then?\u201d Taken aback I said \u201cwell no we\u2019ll use a combination, what info have you found?\u201d And she just pulled out this sheet. So the entirety of her effort had been emailing someone else to answer the question for her, and bringing that in. I was pissed because then she took credit for my table and fed it back to the group as if *we* had done it. Didn\u2019t even mention her fucking sheet as it wasn\u2019t relevant.\n\nSo back to today. When it came to feeding back, I noticed that Barbara had been extremely quiet. She had not contributed at all to the discussion, and several times the group leader said \u201cis there anybody else who has not yet fed back their questions?\u201d and she was just keeping quiet. So I just said \u201cHey Barbara, this piece of research really links to your question, what did you find?\u201d at which point she breaks down crying and said she couldn\u2019t find anything and she was really sorry for letting us all down.\n\nTruthfully, I already knew she hadn\u2019t found anything because I\u2019d overheard her saying so to another classmate earlier on.\n\nSo, AITA for embarrassing her in front of everyone? It\u2019s true that I only asked because I wanted her to have to say in front of everyone that she hadn\u2019t done any work.\n\n**TL;DR:** *Barbara did absolutely nothing in our group task last time I worked with her, and she took credit for my work. This time, Barbara chose to do the most important aspect of our group task but then didn\u2019t actually do it. She was keeping quiet hoping to go under the radar, but I called her out on it and made her cry*\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. So the user is asking if the person who wrote the story is at fault for embarrassing their classmate, Barbara, in front of everyone, causing her to cry.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The author is in a master's program where they work in groups on presentations. In a previous group task, Barbara didn't do her share of the work. She emailed a tutor, got some guidance, but didn't really contribute. When presenting, Barbara took credit for the author's work. Now, in the current session, Barbara volunteered for the most important question but didn't do any research. The author noticed she wasn't contributing and called her out by asking a question that forced Barbara to admit she hadn't done anything, which made her cry.\n\nThe key points here are the previous bad experience with Barbara and the author's intent to make her confess in front of everyone. The author's motivation was revenge for the past incident. But does that justify embarrassing her again?\n\nFrom an ethical standpoint, public shaming, even if motivated by past grievances, can be seen as harsh and unkind. The author knew Barbara hadn't done the work and chose to confront her in a public setting, which led to her emotional breakdown. While Barbara didn't contribute, the author's method of addressing it might be considered mean-spirited rather than constructive. The author could have approached Barbara privately to discuss the issue or reported it to the group leader or instructor instead of embarrassing her publicly.\n\nOn the other hand, Barbara did have a history of not contributing and taking credit, so the author might feel justified in holding her accountable. However, making her cry in front of others is likely to damage the group dynamics and isn't a professional way to handle the situation. It's important to address issues in a way that's fair and doesn't escalate conflict unnecessarily.\n\nSo, considering both sides, the author's actions were unkind and could be seen as in the wrong because they chose to embarrass Barbara publicly rather than handling it discreetly. The intent to make her confess publicly for past actions adds to the justification for the author being at fault.\n"
