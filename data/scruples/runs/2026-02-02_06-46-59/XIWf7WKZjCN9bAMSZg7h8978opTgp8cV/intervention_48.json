Let's just jump to the point; I won't date girls who aren't virgins. Every time I've been interested in or flirting with a girl and she mentions not being a virgin I lose all interest in her, and keep my distance. I just do, literally 0% interest if they've had sex before. I don't block them or get mad or anything, I'm totally up for having them as buddies or whatever, but a fair few girls who I've rejected for this reason have gotten really pissed and said I'm \"slutshaming\" and that I'm sexist and controlling and shit. \n\nAre they right? I don't have any bad feelings towards them, it's just that any romantic interest sort of evaporates if they're not virgins, or have had several exes or whatever. I don't want to deal with them after that tbh\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so the user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong. Let's break down the situation. The person is a 18-year-old guy who refuses to date girls who aren't virgins. He says that when a girl mentions not being a virgin, he loses all romantic interest, but he's still okay being friends. The girls he's rejected are upset, calling him sexist, controlling, and slut-shaming. The question is whether he's in the wrong.\n\nFirst, I need to consider societal norms and values. In many modern societies, there's a strong emphasis on consent and equality in relationships. Preferring someone based on their sexual history could be seen as discriminatory. Virginity is a personal choice and doesn't indicate anything about a person's worth or suitability for a relationship. By rejecting someone based on that, he's imposing his standards onto others, which might be considered disrespectful.\n\nThen there's the aspect of slut-shaming. The term refers to shaming someone for their sexual activity, but in this case, the author is making a judgment based on others' past. Even though he doesn't express anger or hostility, his preference is still a form of judgment. The fact that he's using it as a deal-breaker for romantic interest might be seen as controlling because it's dictating his potential partners' behavior.\n\nOn the other hand, the author claims there's no ill intent and that he's not being hostile. He's just stating his preference. However, preferences that contribute to harmful stereotypes or discrimination are generally frowned upon. The key here is that while personal preferences in relationships can be subjective, when they lead to shaming or devaluing others, it crosses into problematic territory.\n\nAlso, considering the age of the author, 18 is a time when people are still developing their values. However, the issue isn't about his age but about the validity of his preference. The societal shift towards accepting diverse experiences and rejecting outdated norms might mean that his stance is out of step with current values, even if it's his personal choice.\n\nAnother angle is the concept of respect in relationships. Mutual respect involves accepting each other's pasts without judgment. By rejecting someone based on their sexual history, he's not respecting their autonomy and experiences. It's similar to how some people might have issues with a partner's past relationships, but in this case, it's specifically about virginity, which is more personal and can be more sensitive.\n\nThe girls' reactions are valid because they feel shamed. Even if the author isn't doing it maliciously, the impact is still there. The term \"slut-shaming\" applies when someone judges others for their sexual activity, and the author's actions fit that definition. Additionally, labeling someone as sexist and controlling could be because the author is setting a standard that limits women's choices, implying that their worth is tied to their sexual history.\n\nIn conclusion, while the author's preference is his to have, the way it's implemented leads to judgment and discrimination, which are considered wrong in contemporary standards. The girls are justified in feeling upset because their experiences are being devalued. Therefore, the author is in the wrong.\n"
