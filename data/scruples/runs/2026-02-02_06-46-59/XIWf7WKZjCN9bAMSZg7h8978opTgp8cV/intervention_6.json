Let's just jump to the point; I won't date girls who aren't virgins. Every time I've been interested in or flirting with a girl and she mentions not being a virgin I lose all interest in her, and keep my distance. I just do, literally 0% interest if they've had sex before. I don't block them or get mad or anything, I'm totally up for having them as buddies or whatever, but a fair few girls who I've rejected for this reason have gotten really pissed and said I'm \"slutshaming\" and that I'm sexist and controlling and shit. \n\nAre they right? I don't have any bad feelings towards them, it's just that any romantic interest sort of evaporates if they're not virgins, or have had several exes or whatever. I don't want to deal with them after that tbh\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so the user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong. The situation is that the person is 18, male, and refuses to date girls who aren't virgins. He says he loses all romantic interest if they've had sex before, but he's still okay being friends. The girls he's rejected have accused him of slut-shaming, sexism, and being controlling. The user thinks the author is in the wrong but wants my opinion.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze the situation from different angles. The key points here are the author's personal preference versus the reactions of the girls. The author isn't being hostile or mean; he's just not interested. However, his criteria for dating others is based on their sexual history, which can be seen as problematic.\n\nFrom a social perspective, virginity isn't a standard that's applied equally to both genders. In many cultures, there's more pressure on women regarding their sexual history, which can lead to double standards. The author's stance might be seen as reinforcing such a double standard. Even if his intentions are to avoid dealing with someone's past, the impact of his actions could be hurtful and discriminatory.\n\nThe girls' reactions are about feeling shamed and judged. Slut-shaming is a serious issue where people, especially women, are criticized or humiliated for their sexual behavior. The author's rejection, even if not hostile, could contribute to that climate. Sexism here might come from the idea that women's value in a relationship is tied to their sexual history, which is a traditional, often outdated, view.\n\nOn the other hand, the author is stating his personal preferences. In dating, people have the right to look for partners who meet their criteria. However, when those criteria are based on societal norms that are discriminatory or contribute to the shaming of others, it's a problem. The line between personal preference and harmful behavior can be thin here.\n\nThe author's justification is that he doesn't want to deal with someone's past, but that's a personal choice. However, the way he's applying this preference could be seen as placing unnecessary value on virginity, which is subjective and not a valid measure of a person's worth. This could be considered controlling if it's about him having power over the choice rather than mutual respect.\n\nConsidering all these factors, the author's actions, while his own preference, might indeed be seen as contributing to a harmful social issue. Therefore, he could be in the wrong for enforcing such a standard and potentially hurting others' feelings by shaming them for their past experiences.\n"
