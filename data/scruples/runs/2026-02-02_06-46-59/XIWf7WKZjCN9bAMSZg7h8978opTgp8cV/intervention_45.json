Let's just jump to the point; I won't date girls who aren't virgins. Every time I've been interested in or flirting with a girl and she mentions not being a virgin I lose all interest in her, and keep my distance. I just do, literally 0% interest if they've had sex before. I don't block them or get mad or anything, I'm totally up for having them as buddies or whatever, but a fair few girls who I've rejected for this reason have gotten really pissed and said I'm \"slutshaming\" and that I'm sexist and controlling and shit. \n\nAre they right? I don't have any bad feelings towards them, it's just that any romantic interest sort of evaporates if they're not virgins, or have had several exes or whatever. I don't want to deal with them after that tbh\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote about rejecting non-virgins is in the wrong. The author is a guy who says he won't date girls who aren't virgins, and when they mention not being virgins, he loses interest. Some of the girls he's rejected got angry, calling him sexist and slut-shaming.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. He's 18, which is young, and maybe his views are shaped by personal beliefs or upbringing. But from a broader perspective, the issue is about personal preferences versus imposing societal standards. \n\nRejecting someone based on their sexual history is a form of judgment. While it's his personal choice to date only virgins, the way he frames it as a complete loss of interest might come off as disrespectful. The key here is whether this preference is a harmless personal choice or if it perpetuates harmful stereotypes.\n\nSlut-shaming is a real issue where people judge others for their sexual activity. By rejecting non-virgins, he might be contributing to that culture. However, he doesn't seem to have malicious intent; he's just not interested. The girls feeling offended might be because his stance is seen as controlling or sexist, even if he doesn't mean it that way.\n\nOn the other hand, people have the right to set their own dating criteria. But when those criteria are based on a person's past and not their current character or compatibility, it can be problematic. Also, considering that societal norms are shifting towards more acceptance and that virginity isn't a standard everyone agrees on, his stance could be seen as outdated or judgmental.\n\nSo, is he in the wrong? If he's not being violent or abusive, but just not pursuing relationships based on this, it's a tricky case. However, the impact on others' feelings and the potential reinforcement of negative attitudes towards women's autonomy might make him at least partly responsible for the hurt caused. Therefore, he might be in the wrong.\n"
