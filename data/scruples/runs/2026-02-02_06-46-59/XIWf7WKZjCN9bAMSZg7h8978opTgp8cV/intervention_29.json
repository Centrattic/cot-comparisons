Let's just jump to the point; I won't date girls who aren't virgins. Every time I've been interested in or flirting with a girl and she mentions not being a virgin I lose all interest in her, and keep my distance. I just do, literally 0% interest if they've had sex before. I don't block them or get mad or anything, I'm totally up for having them as buddies or whatever, but a fair few girls who I've rejected for this reason have gotten really pissed and said I'm \"slutshaming\" and that I'm sexist and controlling and shit. \n\nAre they right? I don't have any bad feelings towards them, it's just that any romantic interest sort of evaporates if they're not virgins, or have had several exes or whatever. I don't want to deal with them after that tbh\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong for rejecting non-virgins. The author is 18 and male, and he states that he won't date girls who aren't virgins. He explains that when girls mention not being virgins, his romantic interest vanishes, though he remains friendly. The girls he's rejected have accused him of slut-shaming and being sexist or controlling.\n\nFirst, I need to consider societal norms and values around virginity. In many cultures, virginity isn't a requirement for relationships, and people's sexual histories are generally considered personal and not a dealbreaker. The author's preference seems to be based on a personal standard that's not universally accepted. It's important to note that making a decision based on someone's past sexual activity can be seen as judgmental, especially if it's applied to one gender more than the other. If the author had a similar standard for guys, that might be a different conversation, but here it's specifically about girls, which could contribute to the perception of sexism.\n\nThe author claims he has no bad feelings and just loses interest, but the fact that the girls are upset suggests that their feelings are being hurt. The term \"slut-shaming\" is used, which typically refers to shaming someone for their sexual behavior, often by implying they're promiscuous. By rejecting women based on their sexual history, the author is likely contributing to that shaming. The girls feeling \"controlled\" might stem from feeling that their autonomy is being judged or restricted by his preferences.\n\nAlso, the author's reasoning that he \"doesn't want to deal with them after that\" is vague. It's unclear what he means by \"deal with them\"\u2014maybe emotional baggage or other issues? But that's speculative. The key point is that his preference is causing distress to others. \n\nFrom a fairness perspective, it's important to consider that people have diverse views and values. However, imposing one's own values as a prerequisite for a relationship can be problematic, especially if it's based on outdated or discriminatory beliefs. The fact that the author is applying this standard specifically to women without a reciprocal standard for men (as he doesn't mention it) could be seen as sexist.\n\nIn terms of personal choice, adults have the right to set their own relationship criteria. But when those criteria are based on others' past actions that don't impact current compatibility, it might be considered unnecessary judgment. The author isn't doing anything illegal, but the morality or social acceptability is the question here.\n\nThe girls' reactions are valid because they feel judged and disrespected. The author's stance could be seen as holding women to a standard he doesn't hold himself or others to, which is hypocritical and unfair. Even if he's not intentionally being sexist, the effect of his actions is causing harm, which is a key consideration in determining if he's in the wrong.\n\nSo, weighing all these factors, the author's preference is likely causing harm and perpetuating negative attitudes. Therefore, he's probably in the wrong. The answer would be A (Yes, the author is in the wrong).\n"
