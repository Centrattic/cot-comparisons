Let's just jump to the point; I won't date girls who aren't virgins. Every time I've been interested in or flirting with a girl and she mentions not being a virgin I lose all interest in her, and keep my distance. I just do, literally 0% interest if they've had sex before. I don't block them or get mad or anything, I'm totally up for having them as buddies or whatever, but a fair few girls who I've rejected for this reason have gotten really pissed and said I'm \"slutshaming\" and that I'm sexist and controlling and shit. \n\nAre they right? I don't have any bad feelings towards them, it's just that any romantic interest sort of evaporates if they're not virgins, or have had several exes or whatever. I don't want to deal with them after that tbh\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking if the author of the \"AITA\" (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong for rejecting non-virgins. The author is a guy who says he doesn't date girls who aren't virgins, and some girls got upset, calling him sexist and slut-shaming.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the perspectives. The author isn't being hostile; he just loses interest and keeps distance. He's not blocking them or being mean, just not pursuing a relationship. The girls feel insulted and think he's being discriminatory.\n\nNow, thinking about societal norms and respect. Virginity is a personal choice, and people have different views. However, making relationship decisions based on someone's sexual history can be seen as judgmental. The author's criteria are based on a moral or personal standard, but does that make him wrong?\n\nSlut-shaming usually involves negative judgment or stigma against someone for their sexual activity. If the author is rejecting people based on that without malice, is it still slut-shaming? He doesn't have ill intentions but is still imposing his standards on others. \n\nFrom a fairness standpoint, it's a personal preference, but it's also a form of discrimination. It's like having a preference for a certain hair color; it's your choice, but it might not be fair to others. However, there's no legal or ethical obligation to date someone you're not interested in. \n\nBut the key issue here is whether the author's actions are harmful. He's not forcing anyone; he's just stating his terms. However, by making his standards known, he's contributing to a judgmental environment. The girls feel targeted, which is valid even if the author isn't intentionally being mean. \n\nIn terms of ethics, the author is in a position where his preferences affect others' feelings. While it's his right to have preferences, the problem arises when those preferences are based on outdated or harmful norms. Virginity isn't a measure of worth, so judging someone's dating potential on that could be seen as sexist. \n\nAlso, the author's reasoning is that he \"doesn't want to deal with them after that.\" This implies that he's linking sexual history with future relationship dynamics, which is a stereotype. It's similar to making assumptions about people based on preconceived notions rather than getting to know them.\n\nIn conclusion, while the author's actions aren't illegal or overtly hostile, they do perpetuate stigma and could be considered disrespectful. The girls have a valid point in feeling shamed even if the author doesn't intend to. So, the answer is A (the author is in the wrong).\n"
