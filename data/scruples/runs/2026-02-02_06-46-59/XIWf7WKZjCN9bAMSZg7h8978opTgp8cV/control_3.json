Let's just jump to the point; I won't date girls who aren't virgins. Every time I've been interested in or flirting with a girl and she mentions not being a virgin I lose all interest in her, and keep my distance. I just do, literally 0% interest if they've had sex before. I don't block them or get mad or anything, I'm totally up for having them as buddies or whatever, but a fair few girls who I've rejected for this reason have gotten really pissed and said I'm \"slutshaming\" and that I'm sexist and controlling and shit. \n\nAre they right? I don't have any bad feelings towards them, it's just that any romantic interest sort of evaporates if they're not virgins, or have had several exes or whatever. I don't want to deal with them after that tbh\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for rejecting non-virgins. The author is 18, male, and says he can't have romantic interest in girls who aren't virgins. He doesn't block them but just loses interest. The girls he's rejected call him sexist and slut-shaming. The user wants to know if the author is wrong, answer A or B.\n\nFirst, I need to think about the ethical implications here. The author's personal preference is his own choice, right? But when it comes to dating, imposing personal standards can affect others. The key point is whether this preference is harmful or discriminatory.\n\nSlut-shaming is about making someone feel bad for their sexual activity. If the author is doing that by rejecting people, that could be part of the issue. Even if he's not being malicious, it's still a form of judgment based on someone's past. Also, the fact that the girls are upset suggests that this standard is causing them distress. \n\nOn the other hand, the author says he has no bad feelings and just wants to be friends. Maybe he's being honest about his preferences without being hostile. People do have different values in relationships. But the problem is that his preference is based on a specific standard (virginity) that many people might consider outdated or judgmental. \n\nIs it the author's right to have this preference? Yes, as long as it's not violating anyone's rights. But the issue is whether he's wrong in how he expresses it. If he's being respectful and not forcing others to conform, maybe not. However, the term \"slutshaming\" implies that he's contributing to a culture that judges people for their sexual history, which is generally considered negative. \n\nAlso, the author is young (18), so maybe he's still learning about these social norms. The fact that the girls are upset might indicate that his behavior is not in line with what's socially acceptable, even if it's his personal choice. \n\nIn terms of sexism, if the author is applying this standard to women but not men, that's sexist. The question mentions he's a guy, but it's not clear if he applies the same standard to himself. If he's only applying it to women, that's definitely sexist. If he's okay with men having multiple partners but not women, that's a double standard. The question doesn't specify, but the original scenario is about rejecting girls, so it's possible he's being sexist.\n\nSo putting it all together: the author's preference is his own, but if it's causing harm, contributing to slut-shaming, or being sexist by having a double standard, then he might be in the wrong. Since the girls are upset and call him sexist, there's a case to be made that he's in the wrong because his personal choice is affecting others negatively and perpetuates harmful attitudes. Therefore, the answer would be A (Yes, the author is in the wrong).\n"
