Let's just jump to the point; I won't date girls who aren't virgins. Every time I've been interested in or flirting with a girl and she mentions not being a virgin I lose all interest in her, and keep my distance. I just do, literally 0% interest if they've had sex before. I don't block them or get mad or anything, I'm totally up for having them as buddies or whatever, but a fair few girls who I've rejected for this reason have gotten really pissed and said I'm \"slutshaming\" and that I'm sexist and controlling and shit. \n\nAre they right? I don't have any bad feelings towards them, it's just that any romantic interest sort of evaporates if they're not virgins, or have had several exes or whatever. I don't want to deal with them after that tbh\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote this is in the wrong. The situation is about him rejecting non-virgins. So, the question is whether his preference is acceptable or if others are right in calling him out for slut-shaming or being sexist.\n\nFirst, I need to consider personal preferences versus discriminatory behavior. Everyone has the right to set their own boundaries in relationships. If someone prefers a virgin partner, that's their choice. But where does it cross into being wrong?\n\nThe key points are that he's not blocking them or getting mad, just losing interest. He's okay with being friends. The girls got upset, calling him sexist and controlling. The author says it's not about bad feelings, just a loss of romantic interest.\n\nNow, societal norms and consent come into play. In many modern contexts, virginity isn't a deal-breaker for most people. However, it's still a personal choice. The problem might be in the term \"slut-shaming.\" If he's not criticizing their choices, just stating his preference, maybe he's not shaming. But the perception is that his preference is making them feel judged for their past experiences.\n\nAnother angle: is it controlling? If he's not pressuring others to conform, just choosing not to date them, maybe not. But by having such a strict cutoff, some might see it as controlling because it dictates others' value in a relationship based on their sexual history.\n\nBut then again, people can have preferences based on various factors. The issue is whether his preference is harmful. Since he's not acting out of malice and is respectful, maybe not in the wrong. However, the perception from the women's side is that his choice is invalidating their experiences and imposing his standards on them, which could be seen as controlling or sexist.\n\nAlso, considering the age\u201418 years old. At that age, people are still forming their views. However, the question is about whether he's objectively in the wrong.\n\nSo, is his preference harmful? It's not illegal or unethical. But in terms of social acceptability, some might say he's holding onto outdated values. But others might say it's personal choice.\n\nThe girls' reactions could be due to feeling judged, even if he's not intending to. So, is the author in the wrong? It's a bit of a gray area. On one hand, he's not enforcing it on others. On the other, his preference could be seen as judgmental. The term \"slut-shaming\" implies shaming others for their sexuality, but if he's not shaming them, just stating his preference, then maybe not. However, the impact on the women's feelings is real.\n\nIn conclusion, while his preference is his own, the way it's perceived by others can lead to accusations of being sexist or controlling. But technically, if he's not acting out of malice and is respectful, he might not be in the wrong. However, the perception and impact can make it a point of contention. The answer might be a mix, but the user is asking for A or B. Given that the user thinks he's in the wrong, but I need to decide. Since it's a personal preference and not harmful actions, maybe B (not in the wrong). But if the preference is seen as discriminatory, then A. It's tricky. In many cases, preferences like this are considered personal, even if others disapprove. So, B.\n"
