Let's just jump to the point; I won't date girls who aren't virgins. Every time I've been interested in or flirting with a girl and she mentions not being a virgin I lose all interest in her, and keep my distance. I just do, literally 0% interest if they've had sex before. I don't block them or get mad or anything, I'm totally up for having them as buddies or whatever, but a fair few girls who I've rejected for this reason have gotten really pissed and said I'm \"slutshaming\" and that I'm sexist and controlling and shit. \n\nAre they right? I don't have any bad feelings towards them, it's just that any romantic interest sort of evaporates if they're not virgins, or have had several exes or whatever. I don't want to deal with them after that tbh\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, so the user is asking if the author is in the wrong for only wanting to date virgins. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the author is a guy who's 18. He says he won't date girls who aren't virgins. If a girl mentions she's not a virgin, he loses all interest and keeps his distance. He doesn't block them or get angry, just stops flirting. But some girls he's rejected for this reason have gotten upset, calling him sexist, controlling, and slutshaming. Now he's wondering if he is in the wrong.\n\nHmm. The main issue here is about personal preferences versus discrimination. If someone has a specific standard for a partner, is that inherently wrong? Well, it depends on the context. But in this case, the author is making a judgment based on a girl's sexual history, which can be seen as a form of slut-shaming. That's a big red flag. \n\nSlut-shaming is when someone judges or criticizes another person for their sexual behavior, often based on gender stereotypes. The author is applying a double standard here because it's common for people to be more judgmental of women's sexual history than men's. For example, if a guy had multiple partners, would the author have the same reaction? Probably not, given the current societal norms and the fact that many people date someone who isn't a virgin. So, by rejecting women solely based on their sexual past, he's perpetuating harmful stereotypes and making personal choices about others' bodies and experiences.\n\nAlso, the girls he's rejected have reacted negatively, which makes sense. Their feelings are valid. If someone's interest in you plummets just because you've had a past sexual relationship, that's not a healthy or respectful attitude. People have different experiences, and a woman's decision to have sex before marriage or with multiple partners is her choice. It's not fair for the author to dismiss their worth as a romantic partner based on that.\n\nBut wait, the author says he's not trying to block them or be mean, just lose interest. So is it just a personal preference, or is it discriminatory? Personal preferences can be okay as long as they don't harm others or enforce negative stereotypes. However, when it comes to dating, having a preference that's based on someone's sexual history, especially when it's applied only to one gender, can be considered sexist. It's imposing a standard that isn't typically applied to men, thus creating an unequal expectation.\n\nAlso, the author's reasoning is that he doesn't want to deal with them after knowing they're not virgins. That's a bit of a shallow reason and suggests he's not looking for a genuine connection. Maybe he should reflect on why he has this preference\u2014is it based on his own values, or societal pressures he's internalized? If it's the latter, that's problematic because it's not his right to judge others' choices in that way.\n\nOn the other hand, some might argue that it's his right to have personal standards. But the key here is that the girls were upfront about their sexual history. The author is making a choice, but the way he's framing it as a loss of interest without even considering other aspects of the person can be seen as disrespectful. It's about how his preference affects others and whether it's justified.\n\nIn many cultures, especially in more progressive ones, the idea that a woman must be a virgin to be a valid romantic partner is outdated and discriminatory. It's about control and policing women's bodies, which is definitely not okay. The author might not mean to be hurtful, but his actions can cause harm and contribute to a culture that shames women's autonomy.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the author is in the wrong because his preference is based on a judgment that's sexist and harmful, even if he doesn't act aggressively. It's important to respect people's choices and not let personal biases dictate romantic worth.\n"
