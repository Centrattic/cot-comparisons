Let's just jump to the point; I won't date girls who aren't virgins. Every time I've been interested in or flirting with a girl and she mentions not being a virgin I lose all interest in her, and keep my distance. I just do, literally 0% interest if they've had sex before. I don't block them or get mad or anything, I'm totally up for having them as buddies or whatever, but a fair few girls who I've rejected for this reason have gotten really pissed and said I'm \"slutshaming\" and that I'm sexist and controlling and shit. \n\nAre they right? I don't have any bad feelings towards them, it's just that any romantic interest sort of evaporates if they're not virgins, or have had several exes or whatever. I don't want to deal with them after that tbh\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the original post is in the wrong. The situation is that the author, an 18-year-old guy, refuses to date girls who aren't virgins. He says he loses all interest if they've had sex before, but he doesn't get angry or block them, just avoids romantic involvement. Some of these girls got upset, saying he's being sexist and slut-shaming.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the societal norms and attitudes towards this. Virginity is a personal choice and varies by culture and individual beliefs. The author is clear about his preferences, but is it wrong to have such a preference? On one hand, it's his right to have personal preferences in relationships. On the other hand, there's the aspect of judgment and potential discrimination. \n\nSlut-shaming typically involves making someone feel guilty or shameful about their sexual activity. The author isn't shaming them directly, but his rejection could be seen as a form of shaming if he's making his disapproval clear. However, he's not attacking them beyond losing interest. He's not pressuring them or being abusive, just choosing not to date them.\n\nThen there's the issue of sexism. The author is applying a standard specifically to women. If he had the same standard for men, it might be different, but since it's only toward women, that could be considered sexist. The fact that he's judging women's sexual history but not men's might contribute to the perception of sexism.\n\nThe author also mentions that he's okay with being friends, so he's not excluding them entirely. That might mitigate some of the wrongdoing, as he's not cutting off all contact. However, his preference is still a personal choice that others might find judgmental.\n\nAnother angle is consent and autonomy. People have the right to make their own choices about their bodies and relationships. The author is choosing not to date based on a personal preference, but is that preference harmful? If it's not causing direct harm beyond emotional distress, it's debatable. However, the emotional impact on the other person is still a valid concern.\n\nAge is also a factor. At 18, his views might still be forming, and he could benefit from understanding different perspectives. The girls' reactions suggest that they feel his actions are disrespectful, which he needs to consider.\n\nIn summary, while the author isn't breaking any laws, his actions could be seen as judgmental and potentially sexist. The key points are the targeted application of standards to women, the potential for slut-shaming, and the emotional impact on others. So, the answer might lean towards A (the author is in the wrong) because of these factors, even if he's not malicious.\n"
