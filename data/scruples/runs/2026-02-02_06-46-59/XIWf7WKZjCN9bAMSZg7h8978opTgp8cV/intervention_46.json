Let's just jump to the point; I won't date girls who aren't virgins. Every time I've been interested in or flirting with a girl and she mentions not being a virgin I lose all interest in her, and keep my distance. I just do, literally 0% interest if they've had sex before. I don't block them or get mad or anything, I'm totally up for having them as buddies or whatever, but a fair few girls who I've rejected for this reason have gotten really pissed and said I'm \"slutshaming\" and that I'm sexist and controlling and shit. \n\nAre they right? I don't have any bad feelings towards them, it's just that any romantic interest sort of evaporates if they're not virgins, or have had several exes or whatever. I don't want to deal with them after that tbh\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who posted about rejecting non-virgins is in the wrong. The question is from Reddit's \"Am I the Asshole?\" so the usual context here is to determine if the person's actions are unreasonable.\n\nThe author is 18, male, and states he won't date girls who aren't virgins. He mentions that when a girl isn't a virgin, his interest drops to zero, but he doesn't block them; he just becomes a friend. The girls he's rejected have accused him of slut-shaming, sexism, etc. The user thinks the author is wrong and wants to know.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the societal norms and whether the author's preference is discriminatory. Virginity as a dating criterion can be seen as problematic because it imposes a standard that may be based on outdated or biased views. It's important to note that people's sexual histories are their own business and shouldn't affect someone else's worth. By rejecting people based on their sexual activity, the author might be perpetuating stigma and judgment, which can be hurtful.\n\nHowever, the author isn't forcing anyone; he's just stating his personal preference. The key here is whether his preference crosses into harassment or discrimination. Since he's not blocking or acting aggressively, just not pursuing relationships, it's a personal choice. But the way the girls reacted suggests that their sense of being judged is valid. The term \"slut-shaming\" is used because it's about shaming someone for their sexual behavior. The author's stance could be seen as sexist because it's a double standard\u2014men aren't typically judged the same way for their sexual history.\n\nOn the other hand, the author isn't in a position where he's enforcing this on others; it's his personal choice. However, when he expresses this preference, especially if it's done in a way that makes others feel shamed, that's where the issue arises. The fact that the girls felt shamed implies that the way he's communicating or acting on this preference might be contributory.\n\nIn terms of right or wrong, the answer might lean towards the author being in the wrong because his preference is based on criteria that aren't about the person's character and could promote harmful attitudes. Even if it's personal, the impact on others is negative, and the rejection is based on something that's not relevant to a healthy relationship. So, AITA is usually about whether the person's actions are unreasonable or cruel. Here, the author's actions aren't illegal, but they could be considered morally or socially inappropriate.\n\nSo, the answer would be A (Yes, the author is in the wrong) because his preference is discriminatory and perpetuates stigma, even if it's his personal choice.\n"
