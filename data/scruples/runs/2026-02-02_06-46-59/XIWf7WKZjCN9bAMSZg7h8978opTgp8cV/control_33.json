Let's just jump to the point; I won't date girls who aren't virgins. Every time I've been interested in or flirting with a girl and she mentions not being a virgin I lose all interest in her, and keep my distance. I just do, literally 0% interest if they've had sex before. I don't block them or get mad or anything, I'm totally up for having them as buddies or whatever, but a fair few girls who I've rejected for this reason have gotten really pissed and said I'm \"slutshaming\" and that I'm sexist and controlling and shit. \n\nAre they right? I don't have any bad feelings towards them, it's just that any romantic interest sort of evaporates if they're not virgins, or have had several exes or whatever. I don't want to deal with them after that tbh\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. So, the user is asking if the person who wrote the original post (OP) is in the wrong for rejecting non-virgins. The options are A (yes) or B (no). Let's break down the situation.\n\nFirst, the OP is 18, male, and states that he won't date girls who aren't virgins. When they mention not being virgins, he loses interest. He doesn't get angry or block them but just keeps his distance. The girls he's rejected have accused him of slut-shaming, being sexist, and controlling. He doesn't have bad feelings, he just loses interest if they've had sex or had multiple exes. The question is whether he's in the wrong.\n\nI need to consider societal norms, personal choice, and potential discrimination. On one hand, people have the right to set their own relationship criteria. If someone is a virgin and that's important to them, maybe it's their choice. But on the other hand, there's the aspect of judgment and how it affects others. Slut-shaming is a real issue, and by judging someone based on their sexual history, especially if it's a strict rule, it could be seen as shaming. \n\nAlso, the fact that he's 18 and in a formative stage of his life might play into this. His reasoning is that he doesn't want to deal with the \"aftermath,\" which could imply he's making assumptions about how someone's sexual history affects their character or compatibility. That kind of judgment can be considered sexist because it's evaluating women based on their sexual activity, which isn't a valid measure of their worth or suitability as a partner.\n\nThe girls' reactions are also a point to consider. If they feel shamed or controlled, even if he doesn't have ill intentions, his actions are causing harm. The key here is whether his preference is within his right or if it crosses into discriminatory behavior. While people can choose their partners based on personal preferences, when it's framed as a moral judgment or when it's based on stereotypes, it can be problematic.\n\nAnother angle is the double standard. If the OP had a rule about not dating men who had multiple partners, similar reactions might be justified, highlighting the inconsistency in societal expectations. This could support the argument that his standards are indeed sexist.\n\nHowever, there's the argument of personal choice in relationships. If someone is a strict vegan and won't date non-vegans, it's their prerogative, even if others critique them for it. But the difference here is that dietary choices are different from personal relationships and societal attitudes towards them. Sexual history is more personal and often tied to cultural taboos, so the stigma might be more harmful.\n\nIn conclusion, while the OP might not have malicious intent, his strict rule and the way it's affecting others could make him \"in the wrong\" because it's perpetuating harmful judgments and stereotypes. Therefore, the answer might lean towards A (yes). But I need to make sure there's no counterpoint I'm missing. The fact that he's not blocking them or being hostile might mitigate some of the blame, but the core issue is still about the judgment and the impact on others' self-esteem.\n"
