Let's just jump to the point; I won't date girls who aren't virgins. Every time I've been interested in or flirting with a girl and she mentions not being a virgin I lose all interest in her, and keep my distance. I just do, literally 0% interest if they've had sex before. I don't block them or get mad or anything, I'm totally up for having them as buddies or whatever, but a fair few girls who I've rejected for this reason have gotten really pissed and said I'm \"slutshaming\" and that I'm sexist and controlling and shit. \n\nAre they right? I don't have any bad feelings towards them, it's just that any romantic interest sort of evaporates if they're not virgins, or have had several exes or whatever. I don't want to deal with them after that tbh\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong for rejecting non-virgins. The author is 18, male, and states he only dates virgins. He mentions losing all interest if a girl isn't a virgin, but he doesn't get angry or block them, just keeps his distance. The girls he rejects are upset, calling him sexist and slut-shaming.\n\nFirst, I need to consider societal norms and perspectives. Virginity preferences are personal, but when does a personal preference cross into being problematic? The key here is whether his preference is harmful or discriminatory. The author himself claims he has no bad feelings and just loses interest. But the girls feel shamed and targeted, which is a big red flag.\n\nSlut-shaming typically involves making someone feel bad for their sexual history. Even if the author isn't doing it intentionally, his actions lead to others feeling shamed. That's a problem. Also, the idea that someone's worth as a romantic partner depends on their sexual history is a form of sexism because it imposes strict standards on women but not on men. If he had the same preference for male partners, it would be different, but since it's only applied to women, it reinforces double standards.\n\nAnother angle is the concept of personal choice. People have the right to set their own boundaries in dating. However, when those boundaries stigmatize others, they can be harmful. The author isn't forcing anyone, but his rejection based on something that's none of his business (their sexual history) can be seen as controlling. The girls' reactions are valid because they feel judged, which is a form of shaming.\n\nIt's also important to consider consent and mutual respect. While the author isn't pressuring the women, his rejection is based on a personal value that isn't mutual. The women aren't doing anything to him, so his preference is a personal choice, but the way it's being applied might not respect their autonomy.\n\nIn conclusion, while the author isn't breaking the law, his actions contribute to a harmful double standard and stigmatize others. Therefore, he's likely in the wrong.\n"
