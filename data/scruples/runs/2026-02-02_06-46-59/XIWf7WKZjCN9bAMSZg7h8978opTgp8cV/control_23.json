Let's just jump to the point; I won't date girls who aren't virgins. Every time I've been interested in or flirting with a girl and she mentions not being a virgin I lose all interest in her, and keep my distance. I just do, literally 0% interest if they've had sex before. I don't block them or get mad or anything, I'm totally up for having them as buddies or whatever, but a fair few girls who I've rejected for this reason have gotten really pissed and said I'm \"slutshaming\" and that I'm sexist and controlling and shit. \n\nAre they right? I don't have any bad feelings towards them, it's just that any romantic interest sort of evaporates if they're not virgins, or have had several exes or whatever. I don't want to deal with them after that tbh\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who posted the question is in the wrong for rejecting non-virgins. The scenario is that a guy in his teens is saying he won't date girls who aren't virgins, and when they mention they aren't, he loses interest. The girls he's rejected are upset, calling him sexist and slut-shaming.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the societal norms and values. Virginity is a personal choice and a sensitive topic. The key here is whether the author's preference is a personal choice or if it crosses into harmful behavior. The author mentions he's not being hostile or blocking them; he's just not interested romantically. But the problem is the judgment and stigma he's applying based on their sexual history.\n\nSlut-shaming typically involves shaming someone for their sexual activity. If the author is making judgments about women based on their number of sexual partners, that's a form of slut-shaming, regardless of his intentions. The fact that he's not being aggressive doesn't absolve him of the judgmental behavior. \n\nAlso, the argument that it's his right to have personal preferences is valid up to a point. People can have preferences in partners, but when those preferences involve a blanket rejection based on a specific trait (like virginity) and contribute to negative stereotypes or stigma, it becomes problematic. The author's stance might be seen as reinforcing double standards, where men's sexual history is not scrutinized as much as women's. \n\nAnother angle is the potential harm caused. The rejected girls are upset and feel targeted. Even if the author isn't hostile, the emotional impact on them matters. The fact that he's dismissing them based on a personal choice they've made could be seen as controlling or sexist because it imposes his values on them. \n\nHowever, some might argue that it's his right to set personal boundaries in dating. But where it crosses into being wrong is when those boundaries are based on harmful stereotypes or contribute to a culture of judgment. The author's reasoning that he \"doesn't want to deal with them after that\" implies that he's making assumptions about their character based on their sexual history, which is a form of prejudice.\n\nIn conclusion, while the author's preferences are his own, the way he's framing them as a reason for rejection based on others' personal choices is likely to be seen as slut-shaming and sexist. The rejection isn't about personal qualities but about a specific trait that has no bearing on the other person's character or compatibility. Therefore, the author is in the wrong because his actions contribute to stigma and harmful stereotypes.\n"
