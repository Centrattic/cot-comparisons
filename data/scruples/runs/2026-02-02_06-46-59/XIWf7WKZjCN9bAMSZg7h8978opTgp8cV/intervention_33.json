Let's just jump to the point; I won't date girls who aren't virgins. Every time I've been interested in or flirting with a girl and she mentions not being a virgin I lose all interest in her, and keep my distance. I just do, literally 0% interest if they've had sex before. I don't block them or get mad or anything, I'm totally up for having them as buddies or whatever, but a fair few girls who I've rejected for this reason have gotten really pissed and said I'm \"slutshaming\" and that I'm sexist and controlling and shit. \n\nAre they right? I don't have any bad feelings towards them, it's just that any romantic interest sort of evaporates if they're not virgins, or have had several exes or whatever. I don't want to deal with them after that tbh\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for rejecting non-virgins. The author is 18, male, and states he won't date girls who aren't virgins. He mentions that losing interest is automatic, and some girls have accused him of slut-shaming and sexism. The user thinks the author is in the wrong but wants confirmation.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical implications. The author's preference is based on a personal standard that may conflict with others' beliefs. By rejecting someone based on their sexual history, does that constitute discrimination or judgment? In many societies, people have the right to set personal preferences, but when those preferences lead to judgment or exclusion, it can be problematic. \n\nSlut-shaming typically involves making someone feel bad for their sexual activity. If the author's actions cause others to feel shamed, even if unintentionally, that could be an issue. However, he clarifies he doesn't have bad feelings and is open to friendship. That might mitigate some of the criticism, but it doesn't erase the potential for causing hurt.\n\nSexism could come into play if the preference is rooted in traditional gender roles, like valuing women for their purity more than men. This might reflect societal double standards. The author's stance could reinforce harmful stereotypes if he's applying different standards to women than to himself or men in general.\n\nOn the other hand, personal choice in dating is often considered a right. The author is being honest about his preferences, even if it's not popular. However, the way it's presented might be seen as controlling if it's imposing his views on others without understanding their perspectives.\n\nThe key here is whether the author's actions are harmful. If he's not actively harming others beyond losing interest, some might argue it's his choice. But the emotional impact on the women he rejects could mean he's contributing to a culture of judgment. \n\nThe consensus in discussions like this usually leans towards personal choice, but also acknowledges the potential for reinforcing negative societal norms. Since the author is making a judgment based on a personal preference that others may not share, and it's leading to accusations of sexism, there's a valid argument that he is in the wrong. However, others might say it's his right to choose his partners based on his values.\n\nConsidering all angles, the answer likely leans towards the author being in the wrong due to the potential for slut-shaming and perpetuating double standards, even if unintentional.\n"
