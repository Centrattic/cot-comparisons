Let's just jump to the point; I won't date girls who aren't virgins. Every time I've been interested in or flirting with a girl and she mentions not being a virgin I lose all interest in her, and keep my distance. I just do, literally 0% interest if they've had sex before. I don't block them or get mad or anything, I'm totally up for having them as buddies or whatever, but a fair few girls who I've rejected for this reason have gotten really pissed and said I'm \"slutshaming\" and that I'm sexist and controlling and shit. \n\nAre they right? I don't have any bad feelings towards them, it's just that any romantic interest sort of evaporates if they're not virgins, or have had several exes or whatever. I don't want to deal with them after that tbh\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the \"AITA\" post is in the wrong for rejecting non-virgins. The author is an 18-year-old male who states he won't date girls who aren't virgins. He mentions that when girls he's interested in have sex experience, his interest drops to zero, and he distances himself without being hostile. The girls he's rejected have accused him of slut-shaming and being sexist and controlling.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical and social implications here. The author's stance is based on personal preference, but it's about a specific standard for dating. However, the key issue is whether his actions are discriminatory or harmful. The term \"slut-shaming\" implies that he's judging others' sexual behavior, which can be seen as shaming them for their choices. \n\nAnother angle is consent and personal boundaries. The author is clear about his preferences and doesn't force relationships, but by making a blanket rejection based on something unrelated to the person's character (like their sexual history), it could be considered discriminatory. It's similar to other forms of bias where personal preferences lead to exclusion based on factors that don't affect the relationship's viability.\n\nAlso, societal norms are changing, and many advocate for the idea that a person's sexual history shouldn't affect how others treat them. The author's behavior might perpetuate harmful stereotypes, even if he doesn't mean to. The fact that the women feel shamed and called him sexist suggests that his actions impact others negatively, even if he's not hostile.\n\nOn the other hand, the author isn't forcing anyone into relationships; he's just stating his preferences. However, the problem arises when these preferences are based on outdated or harmful beliefs. The key is whether it's acceptable to have such a preference. While people have the right to set their own standards, when it leads to judgment or exclusion based on irrelevant factors, it can be problematic.\n\nIn conclusion, while the author isn't forcing anyone, his preference is rooted in a judgment about others' bodies and choices that many consider sexist. Therefore, he's likely in the wrong because his actions contribute to slut-shaming and reinforce gender-based discrimination.\n"
