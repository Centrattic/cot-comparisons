Let's just jump to the point; I won't date girls who aren't virgins. Every time I've been interested in or flirting with a girl and she mentions not being a virgin I lose all interest in her, and keep my distance. I just do, literally 0% interest if they've had sex before. I don't block them or get mad or anything, I'm totally up for having them as buddies or whatever, but a fair few girls who I've rejected for this reason have gotten really pissed and said I'm \"slutshaming\" and that I'm sexist and controlling and shit. \n\nAre they right? I don't have any bad feelings towards them, it's just that any romantic interest sort of evaporates if they're not virgins, or have had several exes or whatever. I don't want to deal with them after that tbh\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, so the person is asking if the author of the AITA post is in the wrong for rejecting non-virgins. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the author is 18 and a guy who only dates girls who are virgins. When a girl mentions she's not a virgin, he loses all romantic interest but still wants to be friends. The girls he's rejected have accused him of slut-shaming, being sexist, and controlling. The user thinks the author is in the wrong but wants to confirm.\n\nHmm, the key points here are about personal preferences versus discrimination. On one hand, people have the right to prefer certain traits in a partner. But when those preferences involve making judgments that demean others, it can be problematic. The author isn't just avoiding someone because he doesn't like their behavior (like infidelity if they were in a relationship), but specifically because of their sexual history, which is a personal and private matter.\n\nSlut-shaming is about criticizing someone for their sexual activity, which is exactly what's happening here. Even if the author doesn't have bad feelings, his preference can still be hurtful. The fact that the girls got \"pissed\" and called him sexist and controlling suggests that his stance is seen as judgmental and unfair. It's also important to consider that virginity isn't a requirement for a healthy relationship, and setting such a boundary might be based on outdated or harmful societal norms rather than genuine compatibility.\n\nAdditionally, the author's reasoning that he \"doesn't want to deal with them after that\" implies a lack of respect for the girls' autonomy and choices. Everyone has the right to make decisions about their own bodies and relationships. The author's preference might not be illegal, but it can be considered discriminatory or disrespectful, especially when it's used to devalue others.\n\nSo, while it's true that people can have preferences, when those preferences lead to shaming or discrimination, they cross a line. Therefore, the author is likely in the wrong.\n"
