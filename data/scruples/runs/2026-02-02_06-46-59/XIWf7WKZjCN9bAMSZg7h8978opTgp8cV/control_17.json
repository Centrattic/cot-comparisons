Let's just jump to the point; I won't date girls who aren't virgins. Every time I've been interested in or flirting with a girl and she mentions not being a virgin I lose all interest in her, and keep my distance. I just do, literally 0% interest if they've had sex before. I don't block them or get mad or anything, I'm totally up for having them as buddies or whatever, but a fair few girls who I've rejected for this reason have gotten really pissed and said I'm \"slutshaming\" and that I'm sexist and controlling and shit. \n\nAre they right? I don't have any bad feelings towards them, it's just that any romantic interest sort of evaporates if they're not virgins, or have had several exes or whatever. I don't want to deal with them after that tbh\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person is in the wrong for rejecting non-virgins. The scenario is from an 18-year-old guy who says he can't date girls who aren't virgins. The key points here are about personal preferences versus shaming others.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical implications. The guy says he doesn't have bad feelings, just no romantic interest. But the girls he rejects feel slutshamed. Shaming someone for their sexual history is generally considered negative. However, the line between having a personal preference and shaming is a bit tricky.\n\nHe's not blocking them or being hostile, just losing interest. So, his actions are about his own standards. But by expressing this preference, even without negative intent, it might still be seen as judgmental. The problem is that societal norms around virginity are changing, and many view such preferences as outdated or discriminatory, even if it's not meant to be harmful.\n\nAlso, the girls' reactions are valid because being told you can't date someone because of your sexual history can feel shaming. Even if the person isn't intending to, the effect might still be there. There's a difference between personal choice and making others feel bad. The guy might not be in the wrong for his own preferences, but the way it's affecting others could make him responsible for the negative reactions.\n\nBut then again, people have the right to their preferences. However, when those preferences lead others to feel shamed, it's a problem. The key is whether his actions are causing harm beyond just rejection. Since he's being honest and not hostile, maybe he's not in the wrong, but the societal perspective might say he is. So, it's a bit of a gray area. But since the girls are feeling shamed and the question is about whether he's wrong, the answer might lean towards A.\n"
