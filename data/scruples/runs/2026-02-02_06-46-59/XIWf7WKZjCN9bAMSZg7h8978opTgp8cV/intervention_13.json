Let's just jump to the point; I won't date girls who aren't virgins. Every time I've been interested in or flirting with a girl and she mentions not being a virgin I lose all interest in her, and keep my distance. I just do, literally 0% interest if they've had sex before. I don't block them or get mad or anything, I'm totally up for having them as buddies or whatever, but a fair few girls who I've rejected for this reason have gotten really pissed and said I'm \"slutshaming\" and that I'm sexist and controlling and shit. \n\nAre they right? I don't have any bad feelings towards them, it's just that any romantic interest sort of evaporates if they're not virgins, or have had several exes or whatever. I don't want to deal with them after that tbh\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for rejecting non-virgins. The author is a 18-year-old guy who says he can't be interested in girls who aren't virgins. He mentions that when girls tell him they're not virgins, his interest drops to zero, and he avoids them. Some of these girls got upset and accused him of slut-shaming and being sexist.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the societal norms and values here. Virginity is a topic that varies a lot culturally and personally. Some people might have personal or religious reasons for valuing virginity, but in many modern contexts, it's considered outdated or even discriminatory. The author is imposing his personal preference as a deal-breaker, which could be seen as judgmental.\n\nSlut-shaming is a real issue where people judge others for their sexual activity. If the author's rejection is based on a girl's sexual history, that could fit into that category. He's not just personally disinterested; he's actively avoiding these women, which might make them feel devalued. Even if he doesn't mean to be offensive, the impact of his actions matters here.\n\nAlso, the author's reasoning is that he doesn't want to deal with them after knowing their history. That sounds like a personal bias. It's important to recognize that people's sexual histories don't define their worth. Judging someone based on that could be seen as sexist because it's about controlling or limiting their choices and then penalizing them for it.\n\nHowever, the author isn't forcing anyone; he's just stating his preferences. People have the right to date who they want. But when those preferences lead to shaming or rejection based on others' choices, it crosses into being offensive. The key point is whether it's harmful. The girls felt hurt and accused him of sexism, which suggests that his actions are causing pain.\n\nSo, while the author might not have malicious intent, his actions contribute to a judgmental attitude towards others' sexual choices. That could be considered in the wrong because it perpetuates stigma and inequality. Therefore, the answer is likely A, he's in the wrong.\n"
