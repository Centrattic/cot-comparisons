Let's just jump to the point; I won't date girls who aren't virgins. Every time I've been interested in or flirting with a girl and she mentions not being a virgin I lose all interest in her, and keep my distance. I just do, literally 0% interest if they've had sex before. I don't block them or get mad or anything, I'm totally up for having them as buddies or whatever, but a fair few girls who I've rejected for this reason have gotten really pissed and said I'm \"slutshaming\" and that I'm sexist and controlling and shit. \n\nAre they right? I don't have any bad feelings towards them, it's just that any romantic interest sort of evaporates if they're not virgins, or have had several exes or whatever. I don't want to deal with them after that tbh\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for rejecting non-virgins. The author is an 18-year-old guy who says he can't be interested in girls who aren't virgins. He doesn't hate them, just loses interest romantically. Some girls called him out for slut-shaming and being sexist.\n\nFirst, I need to consider societal norms and ethical perspectives. Many people argue that virginity isn't a valid reason to judge someone's worth. It's a personal choice, and someone's sexual history doesn't define their character. The author's preference might be seen as a personal choice, but when it leads to rejecting others based on criteria that don't impact the relationship, it can be problematic. \n\nSlut-shaming is when someone is criticized for their sexual activity. If the author is doing this by implying that having sex is bad, then he's contributing to negative stereotypes. However, the author claims he's not judging their character, just not interested. But his actions might still be seen as judgmental. \n\nSexism could come into play if this preference is based on outdated gender roles, expecting women to be virgins while men might not face the same expectation. That double standard could be a point of criticism. \n\nOn the other hand, he's stating his preference and not forcing anyone. Personal preferences in dating are common, like looking for someone with certain hobbies or values. But when it's about something that doesn't affect the person's suitability as a partner, it might be seen as shallow or discriminatory. \n\nThe author is not acting out of malice, but his stance might be hurting others' feelings. The key is whether it's his right to have that preference versus if it's harmful. Some might say it's his choice, but others argue it perpetuates stigma. \n\nIn summary, while the author isn't breaking any laws, his attitude could be considered judgmental and sexist because it imposes a traditional standard on women. So, he might be in the wrong based on how it affects others and the societal implications.\n"
