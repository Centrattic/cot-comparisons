Let's just jump to the point; I won't date girls who aren't virgins. Every time I've been interested in or flirting with a girl and she mentions not being a virgin I lose all interest in her, and keep my distance. I just do, literally 0% interest if they've had sex before. I don't block them or get mad or anything, I'm totally up for having them as buddies or whatever, but a fair few girls who I've rejected for this reason have gotten really pissed and said I'm \"slutshaming\" and that I'm sexist and controlling and shit. \n\nAre they right? I don't have any bad feelings towards them, it's just that any romantic interest sort of evaporates if they're not virgins, or have had several exes or whatever. I don't want to deal with them after that tbh\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the person who wrote this is in the wrong. The situation is that they're 18 and a guy who refuses to date girls who aren't virgins. They say that whenever a girl mentions not being a virgin, they lose all romantic interest and just keep their distance, not getting angry or blocking them, but not being interested anymore. Some of these girls got upset, calling him sexist, controlling, etc. He's asking if they're right.\n\nFirst, I should consider the context. He's 18, so he's young. His reasoning is that he doesn't want to date non-virgins, which is a personal preference. But is that preference problematic? Well, it's a form of prejudice against women for their sexual history. Virginity isn't a standard that applies to men in the same way, so there's an inherent double standard here. If he had the same expectations for male partners, that might be different, but since it's only for women, it's sexist.\n\nAlso, the girls are upset because they feel shamed. He's not being violent or abusive, but his behavior is still judgmental. It's important to recognize that sexual history is a personal matter and doesn't affect someone's worth. By rejecting women based on this, he's implying a moral judgment that might not be his place to make. Even if it's his preference, the way it's framed can be hurtful and perpetuate harmful stereotypes.\n\nHowever, some might argue that it's his right to have preferences in partners. But when those preferences are based on outdated or discriminatory beliefs, they can be problematic. The key difference here is the application of different standards to different genders, which is a form of sexism. So, even if it's his personal choice, the underlying issue is the unfair treatment of women based on their sexual history.\n\nIn conclusion, while he's not physically harming anyone, the mindset and actions contribute to a culture of slut-shaming and gender inequality. Therefore, he is in the wrong for perpetuating these harmful attitudes.\n"
