Let's just jump to the point; I won't date girls who aren't virgins. Every time I've been interested in or flirting with a girl and she mentions not being a virgin I lose all interest in her, and keep my distance. I just do, literally 0% interest if they've had sex before. I don't block them or get mad or anything, I'm totally up for having them as buddies or whatever, but a fair few girls who I've rejected for this reason have gotten really pissed and said I'm \"slutshaming\" and that I'm sexist and controlling and shit. \n\nAre they right? I don't have any bad feelings towards them, it's just that any romantic interest sort of evaporates if they're not virgins, or have had several exes or whatever. I don't want to deal with them after that tbh\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking whether the person who wrote this is in the wrong for rejecting non-virgins. The author is a guy who says he can't be interested in girls who aren't virgins. He mentions that he doesn't act hostile, just loses interest and keeps distance. The girls he's rejected are upset, calling him sexist and slut-shaming. The question is whether he's in the wrong.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author is 18, and his preference is based on whether someone is a virgin. He's not being aggressive, just not pursuing a relationship. But the key here is whether this preference is considered discriminatory or harmful. \n\nSlut-shaming typically refers to judging or criticizing someone for their sexual behavior, often in a way that stigmatizes them. By stating that he only dates virgins, he's setting a standard that could be seen as imposing his values on others. However, he's not shaming them directly, just choosing not to date them. \n\nThen there's the aspect of personal choice in relationships. People have different values and preferences. Some might prefer partners with similar views on relationships, but when it comes to something like virginity, which is a personal choice, does imposing that preference make someone sexist? \n\nSexism involves prejudice or discrimination based on gender. If his preference is about the number of sexual partners, that might relate more to double standards, where women are judged more harshly than men for similar behaviors. If he's applying that standard to women but not to himself (like if he's had multiple partners but doesn't care if a woman has), that could be sexist. But the author doesn't mention his own sexual history, so that's unclear. \n\nAlso, the impact on others is important. The girls he's rejected are upset, feeling shamed. Even if he's not intending to harm, his actions are causing distress. But is the act of rejecting someone based on a personal preference inherently wrong? People can have preferences in partners, like not wanting someone with certain habits or lifestyles, but when it becomes a blanket rejection based on a trait that's not about behavior towards him (like past relationships), it might be seen as judgmental.\n\nAnother angle is that virginity isn't a choice; it's a status that someone has. So judging someone based on their past choices (or lack of choices) could be seen as controlling or disrespectful. But again, if it's his personal preference, is it wrong? In some cultures or religions, preferring a virgin partner is acceptable. However, in modern secular contexts, it's often considered outdated or discriminatory.\n\nThe author argues he doesn't have bad feelings, just loses interest. But the problem might be that his preference is based on a value that stigmatizes women for their sexual history, which is a form of slut-shaming. The fact that others are calling him sexist and controlling might indicate that his preference is seen as enforcing harmful gender norms.\n\nOn the other hand, he's not forcing anyone; he's just choosing not to date people who don't meet his criteria. So maybe it's his choice. However, when it's based on a standard that perpetuates inequality or stigma, it's considered problematic. The line here is between personal preference and discrimination.\n\nIn conclusion, while he's not acting aggressively, his preference does contribute to slut-shaming and sexism by valuing women based on their sexual history and implying that non-virgins are less desirable. Therefore, he might be in the wrong because it's a form of prejudice.\n"
