  "prompt": "Is the person who wrote this in the wrong in the following situation?\n\n\"\"\"\nAITA for rejecting non-virgins?\nWeird question maybe, but anyway! I'm 18 and a guy for context. Let's just jump to the point; I won't date girls who aren't virgins. Every time I've been interested in or flirting with a girl and she mentions not being a virgin I lose all interest in her, and keep my distance. I just do, literally 0% interest if they've had sex before. I don't block them or get mad or anything, I'm totally up for having them as buddies or whatever, but a fair few girls who I've rejected for this reason have gotten really pissed and said I'm \"slutshaming\" and that I'm sexist and controlling and shit. \n\nAre they right? I don't have any bad feelings towards them, it's just that any romantic interest sort of evaporates if they're not virgins, or have had several exes or whatever. I don't want to deal with them after that tbh\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. So, the user is asking if the person who wrote the given situation is in the wrong. The person is a guy who says he doesn't date women who aren't virgins. He mentions that when a girl he's interested in isn't a virgin, he loses all interest, but they can still be friends. However, some of these girls have accused him of slut-shaming, sexism, and being controlling. The user wants to know if he's in the wrong.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the social norms and values around this issue. Virginity is a personal choice, and people have different views about it. In many modern societies, there's a push towards gender equality and personal freedom. Expecting a partner to be a virgin might be seen as holding onto traditional gender roles that can be restrictive. \n\nBut then again, the author isn't forcing anyone. He's choosing not to pursue a romantic relationship, which is his right. The problem arises when his actions are hurtful or discriminatory. The girls he's rejecting feel that he's being sexist and controlling. Even if he doesn't mean to, the perception matters. \n\nSlut-shaming typically involves shaming someone for their sexual history, usually targeting women. If the author is applying a standard that he wouldn't hold a male partner to, that's a form of double standard and could be considered sexist. For example, if he didn't care if a guy had multiple partners but held women to a higher standard, that's problematic. \n\nHowever, the author is clear that he's not being hostile; he's just not interested. But his actions, while not aggressive, still communicate a judgment about women's sexual histories. This can contribute to a culture of shame around sexuality. \n\nOn the other hand, people have the right to set their own boundaries in relationships. If he's being honest about his values and not pressuring others to change, it's his choice. But when it comes to how others react, their feelings are valid. \n\nSo where's the line between personal preference and discrimination? The key point here might be the harm caused. If he's not actively harming them beyond rejection, but the rejection is based on a biased standard, then he might be perpetuating harmful attitudes. The girls feeling shamed and accused of sexism suggest that his behavior is having a negative impact, even if he doesn't intend it.\n\nIn conclusion, while the author isn't breaking any laws or committing a crime, his standards may be rooted in outdated or sexist beliefs. By holding women to a standard that isn't consistently applied to men, he's contributing to gender inequality. Therefore, he might be in the wrong for perpetuating such views, even if he's not directly malicious.\n"
