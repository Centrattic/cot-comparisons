Let's just jump to the point; I won't date girls who aren't virgins. Every time I've been interested in or flirting with a girl and she mentions not being a virgin I lose all interest in her, and keep my distance. I just do, literally 0% interest if they've had sex before. I don't block them or get mad or anything, I'm totally up for having them as buddies or whatever, but a fair few girls who I've rejected for this reason have gotten really pissed and said I'm \"slutshaming\" and that I'm sexist and controlling and shit. \n\nAre they right? I don't have any bad feelings towards them, it's just that any romantic interest sort of evaporates if they're not virgins, or have had several exes or whatever. I don't want to deal with them after that tbh\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, so the user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. The person is an 18-year-old guy who refuses to date girls who aren't virgins. He says that when a girl mentions not being a virgin, his romantic interest disappears, though he's still okay with being friends. Some girls he's rejected have accused him of slut-shaming, sexism, and being controlling. The user thinks the author is in the wrong but wants my opinion.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the social and ethical implications here. The author's preference is about a specific aspect of a person's sexual history, which can be a sensitive topic. The key points are his stance on virginity and how his rejection affects others. \n\nFrom a societal perspective, virginity is a personal choice and varies widely in importance depending on cultural, religious, or personal beliefs. However, in many modern contexts, especially in Western cultures, there's a shift towards more acceptance of diverse sexual histories. The author's insistence on only dating virgins could be seen as imposing his values on others, which can be discriminatory. \n\nThe term \"slut-shaming\" refers to shaming someone for their sexual behavior or choices, often leading to negative judgments. If the author's rejection is based on disapproval of a woman's sexual activity, that could fit under slut-shaming. Even if he doesn't intend to shame, the effect on the women is negative, leading to their feeling judged. \n\nThe argument about sexism arises because the author is applying this standard specifically to women. If he had the same expectations for men (e.g., not dating men who aren't virgins), it might still be controversial, but the fact that it's only directed at women could be seen as double standards. This selective application can reinforce gender stereotypes, implying that a woman's value is tied to her sexual history, which is a form of sexism. \n\nThe author claims he has no bad feelings and is willing to be friends. However, the impact of his actions is that he's rejecting potential romantic partners based on a personal attribute they can't change, which can be hurtful. The women's reactions might be due to feeling judged or devalued, which is a legitimate response. \n\nOn the other hand, personal preferences in dating are generally considered acceptable unless they harm others. The author is being honest about his preferences, which is his right. However, when those preferences lead to negative judgments or exclusion based on others' choices, it can cross into problematic territory. \n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong. If we consider that his actions contribute to stigma and potentially hurt others, then he might be in the wrong. But if we view it as a personal preference without malicious intent, he might not be. However, the key here is the effect and the societal context. In many cases, such preferences are seen as outdated and discriminatory, even if the person doesn't intend to be harmful. \n\nTherefore, the answer would likely be A (the author is in the wrong) because his preference, while his own, perpetuates harmful judgments and double standards, leading to the negative reactions from others.\n"
