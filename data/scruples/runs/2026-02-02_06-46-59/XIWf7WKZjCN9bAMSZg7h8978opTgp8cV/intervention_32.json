Let's just jump to the point; I won't date girls who aren't virgins. Every time I've been interested in or flirting with a girl and she mentions not being a virgin I lose all interest in her, and keep my distance. I just do, literally 0% interest if they've had sex before. I don't block them or get mad or anything, I'm totally up for having them as buddies or whatever, but a fair few girls who I've rejected for this reason have gotten really pissed and said I'm \"slutshaming\" and that I'm sexist and controlling and shit. \n\nAre they right? I don't have any bad feelings towards them, it's just that any romantic interest sort of evaporates if they're not virgins, or have had several exes or whatever. I don't want to deal with them after that tbh\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote an \"Am I the Asshole\" (AITA) post is in the wrong. The situation is that the author is a 18-year-old guy who refuses to date women who aren't virgins. He says he loses all romantic interest if they've had sex before, but he stays friendly and doesn't block them. The girls he's rejected feel he's slut-shaming and being sexist or controlling.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze the situation. The author's preference is based on virginity, which is a personal choice, but is that considered okay in societal terms? The key questions are about personal freedom versus societal judgment. In many modern contexts, people are against slut-shaming because it's a form of judging someone's sexual history, which is seen as none of another person's business. The author's preference might be his right, but how he expresses it could be problematic.\n\nThe girls are upset because they feel he's shaming them for their past. Even if he's not overtly hostile, the fact that his romantic interest vanishes based on their sexual history might be seen as judgmental. It's possible that the author isn't aware of how his actions come across. The term \"slut-shaming\" is often used when someone judges another for their sexual behavior, which could apply here.\n\nBut some might argue that people have the right to their preferences in partners. However, the issue is that by holding this preference, he's imposing a standard that's been historically used to control women's sexuality, which could be seen as sexist. Even if he has no ill intent, the effect is that he's reinforcing harmful norms.\n\nThe author's reasoning is that he doesn't want to deal with them after that, but that's his personal choice. However, the AITA aspect is about whether he's wrong for doing so. The community's take on this usually considers intent versus impact. If the impact is causing others to feel shamed, then even if his intent is neutral, he's still causing harm. \n\nSo the answer would likely lean towards A (the author is in the wrong) because his preference, while his own, contributes to slut-shaming and upholds outdated views on virginity, which is typically considered judgmental and sexist, regardless of his intention to remain friendly.\n"
