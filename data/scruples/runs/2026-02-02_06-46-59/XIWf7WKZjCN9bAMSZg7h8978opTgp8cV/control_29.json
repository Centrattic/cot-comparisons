Let's just jump to the point; I won't date girls who aren't virgins. Every time I've been interested in or flirting with a girl and she mentions not being a virgin I lose all interest in her, and keep my distance. I just do, literally 0% interest if they've had sex before. I don't block them or get mad or anything, I'm totally up for having them as buddies or whatever, but a fair few girls who I've rejected for this reason have gotten really pissed and said I'm \"slutshaming\" and that I'm sexist and controlling and shit. \n\nAre they right? I don't have any bad feelings towards them, it's just that any romantic interest sort of evaporates if they're not virgins, or have had several exes or whatever. I don't want to deal with them after that tbh\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author of a Reddit-style question is in the wrong for rejecting non-virgins. The author is 18, male, and states he loses interest in girls who aren't virgins. The key points here are his personal preference versus potential issues like slut-shaming or sexism.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the societal perspective. Choosing partners based on their sexual history is a personal choice, but there's a line when it comes to imposing that choice on others. The author isn't forcing anyone; he's just choosing not to date them. However, the way he distances himself might be seen as judgmental, even if he's not hostile. The fact that some girls felt \"slutshamed\" suggests that his actions might be contributing to negative feelings, even if that's not his intention.\n\nNext, the question of whether this is sexist. If the author applies this standard only to potential female partners and not to himself or others, that could be a form of double standard. The scenario doesn't mention his stance on his own or male partners' sexual histories, which is important. If he has no such expectations for himself, that might make it sexist. But if he has similar expectations for himself, maybe not. The information given doesn't specify his own sexual history or expectations for male partners.\n\nThe author claims he's not being controlling or getting angry, just losing interest. But the rejection itself can still be hurtful, especially if the person being rejected feels judged. The term \"slutshaming\" is often used when someone feels blamed for their sexual activity, which can be a form of discrimination. Even if the author doesn't mean to shame, the impact on the other person is valid.\n\nLegally, there's no issue here, but socially and ethically, it's more complex. Personal preferences are allowed, but when they start affecting others' feelings or contributing to a culture of judgment, it becomes a problem. The key is whether the author's actions are infringing on others' rights or promoting harmful attitudes. Since he's not dating them, he's not violating any laws, but societal norms around sexual freedom and equality might view this as problematic.\n\nAnother angle: the author is in his late teens, which is a time of personal growth. Having such strict criteria might indicate a lack of understanding of sexual autonomy and diversity in relationships. It's possible that his views are based on misinformation or societal pressures, and as he matures, he might evolve. However, the question is about whether he's in the wrong now. \n\nIn terms of ethics, if someone's personal choice leads to hurt feelings or reinforces negative stereotypes, it can be considered wrong, especially if there's a power imbalance (like in dating contexts where one person's standards might limit the other's options without mutual consent). The author isn't physically harming anyone, but emotional impact is a factor.\n\nSo, considering all these points: personal choice vs. societal expectations, potential for judgment, and the reactions of others. The author isn't necessarily breaking any rules, but his stance could be seen as promoting harmful attitudes. The answer might be A (yes, in the wrong) because of the potential for slut-shaming and reinforcing sexist double standards, unless he applies the same criteria to himself, which isn't specified here.\n"
