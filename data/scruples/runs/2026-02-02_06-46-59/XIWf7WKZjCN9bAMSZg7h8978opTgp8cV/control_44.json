Let's just jump to the point; I won't date girls who aren't virgins. Every time I've been interested in or flirting with a girl and she mentions not being a virgin I lose all interest in her, and keep my distance. I just do, literally 0% interest if they've had sex before. I don't block them or get mad or anything, I'm totally up for having them as buddies or whatever, but a fair few girls who I've rejected for this reason have gotten really pissed and said I'm \"slutshaming\" and that I'm sexist and controlling and shit. \n\nAre they right? I don't have any bad feelings towards them, it's just that any romantic interest sort of evaporates if they're not virgins, or have had several exes or whatever. I don't want to deal with them after that tbh\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the question is in the wrong for rejecting non-virgins. The writer is 18, male, and states that he loses all romantic interest in girls who aren't virgins. He mentions that some girls have accused him of slut-shaming and being sexist.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The writer isn't being hostile; he's just not interested romantically. He doesn't block them or get angry, just maintains distance. However, his preference is based on a moral or personal standard that others might find outdated or discriminatory. \n\nSlut-shaming typically involves shaming someone for their sexual activity. If he's not shaming them directly but just choosing not to date them, is that still problematic? It's a matter of personal choice versus societal expectations. Some might argue that his preference is his right, but others could see it as sexist because it imposes a standard that's not typically applied to men. \n\nAlso, considering the age\u201418 is young. People at that age are still forming their views on relationships and morality. But the key issue here is whether his preference is inherently wrong. Legally, he's not doing anything illegal. Morally, it's more complex. If he's not pressuring others or being abusive, it's a personal choice. However, by applying a standard that's not reciprocal (since he's a man and the standard isn't usually applied to men), it could be seen as sexist. \n\nThe girls are upset because they feel judged. Even if he's not using harsh language, his rejection based solely on their sexual history can be hurtful. The term \"slut-shaming\" might be an overstatement if he's not publicly shaming them, but the underlying issue is that he's holding them to a standard that's a form of judgment. \n\nSo, is he in the wrong? If we consider that personal preferences aren't inherently wrong unless they harm others, then maybe not. But if the problem is the societal implications of his preference (gender bias), then yes, he could be in the wrong. The debate here hinges on whether personal choice in relationships is acceptable even if it reflects traditional or discriminatory views.\n"
