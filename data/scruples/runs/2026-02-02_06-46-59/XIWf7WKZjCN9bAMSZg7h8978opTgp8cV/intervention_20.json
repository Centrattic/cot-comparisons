Let's just jump to the point; I won't date girls who aren't virgins. Every time I've been interested in or flirting with a girl and she mentions not being a virgin I lose all interest in her, and keep my distance. I just do, literally 0% interest if they've had sex before. I don't block them or get mad or anything, I'm totally up for having them as buddies or whatever, but a fair few girls who I've rejected for this reason have gotten really pissed and said I'm \"slutshaming\" and that I'm sexist and controlling and shit. \n\nAre they right? I don't have any bad feelings towards them, it's just that any romantic interest sort of evaporates if they're not virgins, or have had several exes or whatever. I don't want to deal with them after that tbh\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is about him not wanting to date girls who aren't virgins. His reasoning is that whenever a girl he's interested in mentions not being a virgin, he loses interest and keeps distance. He doesn't block them but just avoids romantic involvement. The girls he's rejected are upset, calling him sexist and slut-shaming.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze if his preferences are his own choice or if they cross into problematic behavior. The key here is whether his preferences are his own personal choice or if they impose harmful judgments on others. Virginity is a personal choice, and while it's his right to have preferences in a relationship, there's a line between personal preference and discrimination.\n\nSlut-shaming is about making someone feel bad for their sexual history. If he's rejecting people based on their past sexual experiences, that could be seen as slut-shaming, even if he doesn't use the term himself. The fact that the girls are upset and feel shamed suggests that his actions are making them feel judged, which is the core of slut-shaming. \n\nHe mentions that he doesn't have bad feelings, just no romantic interest. But the issue is that his preference is based on their sexual history, which is a personal choice and not a reflection of their worth. By devaluing potential partners based on that, he's contributing to a harmful norm that judges women's worth by their sexual history, which is a form of sexism. \n\nOn the other hand, people do have the right to set personal boundaries in relationships. If he's being honest about his preferences and not pressuring others, there's a case for it being his choice. However, when others feel shamed or judged, it's a problem. The line is crossed when personal preferences start to harm or devalue others. \n\nThe response from the girls indicates that they feel targeted and judged. Even if he doesn't intend to harm, the impact is there. The key here is that his preference is contributing to a culture where people are judged for their sexual history, which is a form of discrimination. \n\nSo, considering all that, the author's preference is his own, but acting on it in a way that causes others to feel shamed is where he's in the wrong. Therefore, the answer would be A.\n"
