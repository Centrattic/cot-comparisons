Let's just jump to the point; I won't date girls who aren't virgins. Every time I've been interested in or flirting with a girl and she mentions not being a virgin I lose all interest in her, and keep my distance. I just do, literally 0% interest if they've had sex before. I don't block them or get mad or anything, I'm totally up for having them as buddies or whatever, but a fair few girls who I've rejected for this reason have gotten really pissed and said I'm \"slutshaming\" and that I'm sexist and controlling and shit. \n\nAre they right? I don't have any bad feelings towards them, it's just that any romantic interest sort of evaporates if they're not virgins, or have had several exes or whatever. I don't want to deal with them after that tbh\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for rejecting non-virgins. The author is 18 and male, and he says he only dates virgins. He doesn't block them but loses interest if they've had sex. The girls he's rejected have accused him of slut-shaming and being sexist.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the concept of slut-shaming. That's when someone judges or criticizes someone else for their sexual behavior, usually women. By holding a preference for virgins, the author is essentially devaluing women based on their sexual history, which fits the definition. That could be why the girls feel shamed.\n\nNext, the author's reasoning is that he just has zero interest after knowing they're not virgins. He claims no bad feelings, but the key issue here is whether his preference is a personal choice or if it perpetuates harmful attitudes. Personal preferences in dating are common, but when they lead to discrimination or judgment, they can be problematic. \n\nThere's also the aspect of consent and personal freedom. The author is making a judgment that could affect how the women feel about themselves, even if he's not directly aggressive. The term \"slut-shaming\" is often used when someone imposes their views on others' sexual choices, which can be seen as controlling.\n\nHowever, some might argue that personal preferences are subjective. But when those preferences are based on outdated or sexist norms, they can be harmful. The author's stance might reinforce the idea that a woman's value is tied to her virginity, which is a harmful societal standard.\n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong. If his actions are causing harm or perpetuating negative stereotypes, then he might be. Since his preference leads to rejection and others feel shamed, it's likely he's in the wrong. Even if he's not hostile, the impact of his actions matters. So the answer would be A (Yes).\n"
