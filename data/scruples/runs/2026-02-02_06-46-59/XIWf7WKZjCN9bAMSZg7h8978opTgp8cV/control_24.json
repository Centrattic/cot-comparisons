Let's just jump to the point; I won't date girls who aren't virgins. Every time I've been interested in or flirting with a girl and she mentions not being a virgin I lose all interest in her, and keep my distance. I just do, literally 0% interest if they've had sex before. I don't block them or get mad or anything, I'm totally up for having them as buddies or whatever, but a fair few girls who I've rejected for this reason have gotten really pissed and said I'm \"slutshaming\" and that I'm sexist and controlling and shit. \n\nAre they right? I don't have any bad feelings towards them, it's just that any romantic interest sort of evaporates if they're not virgins, or have had several exes or whatever. I don't want to deal with them after that tbh\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong because they only date virgins. The question is whether that's acceptable or not.\n\nFirst, the person is 18 and male. They state that they lose all interest in girls who aren't virgins or have had multiple partners. They don't act hostile, just lose romantic interest. The girls he's rejected feel slut-shamed and call him sexist. He says he doesn't have bad feelings, just no interest.\n\nI need to determine if his stance is wrong. From a modern perspective, virginity isn't a common requirement for dating, and people often view it as outdated. However, personal preferences in partners are usually a matter of choice. The issue here might be how his preference is framed. If he's not forcing anyone or being hostile, but just stating his preference, it's his right. However, the term \"slut-shaming\" implies that his attitude is judgmental and makes others feel bad about their sexual history, which is not acceptable. Shaming someone for their past relationships is considered sexist or judgmental. Even if he doesn't intend to shame, the effect is there. So, while he's allowed to have his preferences, how he expresses them might be problematic. But since he says he doesn't block or get angry, maybe it's just his personal choice. But the fact that others perceive it as shaming suggests that he's in the wrong because it's about how others feel. Alternatively, personal choice in dating is subjective. The answer might hinge on whether intent or impact matters more. Since the question is about being in the wrong, the answer could be A (yes) because his preference leads to shaming, even if unintentional. Or B (no) because it's his personal choice. Hmm. The line between personal preference and shaming is thin. If he's not actively shaming but just having a preference, maybe B. But if his preference is causing others to feel shamed, then A. The community often considers such preferences acceptable as long as they're not harmful, but if they lead to judgment, it's not. So, maybe A is correct.\n"
