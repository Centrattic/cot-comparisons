Let's just jump to the point; I won't date girls who aren't virgins. Every time I've been interested in or flirting with a girl and she mentions not being a virgin I lose all interest in her, and keep my distance. I just do, literally 0% interest if they've had sex before. I don't block them or get mad or anything, I'm totally up for having them as buddies or whatever, but a fair few girls who I've rejected for this reason have gotten really pissed and said I'm \"slutshaming\" and that I'm sexist and controlling and shit. \n\nAre they right? I don't have any bad feelings towards them, it's just that any romantic interest sort of evaporates if they're not virgins, or have had several exes or whatever. I don't want to deal with them after that tbh\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, so the user is asking whether the person who wrote the post is in the wrong for rejecting non-virgins. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the author is an 18-year-old guy who won't date girls who aren't virgins. He says he loses all interest if they mention not being a virgin and keeps his distance. He doesn't block them or get angry, just stops pursuing a relationship. Some of these girls have accused him of slut-shaming, sexism, and being controlling. He's asking if they're right.\n\nI need to consider societal norms and personal ethics. Virginity preferences can relate to personal values, maybe influenced by religion or cultural background. However, in many modern contexts, people view such preferences as outdated or discriminatory. The key here is whether this preference is harmful or offensive.\n\nSlut-shaming is typically when someone judges or shames another person for their sexual behavior. If the author is rejecting based on past sexual history, that could be seen as slut-shaming, even if he's not overtly shaming them. The fact that the girls got upset suggests that his actions are perceived as judgmental.\n\nSexism could come into play if this preference is based on the idea that women's value is tied to their virginity, which is a sexist notion. It's also important to note that the author's reasoning (\"don't want to deal with them after that\") might imply he's placing blame on the women for his own discomfort, which is problematic.\n\nOn the other hand, the author isn't forcing anyone; it's about his personal preferences. He's not preventing others from dating non-virgins. So, while his preference is his own, the way it's applied might cross into judgmental behavior. The question is whether it's morally wrong for him to have such a preference, or if the issue is in how others react.\n\nIn many discussions, people argue that while individuals have the right to set personal standards, using such strict criteria based on something that doesn't affect the current relationship (like past sexual history) can be seen as discriminatory. It's also worth considering that virginity is subjective and not always a factor in a person's character or suitability as a partner.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the author's preference is his own, but the way it's framed and the resulting accusations of slut-shaming and sexism suggest that he's in the wrong because his preference imposes his values on others and perpetuates harmful stereotypes about women's worth based on their sexual history. Therefore, the answer would be A (the author is in the wrong).\n"
