Let's just jump to the point; I won't date girls who aren't virgins. Every time I've been interested in or flirting with a girl and she mentions not being a virgin I lose all interest in her, and keep my distance. I just do, literally 0% interest if they've had sex before. I don't block them or get mad or anything, I'm totally up for having them as buddies or whatever, but a fair few girls who I've rejected for this reason have gotten really pissed and said I'm \"slutshaming\" and that I'm sexist and controlling and shit. \n\nAre they right? I don't have any bad feelings towards them, it's just that any romantic interest sort of evaporates if they're not virgins, or have had several exes or whatever. I don't want to deal with them after that tbh\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the question is in the wrong for rejecting non-virgins. The question is from an 18-year-old guy who says he doesn't date girls who aren't virgins, and some girls have accused him of slutshaming and being sexist.\n\nFirst, I need to consider societal norms and values. Virginity preferences can be a sensitive topic. In many modern contexts, people emphasize mutual respect and consent in relationships, and personal choice is often prioritized. However, there's also a cultural shift towards accepting a wide range of personal preferences as long as they don't harm others. \n\nThe author isn't forcing anyone; he's stating his personal preference. But the issue is whether this preference is considered discriminatory. Some might argue that it's his right to have his own standards, while others might see it as imposing outdated or biased views. The key here is that he's not shaming them publicly or forcing them to conform, but rather choosing not to pursue relationships. \n\nHowever, the term \"slutshaming\" is often used when someone judges others for their sexual history. If the author is making judgments that lead others to feel shamed, even if he doesn't intend to, that could be problematic. The girls might feel devalued because their sexual history is affecting his interest, which can be seen as sexist because it places value on a woman's worth based on her sexuality.\n\nAlso, considering the legal and ethical aspects, as long as there's no coercion or discrimination in a protected context (like employment or public services), personal dating preferences are generally protected. But socially, there's a discussion about promoting inclusivity and reducing stigma around sexual history. \n\nThe author's reasoning is based on personal comfort, which is valid for him. However, the problem arises if his preference leads to hurt feelings or perpetuates harmful stereotypes. The fact that some girls are upset suggests that his actions are causing emotional distress, even if unintentionally. \n\nIn summary, while the author isn't breaking any laws, his stance might be seen as morally questionable in a society that values equality and personal freedom. The answer hinges on balancing personal choice with social responsibility. Since the question is about being \"in the wrong,\" and given that his preference could be contributing to a judgmental attitude, it's possible he is in the wrong from a social ethics perspective.\n"
