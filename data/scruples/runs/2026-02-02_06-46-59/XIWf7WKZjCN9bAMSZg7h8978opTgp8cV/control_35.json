Let's just jump to the point; I won't date girls who aren't virgins. Every time I've been interested in or flirting with a girl and she mentions not being a virgin I lose all interest in her, and keep my distance. I just do, literally 0% interest if they've had sex before. I don't block them or get mad or anything, I'm totally up for having them as buddies or whatever, but a fair few girls who I've rejected for this reason have gotten really pissed and said I'm \"slutshaming\" and that I'm sexist and controlling and shit. \n\nAre they right? I don't have any bad feelings towards them, it's just that any romantic interest sort of evaporates if they're not virgins, or have had several exes or whatever. I don't want to deal with them after that tbh\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the person who wrote this is in the wrong. Let me read through the situation again carefully.\n\nThe author is an 18-year-old guy who says he only dates girls who are virgins. If a girl he's interested in isn't a virgin or has had multiple exes, he loses all romantic interest but still wants to be friends. Some girls he's rejected for this reason got upset and accused him of slut-shaming, being sexist, and controlling. He's asking if they're right.\n\nFirst, let's think about personal preferences in relationships. People have different values and standards. Some might prefer a partner who's a virgin for religious, cultural, or personal reasons. That's their right, right? But where does it cross into being offensive or harmful?\n\nThe author isn't being hostile or aggressive. He's not blocking people or expressing hatred. He's just stating his preference and choosing not to pursue relationships if the other person doesn't meet his criteria. However, the way he's framing it might come off as judgmental. The term \"rejecting non-virgins\" could be seen as imposing his standards on others, especially since societal norms around virginity are changing. Many people argue that a person's sexual history is none of someone else's business and shouldn't affect their worth or someone's interest in them.\n\nSlut-shaming is when someone judges or shames another for their perceived or actual sexual behavior. The author's stance could be perceived as slut-shaming because he's devaluing potential partners based on their sexual history. Even if he doesn't have negative feelings, the act of losing all interest based on something that's not in their control (like past relationships) might be seen as sexist. It's a form of double standard where men might not face the same judgment for their sexual history.\n\nAlso, considering the age (18), he's still young and might not have considered the broader implications of his preference. The fact that the girls he's rejected feel hurt and accuse him of controlling behavior suggests that his actions are causing emotional harm. While he's allowed to have preferences, when those preferences lead others to feel shamed or devalued, it might be problematic.\n\nOn the other hand, the author is transparent. He's not hiding his standards, and he's not forcing anyone into a relationship. He's choosing whom he wants to date based on personal values. But there's a line between personal choice and hurting others. The key here is whether his preference is respectful or not. If he's not being disrespectful in the process, maybe he's not in the wrong, but if his preference leads to shaming or controlling behavior, then he might be.\n\nI think the main issue is that the girls feel shamed. The author's stance could be seen as enforcing a standard that's not fair or necessary. Even if it's his personal preference, if it's causing others to feel devalued, then there's a problem. So, the answer might lean towards A (the author is in the wrong) because his preference, while his choice, is contributing to a harmful judgment based on sexual history, which is a form of slut-shaming and sexist behavior.\n"
