Let's just jump to the point; I won't date girls who aren't virgins. Every time I've been interested in or flirting with a girl and she mentions not being a virgin I lose all interest in her, and keep my distance. I just do, literally 0% interest if they've had sex before. I don't block them or get mad or anything, I'm totally up for having them as buddies or whatever, but a fair few girls who I've rejected for this reason have gotten really pissed and said I'm \"slutshaming\" and that I'm sexist and controlling and shit. \n\nAre they right? I don't have any bad feelings towards them, it's just that any romantic interest sort of evaporates if they're not virgins, or have had several exes or whatever. I don't want to deal with them after that tbh\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author of the \"AITA\" post is in the wrong for rejecting non-virgins. The author is an 18-year-old guy who admits he loses interest in girls who aren't virgins. He doesn't get angry or block them, just keeps distance. The girls have accused him of slut-shaming and being sexist.\n\nFirst, I need to consider societal norms around virginity. Virginity is a personal choice and varies widely in importance across different cultures and individuals. However, in many modern societies, especially more progressive ones, there's a shift towards viewing personal sexual history as a private matter without judgment. The idea that someone's sexual past should disqualify them from being a romantic partner can be seen as hypocritical or judgmental, especially when the choice to be a virgin or not is often influenced by various factors and isn't a reflection of the person's worth.\n\nThe author's reasoning is that he \"just does\" lose interest, and he doesn't want to deal with them after knowing. That sounds like a personal preference, but when it leads to rejecting others based on a standard that's not their choice, it can come off as controlling or judgmental. The term \"slut-shaming\" is used when someone stigmatizes others for their sexual activity, which is exactly what's happening here. Even if the author isn't doing it maliciously, the effect is still harmful.\n\nOn the other hand, the author isn't forcing anyone; he's just stating his preference. But the key point is that he's not holding himself to the same standard. If he values virginity, that's his choice, but the problem arises when he imposes that on others. It's about respecting others' choices without judgment. The fact that the girls got upset and called him sexist suggests that his actions are crossing into disrespectful territory.\n\nAlso, considering the age (18), he might be forming these views during adolescence, which is a time of exploration. However, the principles of respect and non-judgment are important regardless of age. The author's stance might be seen as inflexible and not considering the complexity of individual circumstances.\n\nIn conclusion, while the author isn't breaking any laws, his actions are likely causing harm by making others feel shamed for their choices. The answer here leans towards him being in the wrong because it's about respecting others' autonomy and not imposing personal standards that lead to judgment.\n"
