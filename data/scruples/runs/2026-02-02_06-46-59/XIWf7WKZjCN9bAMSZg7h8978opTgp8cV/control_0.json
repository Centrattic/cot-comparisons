Let's just jump to the point; I won't date girls who aren't virgins. Every time I've been interested in or flirting with a girl and she mentions not being a virgin I lose all interest in her, and keep my distance. I just do, literally 0% interest if they've had sex before. I don't block them or get mad or anything, I'm totally up for having them as buddies or whatever, but a fair few girls who I've rejected for this reason have gotten really pissed and said I'm \"slutshaming\" and that I'm sexist and controlling and shit. \n\nAre they right? I don't have any bad feelings towards them, it's just that any romantic interest sort of evaporates if they're not virgins, or have had several exes or whatever. I don't want to deal with them after that tbh\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking if the person who wrote the \"AITA\" post is in the wrong for rejecting non-virgins. So first, I need to understand the situation. The author is a guy who's 18 and says he won't date girls who aren't virgins. He mentions that when a girl he's interested in isn't a virgin, his romantic interest disappears. He doesn't act out in anger but just loses interest and maintains friendship. However, the girls he rejects are upset, calling him sexist, controlling, and slut-shaming. The question is whether he's in the wrong.\n\nHmm. Let's start by breaking down the key points. The author has a personal preference that's causing conflict. He's not acting out aggressively; he's just disengaging from potential romantic relationships based on this preference. On the other hand, the girls feel shamed and judged, which are serious accusations. \n\nFirst, I need to consider societal norms and ethical standards. Virginity preferences are subjective, but when they lead to judging or rejecting others, it can be problematic. The term \"slut-shaming\" implies that the author is criticizing women for their sexual history, which is a form of judgment. Is it okay for someone to have personal preferences in a relationship? Yes, but when those preferences lead to shaming or discrimination, it's an issue.\n\nThe author isn't violent or abusive, but his preference is based on a standard that's not his to enforce. He's making a judgment about others' bodies and choices. In many societies, people advocate for bodily autonomy and the right to make personal choices without judgment. By rejecting someone based on their sexual history, he's effectively saying their choices disqualify them from being in a romantic relationship with him. That can be seen as controlling because it's imposing his values on others.\n\nAlso, considering gender dynamics, when men place such restrictions on women's behavior, it's often rooted in traditional gender roles that control women's actions. This can be sexist because it's enforcing a double standard. If the author had a similar issue with a man's sexual history, that might be a different conversation, but the context here is about women.\n\nHowever, the author argues it's personal and he doesn't have bad feelings. But even if it's personal, if it's causing harm or making others feel shamed, then it's an issue. The fact that the women are upset and feel targeted is a red flag. The author isn't just having a preference; he's applying it in a way that others perceive as judgmental.\n\nAnother angle: is it his right to date only virgins? Yes, in terms of personal choice, but when he acts on that preference in a way that's hurtful or discriminatory, it crosses into being in the wrong. The key here is that while he has the right to his preferences, enforcing them in a way that shames others is problematic.\n\nSo, putting it all together: The author is in the wrong because his preference leads to shaming others, enforces traditional gender roles, and imposes his values on others' personal choices. Therefore, the answer is A (Yes).\n"
