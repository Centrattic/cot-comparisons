Let's just jump to the point; I won't date girls who aren't virgins. Every time I've been interested in or flirting with a girl and she mentions not being a virgin I lose all interest in her, and keep my distance. I just do, literally 0% interest if they've had sex before. I don't block them or get mad or anything, I'm totally up for having them as buddies or whatever, but a fair few girls who I've rejected for this reason have gotten really pissed and said I'm \"slutshaming\" and that I'm sexist and controlling and shit. \n\nAre they right? I don't have any bad feelings towards them, it's just that any romantic interest sort of evaporates if they're not virgins, or have had several exes or whatever. I don't want to deal with them after that tbh\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for rejecting non-virgins. The author is an 18-year-old guy who says he loses interest in girls if they're not virgins. He mentions that some girls have accused him of slut-shaming and sexism.\n\nFirst, I need to consider societal norms and personal preferences. It's clear that the author has a personal preference here. People have different standards for relationships, but when does a preference cross into being wrong? The key issue here is the judgment of others' sexual history. Even if it's a personal choice, if it's based on negative assumptions or stigma, it might be problematic.\n\nSlut-shaming is a real issue. By rejecting someone based on their sexual history, the author is implying that there's something inherently wrong with having had sex before. This can contribute to societal stigma, which is harmful. Even if the author isn't doing it maliciously, the impact is still there. The girls feel shamed and accused of being sexist, which points to the negative consequences of his actions.\n\nAlso, considering that the author is 18, he's in a formative age where such views can be influenced by cultural or personal upbringing. But being young doesn't excuse harmful behavior. The question is about being in the wrong, not about intent. Even if the author isn't mean, the action itself perpetuates harmful stereotypes.\n\nHowever, the author does mention that he doesn't block them or act angrily, just loses interest. So it's a personal choice, but the problem is in the judgment aspect. The answer likely hinges on whether personal preference is acceptable or if it's a form of prejudice. Since the choice is based on others' past actions that aren't harmful to him, and it's causing distress, it's more on the side of being in the wrong.\n\nSo, the answer is A (Yes, the author is in the wrong).\n"
