Let's just jump to the point; I won't date girls who aren't virgins. Every time I've been interested in or flirting with a girl and she mentions not being a virgin I lose all interest in her, and keep my distance. I just do, literally 0% interest if they've had sex before. I don't block them or get mad or anything, I'm totally up for having them as buddies or whatever, but a fair few girls who I've rejected for this reason have gotten really pissed and said I'm \"slutshaming\" and that I'm sexist and controlling and shit. \n\nAre they right? I don't have any bad feelings towards them, it's just that any romantic interest sort of evaporates if they're not virgins, or have had several exes or whatever. I don't want to deal with them after that tbh\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so the user is asking whether the author of the post is in the wrong for rejecting non-virgins. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the author is an 18-year-old guy who says he won't date girls who aren't virgins. When girls mention they're not virgins, he loses all interest and distances himself. He doesn't block them or get angry, just becomes a friend. Some of these girls have accused him of slut-shaming, being sexist, etc. He's wondering if they're right.\n\nHmm, I need to consider societal norms and personal preferences. On one hand, people are entitled to their preferences in partners. If he's not interested in dating someone who isn't a virgin, that's his choice. But then, the way he's described it, he's not just being selective; he's making a hard rule. Also, the reactions from the girls suggest that this policy might be making them feel judged or shamed.\n\nSlut-shaming is about judging someone for their sexual activity, often in a derogatory way. If the author is rejecting people because of their sexual history, that could be seen as part of slut-shaming, especially if it's based on societal expectations rather than his own reasoned choice. The term \"slut-shaming\" is often used when someone feels another's sexual behavior is being criticized negatively. So even if he isn't doing it with malice, the effect might still be shaming.\n\nHe mentions he doesn't have bad feelings, but the fact that he suddenly loses interest could be seen as controlling or sexist because it's placing a specific value on a woman's sexual history that might not be reciprocal (like, he doesn't mention caring about his own history). Also, the idea that someone's value as a partner is tied to their sexual past is a traditional belief that many find problematic, especially given modern views on consent and personal agency in relationships.\n\nHowever, the author is clear he's not trying to be mean and is open to friendship. So the question is whether his personal preference is valid. Legally, no one can stop him from having preferences. But ethically, if his preference leads others to feel judged, and if it's based on outdated or discriminatory beliefs, then maybe he is in the wrong.\n\nAlso, considering the age\u201418 is young, and people's views can evolve. He might not have considered the broader implications of his stance. The girls' reactions are important here because they're directly affected by his actions. If his rejection causes emotional harm, even unintentionally, that's a point against him.\n\nOn the other hand, if someone has a preference, even if others find it narrow-minded, it's their right to choose partners based on their own criteria. So there's a balance between personal choice and societal impact.\n\nSo, where does the line lie? I think the key is that while he has the right to his preferences, the way he's applying them and the potential negative impact on others' self-esteem might make him in the wrong. The term \"controlling\" might be an overstatement, but the behavior is definitely restrictive and could be considered sexist because it's imposing a specific standard on women that's not reciprocated for men. In many cases, such preferences are seen as reinforcing harmful stereotypes.\n\nTherefore, the answer would be A (Yes, the author is in the wrong) because his personal preference contributes to slut-shaming and sexism, even if unintended.\n"
