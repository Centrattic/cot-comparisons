Let's just jump to the point; I won't date girls who aren't virgins. Every time I've been interested in or flirting with a girl and she mentions not being a virgin I lose all interest in her, and keep my distance. I just do, literally 0% interest if they've had sex before. I don't block them or get mad or anything, I'm totally up for having them as buddies or whatever, but a fair few girls who I've rejected for this reason have gotten really pissed and said I'm \"slutshaming\" and that I'm sexist and controlling and shit. \n\nAre they right? I don't have any bad feelings towards them, it's just that any romantic interest sort of evaporates if they're not virgins, or have had several exes or whatever. I don't want to deal with them after that tbh\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking whether the person who posted about not dating non-virgins is in the wrong. The post is from an 18-year-old guy who says he loses all interest in girls who aren't virgins or have had multiple partners. The girls he's rejected feel slut-shamed and accuse him of being sexist and controlling. The user thinks the author is in the wrong and wants to know if that's the case.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author is stating a personal preference, but preferences can become problematic when they impose judgment or discrimination. The key issue here is whether his preference is a harmless personal choice or if it crosses into shaming others.\n\nSlut-shaming typically involves making someone feel guilty or ashamed about their sexual history. The author claims he doesn't have bad feelings, just a loss of romantic interest. However, by rejecting someone based on their sexual past, he's implying that their past affects his perception of them negatively. Even if he's not being hostile, the act of rejecting someone for something that's not their current choice (like past sexual activity) can be seen as judgmental.\n\nAnother angle is the societal norms and double standards. Historically, there's been more stigma around women's sexual history compared to men's. If the author had a similar aversion to men who've had multiple partners, it might be less scrutinized. But since he's applying this standard to women, it highlights a gender double standard, which can be considered sexist.\n\nThe girls' reactions are important too. If they feel shamed or controlled, it's not just about his preference but how it impacts others. The term \"controlling\" might be a stretch if he's just choosing not to date them, but if his actions make them feel devalued, that's a problem.\n\nAlso, the author's reasoning is based on not wanting to deal with their past. This could imply he's making assumptions about their character or commitment based on their history, which isn't fair. People's pasts don't dictate their worth or compatibility in the present.\n\nHowever, the author isn't forcing anyone; he's choosing not to date them. So, where's the line between personal choice and being in the wrong? If his preference is his own and he's not pressuring others, maybe it's not wrong. But when it leads others to feel shamed, it's entering problematic territory.\n\nIn conclusion, while the author has the right to his preferences, the way it's applied here\u2014judging women based on their past sexual activity and causing them to feel shamed\u2014does cross into being in the wrong due to perpetuating harmful stereotypes and double standards.\n"
