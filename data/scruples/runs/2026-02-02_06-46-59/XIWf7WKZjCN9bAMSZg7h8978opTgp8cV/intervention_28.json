Let's just jump to the point; I won't date girls who aren't virgins. Every time I've been interested in or flirting with a girl and she mentions not being a virgin I lose all interest in her, and keep my distance. I just do, literally 0% interest if they've had sex before. I don't block them or get mad or anything, I'm totally up for having them as buddies or whatever, but a fair few girls who I've rejected for this reason have gotten really pissed and said I'm \"slutshaming\" and that I'm sexist and controlling and shit. \n\nAre they right? I don't have any bad feelings towards them, it's just that any romantic interest sort of evaporates if they're not virgins, or have had several exes or whatever. I don't want to deal with them after that tbh\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the post is in the wrong for rejecting non-virgins. The situation is that the author, an 18-year-old guy, refuses to date women who aren't virgins and claims it's not out of malice but a lack of romantic interest. The girls he's rejected have accused him of slut-shaming, sexism, and controlling behavior.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the arguments from both sides. The author's perspective is that it's a personal preference. He's not being hostile, just not interested in relationships with non-virgins. He's open to being friends, which might suggest he doesn't have negative feelings towards them beyond the romantic context. \n\nOn the other hand, the girls feel hurt and accuse him of slut-shaming. That term refers to the act of judging or disapproving a person, especially a woman, for being sexually active. It's often tied to double standards where similar judgments aren't applied to men. The key here is whether the author's preference perpetuates harmful stereotypes or contributes to a judgmental attitude towards women's sexual histories.\n\nLegally, there's no wrong in having personal preferences, but socially and ethically, it's more complex. The author is making a judgment based on a specific criterion that may not be relevant to the qualities he's looking for in a partner. It could be seen as sexist if it's based on the idea that a woman's worth as a partner is tied to her sexual history, which is a problematic notion. \n\nThe author claims it's not about bad feelings but lack of interest. However, imposing such strict criteria can be limiting and may stem from societal norms rather than genuine compatibility. It's also worth noting that virginity isn't a standard that men are typically judged by in the same way, so there's a double standard at play here.\n\nIn terms of consent and personal choice, the author is choosing not to date certain people, which he has the right to do. However, the reaction from the women suggests that this choice is causing harm, so it's a matter of whether the right to personal preference outweighs the potential for causing distress. \n\nAnother angle is the concept of respect. Even if it's a personal preference, if it's leading others to feel shamed or judged, it might be considered inconsiderate. The author might need to reflect on whether his preference is based on genuine values or societal conditioning. \n\nI should also consider cultural context. In some cultures, virginity is still highly valued, but in many modern societies, it's less of a focus. The author's stance might be more aligned with traditional views, but that doesn't necessarily make it right in a progressive context. \n\nUltimately, while the author isn't breaking any laws, the ethical question is about the impact of his preferences on others and whether they contribute to harmful attitudes. The key points are the judgmental nature of the preference, the double standard, and the emotional impact on those rejected. \n\nGiven that the author's actions are causing upset and could be reinforcing negative stereotypes, it's more likely that he is in the wrong. The answer would be A (Yes, the author is in the wrong).\n"
