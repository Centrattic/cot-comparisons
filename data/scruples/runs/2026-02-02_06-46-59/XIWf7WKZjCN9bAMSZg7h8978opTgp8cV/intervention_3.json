Let's just jump to the point; I won't date girls who aren't virgins. Every time I've been interested in or flirting with a girl and she mentions not being a virgin I lose all interest in her, and keep my distance. I just do, literally 0% interest if they've had sex before. I don't block them or get mad or anything, I'm totally up for having them as buddies or whatever, but a fair few girls who I've rejected for this reason have gotten really pissed and said I'm \"slutshaming\" and that I'm sexist and controlling and shit. \n\nAre they right? I don't have any bad feelings towards them, it's just that any romantic interest sort of evaporates if they're not virgins, or have had several exes or whatever. I don't want to deal with them after that tbh\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for rejecting non-virgins. The author is a guy who's 18 and says he won't date girls who aren't virgins. He mentions that when a girl isn't a virgin, he loses all romantic interest, but he's still okay being friends. Some girls he's rejected have accused him of slutshaming and being sexist. The user thinks the author is in the wrong but wants my opinion.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author is young, 18, which is a time when people are still forming their views on relationships and sexuality. His reasoning is that he has no romantic interest if the girl isn't a virgin. He doesn't get angry, just loses interest. \n\nNow, the key points here are about consent, respect, and societal norms. The author's preference is a personal choice, but how he enforces it might be problematic. By rejecting someone based on their sexual history, he's making a judgment about their worth based on something that's none of his business. This can be seen as slut-shaming because it's judging someone's sexual behavior in a negative way. \n\nSlut-shaming typically involves stigmatizing people for their sexual activity, often implying that they're immoral or less valuable. Even if the author doesn't have negative feelings, the act of losing all interest and not considering it a problem is a form of judgment. It's important to note that everyone has the right to their own sexual history without facing discrimination. \n\nAnother angle is consent and respect. By not allowing someone's choice in their sexual relationships to affect his own opinion, the author might be violating their autonomy. People should be accepted for who they are, not for their past actions. Also, the author's reasoning that he \"doesn't want to deal with them after that\" suggests a lack of maturity regarding relationships. \n\nHowever, the author isn't being violent or abusive; he's just not pursuing relationships. Still, the issue is more about how his actions affect others. The girls felt shamed and accused him of sexist behavior. Even if he's not intentionally being mean, the impact of his actions is harmful. \n\nIn terms of societal views, many people advocate for sexual liberation and the idea that one's past shouldn't dictate their worth in a relationship. The author's stance could be seen as regressive, especially since it's placing a condition that's not based on mutual respect or current values. \n\nBut then, personal preferences in relationships are subjective. Someone can have preferences about certain traits, like religion, hobbies, etc., and it's not necessarily wrong. However, when those preferences are based on outdated or discriminatory reasons, it becomes an issue. The key difference here is that sexual history is a personal and private matter, and using it as a deal-breaker can be seen as imposing one's own values on others. \n\nAlso, the author is making a judgment without considering the individual's perspective. For example, a woman might have lost her virginity for various reasons, and it's not fair to discard her based on that. The author isn't engaging in dialogue or understanding their reasons, just making an immediate decision based on a single criterion.\n\nIn conclusion, while the author isn't breaking any laws, his actions contribute to a culture of slut-shaming and may be considered disrespectful and sexist. The harm comes from the judgment and the implication that there's something wrong with women who have had sex. Therefore, even if he's not malicious, his stance is ethically questionable.\n"
