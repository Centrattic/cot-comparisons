Let's just jump to the point; I won't date girls who aren't virgins. Every time I've been interested in or flirting with a girl and she mentions not being a virgin I lose all interest in her, and keep my distance. I just do, literally 0% interest if they've had sex before. I don't block them or get mad or anything, I'm totally up for having them as buddies or whatever, but a fair few girls who I've rejected for this reason have gotten really pissed and said I'm \"slutshaming\" and that I'm sexist and controlling and shit. \n\nAre they right? I don't have any bad feelings towards them, it's just that any romantic interest sort of evaporates if they're not virgins, or have had several exes or whatever. I don't want to deal with them after that tbh\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the prompt is in the wrong for rejecting non-virgins. The author is a guy who says he can't date women who've had sex before. He claims it's not about being angry but just losing interest. Others called him sexist and slut-shaming. The user thinks the author is wrong but wants to know if that's the case.\n\nFirst, I need to consider societal norms and individual preferences. People have different values and preferences when it comes to relationships. However, the term \"slut-shaming\" implies that the author is making moral judgments about women's sexual history, which is a form of shaming. Even if he's not hostile, the impact of his actions is that women feel judged. \n\nThe key here is whether the author's preference is within his right or crosses into discriminatory behavior. While he's allowed to have personal preferences, the way he's applying them could be problematic. By rejecting women based on their sexual history, he's imposing his standards onto others, which can be seen as controlling or sexist because it's often about judging women's past without similar expectations for men. \n\nAlso, the fact that women are getting angry and feeling shamed suggests that his actions are causing harm. Even if he doesn't intend to, the effect is negative. So, the answer might hinge on whether his preference is just a personal choice or a judgmental stance that contributes to societal issues. \n\nIn conclusion, while the author isn't necessarily breaking any laws, his behavior could be considered wrong because it perpetuates shaming and may be discriminatory. So the answer is probably A (yes, he's in the wrong).\n"
