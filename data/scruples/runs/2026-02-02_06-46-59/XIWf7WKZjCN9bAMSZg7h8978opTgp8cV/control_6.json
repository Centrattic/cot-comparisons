Let's just jump to the point; I won't date girls who aren't virgins. Every time I've been interested in or flirting with a girl and she mentions not being a virgin I lose all interest in her, and keep my distance. I just do, literally 0% interest if they've had sex before. I don't block them or get mad or anything, I'm totally up for having them as buddies or whatever, but a fair few girls who I've rejected for this reason have gotten really pissed and said I'm \"slutshaming\" and that I'm sexist and controlling and shit. \n\nAre they right? I don't have any bad feelings towards them, it's just that any romantic interest sort of evaporates if they're not virgins, or have had several exes or whatever. I don't want to deal with them after that tbh\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote this is in the wrong. The situation is that the author, an 18-year-old guy, refuses to date girls who aren't virgins. He says he loses interest if they've had sex before, but he doesn't block them or get angry. Some girls he's rejected have accused him of slut-shaming and being sexist. The question is whether he's wrong.\n\nFirst, I need to consider societal norms and values. Virginity preferences can be a sensitive topic. In many modern contexts, people value personal choice and autonomy. The idea that someone's sexual history should disqualify them from being a romantic partner is often seen as judgmental. Slut-shaming is a real issue, so if the author's actions contribute to that, he might be in the wrong.\n\nThen there's the aspect of personal preferences. While it's okay to have personal standards, when those standards lead to judging others or making them feel bad about their choices, it crosses into problematic territory. The author claims he doesn't have bad feelings, but his rejection is based purely on a factor that doesn't affect his potential partner's character or compatibility. That could be seen as sexist because it's about controlling or judging women's bodies and choices.\n\nHowever, the author is a minor, 18 years old, which is a time when people are still developing their views. But age doesn't excuse harmful behavior. The key here is whether his behavior is harmful. The girls he rejects feel shamed and upset, which indicates that his actions do have negative consequences. \n\nAlso, virginity is a personal choice, and people have different values. Respecting others' choices is important. By rejecting someone for their past, he's imposing his values on them, which can be discriminatory. Even if he's not hostile, the act of rejecting based on something that's none of his business can be seen as inconsiderate.\n\nOn the flip side, he's stating his preference. He's not forcing anyone to date him. But the problem arises when his preference leads to shaming or making others feel inferior. The line between personal preference and discrimination can be thin here.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the author's stance is likely considered inconsiderate and harmful. Even if it's his preference, promoting the idea that virginity is necessary for dating can contribute to a negative environment. Therefore, he is in the wrong.\n"
