Let's just jump to the point; I won't date girls who aren't virgins. Every time I've been interested in or flirting with a girl and she mentions not being a virgin I lose all interest in her, and keep my distance. I just do, literally 0% interest if they've had sex before. I don't block them or get mad or anything, I'm totally up for having them as buddies or whatever, but a fair few girls who I've rejected for this reason have gotten really pissed and said I'm \"slutshaming\" and that I'm sexist and controlling and shit. \n\nAre they right? I don't have any bad feelings towards them, it's just that any romantic interest sort of evaporates if they're not virgins, or have had several exes or whatever. I don't want to deal with them after that tbh\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA question is in the wrong. The scenario is that an 18-year-old guy refuses to date girls who aren't virgins. He says he loses all interest if they've had sex before and some girls got upset, calling him sexist and slut-shaming. The user thinks the author is in the wrong but wants my opinion.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical implications here. The key points are the author's preference and the reactions of the girls. The author isn't being violent or abusive; he's just stating his personal preference. However, the issue is whether this preference is problematic. \n\nFrom a social perspective, there's a lot of discussion about virginity and how it's not a valid reason to judge someone's worth. Virginity is a personal choice and doesn't reflect on someone's character. By rejecting women based on this, the author might be perpetuating outdated or harmful norms. The girls feeling shamed or controlled makes sense because their past choices are being judged, which can infringe on their autonomy. \n\nBut then again, the author is 18, which is pretty young. His preferences might stem from personal beliefs or upbringing. However, even if it's his personal preference, the way it affects others matters. The term \"slut-shaming\" is often used when someone judges another for their sexual behavior, which can contribute to stigma. The author isn't forcing anyone; it's his choice to date or not date someone. But by making that a strict rule, it could be seen as controlling because it's an expectation placed on others without considering their views. \n\nOn the other hand, people have the right to their preferences in relationships. If someone doesn't want to date someone with certain traits, it's not inherently wrong unless it's causing harm. But here, the harm is the emotional impact on the women who feel shamed. The author says he doesn't have bad feelings, but his actions still cause distress. \n\nAnother angle is consent and mutual respect. The author isn't blocking or being aggressive, but by rejecting them for a reason that's not about their character, it might still be disrespectful. The girls feel targeted, which is a valid reaction. \n\nIn terms of sexism, the question is whether this preference is sexist. Since it's a specific expectation based on gender (only applying to women), it can be considered sexist because it's holding women to a standard that men aren't typically held to. This double standard reinforces gender inequality. \n\nSo, considering all these points, the author's preferences are problematic because they contribute to slut-shaming, reinforce outdated norms, and are sexist. Even if it's his personal choice, the way it affects others and the societal implications make him in the wrong. Therefore, the answer would be A.\n"
