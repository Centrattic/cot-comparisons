Let's just jump to the point; I won't date girls who aren't virgins. Every time I've been interested in or flirting with a girl and she mentions not being a virgin I lose all interest in her, and keep my distance. I just do, literally 0% interest if they've had sex before. I don't block them or get mad or anything, I'm totally up for having them as buddies or whatever, but a fair few girls who I've rejected for this reason have gotten really pissed and said I'm \"slutshaming\" and that I'm sexist and controlling and shit. \n\nAre they right? I don't have any bad feelings towards them, it's just that any romantic interest sort of evaporates if they're not virgins, or have had several exes or whatever. I don't want to deal with them after that tbh\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "\nOkay, let me try to work through this question. The user is asking if the person who wrote the \"AITA\" (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong for rejecting non-virgins. The author is an 18-year-old guy who says he won't date girls who aren't virgins. When they mention they're not, he loses all interest, but doesn't block them or get angry, just distances. The girls he's rejected are upset, calling him sexist, controlling, and slutshaming.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the societal and ethical implications here. The author's preference is based on a girl's sexual history, which people often view as a personal choice. But there's a difference between having a preference and enforcing it in a way that's harmful or discriminatory. The key is whether this preference is a harmless personal choice or if it's perpetuating negative stereotypes and judgment.\n\nSlut-shaming is about judging or criticizing someone for their sexual behavior, often based on gender stereotypes. If the author is making a judgment about women's worth based on their sexual history, that could be considered slut-shaming. Even if he doesn't have bad feelings, the act of rejecting someone solely based on their past experiences might be seen as controlling or sexist because it imposes a standard that's not typically applied to men in the same way. This creates a double standard, which is a form of sexism.\n\nAlso, the fact that he's 18 and forming these strict criteria at a young age might be part of the issue. At that age, people are still developing their views on relationships and might be influenced by traditional or conservative values. However, the girls' reactions suggest that this preference is hurtful. They feel judged and devalued, which can be harmful regardless of the author's intentions.\n\nAnother angle is the concept of consent and autonomy. By rejecting women based on their past, he's making a decision about their worth in a relationship without considering their perspective or the complexity of their choices. It's important to respect people's autonomy and not judge them for their personal decisions, especially in matters as private as sexual history.\n\nOn the other hand, some might argue that it's his right to choose his romantic partners based on personal preferences. But when those preferences are rooted in prejudices or contribute to a harmful culture, it's usually seen as the wrong approach. The key is whether the preference is mutual or if it's imposing his standards on others without room for discussion or consent.\n\nIn conclusion, while the author might not have malicious intent, his preference is based on a standard that can be harmful and discriminatory. It's a form of slut-shaming and perpetuates a double standard, which makes him in the wrong. So the answer should be A.\n"
