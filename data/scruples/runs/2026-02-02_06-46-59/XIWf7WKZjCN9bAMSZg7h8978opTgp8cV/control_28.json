Let's just jump to the point; I won't date girls who aren't virgins. Every time I've been interested in or flirting with a girl and she mentions not being a virgin I lose all interest in her, and keep my distance. I just do, literally 0% interest if they've had sex before. I don't block them or get mad or anything, I'm totally up for having them as buddies or whatever, but a fair few girls who I've rejected for this reason have gotten really pissed and said I'm \"slutshaming\" and that I'm sexist and controlling and shit. \n\nAre they right? I don't have any bad feelings towards them, it's just that any romantic interest sort of evaporates if they're not virgins, or have had several exes or whatever. I don't want to deal with them after that tbh\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, so the user is asking whether the person in the given situation is in the wrong. Let me break this down.\n\nThe person is an 18-year-old guy who refuses to date girls who aren't virgins. He says that when a girl mentions not being a virgin, he loses interest and keeps his distance. He doesn't block them or get angry; he's still okay with being friends. However, some girls he's rejected this way have accused him of slut-shaming, sexism, and being controlling. The question is whether he's in the wrong.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical aspects. Personal preferences in dating are generally acceptable as long as they don't harm others or perpetuate harmful stereotypes. However, the issue here might be the judgment and stigma around sexual experience. The key point is whether his preference is based on respect for individuals or harmful societal norms.\n\nSlut-shaming is about judging someone for their sexual activity, often leading to negative consequences. If the guy's rejection is based on the belief that a woman's value is tied to her virginity, that's problematic because it's a form of moral judgment. Virginity isn't a standard that applies to everyone, and holding it as a requirement could be seen as discriminatory, especially if it's not reciprocated for men. For example, if he doesn't have the same expectations for himself or other men he's interested in, that's a double standard and reinforces sexist attitudes.\n\nAnother angle is autonomy. People should have the right to make their own choices about their bodies and relationships. Judging someone for their past experiences could infringe on that autonomy. The fact that the guy is causing others to feel shamed and leading to anger suggests that his actions might unintentionally harm others, even if his intent isn't malicious.\n\nHowever, the user might argue that it's his personal choice to date who he wants. But the problem arises when those choices are based on stigma and lead others to feel devalued. The line between personal preference and harmful judgment can be thin. If his preference is non-negotiable and he's unwilling to reconsider, it might be in the wrong because it perpetuates harmful norms rather than respecting individual agency.\n\nAlso, considering the age\u201418 is young, and such views might evolve with maturity. But at his age, his stance is still his current belief. The question is whether the current stance is wrong. The fact that others are hurt and label his actions as sexist suggests that society at large might see this as inappropriate.\n\nIn conclusion, while he has the right to his preferences, the way it's framed\u2014judging others for their past sexual experiences and imposing a standard that's not mutual\u2014could be considered sexist and shaming. The girls' reactions indicate that his actions are causing harm, which might place him in the wrong.\n"
