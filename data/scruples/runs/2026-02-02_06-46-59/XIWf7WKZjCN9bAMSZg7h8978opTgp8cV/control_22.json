Let's just jump to the point; I won't date girls who aren't virgins. Every time I've been interested in or flirting with a girl and she mentions not being a virgin I lose all interest in her, and keep my distance. I just do, literally 0% interest if they've had sex before. I don't block them or get mad or anything, I'm totally up for having them as buddies or whatever, but a fair few girls who I've rejected for this reason have gotten really pissed and said I'm \"slutshaming\" and that I'm sexist and controlling and shit. \n\nAre they right? I don't have any bad feelings towards them, it's just that any romantic interest sort of evaporates if they're not virgins, or have had several exes or whatever. I don't want to deal with them after that tbh\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for only wanting to date virgins. The author is 18 and male. He states that he loses all interest if a girl isn't a virgin, which leads to some of them feeling shamed or called sexist.\n\nFirst, I need to consider societal norms. In many places, there's a shift towards more open discussions about sex and personal choice. The idea of valuing someone's virginity as a prerequisite for dating can be seen as outdated or even discriminatory. The term \"slutshaming\" is often used when someone judges another for their sexual activity, which the author's actions could be interpreted as.\n\nBut then, personal preferences are a factor. The author isn't forcing anyone; he's choosing not to date certain people based on his criteria. However, the problem arises when this preference causes harm or offense. The women he rejects feel hurt and accuse him of being sexist. Even if his intention isn't malicious, the impact is negative.\n\nAlso, the author mentions keeping them as friends, but in doing so, he's excluding them from romantic possibilities. This can be seen as controlling or disrespectful, as it's placing a value judgment on their past actions. Sexism typically involves prejudice based on gender, and by having a preference that's not applied to men, it might reinforce gender stereotypes.\n\nHowever, some might argue that personal preferences in dating are valid unless they cause direct harm. But given the age of the author, he's likely still forming his views, and being open to different perspectives is important for growth.\n\nSo, the key points are: the author's preference leads others to feel shamed, it's based on gender (only affecting women), and it's a personal choice that doesn't consider the other person's autonomy. This likely makes him in the wrong.\n"
