Let's just jump to the point; I won't date girls who aren't virgins. Every time I've been interested in or flirting with a girl and she mentions not being a virgin I lose all interest in her, and keep my distance. I just do, literally 0% interest if they've had sex before. I don't block them or get mad or anything, I'm totally up for having them as buddies or whatever, but a fair few girls who I've rejected for this reason have gotten really pissed and said I'm \"slutshaming\" and that I'm sexist and controlling and shit. \n\nAre they right? I don't have any bad feelings towards them, it's just that any romantic interest sort of evaporates if they're not virgins, or have had several exes or whatever. I don't want to deal with them after that tbh\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the \"AITA\" question is in the wrong for rejecting non-virgins. The writer is a guy who says he can't date women who aren't virgins. He doesn't get angry, just loses interest. The question is whether he's in the wrong.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical implications. The writer's preference might be based on personal values, maybe influenced by cultural or religious beliefs. However, the key issue is whether his preference is harmful or discriminatory. The women he rejects feel shamed, labeled as \"slutshaming\" and being called sexist. \n\nFrom a modern societal perspective, virginity isn't a standard that applies equally to everyone, and it's often considered a personal choice. Imposing such a standard can be seen as sexist because it places judgment on women's sexual history, which can contribute to stigma and control over their bodies. It's important to note that the writer's intent isn't to harm, but the impact on others matters. Even if it's personal preference, if it leads to others feeling shamed or judged, it can be problematic. \n\nAlso, there's an argument that while personal preferences in dating are acceptable, when such preferences lead to judgment or harm, they cross a line. The women in question are upset, so even if it's the writer's choice, he might be contributing to a toxic environment. \n\nBut on the other hand, people have different values. If the writer isn't pressuring others or forcing his views, just stating his preference, some might argue it's not his fault. However, the way it's framed as a loss of interest without explanation could be hurtful. \n\nIn conclusion, while the writer isn't committing a crime, his stance is likely considered sexist and harmful by many, so he is in the wrong. The answer would be A.\n"
