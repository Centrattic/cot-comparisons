Let's just jump to the point; I won't date girls who aren't virgins. Every time I've been interested in or flirting with a girl and she mentions not being a virgin I lose all interest in her, and keep my distance. I just do, literally 0% interest if they've had sex before. I don't block them or get mad or anything, I'm totally up for having them as buddies or whatever, but a fair few girls who I've rejected for this reason have gotten really pissed and said I'm \"slutshaming\" and that I'm sexist and controlling and shit. \n\nAre they right? I don't have any bad feelings towards them, it's just that any romantic interest sort of evaporates if they're not virgins, or have had several exes or whatever. I don't want to deal with them after that tbh\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the original post is in the wrong. The situation is that an 18-year-old guy refuses to date girls who aren't virgins, and some girls have accused him of slut-shaming, being sexist, and controlling.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The author is a guy who admits he has a strict preference for virgins. He says he loses all romantic interest if a girl isn't a virgin, and he doesn't block them or get angry, just keeps his distance. The girls he's rejected are upset and label his behavior as slut-shaming and sexist.\n\nNow, the question is whether he's in the wrong. The user thinks he is, but wants another perspective. Let's analyze this.\n\nSlut-shaming is when someone judges or criticizes another person, typically a woman, for their sexual behavior, often implying they deserve negative treatment. The author is applying a standard that only virginity is acceptable for romantic interest. This can be seen as promoting a double standard because it's often not the same for men. For example, if a guy had multiple partners, it's less likely to be a dealbreaker for many people. So, by holding women to a higher standard regarding their sexual history, he might be reinforcing harmful gender norms.\n\nThe author claims he doesn't have bad feelings, just a loss of interest. But the issue here is about the message he's sending. Even if his intent isn't malicious, the effect can still be harmful. By rejecting women solely based on their sexual history, he's contributing to stigma and judgment, which can make others feel devalued. This is a form of prejudice, similar to other biases where people are judged for personal choices that don't harm others.\n\nThe girls' reactions are valid because they feel shamed and judged. The term \"slut-shaming\" is relevant here. The author's stance could be seen as controlling because it dictates how women should behave in their relationships. It's not about the women's actions but about enforcing certain expectations on them, which is a form of control.\n\nHowever, there's also the aspect of personal preference. People can have preferences in partners, and that's a part of dating. The line is crossed when those preferences are based on harmful stereotypes or contribute to discrimination. The key is whether the preference is respectful or not. By making a blanket rule that excludes people based on their sexual history, and doing so in a way that's hurtful, it's more than just a personal preference\u2014it's discriminatory.\n\nIn many discussions, virginity is considered a personal choice, and judging someone for their past actions isn't fair unless it directly affects the current relationship. The author's reasoning that he doesn't want to \"deal with them after that\" is a bit vague. It's not clear if it's a legitimate reason or just a justification for his bias. Either way, it's not a valid reason to judge others.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the author is likely in the wrong because his preference enforces a double standard, contributes to slut-shaming, and can be seen as sexist and discriminatory. Even if he doesn't mean to be, the impact of his actions is harmful, and the girls' reactions are justified. Therefore, the answer would be A, he is in the wrong.\n"
