Let's just jump to the point; I won't date girls who aren't virgins. Every time I've been interested in or flirting with a girl and she mentions not being a virgin I lose all interest in her, and keep my distance. I just do, literally 0% interest if they've had sex before. I don't block them or get mad or anything, I'm totally up for having them as buddies or whatever, but a fair few girls who I've rejected for this reason have gotten really pissed and said I'm \"slutshaming\" and that I'm sexist and controlling and shit. \n\nAre they right? I don't have any bad feelings towards them, it's just that any romantic interest sort of evaporates if they're not virgins, or have had several exes or whatever. I don't want to deal with them after that tbh\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author of this post is in the wrong for rejecting non-virgins. The author is an 18-year-old guy who says he won't date women who aren't virgins. He claims he doesn't have bad feelings, just loses interest, and some girls have accused him of slut-shaming, sexism, or being controlling.\n\nFirst, I need to consider societal norms and personal preferences. People have different criteria for dating, right? Some people value virginity for religious, cultural, or personal reasons. But there's also the aspect of judgment and discrimination. The question is whether rejecting someone based on their sexual history is acceptable.\n\nIn many modern contexts, virginity isn't a common requirement for relationships. People often have diverse sexual histories, and judging someone for that can be seen as biased. The key here is whether the author's preference crosses into discrimination. The term \"slut-shaming\" implies that the author is shaming others for their sexual choices, which is generally frowned upon. Even if he's not being hostile, the mere act of rejecting someone based on their past relationships could be viewed as controlling or sexist, as it imposes his standards on others.\n\nBut then again, the author isn't blocking or being aggressive; he's just choosing not to pursue a romantic relationship. In terms of his own rights, he can choose who he wants to date. However, the issue is that by making this a non-negotiable, he's enforcing a standard that may not be his to impose. The girls' reactions suggest that they feel judged, which is a valid concern. Even if the author doesn't mean to, his actions can be hurtful and contribute to a culture of stigma around sexual experiences.\n\nThere's also the angle of consent and autonomy. People have the right to make their own choices about their bodies and relationships. If the author's preference leads others to feel shamed, that's problematic. It's possible he's not intentionally harmful, but the impact is there. The question is whether the intention matters more than the impact. In discussions about discrimination, often the impact is what's considered, even if the intent was neutral.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? On one hand, he's stating his preferences, which is his right. On the other hand, his preference may be perpetuating harmful attitudes. The answer might depend on cultural context, but in many current dialogues, such preferences are seen as outdated and potentially discriminatory. Therefore, the author could be seen as in the wrong for enforcing his views in a way that others find offensive.\n"
