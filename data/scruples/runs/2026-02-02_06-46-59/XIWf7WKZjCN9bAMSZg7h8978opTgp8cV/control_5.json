Let's just jump to the point; I won't date girls who aren't virgins. Every time I've been interested in or flirting with a girl and she mentions not being a virgin I lose all interest in her, and keep my distance. I just do, literally 0% interest if they've had sex before. I don't block them or get mad or anything, I'm totally up for having them as buddies or whatever, but a fair few girls who I've rejected for this reason have gotten really pissed and said I'm \"slutshaming\" and that I'm sexist and controlling and shit. \n\nAre they right? I don't have any bad feelings towards them, it's just that any romantic interest sort of evaporates if they're not virgins, or have had several exes or whatever. I don't want to deal with them after that tbh\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote this is in the wrong. The situation is about rejecting someone for not being a virgin.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the context. The author is 18, male, and he won't date girls who aren't virgins. He says he loses interest if they've had sex before. He doesn't act out, just keeps distance, but some girls got upset, calling him sexist and slut-shaming.\n\nSo, the question is whether he's in the wrong. Let's break it down. The key points here are personal preferences versus discrimination. The author is stating his preference for a partner's sexual history, but does that make him wrong?\n\nIn many societies, there's a shift towards the idea that people's sexual histories are their own business and shouldn't affect someone else's judgment. However, others argue that personal preferences in dating are subjective. The problem arises when the preference leads to judgment or discrimination. \n\nSlut-shaming is usually when someone is judged for their sexual activity. But here, the author is the one forming a judgment based on others' sexual history. By avoiding non-virgins, he's applying a standard that could be seen as controlling or sexist. The fact that girls are upset and feel shamed suggests that his actions, even if not explicitly hostile, are causing them distress.\n\nBut is it wrong? On one hand, people have the right to have preferences. On the other hand, if those preferences are based on outdated or harmful norms, they can be problematic. The author's reasoning is that he doesn't want to deal with someone who has had multiple partners or isn't a virgin. That implies a preference rooted in maybe traditional views or personal insecurity. \n\nThe key here is whether the preference itself is discriminatory. Even if he's not being aggressive, the mere act of rejecting someone based on their sexual history can be seen as slut-shaming. It's about respecting others' choices and not making assumptions. The author might not have ill intentions, but the effect is negative. \n\nIn terms of the question, \"in the wrong\" usually refers to violating social norms or causing harm without valid justification. Since the author's actions are causing upset and the preference is based on a personal standard that others find discriminatory, he could be in the wrong. However, some might argue that it's his right to have such preferences. But the consensus in modern discourse leans towards the view that such preferences are problematic if they lead to judgment or exclusion based on someone's sexual history. \n\nTherefore, the answer would be A, the author is in the wrong.\n"
