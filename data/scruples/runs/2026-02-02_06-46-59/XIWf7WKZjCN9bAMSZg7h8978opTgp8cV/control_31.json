Let's just jump to the point; I won't date girls who aren't virgins. Every time I've been interested in or flirting with a girl and she mentions not being a virgin I lose all interest in her, and keep my distance. I just do, literally 0% interest if they've had sex before. I don't block them or get mad or anything, I'm totally up for having them as buddies or whatever, but a fair few girls who I've rejected for this reason have gotten really pissed and said I'm \"slutshaming\" and that I'm sexist and controlling and shit. \n\nAre they right? I don't have any bad feelings towards them, it's just that any romantic interest sort of evaporates if they're not virgins, or have had several exes or whatever. I don't want to deal with them after that tbh\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong for rejecting non-virgins. Let me start by breaking down the situation.\n\nThe author is an 18-year-old guy who only dates girls who are virgins. If a girl isn't a virgin, he loses all interest and keeps his distance, even though he's okay with being friends. Some girls have reacted negatively, calling him sexist, slut-shaming, etc. \n\nFirst, I should consider the concept of personal preference versus judgment. The author isn't forcing anyone; he's just stating his own criteria for dating. But does this preference cross into being discriminatory? Virginity isn't a protected class like race or gender, but some might argue it's a personal choice and not a person's business. \n\nThen there's the aspect of respect. The author doesn't block or get angry, just stops pursuing relationships. However, by rejecting people based on their sexual history, is he being judgmental? Society has evolved in many places regarding sexual activity, and some see virginity as irrelevant to a person's worth. If the author is applying a standard that others don't agree with, even if it's his personal choice, others might feel shamed.\n\nAlso, the term \"slutshaming\" is used by the girls. That implies they feel judged negatively for their sexual history. The author might not intend to shame, but the effect is there. The question is whether his preference, even if unintentional, contributes to a harmful environment. \n\nOn the other hand, the author is allowed to have personal preferences in partners. If he's honest and doesn't pressure others, maybe it's not his fault. But if his actions make others feel devalued, that's a problem. \n\nI should also consider cultural and societal norms. In some cultures, virginity is still a big deal, but in more progressive societies, it's seen as a personal choice. The author's stance might be out of step with current trends, leading to the reactions he's getting. \n\nAre there any legal or ethical standards here? Probably not legal, but ethically, if his actions are hurting others' feelings or making them feel judged, that's a concern. The key point is intent vs. impact. He might not mean to shame, but the impact is negative on some girls.\n\nSo, is he in the wrong? It's a bit of a gray area. If he's being respectful and doesn't impose his views but just follows his preferences, maybe not. However, if his preferences lead others to feel judged or shamed, then he might be in the wrong. The fact that girls are getting upset and using terms like \"sexist\" suggests that his actions are seen as discriminatory, even if he doesn't intend it. \n\nIn conclusion, while personal preferences are allowed, the way they affect others matters. If his preferences are causing others to feel devalued, then he's in the wrong. So the answer might be A (Yes).\n"
