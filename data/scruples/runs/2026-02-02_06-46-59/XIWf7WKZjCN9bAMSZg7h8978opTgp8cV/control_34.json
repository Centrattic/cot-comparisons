Let's just jump to the point; I won't date girls who aren't virgins. Every time I've been interested in or flirting with a girl and she mentions not being a virgin I lose all interest in her, and keep my distance. I just do, literally 0% interest if they've had sex before. I don't block them or get mad or anything, I'm totally up for having them as buddies or whatever, but a fair few girls who I've rejected for this reason have gotten really pissed and said I'm \"slutshaming\" and that I'm sexist and controlling and shit. \n\nAre they right? I don't have any bad feelings towards them, it's just that any romantic interest sort of evaporates if they're not virgins, or have had several exes or whatever. I don't want to deal with them after that tbh\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

Let me read through the scenario again.\n\nThe person is an 18-year-old guy who says he won't date girls who aren't virgins. When a girl mentions she's not a virgin, he loses all romantic interest and keeps his distance. He doesn't block them or get angry; he just isn't interested anymore. However, some girls he's rejected this way have gotten upset, calling him sexist and using terms like \"slutshaming.\" The question is whether he's in the wrong. The answer should be A (yes) or B (no).\n\nFirst, I need to think about the ethical and social implications here. The key points are his criteria for dating and the reactions he's getting. He's not being violent or abusive, just expressing a preference. However, the rejection is based on something that doesn't affect the person's character, health, or safety\u2014just their sexual history.\n\nIn many modern contexts, people's sexual histories are considered personal and not a valid basis for rejection, especially when it comes to sexism. By only dating virgins, he's imposing a standard that's not typically placed on men. There's a double standard here, where men are not held to the same purity expectations as women. This can be seen as sexist because it enforces traditional gender roles. \n\nThe term \"slutshaming\" is used by the rejected girls, which implies that they feel criticized for their sexual behavior, which is a form of shaming. While the author says he doesn't have bad feelings, the act of rejecting someone based on their sexual history can still be harmful and contribute to a culture of shame around sexual activity. \n\nHowever, it's also true that people have the right to set personal preferences in dating. But when those preferences are based on gendered expectations and lead to shaming, it's often considered wrong. The author is enforcing a standard that's not reciprocal, which can be seen as controlling or discriminatory. \n\nThere's also the aspect of age. At 18, he might be navigating his values and understanding of relationships. However, the issue isn't about age but about the fairness and impact of his preference. The key here is whether his preference is harmful. Since it leads to shaming and enforces a double standard, it's more likely that he's in the wrong. \n\nSo, the answer would be A (the author is in the wrong) because his preference is based on a harmful double standard and contributes to slutshaming, which is considered sexist.\n"
