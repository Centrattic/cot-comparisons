Let's just jump to the point; I won't date girls who aren't virgins. Every time I've been interested in or flirting with a girl and she mentions not being a virgin I lose all interest in her, and keep my distance. I just do, literally 0% interest if they've had sex before. I don't block them or get mad or anything, I'm totally up for having them as buddies or whatever, but a fair few girls who I've rejected for this reason have gotten really pissed and said I'm \"slutshaming\" and that I'm sexist and controlling and shit. \n\nAre they right? I don't have any bad feelings towards them, it's just that any romantic interest sort of evaporates if they're not virgins, or have had several exes or whatever. I don't want to deal with them after that tbh\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for rejecting non-virgins. The author is a guy who says he won't date girls who aren't virgins, and when girls mention they're not, he loses interest. Some of them got angry, calling him sexist and slut-shaming. The user thinks the author is wrong but wants my opinion.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author is 18, so he's a young adult. His stance is about personal preference in dating. But the key here is that his preference is based on whether someone is a virgin or not, which could be seen as discriminatory. \n\nSlut-shaming typically involves judging someone for their sexual activity, often in a negative way. If the author is rejecting people based on their sexual history, that might fall under that. Also, saying he's controlling or sexist might relate to imposing his standards on others without considering their autonomy.\n\nHowever, the author mentions he's not blocking them or being hostile, just losing interest. He's okay with friendship. So it's about personal choice in dating. The question is whether personal preferences in dating are acceptable, or if they cross into being offensive or discriminatory.\n\nIn modern discussions, people often emphasize that one's sexual history is their own business and shouldn't affect how others treat them. So if someone refuses to date someone because of their past relationships, it could be seen as prejudice. But the line between personal preference and discrimination can be blurry. \n\nThe author's reasoning is that he doesn't want to deal with them after knowing their history. That could be seen as a personal choice, but it also might be considered judgmental. The girls feel shamed and accused him of being sexist. Whether that's valid depends on societal norms around consent and personal autonomy.\n\nIn many cases, people argue that it's okay to have preferences, but when those preferences are based on stereotypes or contribute to stigma, they can be problematic. Since the author's preference is not about mutual respect or compatibility but about a specific trait (virginity), it's more about a personal standard that may not be fair to others.\n\nSo, the answer would likely be A (the author is in the wrong) because his preference is contributing to slut-shaming and imposing his values on others, which is considered disrespectful and discriminatory.\n"
