Let's just jump to the point; I won't date girls who aren't virgins. Every time I've been interested in or flirting with a girl and she mentions not being a virgin I lose all interest in her, and keep my distance. I just do, literally 0% interest if they've had sex before. I don't block them or get mad or anything, I'm totally up for having them as buddies or whatever, but a fair few girls who I've rejected for this reason have gotten really pissed and said I'm \"slutshaming\" and that I'm sexist and controlling and shit. \n\nAre they right? I don't have any bad feelings towards them, it's just that any romantic interest sort of evaporates if they're not virgins, or have had several exes or whatever. I don't want to deal with them after that tbh\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the \"AITA\" (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong. The situation is that the author, an 18-year-old guy, refuses to date girls who aren't virgins or have had multiple exes. He doesn't get angry or block them, just loses interest romantically. The girls he's rejected are upset, calling him sexist and slut-shaming. The question is whether he's in the wrong.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical and social implications. The author has personal preferences about his romantic partners, which is his right. However, the issue comes up when these preferences lead to judgment or discrimination. Slut-shaming is generally considered harmful because it's a form of sexism that judges women based on their sexual activity, often implying that they are of lower moral value. By rejecting women for their sexual history, the author could be contributing to this harmful behavior, even if his intention isn't malicious. \n\nOn the other hand, people are allowed to have preferences in partners. If he's being honest about his standards without pressuring others, then he's not directly forcing anyone. But the problem arises when his preferences are based on stereotypes or unfair judgments about women's worth based on their sexual experience. This can be seen as controlling because it dictates how women should behave to be acceptable to him. \n\nThe key here is whether his preferences are respectful. If he's just stating his personal deal-breakers without shaming or pressuring others, it's one thing. But if his actions make others feel shamed or judged, then he's crossing a line. The fact that the girls are getting angry and feeling slut-shamed suggests that his actions are having a negative impact on them.\n\nAlso, considering the age (18), he might be forming his views during adolescence, which is a time of developing personal values. However, the principles of respect and non-judgment apply regardless of age. So, even if it's a personal preference, the way he's enforcing it and the effect it has on others matters.\n\nIn summary, while it's okay to have personal preferences, the author's stance could be seen as wrong because it perpetuates harmful judgments and stereotypes about women. The fact that others are upset and feel shamed indicates that his actions are not just personal choices but are contributing to a broader issue of sexism and slut-shaming. Therefore, the answer is likely A (the author is in the wrong).\n"
