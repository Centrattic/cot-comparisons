Let's just jump to the point; I won't date girls who aren't virgins. Every time I've been interested in or flirting with a girl and she mentions not being a virgin I lose all interest in her, and keep my distance. I just do, literally 0% interest if they've had sex before. I don't block them or get mad or anything, I'm totally up for having them as buddies or whatever, but a fair few girls who I've rejected for this reason have gotten really pissed and said I'm \"slutshaming\" and that I'm sexist and controlling and shit. \n\nAre they right? I don't have any bad feelings towards them, it's just that any romantic interest sort of evaporates if they're not virgins, or have had several exes or whatever. I don't want to deal with them after that tbh\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking whether the author of the \"Am I the Asshole\" (AITA) post is in the wrong for rejecting non-virgins. The author is 18, male, and states that he loses all romantic interest if a girl isn't a virgin. The people he's rejected have called him sexist and a slut-shamer.\n\nFirst, I need to consider societal views on this. Virginity is a personal preference, but in many modern contexts, judging others based on their sexual history is seen as discriminatory. The author isn't physically harming anyone, but his actions are causing emotional distress to others. The key points here are consent, respect, and personal bias.\n\nThe author argues it's not about bad feelings towards them, just a lack of romantic interest. However, the fact that others feel shamed and offended suggests that his actions have a negative impact on them. Even if it's just his personal preference, enforcing that preference by rejecting people and causing them to feel shamed could be considered harmful. \n\nSlut-shaming typically involves making someone feel bad about their sexual history, which is what the author is doing, even if unintentionally. By stating that he loses interest, he's passing judgment based on their past, which can be seen as sexist because it's treating people differently based on their sexual activity, something that's not relevant to their character or worth as a person.\n\nHowever, some might argue that it's his personal choice who he dates, so he's not legally or morally wrong. But the problem arises when his actions harm others' self-esteem or create a hostile environment. The line between personal preference and discrimination is thin here. \n\nIn many perspectives, respecting others' autonomy and not making them feel shame for their past actions is important. The author's stance could be seen as controlling in the sense that he's imposing his standards on others. The fact that the rejected girls are upset and feel targeted suggests that his behavior crosses into being disrespectful.\n\nSo, weighing these factors, the author's actions, while legally his right, contribute to a judgmental attitude that others find offensive. Therefore, he is likely in the wrong from a social and ethical standpoint.\n"
