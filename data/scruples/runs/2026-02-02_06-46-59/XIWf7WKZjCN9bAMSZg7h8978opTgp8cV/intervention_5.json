Let's just jump to the point; I won't date girls who aren't virgins. Every time I've been interested in or flirting with a girl and she mentions not being a virgin I lose all interest in her, and keep my distance. I just do, literally 0% interest if they've had sex before. I don't block them or get mad or anything, I'm totally up for having them as buddies or whatever, but a fair few girls who I've rejected for this reason have gotten really pissed and said I'm \"slutshaming\" and that I'm sexist and controlling and shit. \n\nAre they right? I don't have any bad feelings towards them, it's just that any romantic interest sort of evaporates if they're not virgins, or have had several exes or whatever. I don't want to deal with them after that tbh\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's dive into this. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong for rejecting non-virgins. The author is a guy who says he loses all romantic interest in girls who aren't virgins. The key points here are his personal preference and the reactions from others.\n\nFirst, I need to consider personal freedom vs. societal expectations. The author is stating his dating criteria, which is his right. However, the issue arises when others label this as slut-shaming or sexist. Slut-shaming typically involves shaming someone for their sexual activity, which can be harmful. But is the author's preference inherently shaming? He mentions he doesn't block them or get angry, just loses interest. \n\nThen there's the aspect of consent and judgment. People should have autonomy over their dating preferences, but when those preferences lead to judgment or exclusion, it can be problematic. The author isn't physically harming anyone, but his stance might contribute to a culture where women's sexual histories are judged. \n\nAlso, the argument about sexism: if he's using virginity as a strict criterion, it could reinforce traditional gender roles that place more value on women's sexual history than men's. This could be seen as sexist because it's applying different standards to women than to men. \n\nOn the flip side, the author isn't forcing anyone's hand. He's choosing who he dates based on his own values. But the problem is that his preference can make others feel devalued or judged, even if he doesn't intend to. The question is whether his personal choice crosses into being discriminatory. \n\nIn many cultures, virginity isn't a legal or moral issue, so personal preference isn't inherently wrong. However, the term \"slutshaming\" implies that the rejection is based on negative judgment rather than a neutral preference. If the author is making others feel bad about their choices, even without direct confrontation, he might be contributing to that culture. \n\nSo, balancing personal choice with the impact on others. The author is in the wrong if his actions cause harm or perpetuate harmful stereotypes, even unintentionally. Since he's not engaging in direct harassment but is still causing distress through his rejection, it's a gray area. However, the societal context of how such preferences can reinforce sexism might tip the scale towards him being in the wrong.\n"
