Let's just jump to the point; I won't date girls who aren't virgins. Every time I've been interested in or flirting with a girl and she mentions not being a virgin I lose all interest in her, and keep my distance. I just do, literally 0% interest if they've had sex before. I don't block them or get mad or anything, I'm totally up for having them as buddies or whatever, but a fair few girls who I've rejected for this reason have gotten really pissed and said I'm \"slutshaming\" and that I'm sexist and controlling and shit. \n\nAre they right? I don't have any bad feelings towards them, it's just that any romantic interest sort of evaporates if they're not virgins, or have had several exes or whatever. I don't want to deal with them after that tbh\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "\nOkay, so I need to figure out if the person who wrote this is in the wrong. The situation is that he's 18, a guy, and he won't date girls who aren't virgins. He says that when a girl mentions not being a virgin, he loses all interest and keeps his distance. The girls he's rejected for this reason have called him slut-shaming, sexist, and controlling. He's asking if they're right.\n\nFirst, I should consider the ethical implications here. The author is making a judgment about people based on their sexual history. That's a personal choice, but does it cross into being wrong? Let's think about slut-shaming. That term usually refers to shaming someone for their sexual behavior, often implying that having a certain number of partners or being sexually active is immoral or shameful. By rejecting people because they're not virgins, he might be contributing to that stigma. \n\nThen there's the aspect of sexism. If his standard is that he only dates virgins but doesn't hold the same expectation for himself, that could be sexist. But if he's also a virgin or has certain expectations for himself, maybe not. The question doesn't specify his own sexual history, so that's unclear. However, the key point is that he's judging women based on their sexual past, which is a common form of sexism. \n\nThe author claims he has no bad feelings and is just not interested. But even if it's a personal preference, when it leads to shaming or making others feel ashamed, it becomes problematic. Also, controlling behavior can be in the form of imposing one's values on others, especially in a dating context.\n\nOn the other hand, people have the right to set personal boundaries in dating. If he's being honest about his preferences without being hostile, some might argue it's not his fault. But the issue is how his actions affect others. The girls felt shamed and offended, which suggests his actions are causing harm. \n\nAlso, considering societal norms, virginity is a personal and cultural matter. What one person values, another might not. It's important to respect others' choices without judgment. By rejecting people solely based on their sexual history, he's imposing his values on them, which can be seen as controlling. \n\nIn summary, while it's his right to have preferences, the way he's acting on them\u2014leading to others feeling shamed or judged\u2014makes him at least partially responsible. The key factors are the impact on others and whether his actions contribute to harmful stereotypes or stigma. So the answer is likely A (he's in the wrong) because his actions, though based on personal choice, are causing harm and perpetuating negative attitudes towards women's sexual autonomy.\n"
