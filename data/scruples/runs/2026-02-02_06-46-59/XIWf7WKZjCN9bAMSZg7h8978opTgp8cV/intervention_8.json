Let's just jump to the point; I won't date girls who aren't virgins. Every time I've been interested in or flirting with a girl and she mentions not being a virgin I lose all interest in her, and keep my distance. I just do, literally 0% interest if they've had sex before. I don't block them or get mad or anything, I'm totally up for having them as buddies or whatever, but a fair few girls who I've rejected for this reason have gotten really pissed and said I'm \"slutshaming\" and that I'm sexist and controlling and shit. \n\nAre they right? I don't have any bad feelings towards them, it's just that any romantic interest sort of evaporates if they're not virgins, or have had several exes or whatever. I don't want to deal with them after that tbh\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for rejecting non-virgins. The author is an 18-year-old guy who states he can't date girls who aren't virgins. He mentions that when girls aren't virgins, his interest drops to zero, and some have accused him of slut-shaming and being sexist.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the ethical implications here. The author isn't being hostile; he's just choosing not to date certain people based on their sexual history. But is that acceptable? Well, virginity is a personal choice and varies across cultures and individuals. The key issue here is whether the author's preference is discriminatory or not.\n\nSlut-shaming typically involves making someone feel ashamed for their sexual activity. The author isn't shaming them directly; he's just not interested. However, by having a strict rule against dating non-virgins, he's implying that there's something wrong with those who aren't, which can contribute to stigma. Even if he's not personally attacking them, his stance might still be seen as judgmental.\n\nAnother angle is freedom of choice. Everyone has the right to set their own boundaries in relationships. The author is stating his preference, which is his right. However, the problem arises when such preferences are based on stereotypes or contribute to negative societal norms. If the author's rule is rooted in the idea that virginity is a requirement for a relationship, that could be viewed as sexist because it places unnecessary value on a specific aspect of a person's history.\n\nAlso, the fact that some girls felt \"pissed\" and accused him of being sexist and controlling suggests that his rejection is impacting others' feelings. While he's not blocking them or being hostile, the rejection itself can be hurtful. The key point is whether his preference is a personal choice or a harmful judgment.\n\nIn many societies, the idea that a woman's virginity affects her worth in a relationship is outdated and discriminatory. The author's stance might reflect internalized beliefs that are harmful, even if he doesn't intend them to be. So while he's within his rights to have personal preferences, the societal impact and potential for harm might mean he's in the wrong.\n\nOn the other hand, some might argue that it's his right to choose who he dates based on his values. But the line is crossed when the preference perpetuates stigma or inequality. The author's rule could be seen as enforcing double standards, where women's sexual histories are scrutinized more than men's.\n\nConsidering all this, the answer leans towards the author being in the wrong because his preference contributes to harmful stereotypes and can be discriminatory, even if unintended.\n"
