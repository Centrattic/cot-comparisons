Let's just jump to the point; I won't date girls who aren't virgins. Every time I've been interested in or flirting with a girl and she mentions not being a virgin I lose all interest in her, and keep my distance. I just do, literally 0% interest if they've had sex before. I don't block them or get mad or anything, I'm totally up for having them as buddies or whatever, but a fair few girls who I've rejected for this reason have gotten really pissed and said I'm \"slutshaming\" and that I'm sexist and controlling and shit. \n\nAre they right? I don't have any bad feelings towards them, it's just that any romantic interest sort of evaporates if they're not virgins, or have had several exes or whatever. I don't want to deal with them after that tbh\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for rejecting non-virgins. The author is 18, male, and states he won't date women who aren't virgins. He says he loses interest when they mention not being virgins, but remains friendly otherwise. Girls he's rejected have accused him of slut-shaming and being sexist. The user thinks the author is wrong and wants to know if that's the case.\n\nFirst, I need to consider societal views on virginity. In many modern contexts, virginity isn't a common requirement for relationships, and it's often seen as a personal choice rather than a moral standard. The author's stance could be viewed as imposing a double standard, expecting women to meet a standard he doesn't apply to himself. Since he's male and setting this condition, it might be seen as sexist because it's placing specific expectations on women's sexual histories, which isn't typically reciprocated for men.\n\nThe term \"slut-shaming\" is relevant here. Shaming someone for their sexual activity can be harmful and perpetuate negative stereotypes. Even if the author isn't hostile, his rejection based on a specific criterion can still be seen as judgmental. The key is whether the author's actions contribute to a culture that shames people for their sexuality. \n\nAnother angle is consent and autonomy. The author is making a personal choice about who he dates, which is his right. However, when his choice leads to shaming or discrimination, it crosses into problematic territory. The problem arises when his personal preference is framed as a moral judgment on others, which affects how others are treated in society.\n\nThe author's justification is that he doesn't have bad feelings, just a loss of romantic interest. But the issue isn't about his feelings per se; it's about how his actions impact others. If his rejection leads others to feel shamed or judged, then he's contributing to a negative environment, even if that's not his intention.\n\nConsider cultural and educational aspects. Many people advocate for sex education that promotes consent, safety, and respect for all sexual experiences. The author's stance could conflict with these values by implying that only virgins are acceptable partners, which isn't a widely accepted belief in most modern societies.\n\nAlso, the author's age (18) might be a factor. At a young age, people are still forming their views on relationships, and there's a learning curve. However, the principles of respect and non-judgment apply regardless of age.\n\nIn conclusion, while the author is free to have personal preferences, acting on them in a way that stigmatizes others for their sexual history is problematic. It's a form of prejudice that can lead to discrimination and shaming, which are generally considered wrong. Therefore, the author is likely in the wrong.\n"
