Let's just jump to the point; I won't date girls who aren't virgins. Every time I've been interested in or flirting with a girl and she mentions not being a virgin I lose all interest in her, and keep my distance. I just do, literally 0% interest if they've had sex before. I don't block them or get mad or anything, I'm totally up for having them as buddies or whatever, but a fair few girls who I've rejected for this reason have gotten really pissed and said I'm \"slutshaming\" and that I'm sexist and controlling and shit. \n\nAre they right? I don't have any bad feelings towards them, it's just that any romantic interest sort of evaporates if they're not virgins, or have had several exes or whatever. I don't want to deal with them after that tbh\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so the user is asking whether the person who wrote about rejecting non-virgins is in the wrong. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the author is 18 and male. He states that he won't date girls who aren't virgins, and that his interest drops to zero when they mention having had sex. He mentions that he doesn't get angry or block them, just loses interest. However, some girls have accused him of slut-shaming, sexism, and being controlling. The user thinks the author is in the wrong and wants to know if that's the case.\n\nI need to consider societal norms and what's considered respectful in relationships. The key points here are the author's preference and how it affects others. While it's his personal choice to have certain preferences, the way it's framed might be problematic. Judging someone's sexual history and using that as a deal-breaker could be seen as imposing personal values on others. It's important to note that people's sexual histories are their own business, and others shouldn't be judged based on that unless it's relevant to the relationship.\n\nThe author claims there's no malice, just a lack of interest. However, the fact that others feel shamed or controlled suggests that his actions have negative impacts. Even if he's not intentionally shaming, the effect of his rejection based on sexual history can be perceived as slut-shaming. There's also a gender dynamic here; it's more common to judge women's sexual behavior, which ties into broader issues of sexism and double standards.\n\nOn the other hand, people do have the right to their preferences in partners. The author isn't forcing anyone; he's just stating his own criteria. But the question is whether that's acceptable. It's a balance between personal choice and societal expectations. If his preference leads to hurting others or perpetuates harmful stereotypes, that could be problematic. However, if it's a personal choice without coercion, some might argue it's not inherently wrong.\n\nBut given that the author is rejecting people based on a characteristic that's not harmful (their sexual history), and this is causing others to feel shamed, it leans towards being in the wrong. Also, the idea that virgins are preferable can be seen as traditional and possibly sexist, as it values a woman's purity in a way that's not applied to men the same. The author might be applying a standard that's unfair or discriminatory.\n\nIn conclusion, while the author isn't breaking any laws, the preference is problematic because it can lead to judgment and harm others' feelings. It's about respecting others' autonomy and not imposing personal moral standards. So, the answer would be that the author is in the wrong.\n"
