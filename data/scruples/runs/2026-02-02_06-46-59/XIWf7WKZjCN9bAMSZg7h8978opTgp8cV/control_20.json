Let's just jump to the point; I won't date girls who aren't virgins. Every time I've been interested in or flirting with a girl and she mentions not being a virgin I lose all interest in her, and keep my distance. I just do, literally 0% interest if they've had sex before. I don't block them or get mad or anything, I'm totally up for having them as buddies or whatever, but a fair few girls who I've rejected for this reason have gotten really pissed and said I'm \"slutshaming\" and that I'm sexist and controlling and shit. \n\nAre they right? I don't have any bad feelings towards them, it's just that any romantic interest sort of evaporates if they're not virgins, or have had several exes or whatever. I don't want to deal with them after that tbh\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, so the user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong. Let me break this down.\n\nThe author is an 18-year-old guy who refuses to date women who aren't virgins. He says that whenever a girl he's interested in mentions not being a virgin, he loses all romantic interest. He doesn't block them or get angry, just keeps them as friends. However, some of these girls have accused him of slut-shaming, being sexist, and controlling.\n\nFirst, I need to consider societal norms and ethics. Virginity preferences are a personal choice, but when they affect others, especially in terms of dating, it can be problematic. The author is making a judgment based on someone's sexual history, which is a personal and private matter. This could be seen as discriminatory because it's a preference that's not based on the person's character, compatibility, or mutual respect. \n\nSlut-shaming typically involves criticizing someone for their sexual activity, but in this case, the author isn't shaming the girls; he's just not interested in dating them. However, by making a blanket rule against non-virgins, he might be enforcing traditional gender roles that place undue importance on a woman's sexual history. It's also worth noting that the author's age (18) might mean he's still forming his views on relationships and equality.\n\nOn the other hand, the author claims he has no bad feelings and is open to friendship. But the issue here isn't just about his feelings; it's about respecting others' autonomy and not making them feel judged. The girls feeling \"pissed\" and calling him sexist suggests that his actions are causing harm, even if unintended. \n\nIn terms of consent and equality, judging someone's worth based on their sexual history can be a form of sexism. It's a standard that's not typically applied to men in the same way, which highlights the gendered nature of the issue. The author's preference might be a personal right, but it's also contributing to a culture that stigmatizes people for their choices.\n\nSo, the answer leans towards the author being in the wrong (A) because his preference is discriminatory and perpetuates harmful gender norms, even if he doesn't intend to shame others. However, there's nuance in that it's a personal choice, but when it affects others' feelings and reinforces inequality, it's problematic.\n"
