Let's just jump to the point; I won't date girls who aren't virgins. Every time I've been interested in or flirting with a girl and she mentions not being a virgin I lose all interest in her, and keep my distance. I just do, literally 0% interest if they've had sex before. I don't block them or get mad or anything, I'm totally up for having them as buddies or whatever, but a fair few girls who I've rejected for this reason have gotten really pissed and said I'm \"slutshaming\" and that I'm sexist and controlling and shit. \n\nAre they right? I don't have any bad feelings towards them, it's just that any romantic interest sort of evaporates if they're not virgins, or have had several exes or whatever. I don't want to deal with them after that tbh\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote this is in the wrong for rejecting non-virgins. The author is an 18-year-old guy who states he won't date girls who aren't virgins. He loses all interest when they mention they've had sex before. The other people he's rejected are calling him slutshaming, sexist, and controlling. The user wants to know if he's actually wrong here, with options A or B.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author is pretty young, 18, which is when people are still forming their views on relationships and sexuality. His preference is clear: he only wants to date virgins. The key issues here are whether this is discriminatory, if it's a personal choice, and how it affects others.\n\nSlut-shaming typically involves criticizing someone for being sexually active, often in a judgmental or derogatory way. The author isn't shaming them per se; he's just not interested. But the problem is that by making a blanket statement about not dating non-virgins, it can impose his own standards onto others, which is a form of judgment. That's where the slut-shaming accusation might come from\u2014his rejection is based on their sexual history, which is a personal choice but can be seen as disrespectful to their autonomy.\n\nThen there's the aspect of sexism. If he's applying this standard only to women and not himself or men in general, that's a classic example of double standards. The fact that he's okay with being friends but not dating them because of their sexual pasts might be considered sexist because it objectifies women and reduces their worth based on their sexual behavior. Men aren't typically judged the same way for their sexual history, so this could reinforce harmful gender norms.\n\nControlling behavior is another point. By dictating who he will or won't date based on their virginity, it's more about his own preferences rather than controlling their actions. But the line can be blurry. If he's not pressuring them to change, then maybe it's not controlling. However, the act of basing a relationship on such a specific and traditional criterion can be seen as controlling, especially if it's not reciprocated in expectations for himself.\n\nAlso, considering that people have the right to make their own choices regarding their sexuality, the author's rejection could be seen as invalidating their decisions. Virginity is a personal and cultural matter, and not everyone values it the same way. His stance might limit the other person's ability to find partners who accept them, which could be unfair.\n\nOn the other hand, some might argue that people have the right to set their own dating preferences. If he's not forcing his beliefs on others and is just stating what he's comfortable with, then it's his choice. However, the issue arises when others are hurt by his rejection, even if he's not being aggressive about it.\n\nThe age factor is important too. At 18, he's still young and maybe hasn't fully considered the societal implications of such a preference. It's possible he could reflect on why he holds this belief and if it's based on personal values or if it's perpetuating stereotypes. But the question is about whether he's in the wrong now, not about future growth.\n\nIn terms of ethics, respecting others' autonomy and not judging them for their choices is key. Even if he's not shaming them, his rejection is making a judgment about their worth in a romantic context. That's a form of right-wing shaming when it's about enforcing traditional standards on others without considering their individuality.\n\nSo, putting it all together, while he's not necessarily \"wrong\" in the sense of breaking laws or rules, his attitude does promote a judgmental and potentially sexist view. The girls who are upset have valid points because his preference imposes a standard that isn't universally applicable and can make them feel devalued. Therefore, the answer is A, he is in the wrong.\n"
