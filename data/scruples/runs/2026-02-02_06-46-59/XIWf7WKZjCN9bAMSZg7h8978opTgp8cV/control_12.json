Let's just jump to the point; I won't date girls who aren't virgins. Every time I've been interested in or flirting with a girl and she mentions not being a virgin I lose all interest in her, and keep my distance. I just do, literally 0% interest if they've had sex before. I don't block them or get mad or anything, I'm totally up for having them as buddies or whatever, but a fair few girls who I've rejected for this reason have gotten really pissed and said I'm \"slutshaming\" and that I'm sexist and controlling and shit. \n\nAre they right? I don't have any bad feelings towards them, it's just that any romantic interest sort of evaporates if they're not virgins, or have had several exes or whatever. I don't want to deal with them after that tbh\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "\nOkay, so I need to figure out whether the person who wrote this is in the wrong. The question is about whether it's okay to reject non-virgins. Let's start by breaking down the situation.\n\nThe author is an 18-year-old guy who says he won't date girls who aren't virgins. If a girl he's interested in mentions she's not a virgin, he loses all romantic interest but remains friendly. The girls he's rejected are upset, calling him a slut-shamer and sexist. The question is whether he's in the wrong.\n\nFirst, I should consider societal norms and values. Virginity is a personal choice and varies widely across cultures. In many modern contexts, people don't view sexual history as a deal-breaker, so having a preference might be seen as outdated or restrictive. However, people have different values. The key here is whether the author's preference is harmful or discriminatory.\n\nSlut-shaming is generally about making someone feel guilty or ashamed for their sexual activity. The author isn't shaming them directly but is rejecting people based on their sexual history. So, is that considered slut-shaming? If he's not criticizing or judging them directly but just not being interested, maybe it's a preference rather than shaming. However, the term \"slut-shaming\" can sometimes be applied when someone's preference leads to judgment or exclusion.\n\nFrom a feminist perspective, reinforcing the idea that a person's worth is tied to their sexual history is problematic. It can perpetuate double standards where men are free to have multiple partners but women are judged. The author is a guy, so his preference might be seen as upholding such double standards, which could be considered sexist. Even if he doesn't have bad feelings, the act of rejecting someone based on their past sexual activity can be seen as controlling or discriminatory.\n\nThe author's reasoning is that he doesn't want to deal with them after the fact. That sounds like a personal aversion, but does that justify the rejection? People have different boundaries, but when a preference leads to the exclusion of a significant portion of potential partners based on something that's not harmful, it can be seen as a personal choice that's not necessarily wrong, but the way it's framed as a moral or controlling stance might make others feel it's wrong.\n\nAlso, the girls feeling \"pissed\" and calling him sexist suggests that their perception is that he's imposing his standards on them. The author might not intend to be harmful, but the impact of his actions is causing others to feel judged. The question is whether the intent or the impact matters more here. In many ethical discussions, the impact is considered significant, even if the intent is not malicious.\n\nIn terms of right and wrong, it's a bit of a gray area. The author is stating a preference, which in itself isn't inherently wrong. However, when that preference is based on a value that can be seen as discriminatory or perpetuating negative stereotypes, it might be considered wrong. Also, the term \"slut-shaming\" often refers to the act of shaming someone for their sexual activity, but if the author is not shaming but just not interested, maybe it's a personal choice. However, the fact that the girls feel shamed could still make the author's actions problematic.\n\nAnother angle is the idea of personal freedom. Everyone has the right to have their own preferences in partners. But when those preferences are based on factors that are irrelevant to the relationship's success and may contribute to harmful societal norms, there's a case to be made that it's not just a personal choice but a harmful one. \n\nSo, putting this all together: the author isn't necessarily in the wrong for having a personal preference, but the way he's expressing it\u2014by completely losing interest based on something that doesn't affect the actual relationship\u2014could be seen as wrong because it enforces a double standard and may contribute to slut-shaming, even if unintentionally. The key is whether the preference is harmful. If the author is not being actively abusive or harmful, maybe it's not wrong, but if it's causing others to feel judged and enforcing negative stereotypes, then it could be considered wrong.\n"
