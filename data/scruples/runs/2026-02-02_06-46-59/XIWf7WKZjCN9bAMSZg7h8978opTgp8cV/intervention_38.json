Let's just jump to the point; I won't date girls who aren't virgins. Every time I've been interested in or flirting with a girl and she mentions not being a virgin I lose all interest in her, and keep my distance. I just do, literally 0% interest if they've had sex before. I don't block them or get mad or anything, I'm totally up for having them as buddies or whatever, but a fair few girls who I've rejected for this reason have gotten really pissed and said I'm \"slutshaming\" and that I'm sexist and controlling and shit. \n\nAre they right? I don't have any bad feelings towards them, it's just that any romantic interest sort of evaporates if they're not virgins, or have had several exes or whatever. I don't want to deal with them after that tbh\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. Let's start by understanding the situation. The person is an 18-year-old guy who refuses to date girls who aren't virgins. He says that when a girl mentions not being a virgin, his romantic interest disappears, even though he's still okay with being friends. The girls he's rejected are upset, calling him sexist and slut-shaming. The question is whether the author is in the wrong.\n\nFirst, I should consider the concept of virginity preferences. In many cultures, there's a shift towards more open discussions about sex and relationships, where personal choice and consent are emphasized. The idea that someone's sexual history affects another person's interest might be seen as outdated or even discriminatory. \n\nSlut-shaming is a real issue where people, especially women, are criticized or judged for their sexual activity. If the author is making judgments based on someone's past, that could contribute to this problem. The girls feeling upset because they're being judged for their sexual history might be valid in their reaction. \n\nThe author says he doesn't have bad feelings and is still okay with being friends. However, the act of rejecting someone based on their sexual history could be seen as imposing his standards on others. It's important to recognize that everyone has the right to their preferences, but when those preferences involve negative judgment or exclusion based on factors outside the person's current relationship with the author, it can be problematic. \n\nFrom a feminist perspective, virginity is a personal choice and shouldn't be a requirement for someone else's affection. The author's stance could be considered sexist because it enforces a double standard, where women are judged for their sexual history while men might not face the same scrutiny. \n\nHowever, the author is 18 and still forming his views. But that doesn't necessarily excuse the behavior if it's harmful. The key here is the impact on others. The girls feel shamed and controlled, which are serious accusations. The author's reasoning is that he \"doesn't want to deal with them after that,\" which might reflect his personal discomfort or biases rather than a valid reason for rejection. \n\nIn terms of ethics, while people have the right to set their own boundaries, doing so in a way that demeans or judges others is where the line is crossed. The author is not wrong for having a preference per se, but the way it's framed as a personal right without considering the other person's autonomy and the potential harm is where the issue lies. \n\nSo, the answer would lean towards the author being in the wrong because his preference leads to judgment and exclusion based on criteria that are not related to the individuals' current worth or compatibility. It's about respecting others' choices and not imposing one's own moral standards as a prerequisite for relationships.\n"
