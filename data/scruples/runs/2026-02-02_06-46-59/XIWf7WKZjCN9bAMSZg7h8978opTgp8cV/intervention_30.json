Let's just jump to the point; I won't date girls who aren't virgins. Every time I've been interested in or flirting with a girl and she mentions not being a virgin I lose all interest in her, and keep my distance. I just do, literally 0% interest if they've had sex before. I don't block them or get mad or anything, I'm totally up for having them as buddies or whatever, but a fair few girls who I've rejected for this reason have gotten really pissed and said I'm \"slutshaming\" and that I'm sexist and controlling and shit. \n\nAre they right? I don't have any bad feelings towards them, it's just that any romantic interest sort of evaporates if they're not virgins, or have had several exes or whatever. I don't want to deal with them after that tbh\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The person is asking if they're in the wrong for rejecting non-virgins. They're a guy, 18, and they lose all interest in girls who aren't virgins. The key points here are about personal preference vs. judgment, and how that affects others.\n\nFirst, the author is stating a personal preference. It's their choice who they want to date, right? So if they're not interested in someone who isn't a virgin, that's their prerogative. But the issue comes when others perceive this as shaming or sexist. The author mentions that some girls got angry and accused them of slut-shaming. \n\nSlut-shaming usually involves making someone feel bad about their sexual choices. If the author is just expressing their own preferences without being derogatory, maybe it's not shaming. But if their rejection is causing hurt or implying that non-virgins are less valuable, that could be problematic. \n\nThe author says they have no bad feelings and are okay with being friends. That might mitigate some of the negative intent. However, the fact that others feel shamed suggests that the way the rejection is communicated might be an issue. Also, societal norms play a role here. In many places, people are moving towards more acceptance of diverse sexual histories, so the author's stance might be seen as outdated or judgmental.\n\nAnother angle is the fairness of the preference itself. It's subjective, but if someone has a clear preference, it's their right. However, if it's based on gender stereotypes (like valuing women for their virginity but not men), that's where sexism could come in. If the author's preference is rooted in such stereotypes, they might be in the wrong.\n\nThe author also mentions not wanting to deal with someone after they've had multiple partners. That could be a personal choice, but if it's a double standard (like not caring about their own sexual history), that's another point against them. \n\nIn conclusion, while the author has the right to their preferences, the way those preferences are expressed and the impact on others might make them at fault for causing hurt or perpetuating harmful attitudes. So, likely in the wrong.\n"
