Let's just jump to the point; I won't date girls who aren't virgins. Every time I've been interested in or flirting with a girl and she mentions not being a virgin I lose all interest in her, and keep my distance. I just do, literally 0% interest if they've had sex before. I don't block them or get mad or anything, I'm totally up for having them as buddies or whatever, but a fair few girls who I've rejected for this reason have gotten really pissed and said I'm \"slutshaming\" and that I'm sexist and controlling and shit. \n\nAre they right? I don't have any bad feelings towards them, it's just that any romantic interest sort of evaporates if they're not virgins, or have had several exes or whatever. I don't want to deal with them after that tbh\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of an AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong for rejecting non-virgins. The author is a guy who says he won't date girls who aren't virgins. He mentions that when girls he's interested in aren't virgins, he loses all romantic interest but remains friendly. The girls he's rejected reacted negatively, saying he's slut-shaming, sexist, and controlling. The user wants to know if the author is wrong, with options A (yes) or B (no).\n\nFirst, I need to consider the social norms and values around virginity. In many modern contexts, especially in Western societies, personal choice about sexual activity is generally seen as a personal decision, not a basis for judging someone's worth. The idea that someone's sexual history should disqualify them from being a romantic partner for another person is often viewed as problematic. Slut-shaming is a real issue where individuals, especially women, are criticized or judged for their sexual behavior. The author's stance could be seen as contributing to that, even if he's not hostile.\n\nAlso, the author mentions that he doesn't have ill feelings but just loses interest. However, the fact that his rejection is based on a personal preference (virginity) which is not a behavior he can control (since the girls aren't virgins) might be seen as unfair. People have the right to date who they want, but when that choice is based on criteria that others find discriminatory, it can be problematic. The author isn't making a blanket statement about all non-virgins being undesirable, but his personal preference is causing harm in the sense that the rejected individuals feel shamed.\n\nAnother angle is that the author is honest about his preferences, which is fair in a way. However, the way he applies this preference\u2014without considering the other person's autonomy and without discussing it openly\u2014could be seen as controlling. If he's not willing to date someone for a reason that's not related to their behavior towards him (like respect, compatibility), it's more about his own standards rather than the other person's actions.\n\nMoreover, the fact that the rejected girls are upset and feel shamed is a valid reaction. Even if the author means to be non-judgmental, his actions still marginalize them based on their sexual history. This can perpetuate stigma and reinforce harmful attitudes. So, even if the author isn't malicious, his stance is inconsiderate and contributes to a culture of slut-shaming.\n\nIn conclusion, while the author's preference is his choice, the way he enforces it and the impact it has on others likely makes him the AITA. The answer would be A for Yes.\n"
