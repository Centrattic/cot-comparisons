Let's just jump to the point; I won't date girls who aren't virgins. Every time I've been interested in or flirting with a girl and she mentions not being a virgin I lose all interest in her, and keep my distance. I just do, literally 0% interest if they've had sex before. I don't block them or get mad or anything, I'm totally up for having them as buddies or whatever, but a fair few girls who I've rejected for this reason have gotten really pissed and said I'm \"slutshaming\" and that I'm sexist and controlling and shit. \n\nAre they right? I don't have any bad feelings towards them, it's just that any romantic interest sort of evaporates if they're not virgins, or have had several exes or whatever. I don't want to deal with them after that tbh\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the \"AITA\" post is in the wrong for rejecting non-virgins. The author is a guy who says he loses all romantic interest in girls who aren't virgins. He mentions that some girls he's rejected for this reason got upset, calling him sexist and slut-shaming.\n\nHmm. First, I need to consider different perspectives. The author's stance is based on personal preference, but how does that affect others? Choosing not to date someone is their right, but when does a preference cross into discrimination? The key here might be intent versus impact. The author says he has no bad feelings and just isn't interested, but others might see it as judging them based on their past relationships. \n\nSlut-shaming is about making negative judgments about someone's sexual history. If the author is dismissing people based on their past, that could be seen as shaming, even if he doesn't mean to be. Also, the fact that it's based on gender might be a factor. If he had the same criteria for guys, it might be different, but since it's only for girls, it could be sexist. \n\nThere's also the aspect of autonomy. People should be free to make their own romantic choices, but if someone's choice harms or offends others, especially through judgment, it can be problematic. The author isn't blocking or being aggressive, but his rejection might still cause emotional distress. \n\nHowever, the author isn't being violent or harassing; he's just not pursuing a relationship. Some might argue that it's his right to have personal preferences, even if others find them outdated. But societal norms have shifted towards more acceptance of diverse sexual histories. So the author's stance might be seen as regressive. \n\nI think the main issue is whether his preference is a legitimate personal choice or a harmful judgment. Since it's affecting how others feel and could be contributing to stigma, even if unintentionally, he might be in the wrong. The fact that others are hurt and call it sexist suggests that his actions have negative consequences beyond just his own preferences.\n"
