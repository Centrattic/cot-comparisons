Let's just jump to the point; I won't date girls who aren't virgins. Every time I've been interested in or flirting with a girl and she mentions not being a virgin I lose all interest in her, and keep my distance. I just do, literally 0% interest if they've had sex before. I don't block them or get mad or anything, I'm totally up for having them as buddies or whatever, but a fair few girls who I've rejected for this reason have gotten really pissed and said I'm \"slutshaming\" and that I'm sexist and controlling and shit. \n\nAre they right? I don't have any bad feelings towards them, it's just that any romantic interest sort of evaporates if they're not virgins, or have had several exes or whatever. I don't want to deal with them after that tbh\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the \"AITA\" post is in the wrong. The situation is about him rejecting non-virgins. He's 18, male, and says he loses interest if a girl isn't a virgin. The other people he's rejected have called him sexist and slut-shaming.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethics here. He's not forcing anyone; he's just stating his personal preference. But the question is whether that preference is wrong. From a moral standpoint, virginity isn't a standard that should dictate someone's worth. People have different values, but judging others for their sexual history can be seen as discriminatory. Slut-shaming is a real issue, so if his actions contribute to that, he might be in the wrong.\n\nHowever, he's not being violent or abusive. He's just choosing not to date them and remains friends. People have the right to their preferences, but when those preferences devalue others based on arbitrary criteria, it can be problematic. The key here is whether his actions are harmful. The girls are upset because they feel judged, which can affect their self-esteem. \n\nOn the other hand, he's being honest about his preferences. But societal norms are changing, and many view such preferences as outdated or discriminatory. So while he's not breaking the law, his stance might be considered prejudiced. The answer might lean towards A (wrong) because it's about respect for others' choices and not judging them for their past.\n"
