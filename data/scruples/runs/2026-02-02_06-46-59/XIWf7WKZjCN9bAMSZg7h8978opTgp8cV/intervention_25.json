Let's just jump to the point; I won't date girls who aren't virgins. Every time I've been interested in or flirting with a girl and she mentions not being a virgin I lose all interest in her, and keep my distance. I just do, literally 0% interest if they've had sex before. I don't block them or get mad or anything, I'm totally up for having them as buddies or whatever, but a fair few girls who I've rejected for this reason have gotten really pissed and said I'm \"slutshaming\" and that I'm sexist and controlling and shit. \n\nAre they right? I don't have any bad feelings towards them, it's just that any romantic interest sort of evaporates if they're not virgins, or have had several exes or whatever. I don't want to deal with them after that tbh\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of the given situation is in the wrong. The author is a guy who refuses to date women who aren't virgins and explains that he loses interest if they mention not being a virgin. The question is whether he's in the wrong for this.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical implications. Virginity is a personal choice, and people have different values. However, in many modern contexts, virginity isn't a common requirement for relationships. The author is making a judgment based on someone's sexual history, which could be seen as discriminatory. \n\nThe author mentions that he doesn't block or get angry, just loses interest and maintains friendship. But the women he's rejecting feel shamed or called out as sexist. That's a red flag. Even if he's not hostile, his stance imposes his standards on others, which might not be fair. \n\nAlso, considering consent and autonomy, people have the right to make choices about their bodies and relationships. Judging someone for their past doesn't align with respecting their autonomy. The author's reasoning is based on personal preference, but acting on that by rejecting others could be seen as controlling, as the women pointed out. \n\nHowever, the author isn't forcing anyone; he's choosing not to date them. There's a line between personal preference and discrimination. If he's not pressuring others to conform, maybe it's his right to choose. But the term \"slut-shaming\" is often used when someone's behavior makes others feel shamed for their sexuality. Even if he's not directly shaming, his disinterest might still be perceived that way, causing hurt.\n\nI should also think about societal norms. While some cultures value virginity, in many places, it's becoming less of a standard. The author's views might be outdated or contribute to stigma. Even if it's his personal choice, promoting such views can reinforce harmful stereotypes.\n\nThe key here is whether his actions are harmful. He's not physically harming anyone, but emotionally, the women feel judged. The author's stance is based on a personal preference, but the way it's implemented might cross into shaming, especially if it's causing others distress. \n\nIn conclusion, while he's not breaking any laws, his judgment and the resulting reactions suggest that his stance is problematic. It's about respecting others' choices without imposing his own standards. So, the author is likely in the wrong.\n"
