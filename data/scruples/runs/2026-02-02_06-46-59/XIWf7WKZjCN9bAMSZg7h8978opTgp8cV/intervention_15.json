Let's just jump to the point; I won't date girls who aren't virgins. Every time I've been interested in or flirting with a girl and she mentions not being a virgin I lose all interest in her, and keep my distance. I just do, literally 0% interest if they've had sex before. I don't block them or get mad or anything, I'm totally up for having them as buddies or whatever, but a fair few girls who I've rejected for this reason have gotten really pissed and said I'm \"slutshaming\" and that I'm sexist and controlling and shit. \n\nAre they right? I don't have any bad feelings towards them, it's just that any romantic interest sort of evaporates if they're not virgins, or have had several exes or whatever. I don't want to deal with them after that tbh\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the situation described is in the wrong. The author is a guy who refuses to date girls who aren't virgins and distances himself when they mention having had sex. He claims it's not out of malice but just a loss of interest. The girls he rejects accuse him of slutshaming and being sexist.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical implications here. The author is making a personal choice about his dating preferences. However, the key issue here is whether his preference is harmful or discriminatory. The term \"slutshaming\" is used by the girls, which implies they feel judged or criticized for their sexual history. \n\nIn many societies, there's a double standard where women are often judged more harshly than men for their sexual behavior. The author's stance could be perpetuating this double standard. Even if he doesn't intend to harm, the effect might be that he's devaluing women based on their sexual past, which could be seen as sexist. \n\nAlso, the author's reasoning is based on his personal preference, but in modern contexts, many people argue that a person's sexual history shouldn't disqualify them from being a romantic partner. This could be a matter of personal choice, but if the author is expressing this in a way that's judgmental or makes others feel bad, that's where the issue lies.\n\nThe girls are upset because they feel shamed. The author isn't blocking them but just losing interest, but the fact that they feel targeted is important. Even if it's a personal preference, the way it's communicated can affect others negatively. \n\nAnother angle is consent and autonomy. The author isn't controlling their actions, but his preference might be seen as controlling the narrative about their choices. It's about whether his preference is a harmless personal choice or a harmful judgment.\n\nIn conclusion, while the author claims no ill intent, his preference could be contributing to a culture of judgment that's harmful. The key question is whether his stance is a legitimate personal choice or if it's discriminatory. Given the context, the answer might lean towards the author being in the wrong because his preference reinforces negative stereotypes and double standards against women.\n"
