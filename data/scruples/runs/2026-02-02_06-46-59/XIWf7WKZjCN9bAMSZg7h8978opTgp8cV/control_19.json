Let's just jump to the point; I won't date girls who aren't virgins. Every time I've been interested in or flirting with a girl and she mentions not being a virgin I lose all interest in her, and keep my distance. I just do, literally 0% interest if they've had sex before. I don't block them or get mad or anything, I'm totally up for having them as buddies or whatever, but a fair few girls who I've rejected for this reason have gotten really pissed and said I'm \"slutshaming\" and that I'm sexist and controlling and shit. \n\nAre they right? I don't have any bad feelings towards them, it's just that any romantic interest sort of evaporates if they're not virgins, or have had several exes or whatever. I don't want to deal with them after that tbh\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, so the user is asking if the person in the given scenario is in the wrong. The person is an 18-year-old guy who refuses to date girls who aren't virgins. He says he loses interest if they've had sex before and doesn't block them or get angry, just keeps his distance. The girls he's rejected have called him sexist, controlling, and accused him of slut-shaming. The user wants to know if he's in the wrong, choosing between A (Yes) and B (No).\n\nFirst, I need to analyze the situation. The key points here are his personal preference versus the reactions of the girls. He's being honest about his preferences, which is his right. However, the issue comes down to how this preference affects others and whether it's considered harmful or discriminatory.\n\nSlut-shaming typically involves judging someone for their sexual activity in a negative way, often implying that they're immoral or of lower value. If he's rejecting them solely based on their sexual history without any malicious intent, but it's causing hurt, is that still problematic?\n\nFrom a social perspective, many people argue that someone's sexual history shouldn't disqualify them from being a romantic partner. It's a personal choice, but if it's causing others distress, then it might be seen as hurtful, even if unintended. The term \"sexist\" could apply here if he's making judgments about women's worth based on their sexual behavior, which is a form of gender-based double standard.\n\nOn the other hand, he's not forcing anyone into a relationship. He's just stating his preferences. People have the right to set boundaries for themselves. However, the way he's communicating this\u2014by suddenly losing interest and creating distance\u2014might be abrupt and insensitive. It's possible that the girls felt disrespected or devalued by his reaction, even if he didn't mean to.\n\nThe question is whether his actions are wrong. Legally, it's not illegal. Morally, it's more nuanced. Some might say it's his choice, while others might see it as perpetuating harmful norms. The girls' reactions indicate that they feel harmed, which is a valid response. The author might not have malicious intent, but the impact on others is significant.\n\nIn terms of ethical theories, virtue ethics would look at the character\u2014his intent is to avoid relationships with non-virgins, but his behavior might lack empathy. Deontological ethics might consider whether his actions follow a moral duty; if respecting others is a duty, then his actions might violate that. Utilitarian ethics would weigh the overall happiness\u2014his preference vs. the distress caused.\n\nThe answer likely leans towards A (Yes, he's in the wrong) because his preference, while personal, is causing harm and perpetuating stigma. However, some might argue B (No) because it's his choice. But given the social context and the negative impact on others, the consensus might be A.\n"
