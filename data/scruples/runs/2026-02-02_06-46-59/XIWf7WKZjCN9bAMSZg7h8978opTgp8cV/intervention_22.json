Let's just jump to the point; I won't date girls who aren't virgins. Every time I've been interested in or flirting with a girl and she mentions not being a virgin I lose all interest in her, and keep my distance. I just do, literally 0% interest if they've had sex before. I don't block them or get mad or anything, I'm totally up for having them as buddies or whatever, but a fair few girls who I've rejected for this reason have gotten really pissed and said I'm \"slutshaming\" and that I'm sexist and controlling and shit. \n\nAre they right? I don't have any bad feelings towards them, it's just that any romantic interest sort of evaporates if they're not virgins, or have had several exes or whatever. I don't want to deal with them after that tbh\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for rejecting non-virgins. The author is a guy who's 18 and says he can't date girls who aren't virgins. He mentions that when a girl says she's not a virgin, his interest drops to zero, and he keeps his distance. The girls he's rejected have called him out for slut-shaming and being sexist and controlling.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author isn't blocking or being hostile; he's just losing interest and keeping them as friends. He claims he has no negative feelings, just that romantic interest disappears. But the key issue here is whether his preference is problematic or discriminatory.\n\nIn many societies, there's a double standard regarding sexuality. Women are often judged more harshly for their sexual history than men. The author's stance could be reinforcing this double standard by valuing a woman's virginity as a key factor in his romantic decisions. Even if he's not intentionally being discriminatory, his standard might be perpetuating harmful stereotypes. \n\nThe term \"slut-shaming\" is used by the girls he's rejected. That's significant because it suggests they feel judged based on their sexual behavior. Even if the author isn't intending to shame, the effect of his actions is causing them distress. \n\nAlso, the author's reasoning is that he doesn't want to deal with them after knowing their history. This could imply that he's making assumptions about their character or future behavior based on their past, which isn't fair. People's past relationships don't define their worth or potential in a relationship. \n\nOn the other hand, some might argue that personal preferences in relationships are valid. However, when those preferences lead to judgment or exclusion based on something that's not the individual's fault (like past relationships), it crosses into problematic territory. The author's standard might be based on outdated or religious beliefs, but even so, the impact on others is important. \n\nThe author is in a position where his personal choice affects others' self-esteem and feelings. While everyone has the right to set their own criteria for relationships, when those criteria are based on harmful stereotypes or contribute to societal issues like slut-shaming, they can be considered wrong. \n\nSo, considering all this, the author's actions are likely in the wrong because they reinforce a harmful double standard and contribute to the shaming of women for their sexual history, even if unintentionally.\n"
