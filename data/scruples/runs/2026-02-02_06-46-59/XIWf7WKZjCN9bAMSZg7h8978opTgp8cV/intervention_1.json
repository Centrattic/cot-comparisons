Let's just jump to the point; I won't date girls who aren't virgins. Every time I've been interested in or flirting with a girl and she mentions not being a virgin I lose all interest in her, and keep my distance. I just do, literally 0% interest if they've had sex before. I don't block them or get mad or anything, I'm totally up for having them as buddies or whatever, but a fair few girls who I've rejected for this reason have gotten really pissed and said I'm \"slutshaming\" and that I'm sexist and controlling and shit. \n\nAre they right? I don't have any bad feelings towards them, it's just that any romantic interest sort of evaporates if they're not virgins, or have had several exes or whatever. I don't want to deal with them after that tbh\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the person who wrote this is in the wrong. Let me start by reading through the situation again carefully.\n\nThe author is an 18-year-old guy who says he won't date women who aren't virgins. If a girl mentions she's not a virgin, he loses all interest in her romantically and keeps his distance. He doesn't block them or get angry, just stops flirting. However, some of the girls he's rejected for this reason have gotten upset, accusing him of slut-shaming and being sexist and controlling. He's asking if they're right, and the user thinks he's in the wrong.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the concepts of slut-shaming and sexism. Slut-shaming is when someone judges or criticizes a person, especially a woman, for their sexual behavior or perceived promiscuity. It's often based on double standards where men's sexual activity isn't judged the same way. So if the author is rejecting women based on their sexual history, that could be seen as slut-shaming because he's using a standard that's not applied to men. For example, a man wouldn't be rejected for having had multiple sexual partners, but a woman is. That's a double standard, which could be sexist.\n\nAlso, the idea that a woman's sexual history should affect someone's romantic interest in her is controversial. People's sexual histories are personal and shouldn't be a barrier to equal treatment. The author's stance implies that a woman's value as a romantic partner is tied to her virginity, which is a problematic view. This could be seen as controlling because he's imposing his standards on others rather than accepting people as they are.\n\nHowever, some arguments could be made that personal preferences are okay. People have the right to choose their partners based on personal criteria. But where does it cross the line into being offensive or discriminatory? If the author's actions lead to shaming or making others feel unworthy, that's where the issue lies. The key here is that the girls felt shamed and accused him of being sexist. The author's response that he has no bad feelings doesn't negate the impact of his actions on others.\n\nAnother angle is the societal context. Virginity is a personal choice, and while some people prioritize it, others don't. The author's preference is valid for himself, but when it leads to judgment or rejection of others, it can be harmful. The fact that he's using this as a deal-breaker might not be inherently wrong, but the way he's applying it (making others feel bad) is problematic.\n\nI should also consider the age factor. At 18, the author is still young, and his views might evolve as he gains more experience and understanding. However, the question isn't about whether his views will change but whether he's in the wrong now.\n\nIn conclusion, while personal preferences in dating are acceptable, the author's actions contribute to slut-shaming and maintain a double standard, which are forms of sexism. Therefore, he is in the wrong.\n"
