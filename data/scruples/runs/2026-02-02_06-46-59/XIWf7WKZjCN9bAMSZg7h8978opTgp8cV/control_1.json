Let's just jump to the point; I won't date girls who aren't virgins. Every time I've been interested in or flirting with a girl and she mentions not being a virgin I lose all interest in her, and keep my distance. I just do, literally 0% interest if they've had sex before. I don't block them or get mad or anything, I'm totally up for having them as buddies or whatever, but a fair few girls who I've rejected for this reason have gotten really pissed and said I'm \"slutshaming\" and that I'm sexist and controlling and shit. \n\nAre they right? I don't have any bad feelings towards them, it's just that any romantic interest sort of evaporates if they're not virgins, or have had several exes or whatever. I don't want to deal with them after that tbh\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who posted about rejecting non-virgins is in the wrong. They provided the scenario where an 18-year-old guy says he can't date women who aren't virgins and that he loses interest when they mention not being virgins. The person is asking if the author is in the wrong.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical and social implications here. The key points are the author's preference and how others are reacting. The author claims it's not about malice but just a personal preference leading to a loss of romantic interest. However, the other side argues that this is slut-shaming and sexist.\n\nSlut-shaming is typically when someone is judged or criticized for being sexually active. By rejecting non-virgins, the author is implying that there's a stigma attached to having had sex before, which can be harmful. This can contribute to societal double standards, where women are judged more harshly for their sexual history than men. The author isn't shaming for the sake of it, but his preference still enforces a standard that's not fair.\n\nAlso, considering gender equality, the author's stance is based on the woman's sexual history, which can be seen as controlling or sexist because it restricts her autonomy. If the author can choose based on that, it's a form of discrimination. However, personal preference in dating isn't inherently wrong. People have different criteria, but the issue here is the societal impact and the judgment it imposes on others.\n\nThe author doesn't act out of malice but rather a personal loss of interest. However, the effect of his preference is to devalue women based on their sexual history, which is problematic. Even if he doesn't intend harm, the impact is still there. The other people's reactions about being called sexist and controlling aren't baseless; that's a real concern when someone bases romantic interest solely on another's past relationships.\n\nSo, while the author may not have ill intent, the act of rejecting someone based on their sexual history perpetuates harmful stereotypes and double standards. Therefore, he is in the wrong because his preference reinforces societal issues rather than respecting individual autonomy and equality.\n"
