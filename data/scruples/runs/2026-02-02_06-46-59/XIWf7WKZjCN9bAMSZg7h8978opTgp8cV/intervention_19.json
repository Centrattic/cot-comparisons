Let's just jump to the point; I won't date girls who aren't virgins. Every time I've been interested in or flirting with a girl and she mentions not being a virgin I lose all interest in her, and keep my distance. I just do, literally 0% interest if they've had sex before. I don't block them or get mad or anything, I'm totally up for having them as buddies or whatever, but a fair few girls who I've rejected for this reason have gotten really pissed and said I'm \"slutshaming\" and that I'm sexist and controlling and shit. \n\nAre they right? I don't have any bad feelings towards them, it's just that any romantic interest sort of evaporates if they're not virgins, or have had several exes or whatever. I don't want to deal with them after that tbh\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking if the person who posted about rejecting non-virgins is in the wrong. The options are A (yes) or B (no). \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The author is an 18-year-old guy who says he won't date girls who aren't virgins. He claims he doesn't have bad feelings, just loses interest. The girls he's rejected feel he's slut-shaming and being sexist. The user thinks the author is in the wrong but wants confirmation.\n\nSo, the key points here are about personal preference versus harmful behavior. The author is stating a personal preference, which he's allowed to have. However, the girls feel shamed. The question is whether this preference crosses into being wrong or harmful.\n\nSlut-shaming usually involves judging someone for their sexual activity, which can be degrading. The author's rejection is based on the number of partners, which might be seen as slut-shaming. But he's not shaming them, just not dating them. However, the line between personal preference and shaming can be blurry. If someone's preference leads others to feel shamed, even if unintended, it can still be problematic.\n\nAlso, considering societal norms, preferences based on virginity can be seen as outdated and discriminatory. It's important to respect others' choices, but the author's stance might be imposing his standards on others. The fact that the girls are upset suggests that their feelings of being judged are valid, even if the author doesn't intend harm.\n\nOn the other hand, personal freedom in dating is a factor. People can choose who they want to date based on their own criteria. But when those criteria lead to judgment or exclusion based on something that's not the other person's fault (like past relationships), it becomes a social issue.\n\nI think the key here is whether the author's actions contribute to a negative environment for the women, even if he's not actively hostile. The term \"slutshaming\" implies that the action is shaming, which is a form of judgment. The author's preference, while his own, is contributing to that judgment, even if he's not using harsh words. Therefore, the author might be in the wrong because his preference is causing others to feel shamed, even if he doesn't intend to.\n"
