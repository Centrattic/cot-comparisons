Let's just jump to the point; I won't date girls who aren't virgins. Every time I've been interested in or flirting with a girl and she mentions not being a virgin I lose all interest in her, and keep my distance. I just do, literally 0% interest if they've had sex before. I don't block them or get mad or anything, I'm totally up for having them as buddies or whatever, but a fair few girls who I've rejected for this reason have gotten really pissed and said I'm \"slutshaming\" and that I'm sexist and controlling and shit. \n\nAre they right? I don't have any bad feelings towards them, it's just that any romantic interest sort of evaporates if they're not virgins, or have had several exes or whatever. I don't want to deal with them after that tbh\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, so the user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong. Let me start by breaking down the situation. The author is 18, male, and he won't date girls who aren't virgins. He says that when he finds out a girl isn't a virgin, he loses all romantic interest but is still okay as friends. The girls he's rejected have accused him of slut-shaming and being sexist and controlling. The question is whether he's in the wrong.\n\nFirst, I need to consider societal norms and personal choice. In many modern contexts, the idea of valuing virginity in a partner is seen as outdated and potentially discriminatory. Virginity is a personal choice, and people have different reasons for their experiences. By rejecting someone based on their sexual history, the author is making a judgment about their personal decisions, which could be seen as disrespectful or judgmental.\n\nThen there's the aspect of slut-shaming. The term refers to the practice of publicly humiliating or criticizing someone for their perceived promiscuity. If the author is making girls feel shamed or judged, even if he doesn't intend to, that's a problem. The fact that the girls are upset and feel targeted suggests that his actions might be harmful, even if he's not being overtly hostile.\n\nSexism is another angle. The author is making decisions based on a woman's sexual history, which is a personal choice and not a reflection of her character. By imposing his preferences and then being surprised that others are upset, he might be displaying sexist attitudes, as he's reducing women to their sexual behavior.\n\nHowever, the author does mention that he's not blocking them or being hostile, just losing interest. He claims it's not out of malice but personal preference. Personal preferences in dating are generally acceptable, but when they lead to judgmental behavior or contribute to a harmful societal norm, they cross into problematic territory.\n\nI should also consider the age factor. The author is 18, which is a time when people are forming their views on relationships and society. It's possible he hasn't fully considered the implications of his preferences. Education and awareness could help him understand why his behavior is problematic.\n\nIn conclusion, while it's his personal right to have dating preferences, the way his preferences are applied and the resulting harm (even if unintended) might place him in the wrong. The key is whether his actions perpetuate harmful stereotypes and whether it's acceptable to judge others based on their past without considering their personal journey.\n"
