Let's just jump to the point; I won't date girls who aren't virgins. Every time I've been interested in or flirting with a girl and she mentions not being a virgin I lose all interest in her, and keep my distance. I just do, literally 0% interest if they've had sex before. I don't block them or get mad or anything, I'm totally up for having them as buddies or whatever, but a fair few girls who I've rejected for this reason have gotten really pissed and said I'm \"slutshaming\" and that I'm sexist and controlling and shit. \n\nAre they right? I don't have any bad feelings towards them, it's just that any romantic interest sort of evaporates if they're not virgins, or have had several exes or whatever. I don't want to deal with them after that tbh\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the person who wrote the AITA question is in the wrong. The situation is that he's 18 and only wants to date girls who are virgins. He says that when he finds out a girl isn't a virgin, he loses all romantic interest but still wants to be friends. The girls he's rejected are upset, calling him sexist and slut-shaming. He's asking if he's in the wrong.\n\nFirst, I should consider the key points here. The main issue is his preference for virgins in romantic relationships. Let me think about societal norms and values. In many modern contexts, the idea of valuing someone's virginity as a prerequisite for dating is seen as outdated and potentially discriminatory. Virginity isn't typically considered a relevant factor in whether someone is a good partner, and such preferences can be viewed as judgmental.\n\nSlut-shaming is about shaming someone for their sexual activity, but in this case, the user is not shaming the girls; he's just stating his preference. However, his preference could be seen as contributing to a culture where people judge others based on their sexual history. The girls feel he's sexist because he's applying a standard that doesn't seem to be reciprocated (he doesn't mention being a virgin himself). That could be a point of sexism if he's holding women to a different standard than men.\n\nAlso, the user mentions that he doesn't have bad feelings and is open to friendship, but the key issue is the rejection based on something that's personal and not necessarily a reflection of the person's character. The question is whether this preference is his right or if it's harmful. \n\nThere's the aspect of personal choice in relationships. People can have preferences, but when those preferences impose judgment or lead to discrimination, it's problematic. The user's reasoning (\"I don't want to deal with them after that\") seems to imply that he has negative assumptions about non-virgins, which might not be fair. \n\nLegally, there's no wrong in having personal preferences, but socially and ethically, there's a strong case that this preference is discriminatory. It's important to recognize that sexual history is a personal matter and doesn't affect one's worthiness as a partner. By rejecting people based on this, the user is enforcing a double standard that can be hurtful.\n\nAnother angle is the potential for this to be controlling. By making a strict rule about virginity, he's limiting others' autonomy in their romantic decisions. However, since he's choosing not to date them based on his own criteria, it's more about his choice rather than controlling others. Still, the way it's presented might come across as controlling because it's an absolute cutoff without room for individual judgment.\n\nIn conclusion, while the user is technically within his right to have personal preferences, the societal and ethical implications suggest that his preference is problematic. It contributes to slut-shaming and sexism, even if unintentionally. Therefore, he is likely in the wrong because his preference discriminates against others based on irrelevant personal choices.\n"
