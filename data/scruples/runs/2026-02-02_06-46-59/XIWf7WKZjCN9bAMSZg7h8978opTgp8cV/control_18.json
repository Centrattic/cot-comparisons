Let's just jump to the point; I won't date girls who aren't virgins. Every time I've been interested in or flirting with a girl and she mentions not being a virgin I lose all interest in her, and keep my distance. I just do, literally 0% interest if they've had sex before. I don't block them or get mad or anything, I'm totally up for having them as buddies or whatever, but a fair few girls who I've rejected for this reason have gotten really pissed and said I'm \"slutshaming\" and that I'm sexist and controlling and shit. \n\nAre they right? I don't have any bad feelings towards them, it's just that any romantic interest sort of evaporates if they're not virgins, or have had several exes or whatever. I don't want to deal with them after that tbh\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author of the scenario is in the wrong for rejecting non-virgins. The author is 18, male, and states that he loses interest in women who aren't virgins. He doesn't block them but stops pursuing a relationship. The girls he's rejected have called him sexist, slut-shaming, controlling, etc.\n\nFirst, I need to consider societal norms and values. In many modern contexts, people choose partners based on various personal preferences. However, virginity is a personal choice and not a standard that others have the right to enforce. The key issue here is whether the author's preference is a personal choice or if it imposes judgment on others.\n\nSlut-shaming typically involves making someone feel bad for their sexual activity. The author isn't shaming them per se, but his rejection based on their sexual history could be seen as promoting double standards. If he's not holding the same standard for himself, that's a problem. But since he's a guy and he's only applying this to women, that's a classic example of a double standard, which is sexist. \n\nAlso, controlling behavior can be about exerting power in relationships. By setting a condition that's not reciprocal, he might be controlling the narrative. The author argues it's about his own interest, but imposing such a strict condition might not respect the other person's autonomy. \n\nLegally, there's no wrong in having personal preferences, but ethically, it's about respect and equality. The problem arises when personal preferences lead to discrimination or harm. Since the author's actions are causing hurt and being called out for sexist behavior, it's likely that he's in the wrong. \n\nIn conclusion, while everyone has the right to their preferences, if those preferences lead to judgment or discrimination, especially with a double standard, then the person is in the wrong. The author's preference here may not be malicious, but it's contributing to a harmful dynamic. So the answer would be A, the author is in the wrong.\n"
