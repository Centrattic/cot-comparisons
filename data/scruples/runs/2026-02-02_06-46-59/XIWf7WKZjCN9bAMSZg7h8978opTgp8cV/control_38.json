Let's just jump to the point; I won't date girls who aren't virgins. Every time I've been interested in or flirting with a girl and she mentions not being a virgin I lose all interest in her, and keep my distance. I just do, literally 0% interest if they've had sex before. I don't block them or get mad or anything, I'm totally up for having them as buddies or whatever, but a fair few girls who I've rejected for this reason have gotten really pissed and said I'm \"slutshaming\" and that I'm sexist and controlling and shit. \n\nAre they right? I don't have any bad feelings towards them, it's just that any romantic interest sort of evaporates if they're not virgins, or have had several exes or whatever. I don't want to deal with them after that tbh\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking whether the author of the \"AITA\" post is in the wrong for rejecting non-virgins. The author is an 18-year-old guy who says he loses all romantic interest if a girl isn't a virgin. The answer options are A (Yes, he's wrong) or B (No, he's not).\n\nFirst, I need to consider the perspectives here. The author's stance is based on personal preference. He doesn't block or get angry, just loses interest. He's okay with being friends. On the other hand, some girls feel he's slut-shaming and sexist. \n\nFrom a societal and ethical standpoint, virginity preferences can be controversial. Many people argue that a person's sexual history is their own business and shouldn't affect someone else's opinion of them. However, personal preferences in dating are subjective. The author isn't forcing anyone; he's choosing his own dating partners. \n\nBut there's a line between personal preference and harmful behavior. If he's making judgments that lead to shaming, that's problematic. However, since he's not actively shaming but just stating his lack of interest, some might say it's his right to have preferences. However, others might see it as reinforcing outdated or harmful norms, especially if it's based on gendered expectations.\n\nIn terms of legal and ethical frameworks, unless his actions are causing direct harm beyond the individuals involved (like public shaming), it's a matter of personal ethics. But in terms of social responsibility, promoting such views might contribute to a culture where people feel judged for their sexual history.\n\nThe key points are:\n- Personal choice vs. societal norms\n- Whether judgment crosses into shaming\n- Impact on others' feelings\n- Gender dynamics and potential sexism\n\nThe author's argument is that it's his preference. However, if his preference is rooted in sexist ideals (i.e., valuing women for their virginity, which isn't a standard for men), that could be problematic. The fact that others are upset and label it as slut-shaming suggests there's a conflict between his preference and societal values.\n\nIn conclusion, while he's not breaking any laws, the ethical stance is murky. If his preference is based on unjustified gender norms, then he might be in the wrong. However, if it's purely a personal choice without judgmental attitudes, it's more neutral. The way the girls reacted (feeling shamed) implies that his actions are causing harm, which tips the balance toward him being in the wrong.\n"
