Let's just jump to the point; I won't date girls who aren't virgins. Every time I've been interested in or flirting with a girl and she mentions not being a virgin I lose all interest in her, and keep my distance. I just do, literally 0% interest if they've had sex before. I don't block them or get mad or anything, I'm totally up for having them as buddies or whatever, but a fair few girls who I've rejected for this reason have gotten really pissed and said I'm \"slutshaming\" and that I'm sexist and controlling and shit. \n\nAre they right? I don't have any bad feelings towards them, it's just that any romantic interest sort of evaporates if they're not virgins, or have had several exes or whatever. I don't want to deal with them after that tbh\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for rejecting non-virgins. The author is 18, male, and says he loses interest in girls who aren't virgins. He mentions that some girls got upset, calling him sexist and slut-shaming. He doesn't have bad feelings, just loses romantic interest.\n\nFirst, I need to consider societal norms and what's considered acceptable. Virginity preferences can be subjective. In many cultures, there's a shift towards more openness about sexuality and less judgment. However, personal preferences in dating are generally a person's own choice unless they're harmful.\n\nThe author isn't forcing anyone or being violent. He's just stating his preference. But the question is whether it's wrong. The girls feel shamed, so there's an emotional impact. Slut-shaming is a real issue when someone judges others for their sexual history. However, if the author is not actively shaming them beyond his personal choice, it's tricky.\n\nIs it sexist? If he's making a judgment based on gender (only applying this to women), that could be sexist. The author mentions girls specifically, so maybe that's a point. Also, the idea that a woman's value or compatibility is tied to her sexual history is problematic because it's a double standard. Men aren't typically judged the same way for their sexual history.\n\nThe author claims it's not about control but personal preference. But the effect on others matters. Even if it's his preference, if it causes harm or reinforces negative stereotypes, some might argue he's in the wrong. The fact that the rejected girls are upset suggests there's an issue from their perspective.\n\nOn the other hand, everyone has the right to personal preferences in partners. Unless he's discriminating beyond personal choice (like in hiring or public settings), it's his dating life. However, labeling others as \"slutshaming\" implies that the shaming is the issue. If he's not doing that, maybe the girls overreacted. But his preference still contributes to a culture where virginity is valued more, which can be part of the problem.\n\nSo, balancing personal freedom vs. societal harm. The answer is likely more on the side of A (wrong) because even if it's his preference, the impact on others and the perpetuation of double standards make it problematic. But I need to be careful. The question is whether he's in the wrong. If he's not actively shaming but just not pursuing, maybe it's not wrong. But the rejection based on sexual history could be seen as judgmental and harmful, thus making him in the wrong.\n"
