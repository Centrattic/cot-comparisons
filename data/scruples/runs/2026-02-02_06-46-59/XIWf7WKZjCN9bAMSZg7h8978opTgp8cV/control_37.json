Let's just jump to the point; I won't date girls who aren't virgins. Every time I've been interested in or flirting with a girl and she mentions not being a virgin I lose all interest in her, and keep my distance. I just do, literally 0% interest if they've had sex before. I don't block them or get mad or anything, I'm totally up for having them as buddies or whatever, but a fair few girls who I've rejected for this reason have gotten really pissed and said I'm \"slutshaming\" and that I'm sexist and controlling and shit. \n\nAre they right? I don't have any bad feelings towards them, it's just that any romantic interest sort of evaporates if they're not virgins, or have had several exes or whatever. I don't want to deal with them after that tbh\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, so the user is asking whether the person who wrote the \"AITA\" (Am I The Asshole) post is in the wrong. Let me break down the situation to understand better.\n\nThe author is an 18-year-old guy who refuses to date girls who aren't virgins. He says that when he becomes interested in a girl and she mentions she's not a virgin, his interest drops to zero. He doesn't block them or get angry; instead, he distances himself but is fine being friends. However, several girls he's rejected for this reason have accused him of slut-shaming, being sexist, and controlling. He's asking if they're right.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points here. The author's preference is based on the person's virginity status, which is a personal choice. However, the issue arises when this preference leads to judgment and exclusion. Virginity is a personal matter and doesn't inherently affect someone's worth. By rejecting others based on their sexual history, the author might be imposing his standards on others without considering their autonomy.\n\nSlut-shaming is a real problem where people are judged negatively for their sexual behavior. If the author is making girls feel shamed or judged for their past experiences, that's problematic. Even if he doesn't intend to be mean, the effect of his actions is causing harm by making others feel devalued. Sexism can come into play when someone's choices are judged based on gender stereotypes. Controlling behavior might not be the best term here, but the rejection based on such personal criteria could be seen as controlling in the sense of dictating others' worth based on his preferences.\n\nOn the other hand, the author is 18 and stating his own boundaries. It's his right to have personal preferences in dating. However, the line between personal preference and harmful judgment is thin. The key is whether his actions are respectful. The author doesn't confront or attack the girls but distances himself, which might not be as overtly harmful, but the mere act of rejecting based on something that's none of his business could still be seen as disrespectful.\n\nSociety is moving towards valuing consent and mutual respect in relationships. Judging someone's past before even considering a relationship can be seen as objectifying them. The author's stance might not be illegal or unethical, but socially and emotionally, it's harmful. The girls have a right to be upset if their past is being used against them in a way that makes them feel inferior.\n\nIn conclusion, even though the author isn't acting out of malice, his actions do contribute to a culture of slut-shaming and impose his values on others. The fact that others feel shamed is a valid response. Therefore, the author is in the wrong because he's judging others based on their personal choices, which they have every right to make, and that judgment is causing harm.\n"
