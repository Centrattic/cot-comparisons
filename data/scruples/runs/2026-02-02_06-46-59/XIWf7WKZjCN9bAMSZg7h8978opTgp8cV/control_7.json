Let's just jump to the point; I won't date girls who aren't virgins. Every time I've been interested in or flirting with a girl and she mentions not being a virgin I lose all interest in her, and keep my distance. I just do, literally 0% interest if they've had sex before. I don't block them or get mad or anything, I'm totally up for having them as buddies or whatever, but a fair few girls who I've rejected for this reason have gotten really pissed and said I'm \"slutshaming\" and that I'm sexist and controlling and shit. \n\nAre they right? I don't have any bad feelings towards them, it's just that any romantic interest sort of evaporates if they're not virgins, or have had several exes or whatever. I don't want to deal with them after that tbh\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking if the person who wrote the \"AITA\" (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong. The author is a guy who won't date women who aren't virgins. He says that when a woman mentions she's not a virgin, his interest drops to zero, and he keeps his distance, even if they were previously flirting. He doesn't block them or get angry but just loses interest. Some of the girls he's rejected have called him out for slut-shaming and being sexist and controlling. The question is whether he's wrong.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the key points here. The author's stance is about personal preference in dating. He's honest about his standards, but others are upset about it. So, the main issue is whether holding such a preference makes him sexist or hypocritical, even if he's not acting out of malice. \n\nFrom a social perspective, the idea that a woman's sexual history affects a man's willingness to date her is often criticized as perpetuating double standards. Historically, society has been more judgmental of women's sexual behavior than men's. If the author is applying a standard that he wouldn't to himself or other men, that could be problematic. For example, if he's okay with his own past but not with women's, that's a double standard. But the post doesn't mention his own sexual history, so that's unclear.\n\nThe author claims he doesn't have bad feelings and just can't see them romantically after knowing their status. However, the fact that women feel shamed and called him sexist suggests that his actions contribute to a culture where women's choices are policed. This could be seen as slut-shaming, which is a form of gender-based judgment. Even if he's not using derogatory language, his reaction of losing all interest reinforces the idea that a woman's value in a relationship is tied to her sexual history, which is a form of sexism.\n\nAnother angle is the concept of personal choice. Everyone has different preferences in partners, and some people might choose not to date someone for various reasons. However, when such preferences are based on outdated norms or reinforce harmful stereotypes, they can be problematic. The line between personal choice and prejudice is thin here. If the author's reasoning is that he believes women should be pure, that's a moral judgment. If it's about his own comfort, that's different, but it's still about his standards.\n\nAlso, the girls' reactions are valid because feeling shamed implies that the author's rejection is making them feel judged negatively for their choices. Even if he's not intending to shame, the effect is there. Slut-shaming is about making someone feel bad for their sexual activity, and the author's behavior leads to that outcome, hence the term.\n\nIn terms of control, if he's not trying to control the women but is expressing his own dating criteria, then it's not controlling. But the term \"controlling\" might be an overreaction. However, the key issue is whether his personal preference infringes on others' rights or autonomy. Since he's not pressuring them but just stating his own standards, it's more about his own bias.\n\nIn summary, while the author might not have malicious intent, his preference is based on a standard that imposes his beliefs on others and contributes to a double standard. This makes his stance problematic from a social justice perspective. Therefore, the answer would likely be that he's in the wrong (A).\n"
