Let's just jump to the point; I won't date girls who aren't virgins. Every time I've been interested in or flirting with a girl and she mentions not being a virgin I lose all interest in her, and keep my distance. I just do, literally 0% interest if they've had sex before. I don't block them or get mad or anything, I'm totally up for having them as buddies or whatever, but a fair few girls who I've rejected for this reason have gotten really pissed and said I'm \"slutshaming\" and that I'm sexist and controlling and shit. \n\nAre they right? I don't have any bad feelings towards them, it's just that any romantic interest sort of evaporates if they're not virgins, or have had several exes or whatever. I don't want to deal with them after that tbh\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. Let me read through the situation again. The person is an 18-year-old guy who says he won't date girls who aren't virgins. Whenever a girl he's interested in mentions not being a virgin, he loses all interest and keeps his distance. He doesn't block them or get angry, just becomes friends. However, some of the girls he's rejected have accused him of slut-shaming and being sexist and controlling. The question is whether he's in the wrong.\n\nFirst, I should consider the concept of personal preference vs. discrimination. Everyone has the right to set their own relationship criteria, right? So if someone says they only want to date people who meet certain standards, like being a virgin, that's their choice. But then there's the aspect of how that preference is communicated and the impact it has on others. If the girls feel shamed or discriminated against, maybe there's an issue there. \n\nSlut-shaming is a term used when someone judges or criticizes another for their sexual activity, often implying that the person is of lower moral worth. However, the author isn't shaming the girls for their own choices; he's stating his own boundaries. But the problem arises if his rejection is based on their past actions rather than mutual respect. \n\nAlso, the author is a young man who's still in his teens. At 18, many are still figuring out their values and how to express them. However, holding someone to a standard that they might not hold themselves (like requiring a partner to be a virgin) can be seen as double standards or unfair expectations. It's important to consider consent and respect in relationships. If he's not being violent or coercive, just choosing not to date certain people, then it's within his rights. \n\nBut the key point is whether the author's actions are harmful. The girls are upset because they feel judged, and the author's preference might contribute to a culture of slut-shaming. Even if he's not directly shaming them, his preference could be part of a larger societal issue where people are judged based on their sexual history. \n\nAdditionally, the author mentions he's okay with being friends. That might mitigate some of the harm, but it doesn't erase the judgment. People might still feel hurt by rejection based on such a personal standard. The fact that others are calling him sexist and controlling suggests that there's a perception that his behavior is imposing his values onto others, which is a form of control. \n\nOn the other hand, people do have the right to choose their partners based on their own values. If the author's belief is that he only wants a virgin for personal reasons, and he's not forcing others to adhere to that, then it's his choice. The problem comes when that choice leads to shaming or disrespect. The author's response that he doesn't have bad feelings might be true, but the effect on the other person is still negative. \n\nIn summary, while the author isn't breaking any laws, the issue is more about social and ethical implications. His preference might be seen as outdated or discriminatory, contributing to slut-shaming. Even if it's his personal choice, the way it's impacting others could mean he's in the wrong. The girls are right to feel that he's being sexist if he's holding them to a standard he doesn't hold himself to, which is a common issue in gender norms. So, I think the answer is A, the author is in the wrong.\n"
