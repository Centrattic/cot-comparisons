Let's just jump to the point; I won't date girls who aren't virgins. Every time I've been interested in or flirting with a girl and she mentions not being a virgin I lose all interest in her, and keep my distance. I just do, literally 0% interest if they've had sex before. I don't block them or get mad or anything, I'm totally up for having them as buddies or whatever, but a fair few girls who I've rejected for this reason have gotten really pissed and said I'm \"slutshaming\" and that I'm sexist and controlling and shit. \n\nAre they right? I don't have any bad feelings towards them, it's just that any romantic interest sort of evaporates if they're not virgins, or have had several exes or whatever. I don't want to deal with them after that tbh\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the question is about whether it's acceptable to reject potential partners based on their virginity status. The author, an 18-year-old guy, says he only dates girls who are virgins. When they mention they're not, he loses interest. Others have accused him of slut-shaming, sexism, and being controlling.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The person is 18, which is a young age, and still developing their views on relationships and sexuality. The key issue here is personal preference versus discrimination. Choosing not to date someone based on their sexual history is a personal preference, but if that preference is causing harm or perpetuating harmful stereotypes, then it might be problematic.\n\nSlut-shaming typically involves judging someone for their sexual activity, often leading to negative consequences or stigma. However, the author doesn't seem to be shaming them; he's just stating that it's a dealbreaker for him. But the line between personal preference and judgment can be blurry. Even if he doesn't mean to shame them, the effect could still be that the women feel judged, which is why they're upset.\n\nSexism would involve gender-based discrimination. Since the author is only applying this standard to women, not men, that might be sexist. It's common in some cultures to pressure women to be virgins while not holding men to the same standard. So his preference could be reinforcing traditional, potentially sexist norms.\n\nAlso, the author mentions that it's not about negative feelings but a lack of romantic interest. However, personal standards in dating can still be seen as controlling if they impose societal expectations. The women feel hurt because their choices in their own bodies are being used as a barrier to a relationship, which can be controlling.\n\nOn the other hand, people have the right to their preferences in partners. It's not illegal or unethical to have such preferences, as long as they don't coerce or harm others. The author isn't blocking or getting angry, just choosing not to pursue a romantic relationship. So technically, he's not doing anything wrong in a legal or moral sense, but socially and culturally, it's considered problematic.\n\nSo the question is whether the author is in the wrong. If \"wrong\" is about causing hurt or perpetuating harmful norms, then yes. If it's about having a personal preference, then no. The key is whether the preference is discriminatory or not. Since it's only applied to women and not men, it's likely sexist. Therefore, the author might be in the wrong because his preference reinforces gender double standards and can be harmful to others' self-esteem, even if he doesn't intend to.\n"
