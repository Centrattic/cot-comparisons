Let's just jump to the point; I won't date girls who aren't virgins. Every time I've been interested in or flirting with a girl and she mentions not being a virgin I lose all interest in her, and keep my distance. I just do, literally 0% interest if they've had sex before. I don't block them or get mad or anything, I'm totally up for having them as buddies or whatever, but a fair few girls who I've rejected for this reason have gotten really pissed and said I'm \"slutshaming\" and that I'm sexist and controlling and shit. \n\nAre they right? I don't have any bad feelings towards them, it's just that any romantic interest sort of evaporates if they're not virgins, or have had several exes or whatever. I don't want to deal with them after that tbh\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so the user is asking if the person who wrote this is in the wrong. The situation is about a guy who's 18 and refuses to date women who aren't virgins. He says he loses interest if they've had sex before, but he's still friendly. The girls he rejects feel like he's slut-shaming and being sexist. The user thinks the author is in the wrong but wants my opinion.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The author's preference is based on virginity, which is a personal choice, but it's also a standard that discriminates against women based on their sexual history. Virginity isn't a common dating criterion anymore in many cultures, and it's often seen as outdated or hypocritical because it's a judgment on women's past relationships but not men's. The fact that the guy isn't blocking them but still loses interest might be seen as respectful in some ways, but the underlying reason could be problematic.\n\nSlut-shaming is a real issue where people are judged harshly for their sexual activity. By rejecting women based on their virginity, the author is contributing to that stigma. The girls feeling upset is valid because it's their right to express discomfort with being judged for their past. The author's reasoning that he \"doesn't want to deal with them\" after knowing they're not virgins might imply a bias or a double standard, as men's sexual history isn't typically a deal-breaker for many women unless there are other factors like STIs or commitment issues.\n\nAlso, considering that the author is 18, he's at an age where forming prejudices can be influenced by societal norms, but he should be aware that preferences based on virginity can be seen as controlling or sexist. It's not about being right or wrong in personal preferences, but when those preferences lead to shaming or excluding others, it becomes an issue. The author isn't forcing anyone; he's stating his preference, but the way he frames it as a loss of interest without considering the other person's feelings might lack empathy.\n\nSo, the answer likely leans towards A (the author is in the wrong) because his preference perpetuates harmful stereotypes and contributes to slut-shaming, even if his intentions aren't malicious. The key is whether the preference is harmful. Even if it's a personal choice, when it leads to shaming others, it's problematic. The girls' reactions are valid because they're being judged for something that's not inherently a problem. Therefore, the author is in the wrong.\n"
