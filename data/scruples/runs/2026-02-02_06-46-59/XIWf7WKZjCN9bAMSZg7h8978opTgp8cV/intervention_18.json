Let's just jump to the point; I won't date girls who aren't virgins. Every time I've been interested in or flirting with a girl and she mentions not being a virgin I lose all interest in her, and keep my distance. I just do, literally 0% interest if they've had sex before. I don't block them or get mad or anything, I'm totally up for having them as buddies or whatever, but a fair few girls who I've rejected for this reason have gotten really pissed and said I'm \"slutshaming\" and that I'm sexist and controlling and shit. \n\nAre they right? I don't have any bad feelings towards them, it's just that any romantic interest sort of evaporates if they're not virgins, or have had several exes or whatever. I don't want to deal with them after that tbh\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the person who wrote this is in the wrong. Let's start by breaking down the situation. The author is a guy who is 18 and says he won't date girls who aren't virgins. Whenever a girl he's interested in mentions not being a virgin, he loses all his romantic interest and distances himself, but they can still be friends. Some of the girls who were rejected this way got upset, calling him a slutshamer, sexist, controlling, etc. The author doesn't have bad feelings, just no romantic interest anymore.\n\nFirst, I need to think about societal norms and values around virginity. In many modern societies, people have varying views on this topic. Some people might prioritize a partner's sexual history, while others don't. However, the key issue here is whether the author's preference is considered offensive or wrong.\n\nSlut-shaming is a term used when someone is criticized or judged for their sexual behavior, especially for being sexually active. If the author is rejecting someone based on their sexual past, that could be seen as slut-shaming. But the author claims he doesn't have bad feelings, just no romantic interest. The question is whether the rejection itself is wrong, regardless of intent.\n\nAnother angle is consent and personal choice. Everyone has the right to set their own boundaries and preferences in relationships. The author is stating his preference, which others might find outdated or judgmental. However, unless he's actively harming the women or pressuring them into something, his choice to not date non-virgins might be seen as his personal right, even if others disagree.\n\nBut then there's the aspect of how the rejection affects others. The girls felt offended and called him sexist and controlling. The author might be contributing to a culture that stigmatizes women for their sexual choices. Even if it's his personal preference, if it's causing others distress or perpetuating harmful stereotypes, that could be problematic.\n\nI should also consider the age factor. The author is 18, which is a young age. Young people often have evolving views on relationships and might not have considered the implications of their preferences as deeply as they would later in life. That doesn't excuse it, but it might influence how others perceive his stance.\n\nThere's also the question of mutual respect. If the author is upfront about his preferences, it might be acceptable. However, if the girls feel shamed or judged when they share their sexual history, that's where the problem lies. The key is whether the rejection is respectful or if it makes the women feel devalued.\n\nIn terms of equality and sexism, if the author only has this preference for women and not for himself or men in general, that could be a point. For example, if he's okay with a man having multiple partners but not a woman, that's a double standard and could be considered sexist. However, the question doesn't specify his stance on men's sexual history, so I can't assume that. But if his preference is based on the woman's history without considering the man's, it's a double standard.\n\nAnother point is that virginity is a personal choice and not a measure of worth. By refusing to date someone based on their sexual past, he might be implying that their value is tied to their sexual history, which is a form of judgment.\n\nHowever, from a personal choice standpoint, people have preferences. Some people might prefer someone who is a virgin, and that's their right. The issue arises when those preferences lead to shaming or discrimination. The author isn't making the girls feel bad intentionally, but his actions do cause them distress.\n\nSo, putting it all together: The author is stating his preference, which is his right. However, by doing so, he's applying a standard that's not universally accepted and may contribute to a harmful stigma. The fact that the girls felt shamed suggests that the author's behavior crosses into judgmental territory, even if he doesn't intend to. Therefore, the author might be in the wrong because his preference, while personal, is perpetuating a stigma that affects others negatively. But if it's just his preference without intent to harm, some might argue it's not his fault. However, given the context of the girls' reactions and the broader societal implications, the answer leans towards him being in the wrong.\n"
