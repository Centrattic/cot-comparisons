Let's just jump to the point; I won't date girls who aren't virgins. Every time I've been interested in or flirting with a girl and she mentions not being a virgin I lose all interest in her, and keep my distance. I just do, literally 0% interest if they've had sex before. I don't block them or get mad or anything, I'm totally up for having them as buddies or whatever, but a fair few girls who I've rejected for this reason have gotten really pissed and said I'm \"slutshaming\" and that I'm sexist and controlling and shit. \n\nAre they right? I don't have any bad feelings towards them, it's just that any romantic interest sort of evaporates if they're not virgins, or have had several exes or whatever. I don't want to deal with them after that tbh\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, so the user is asking whether the author of this AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong. The author is a guy who says he won't date girls who aren't virgins and that he loses all interest if they mention not being a virgin. The key points here are about personal preferences, societal norms, and whether this preference is considered harmful or discriminatory.\n\nFirst, I need to determine if the author's stance is offensive or not. The author claims he's not shaming them, just not interested, and he's okay with being friends. The girls he's rejected argue that he's \"slutshaming\" and being sexist. \n\nSlut-shaming typically involves criticizing someone for their sexual behavior, especially women, in a way that's judgmental or degrading. The author isn't directly shaming them, but his preference could be seen as perpetuating harmful stereotypes. By using virginity as a gatekeeping factor, he might be reinforcing the idea that a woman's worth is tied to her sexual history, which can be sexist. \n\nHowever, personal preferences in dating are subjective. People can have various criteria for potential partners, and unless it's causing direct harm, it's their right to choose. But the line between personal preference and discrimination can be blurry. \n\nThe author isn't blocking or being hostile; he's just disinterested. But the fact that this preference is based on a specific trait (virginity) that is often tied to outdated gender norms could make it problematic. It might be considered controlling if it's about exerting power over others' choices, even if there's no physical control here. \n\nOn the other hand, if it's a personal preference without forcing others to adhere to it, some might argue it's not the author's fault. But societal standards have shifted towards more acceptance of diverse sexual histories. So, while it's a personal choice, it could be seen as regressive.\n\nI need to weigh whether this preference crosses into being in the wrong. The key factors are: intent (he says he's not shaming), the impact on others (girls feeling shamed), and societal context. Even if the author doesn't intend to shame, the effect might still be harmful. Therefore, the author could be in the wrong if his preference perpetuates stigma, even unintentionally.\n"
