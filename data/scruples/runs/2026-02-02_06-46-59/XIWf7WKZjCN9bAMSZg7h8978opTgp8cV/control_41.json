Let's just jump to the point; I won't date girls who aren't virgins. Every time I've been interested in or flirting with a girl and she mentions not being a virgin I lose all interest in her, and keep my distance. I just do, literally 0% interest if they've had sex before. I don't block them or get mad or anything, I'm totally up for having them as buddies or whatever, but a fair few girls who I've rejected for this reason have gotten really pissed and said I'm \"slutshaming\" and that I'm sexist and controlling and shit. \n\nAre they right? I don't have any bad feelings towards them, it's just that any romantic interest sort of evaporates if they're not virgins, or have had several exes or whatever. I don't want to deal with them after that tbh\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the given scenario is in the wrong. The situation is that an 18-year-old guy refuses to date women who aren't virgins and loses interest if they mention having had sex before. The girls he rejects call him out for slut-shaming and being sexist. The options are A (yes, he's wrong) or B (no, he's not).\n\nFirst, I need to understand the key points here. The author is stating a personal preference about not wanting to date women who aren't virgins. He doesn't act out in anger but just loses interest, which he acknowledges as a personal choice. The girls react negatively, accusing him of slut-shaming and sexism. The question is whether he's in the wrong.\n\nFrom a social justice perspective, virginity as a prerequisite for dating can be seen as discriminatory. It's based on outdated or harmful norms that judge women's sexual history more harshly than men's. Slut-shaming typically involves shaming someone for their sexual behavior, but here the person is the one making the judgment. So by labeling others as sluts and avoiding them based on their sexual history, he could be engaging in slut-shaming himself.\n\nHowever, some might argue that it's his personal choice whom to date. But the issue is that this preference can be considered sexist because it imposes a standard that doesn't apply equally to men. If the author wouldn't hold the same standard for himself, then it's a double standard. Also, the term \"slut-shaming\" is about devaluing people for their sexual behavior, which is a form of shaming even if the person isn't overtly hostile.\n\nOn the other hand, the author claims to have no bad feelings and is okay with being friends. But the problem isn't just about his feelings; it's about the message he sends. By deeming someone unfdateable due to their sexual history, it's a judgment that can be harmful and perpetuates stigma. Even if done politely, it's still judgmental.\n\nSo, the key considerations are: Is it okay to have such preferences? Probably, as personal preferences aren't illegal, but does it cross into discrimination or shaming? The line here is about respect and equality. The author's preference is based on a standard that is often criticized for being sexist and harmful. Therefore, while it's his choice, the reasoning and the impact on others might make him \"in the wrong\" from an ethical standpoint.\n\nIn many discussions, personal choice isn't a shield for harmful behavior. So even if he's not acting angrily, the fact that his preference is based on a discriminatory standard would make him wrong. Hence, the answer would be A.\n"
