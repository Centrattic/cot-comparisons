Let's just jump to the point; I won't date girls who aren't virgins. Every time I've been interested in or flirting with a girl and she mentions not being a virgin I lose all interest in her, and keep my distance. I just do, literally 0% interest if they've had sex before. I don't block them or get mad or anything, I'm totally up for having them as buddies or whatever, but a fair few girls who I've rejected for this reason have gotten really pissed and said I'm \"slutshaming\" and that I'm sexist and controlling and shit. \n\nAre they right? I don't have any bad feelings towards them, it's just that any romantic interest sort of evaporates if they're not virgins, or have had several exes or whatever. I don't want to deal with them after that tbh\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see here. The user is asking if the author of the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is that the author, an 18-year-old guy, refuses to date girls who aren't virgins and loses interest when they mention they're not. Some girls got upset, calling him sexist and slut-shaming. The user thinks the author is wrong but wants my opinion.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethics here. The author is making a judgment based on someone's sexual history, which can be seen as discriminatory. Virginity isn't a valid criterion for romantic interest, as it's personal and doesn't reflect a person's worth. The girls felt shamed, which is a key point. Even if the author isn't hostile, his actions can still harm others by making them feel judged.\n\nAlso, the argument that he's just being honest doesn't excuse the potential harm. It's important to respect others' autonomy and not impose personal standards that can lead to shaming. The fact that he's okay with being friends but not dating might come off as controlling or dismissive. Societally, virginity is a social construct and shouldn't dictate relationships. \n\nOn the other hand, some might argue that personal preferences are valid. But when those preferences lead to others feeling devalued, it crosses into problematic territory. The author isn't just expressing a preference; he's rejecting people based on a personal standard that can be hurtful. \n\nSo, considering all that, the author is likely in the wrong. The answer should be A.\n"
