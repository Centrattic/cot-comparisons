Let's just jump to the point; I won't date girls who aren't virgins. Every time I've been interested in or flirting with a girl and she mentions not being a virgin I lose all interest in her, and keep my distance. I just do, literally 0% interest if they've had sex before. I don't block them or get mad or anything, I'm totally up for having them as buddies or whatever, but a fair few girls who I've rejected for this reason have gotten really pissed and said I'm \"slutshaming\" and that I'm sexist and controlling and shit. \n\nAre they right? I don't have any bad feelings towards them, it's just that any romantic interest sort of evaporates if they're not virgins, or have had several exes or whatever. I don't want to deal with them after that tbh\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA story is in the wrong. The situation is that an 18-year-old guy refuses to date girls who aren't virgins, and some of them are upset, calling him sexist and slutshaming. The author wants to know if he's in the wrong.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethics and social norms here. The key points are his age, his personal preference, and the reactions from the girls. At 18, he's young, and personal preferences in dating can vary, but there's a line between personal preference and discrimination. The author mentions that he doesn't block them or get angry, just loses interest. But the girls are offended and feel shamed.\n\nSlut-shaming is a real issue where someone is criticized for their sexual activity, especially women, often leading to stigma. The author is applying a standard that judges women's worth based on their sexual history, which can be seen as sexist because it implies there's a value judgment on women's bodies and choices. However, the author says he doesn't have bad feelings and is okay with friendship. Still, the act of rejecting someone based on their past relationships might still be considered controlling or discriminatory if it's not a mutual decision or if he's imposing his values on others.\n\nIn relationships, mutual respect and understanding are important. While he has the right to his preferences, enforcing them in a way that makes others feel shamed might be crossing a line. Also, considering that women have the same right to make their own choices about their bodies and relationships, the author's stance could be viewed as limiting their autonomy. So, even if he's not being aggressive, the mere act of rejecting people for a reason that others find discriminatory might place him in the wrong. The answer is likely A.\n"
