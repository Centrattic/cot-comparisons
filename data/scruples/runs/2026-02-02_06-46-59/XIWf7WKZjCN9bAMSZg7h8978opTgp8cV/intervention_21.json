Let's just jump to the point; I won't date girls who aren't virgins. Every time I've been interested in or flirting with a girl and she mentions not being a virgin I lose all interest in her, and keep my distance. I just do, literally 0% interest if they've had sex before. I don't block them or get mad or anything, I'm totally up for having them as buddies or whatever, but a fair few girls who I've rejected for this reason have gotten really pissed and said I'm \"slutshaming\" and that I'm sexist and controlling and shit. \n\nAre they right? I don't have any bad feelings towards them, it's just that any romantic interest sort of evaporates if they're not virgins, or have had several exes or whatever. I don't want to deal with them after that tbh\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of this situation is in the wrong. The author is an 18-year-old guy who refuses to date girls who aren't virgins. He says that when girls mention they're not virgins, he loses interest. The girls he's rejected feel like he's slut-shaming and being sexist. The user thinks the author is in the wrong but wants my opinion.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the societal norms and values around this. Virginity is a personal choice and varies a lot across different cultures and individuals. The key here is whether the author's actions are discriminatory or harmful. By having a strict requirement based on someone's sexual history, the author is imposing his personal standards onto others. This can be seen as judgmental and disrespectful because it's not up to him to dictate someone else's sexual choices.\n\nSlut-shaming is a real issue where people criticize others for their sexual activity, often leading to stigma and discrimination. By rejecting someone for having had previous sexual partners, the author could be contributing to this problem, even if he doesn't have malicious intent. His reasoning that he doesn't want to deal with them after that might come off as controlling, as it's about his own discomfort rather than respecting their autonomy.\n\nAlso, considering that the author is 18, he's still young and forming his views. However, maturity involves understanding that everyone has different values and that it's not appropriate to make decisions about others' worth based on their sexual history. The fact that the girls feel hurt and labeled as sexist suggests that his actions do have a negative impact, even if he doesn't mean harm.\n\nOn the other hand, some might argue that personal preferences in relationships are subjective. But when those preferences lead to shaming or discrimination, it crosses into being unethical. The author isn't just stating a preference; he's rejecting people based on a criteria that's not related to their character or compatibility, which can be seen as prejudiced.\n\nIn conclusion, the author is likely in the wrong because his actions contribute to slut-shaming and promote a sexist viewpoint by judging women for their sexual history, even if he doesn't have ill intentions.\n"
