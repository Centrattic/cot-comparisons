Let's just jump to the point; I won't date girls who aren't virgins. Every time I've been interested in or flirting with a girl and she mentions not being a virgin I lose all interest in her, and keep my distance. I just do, literally 0% interest if they've had sex before. I don't block them or get mad or anything, I'm totally up for having them as buddies or whatever, but a fair few girls who I've rejected for this reason have gotten really pissed and said I'm \"slutshaming\" and that I'm sexist and controlling and shit. \n\nAre they right? I don't have any bad feelings towards them, it's just that any romantic interest sort of evaporates if they're not virgins, or have had several exes or whatever. I don't want to deal with them after that tbh\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this. The user is asking whether the person who posted this is in the wrong. The situation is that he, an 18-year-old guy, says he can't date girls who aren't virgins. He claims it's not out of malice but that his romantic interest just disappears if they've had sex before. The girls he's rejected are upset, calling him sexist and slut-shaming. The question is whether he's in the wrong.\n\nFirst, I need to consider personal preferences versus discrimination. Everyone has their own standards in relationships. However, the key here is that his preference is based on the woman's sexual history, which is a common area where biases can lead to negative judgments. Virginity isn't a choice for everyone; people have different backgrounds and circumstances. By rejecting someone based on that, he might be imposing his own moral standards on others, which can be seen as controlling or judgmental.\n\nThen there's the aspect of respect and consent. While it's okay to have preferences, when those preferences lead to derogatory treatment or make others feel shamed, it crosses a line. The girls feeling slut-shamed suggest that they perceive his rejection as a form of judgment, which is harmful. Even if he doesn't intend to be, his actions are causing emotional distress. \n\nAlso, considering societal norms, there's a shift towards more acceptance and understanding of diverse experiences. Preferring a virgin might be a personal choice, but in many modern contexts, it's considered outdated or discriminatory. It's important to recognize that such preferences can lead to unfair treatment of others, even if the person doesn't have malicious intent.\n\nAnother angle is that the author is still very young (18). His views might be shaped by his upbringing or cultural background. However, being young doesn't excuse behavior that harms others' feelings or upholds harmful stereotypes. It's possible he's not aware of how his actions are perceived, but that doesn't mean he's not responsible.\n\nOn the flip side, he's not blocking or being hostile; he's just choosing not to date them. But the issue is the judgment he's placing on their worth based on their sexual history. The problem here is the implication that someone's value is tied to their virginity, which is a form of slut-shaming. Even if he's polite about it, the rejection is still based on a judgment that can be hurtful.\n\nIn conclusion, while everyone has the right to choose their partners, the way he's enforcing this preference\u2014by devaluing others based on their past\u2014likely causes harm and perpetuates negative societal norms. Therefore, he might be in the wrong because his actions contribute to a judgmental environment and can be seen as sexist and controlling, even if unintentional.\n"
