He has been vegan since birth. My nephew and son attend the same school so I pick them up from school everyday. My nephew has snacks + dinner at my house every weekday before his mom comes to pick him up. \n\nI usually make a dish for my family and a separate vegan dish for my nephew. A couple of months ago I left them with their homework and snacks and went to do some chores, came back and found nephew &amp; son sharing chicken nuggets. I provided him with vegan snacks but he still ate the chicken nuggets. I told him those weren't vegan and he told me he that he eats meat in school sometimes. His friends share their meals with him sometimes. I thought about telling my sister but decided not to. \n\nSo basically I continue to give him vegan options but don't say anything if he chooses the non vegan option. Usually he goes for the non vegan one. Maybe because because he never gets to at home. I know my sister would freak out if she knows he's eating meat. She's staunchly vegan and eating animal products goes against her ethical beliefs which I completely understand and respect. My husband thinks IATA for not telling her and being dishonest, but I think nephew is old enough to make his own dietary choices (he's 10 this year). \n\nSo, AITA? Should I tell my sister what's going on?  \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong. The situation involves a vegan sister raising her son vegan, and the author, an aunt, sometimes gives the nephew meat but doesn't tell the sister.\n\nFirst, the sister's values are important here. She's been vegan for years and is strict about it, so she's probably made her stance clear. The nephew is 10, so maybe he's starting to explore his own choices, but he's still a child. The author is providing both vegan and non-vegan options, but the nephew often chooses the meat. \n\nThe key question is whether the author is in the wrong for not informing the sister. The sister might believe the child is strictly vegan, and the author is allowing the child to eat meat without her knowledge. This could be seen as going against the sister's wishes. However, the nephew is making his own choices, and the author isn't forcing him to eat the meat. \n\nOn one hand, the author is respecting the child's autonomy, allowing him to make decisions, which could be seen as positive. On the other hand, the sister might feel betrayed if she finds out, especially if she's unaware that her son is eating meat. The author's husband thinks she's in the wrong for being dishonest, which adds another layer. \n\nBut is the author being dishonest? She's not lying, just not informing. The sister might have a right to know, as she's the parent. However, the author might feel that the child should have some freedom. The ethical dilemma here is between respecting the parent's wishes and allowing the child's autonomy. \n\nIn similar situations, like medical treatments or religious practices, parents' wishes are usually followed unless there's a risk of harm. Since the nephew isn't in immediate danger from eating meat, the question is more about ethical beliefs. The author isn't harming the child, but she's not adhering to the sister's parenting choices. \n\nSo, considering the sister's strict veganism and the potential for the sister to feel misled, the author might be in the wrong by not disclosing. Even if the nephew is making choices, the parent's expectations are not being respected. Therefore, the answer would be A.\n"
