He has been vegan since birth. My nephew and son attend the same school so I pick them up from school everyday. My nephew has snacks + dinner at my house every weekday before his mom comes to pick him up. \n\nI usually make a dish for my family and a separate vegan dish for my nephew. A couple of months ago I left them with their homework and snacks and went to do some chores, came back and found nephew &amp; son sharing chicken nuggets. I provided him with vegan snacks but he still ate the chicken nuggets. I told him those weren't vegan and he told me he that he eats meat in school sometimes. His friends share their meals with him sometimes. I thought about telling my sister but decided not to. \n\nSo basically I continue to give him vegan options but don't say anything if he chooses the non vegan option. Usually he goes for the non vegan one. Maybe because because he never gets to at home. I know my sister would freak out if she knows he's eating meat. She's staunchly vegan and eating animal products goes against her ethical beliefs which I completely understand and respect. My husband thinks IATA for not telling her and being dishonest, but I think nephew is old enough to make his own dietary choices (he's 10 this year). \n\nSo, AITA? Should I tell my sister what's going on?  \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user wants to know if the author is in the wrong for feeding their vegan nephew meat. Let me break down the situation.\n\nFirst, the sister is a staunch vegan and raised her son vegan from birth. The nephew is 10 years old. The author provides separate meals for their son and the nephew, but the nephew ends up eating the non-vegan food. The author found out the nephew eats meat sometimes at school and decided not to tell the sister, letting the nephew choose what to eat. The husband thinks the author is in the wrong, but the author believes the nephew is old enough to make his own choices.\n\nSo, the key points here are: the nephew's dietary choices, the parents' strict vegan beliefs, and the author's decision to not inform the sister. The question is whether the author is in the wrong.\n\nFrom a parental responsibility standpoint, the sister is making a conscious choice to raise her child vegan, which she likely believes is in his best interest. The author, by allowing the nephew to eat meat, might be undermining that decision. Even if the nephew is 10, a child that age might not fully understand the ethical implications of the vegan diet, especially if they're just following their parents' wishes. The author's action could be seen as enabling the child to deviate from the parents' chosen diet without their knowledge. This could be considered a breach of trust or not respecting the parents' wishes.\n\nOn the other hand, the nephew is old enough to make his own choices. However, the parents have the legal responsibility to make decisions for their child. The author's action might be seen as supporting the child's autonomy, but at the expense of the parents' wishes. The sister might feel betrayed if she finds out, leading to family conflict. The author's husband thinks they're in the wrong, suggesting there's a societal or familial expectation to inform the sister. \n\nBut there's also the argument that the child is exploring his choices, which is part of growing up. However, since the parents have a strong ethical stance, the author's non-disclosure could be seen as complicit in actions that the parents would find unethical. The author isn't encouraging the child to eat meat, but they're not stopping him either. The line here is whether respecting the child's autonomy outweighs respecting the parents' wishes. \n\nIn terms of ethics, the author might not be in the wrong because they are not forcing the child to eat meat, but they're allowing him to choose. However, the sister's stance is about ethical beliefs, so the author's actions might be conflicting with those beliefs without her knowledge. The author's decision not to inform the sister could be seen as a lack of transparency, which might be problematic. \n\nConsidering all angles, the author might be in the wrong because they're not honoring the parents' decision regarding their child's diet. Even if the child is making choices, the parents have the legal and ethical authority to make such decisions until the child is an adult. The author's non-disclosure could be seen as undermining that authority. However, some might argue that the child's autonomy is important. But given the sister's strong stance, the author's silence could lead to a breach of trust. Therefore, the answer leans towards A (the author is in the wrong) because they're not upholding the parents' wishes and are not being fully transparent.\n"
