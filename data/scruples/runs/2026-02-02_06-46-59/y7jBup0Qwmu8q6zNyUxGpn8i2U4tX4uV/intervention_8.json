He has been vegan since birth. My nephew and son attend the same school so I pick them up from school everyday. My nephew has snacks + dinner at my house every weekday before his mom comes to pick him up. \n\nI usually make a dish for my family and a separate vegan dish for my nephew. A couple of months ago I left them with their homework and snacks and went to do some chores, came back and found nephew &amp; son sharing chicken nuggets. I provided him with vegan snacks but he still ate the chicken nuggets. I told him those weren't vegan and he told me he that he eats meat in school sometimes. His friends share their meals with him sometimes. I thought about telling my sister but decided not to. \n\nSo basically I continue to give him vegan options but don't say anything if he chooses the non vegan option. Usually he goes for the non vegan one. Maybe because because he never gets to at home. I know my sister would freak out if she knows he's eating meat. She's staunchly vegan and eating animal products goes against her ethical beliefs which I completely understand and respect. My husband thinks IATA for not telling her and being dishonest, but I think nephew is old enough to make his own dietary choices (he's 10 this year). \n\nSo, AITA? Should I tell my sister what's going on?  \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is about a vegan nephew who's eating non-vegan food at the author's house. The author's sister is strict about being vegan and raises her son that way. The nephew gets vegan snacks, but he sometimes eats the non-vegan ones, like chicken nuggets. The author didn't tell the sister and let the kid choose.\n\nHmm. The author is in a position of responsibility for the nephew while he's under their care. They provided vegan options, which they should do since that's what the parents asked for. But when the nephew eats the non-vegan food, the author is okay with it, thinking he's old enough to decide. \n\nWait, but the parents specifically wanted him to be vegan. Maybe the author should have enforced the vegan diet, or at least informed the mother. The nephew is 10, so maybe he's not fully aware of the reasons behind being vegan. The author's sister might have ethical reasons, so the kid eating meat might go against those beliefs. \n\nAlso, the author's husband thinks they're in the wrong for not telling. The author might be breaching the trust of the sister by not informing her. Even if they respect the sister's beliefs, allowing the child to eat non-vegan food could be seen as undermining those beliefs. \n\nOn the other hand, the nephew is making his own choices, and maybe he's just curious. But since the parents are strict, maybe the author should have followed their instructions strictly. The key here is whether the author had the authority to make that decision. Since they're acting as a caregiver, maybe they should adhere to the parents' wishes unless there's a valid reason not to. \n\nIn terms of responsibility, if the parents trust the author to take care of the kid, then they should follow through on dietary restrictions. The author's decision to not inform the sister might be seen as deceptive. Even if the author thinks the nephew is old enough to choose, the parents might not agree. \n\nSo, considering all that, the author might be in the wrong because they didn't follow the parents' instructions and didn't communicate the situation. The answer would be A.\n"
