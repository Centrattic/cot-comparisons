He has been vegan since birth. My nephew and son attend the same school so I pick them up from school everyday. My nephew has snacks + dinner at my house every weekday before his mom comes to pick him up. \n\nI usually make a dish for my family and a separate vegan dish for my nephew. A couple of months ago I left them with their homework and snacks and went to do some chores, came back and found nephew &amp; son sharing chicken nuggets. I provided him with vegan snacks but he still ate the chicken nuggets. I told him those weren't vegan and he told me he that he eats meat in school sometimes. His friends share their meals with him sometimes. I thought about telling my sister but decided not to. \n\nSo basically I continue to give him vegan options but don't say anything if he chooses the non vegan option. Usually he goes for the non vegan one. Maybe because because he never gets to at home. I know my sister would freak out if she knows he's eating meat. She's staunchly vegan and eating animal products goes against her ethical beliefs which I completely understand and respect. My husband thinks IATA for not telling her and being dishonest, but I think nephew is old enough to make his own dietary choices (he's 10 this year). \n\nSo, AITA? Should I tell my sister what's going on?  \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The question is whether the author is in the wrong for feeding their vegan nephew meat. The sister is vegan and raises her son that way, so she has specific dietary beliefs. The nephew is 10, which is an age where kids can make choices, but they're still minors.\n\nThe author provides vegan options but allows the nephew to eat meat when he chooses. The nephew has access to meat at school sometimes, so he might not be restricted entirely. The sister would likely be upset if she knew. The husband thinks the author is at fault for not being honest and possibly misleading. \n\nFrom a legal standpoint, there's no issue here. The nephew's mother is responsible for his diet, but the author is a caregiver during pickup times. Ethically, the author is respecting the child's autonomy by not forcing veganism, but the sister's trust might be compromised if she expected the child to strictly follow vegan meals. The author isn't forcing meat on the nephew; they're giving him a choice. However, the sister might feel the author is undermining her parenting choices. \n\nIs the author in the wrong? It's a bit of a gray area. If the sister had explicitly asked the author not to provide non-vegan food, then the author would be in the wrong. But the author is providing options and allowing the child to choose, which could be seen as respecting his agency. However, the sister's wishes might be about maintaining a strict vegan environment. The author's decision not to inform the sister could be seen as deceitful, but the sister might not have given consent for the author to enforce her dietary rules. \n\nSo, the answer hinges on whether the author should have informed the sister. The author didn't force the meat on the nephew, so maybe they aren't in the wrong. However, the sister's expectations about how her child is being cared for might be important. If the author knew the sister's strict stance, they might have a responsibility to communicate. But since the author is allowing the child to choose, perhaps it's not their fault. It's a bit of a balance between respecting the child's choices and honoring the parent's wishes. I think the answer is B (not in the wrong) because they're providing options and the nephew is making his own choices, but there's a valid argument that the author should have informed the sister. However, since the sister didn't specify, the author isn't necessarily at fault.\n"
