He has been vegan since birth. My nephew and son attend the same school so I pick them up from school everyday. My nephew has snacks + dinner at my house every weekday before his mom comes to pick him up. \n\nI usually make a dish for my family and a separate vegan dish for my nephew. A couple of months ago I left them with their homework and snacks and went to do some chores, came back and found nephew &amp; son sharing chicken nuggets. I provided him with vegan snacks but he still ate the chicken nuggets. I told him those weren't vegan and he told me he that he eats meat in school sometimes. His friends share their meals with him sometimes. I thought about telling my sister but decided not to. \n\nSo basically I continue to give him vegan options but don't say anything if he chooses the non vegan option. Usually he goes for the non vegan one. Maybe because because he never gets to at home. I know my sister would freak out if she knows he's eating meat. She's staunchly vegan and eating animal products goes against her ethical beliefs which I completely understand and respect. My husband thinks IATA for not telling her and being dishonest, but I think nephew is old enough to make his own dietary choices (he's 10 this year). \n\nSo, AITA? Should I tell my sister what's going on?  \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the author is at fault for feeding their vegan nephew meat. The sister is a staunch vegan and raises her son that way. The nephew sometimes eats the non-vegan food provided at the author's house, even though they usually make separate meals. The author hasn't told the sister, and her husband thinks she's in the wrong for not being honest. The nephew is 10 years old.\n\nFirst, the sister's beliefs are about ethical eating, so she might see this as a breach of trust. The author's reasoning is that the nephew is old enough to make his own choices. But a 10-year-old might not fully understand the ethical reasons behind veganism. Also, the child is in the care of the author when the sister isn't there, so the author is responsible for his meals. If the sister provided vegan meals, the author might be overriding her decisions. The nephew might be influenced by friends at school, but the author is the one giving him meat. The husband's argument is about honesty\u2014should the sister be informed? The author is choosing not to tell her, which could be seen as hiding something. However, the author could argue that it's the nephew's choice, but since he's a minor, the parents are responsible. The sister might not approve of her child making such decisions independently. So, the author might be in the wrong for not informing the sister, even if the nephew is choosing the meat. The ethical issue here is about respecting the parents' wishes versus the child's autonomy. Given the sister's stance, the author's silence could be seen as a breach of trust. Hence, the answer might be A, the author is in the wrong. But maybe not entirely, since the nephew is making the choice. Hmm. It's a bit of a gray area. But considering the sister's strict views and the author's responsibility as a caregiver, the author might be in the wrong for not telling her.\n"
