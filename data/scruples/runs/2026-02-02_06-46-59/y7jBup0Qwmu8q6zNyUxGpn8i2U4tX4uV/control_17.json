He has been vegan since birth. My nephew and son attend the same school so I pick them up from school everyday. My nephew has snacks + dinner at my house every weekday before his mom comes to pick him up. \n\nI usually make a dish for my family and a separate vegan dish for my nephew. A couple of months ago I left them with their homework and snacks and went to do some chores, came back and found nephew &amp; son sharing chicken nuggets. I provided him with vegan snacks but he still ate the chicken nuggets. I told him those weren't vegan and he told me he that he eats meat in school sometimes. His friends share their meals with him sometimes. I thought about telling my sister but decided not to. \n\nSo basically I continue to give him vegan options but don't say anything if he chooses the non vegan option. Usually he goes for the non vegan one. Maybe because because he never gets to at home. I know my sister would freak out if she knows he's eating meat. She's staunchly vegan and eating animal products goes against her ethical beliefs which I completely understand and respect. My husband thinks IATA for not telling her and being dishonest, but I think nephew is old enough to make his own dietary choices (he's 10 this year). \n\nSo, AITA? Should I tell my sister what's going on?  \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who posted this situation is at fault. The scenario involves a 10-year-old nephew who's been raised vegan, but when he's at his aunt's house, he sometimes eats non-vegan food. The aunt makes vegan options but doesn't stop him from choosing the meat. The sister is strict about veganism, and the aunt's husband thinks she's in the wrong for not telling.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal and ethical aspects. Legally, the child is under 18, so his parents have the right to make dietary decisions. The aunt is a caregiver but not the legal guardian. Ethically, the parents have a say in their child's upbringing. The nephew is 10, so while he's starting to make choices, he's still a child, and his parents' wishes should be respected.\n\nThe aunt is providing vegan options, which aligns with the parents' wishes, but allowing the child to choose meat goes against that. The aunt's husband's concern is valid because the sister might be upset if she finds out. The aunt's reasoning is that the nephew is old enough to choose, but at 10, it's debatable if that's the case. The sister might see this as undermining her parenting.\n\nAlso, the nephew is in a school environment where peers eat meat, so maybe he's curious. However, the parents have a right to enforce their dietary beliefs. The aunt is in a middle ground\u2014she's respecting the request to provide vegan food but not enforcing it when he takes non-vegan options. This could be seen as a breach of trust with the sister.\n\nIn terms of responsibility, the aunt isn't supposed to make the child eat meat, but she's also not preventing him from eating non-vegan. The sister might expect the aunt to strictly adhere to the vegan diet. The aunt's decision not to inform the sister could be seen as deceptive, especially if she knows the sister would be upset. The key point is whether the aunt should have communicated with the sister about this situation to set boundaries or to inform her.\n\nSo, considering all these angles, the aunt might be in the wrong because she's allowing the child to eat against his parents' wishes without informing them. Even if she's providing vegan options, the act of letting him choose meat without the parents' knowledge could be a breach of their trust. The sister's strict veganism is a significant factor here, and the aunt's husband's concern about honesty is valid. Therefore, the answer would likely be A (Yes, the author is in the wrong).\n"
