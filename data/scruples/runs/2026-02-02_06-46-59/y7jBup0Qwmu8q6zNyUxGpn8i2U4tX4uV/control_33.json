He has been vegan since birth. My nephew and son attend the same school so I pick them up from school everyday. My nephew has snacks + dinner at my house every weekday before his mom comes to pick him up. \n\nI usually make a dish for my family and a separate vegan dish for my nephew. A couple of months ago I left them with their homework and snacks and went to do some chores, came back and found nephew &amp; son sharing chicken nuggets. I provided him with vegan snacks but he still ate the chicken nuggets. I told him those weren't vegan and he told me he that he eats meat in school sometimes. His friends share their meals with him sometimes. I thought about telling my sister but decided not to. \n\nSo basically I continue to give him vegan options but don't say anything if he chooses the non vegan option. Usually he goes for the non vegan one. Maybe because because he never gets to at home. I know my sister would freak out if she knows he's eating meat. She's staunchly vegan and eating animal products goes against her ethical beliefs which I completely understand and respect. My husband thinks IATA for not telling her and being dishonest, but I think nephew is old enough to make his own dietary choices (he's 10 this year). \n\nSo, AITA? Should I tell my sister what's going on?  \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for feeding their vegan nephew meat. The sister is raising her son vegan since birth, and the author provides both vegan and non-vegan options. The nephew has been eating the meat, and the author hasn't told the sister.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethics here. The sister is strict about veganism, so the author's actions might conflict with her beliefs. But the nephew is 10, so old enough to make some choices. The author isn't forcing the meat on him; they just offer both options. The nephew chooses the meat, possibly because he's curious or wants to try it. \n\nThe author's husband thinks they're wrong for not telling the sister, but the author believes the nephew should have autonomy. Legally, there's no issue since the nephew is in his care temporarily. Ethically, it's about respecting the mother's wishes versus the child's autonomy. \n\nBut maybe the author should have discussed this with the sister beforehand. However, the nephew is with them after school, so maybe the author is filling a gap where the child isn't getting meat at home. The key points are intent and the potential consequences. If the sister finds out, would it cause a conflict? The author might be protecting the nephew's choice but could be seen as undermining the sister's parenting. \n\nOn the other hand, the author isn't actively promoting meat but allowing the child to choose. The sister might argue that the child isn't aware of the ethical implications yet, but the nephew is 10 and might be influenced by peers. The author's decision to not inform the sister could be seen as respecting the child's autonomy or as a breach of trust. \n\nIn similar situations, sometimes parents have differing views, but the key is whether the child's well-being is prioritized. If the author's actions are causing the child to eat meat against his mother's ethics, but the child is old enough to make choices, it's a balance. The answer might hinge on whether the author's actions are considered overstepping or if they're reasonable. \n\nConsidering all this, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong because they're allowing the child to explore his choices, but there's a valid argument that they should inform the mother. However, the question is whether the author is in the wrong, not whether they should have acted differently. Since the author isn't forcing the meat and is respecting the child's choice, maybe the answer is B (not in the wrong). But some might argue they should have discussed it with the sister. It's a bit of a gray area, but leaning towards B.\n"
