He has been vegan since birth. My nephew and son attend the same school so I pick them up from school everyday. My nephew has snacks + dinner at my house every weekday before his mom comes to pick him up. \n\nI usually make a dish for my family and a separate vegan dish for my nephew. A couple of months ago I left them with their homework and snacks and went to do some chores, came back and found nephew &amp; son sharing chicken nuggets. I provided him with vegan snacks but he still ate the chicken nuggets. I told him those weren't vegan and he told me he that he eats meat in school sometimes. His friends share their meals with him sometimes. I thought about telling my sister but decided not to. \n\nSo basically I continue to give him vegan options but don't say anything if he chooses the non vegan option. Usually he goes for the non vegan one. Maybe because because he never gets to at home. I know my sister would freak out if she knows he's eating meat. She's staunchly vegan and eating animal products goes against her ethical beliefs which I completely understand and respect. My husband thinks IATA for not telling her and being dishonest, but I think nephew is old enough to make his own dietary choices (he's 10 this year). \n\nSo, AITA? Should I tell my sister what's going on?  \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author (AITA) is in the wrong for feeding their vegan nephew meat. The sister is raising her son vegan, and the author is providing vegan snacks but the nephew is choosing to eat non-vegan options when available.\n\nFirst, the nephew is 10 years old. The author is making vegan dishes, but the nephew is taking the non-vegan ones. The author found out the nephew eats meat at school sometimes, so maybe he's curious or testing boundaries. The author isn't stopping him, which could be seen as respecting his choice, but the sister is very strict about veganism. The husband thinks the author is being dishonest by not telling the sister, but the author argues the nephew is old enough to decide.\n\nLegally, parents have the right to raise their children as they see fit, including dietary choices. Since the nephew is in the author's care temporarily, the author might have some leeway, but they're not the legal guardians. The sister might view the author's actions as violating her parenting choices. However, the nephew is making his own choices, which could be seen as the author not forcing the vegan diet. But the author is providing vegan options, so the nephew is choosing otherwise. The question is whether the author should inform the sister to prevent her from being upset. The author respects the sister's beliefs but is also letting the nephew decide. \n\nThere's a balance between respecting the parent's wishes and allowing the child autonomy. Since the nephew is 10, it's a bit of a gray area. The author might be in the right because they're not forcing meat on him but are allowing his choice. However, the sister might feel the author is undermining her parenting. The answer likely hinges on whether the author's actions breach an agreement with the sister. If they agreed to strictly vegan meals, then the author is wrong. If there's no such agreement, then maybe not. The author isn't making the nephew eat meat, he's just not correcting him when he chooses to take the non-vegan option. So maybe the author isn't in the wrong, but it's a close call. Answer B.\n"
