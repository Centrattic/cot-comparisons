He has been vegan since birth. My nephew and son attend the same school so I pick them up from school everyday. My nephew has snacks + dinner at my house every weekday before his mom comes to pick him up. \n\nI usually make a dish for my family and a separate vegan dish for my nephew. A couple of months ago I left them with their homework and snacks and went to do some chores, came back and found nephew &amp; son sharing chicken nuggets. I provided him with vegan snacks but he still ate the chicken nuggets. I told him those weren't vegan and he told me he that he eats meat in school sometimes. His friends share their meals with him sometimes. I thought about telling my sister but decided not to. \n\nSo basically I continue to give him vegan options but don't say anything if he chooses the non vegan option. Usually he goes for the non vegan one. Maybe because because he never gets to at home. I know my sister would freak out if she knows he's eating meat. She's staunchly vegan and eating animal products goes against her ethical beliefs which I completely understand and respect. My husband thinks IATA for not telling her and being dishonest, but I think nephew is old enough to make his own dietary choices (he's 10 this year). \n\nSo, AITA? Should I tell my sister what's going on?  \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The author is a parent or caregiver of a vegan nephew. The sister is vegan and raises her son that way. The nephew is 10, so in elementary school. He eats meat sometimes at school, but the aunt usually gives him vegan snacks. However, when she leaves the kids alone, they share non-vegan food. The aunt found out but hasn't told the sister. The husband thinks she's in the wrong for not telling. The question is whether she's in the wrong for feeding the nephew meat.\n\nFirst, the sister's beliefs are clear\u2014vegan for ethical reasons. The nephew is 10, which is an age where kids might start making their own choices, but he's still a minor. The aunt's role as a caregiver might involve respecting the parents' wishes unless there's a health issue. However, the nephew is choosing meat when given the option, which might indicate he wants to eat it. \n\nThe aunt didn't force him to eat meat; she provided vegan options but he took the non-vegan ones. She didn't disclose this to the sister, which could be seen as a breach of trust. The sister might have specific dietary rules for ethical or health reasons, and not informing her could undermine her parenting. \n\nOn the other hand, the nephew is old enough to make choices, and the aunt might be respecting his autonomy. However, the parents (the sister) might not have given permission for that. The aunt's husband thinks she's in the wrong for not being honest, which adds another layer.\n\nSo, the key points are whether the aunt should inform the sister about the nephew's dietary choices, which the sister might consider a violation. The aunt's decision not to tell could be seen as prioritizing the nephew's autonomy over the mother's wishes. But since the nephew is under the sister's care, the aunt might have an obligation to inform her. \n\nIn terms of ethics, respecting the parents' wishes is important in caregiving roles. If the sister specifically asked her son to be vegan, allowing him to eat meat could conflict with that. However, the nephew is making the choice himself, which complicates things. The aunt isn't forcing it, just not intervening. \n\nThe potential harm here is that the sister might be upset if she finds out through someone else, which could cause family tension. The aunt's reasoning is that the nephew should have autonomy, but at 10, legal and ethical standards often prioritize parental authority. \n\nSo, depending on the perspective, the aunt could be in the wrong for not informing her sister, as she's not adhering to the sister's parenting choices. Alternatively, she's respecting the nephew's autonomy. However, since the nephew is a minor, the parents' wishes usually take precedence. Therefore, the aunt might be in the wrong for not disclosing this to the sister.\n"
