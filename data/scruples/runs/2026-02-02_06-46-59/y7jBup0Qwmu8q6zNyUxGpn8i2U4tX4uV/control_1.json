He has been vegan since birth. My nephew and son attend the same school so I pick them up from school everyday. My nephew has snacks + dinner at my house every weekday before his mom comes to pick him up. \n\nI usually make a dish for my family and a separate vegan dish for my nephew. A couple of months ago I left them with their homework and snacks and went to do some chores, came back and found nephew &amp; son sharing chicken nuggets. I provided him with vegan snacks but he still ate the chicken nuggets. I told him those weren't vegan and he told me he that he eats meat in school sometimes. His friends share their meals with him sometimes. I thought about telling my sister but decided not to. \n\nSo basically I continue to give him vegan options but don't say anything if he chooses the non vegan option. Usually he goes for the non vegan one. Maybe because because he never gets to at home. I know my sister would freak out if she knows he's eating meat. She's staunchly vegan and eating animal products goes against her ethical beliefs which I completely understand and respect. My husband thinks IATA for not telling her and being dishonest, but I think nephew is old enough to make his own dietary choices (he's 10 this year). \n\nSo, AITA? Should I tell my sister what's going on?  \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for feeding their vegan nephew meat. The sister raised him vegan, but the nephew sometimes eats non-vegan food given by friends. The author provides both vegan and non-vegan options and lets the nephew choose. The sister is strict about veganism, and the husband thinks the author should have told her. The nephew is 10, so the author thinks he can make his own choices.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical aspects. The sister's wishes vs. the nephew's autonomy. The author is respecting the nephew's choice, but the sister might see this as undermining her parenting. But the nephew is old enough to make choices, so maybe the author isn't wrong. Also, the sister might react strongly, but the author isn't forcing the meat on him. They offer vegan options and let him choose. The key points are respecting the child's autonomy and the parent's wishes. \n\nIs the author being dishonest by not telling the sister? The author isn't lying but withholding information. The sister might not agree, but the author isn't forcing the meat. The nephew is making his own choices. Maybe the answer is B, the author isn't in the wrong. They are allowing the child some autonomy, which is reasonable for a 10-year-old. The sister's strictness is her choice, but the author isn't forcing the meat. So B seems correct.\n"
