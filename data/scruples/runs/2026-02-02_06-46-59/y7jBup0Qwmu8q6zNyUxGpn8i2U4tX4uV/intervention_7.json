He has been vegan since birth. My nephew and son attend the same school so I pick them up from school everyday. My nephew has snacks + dinner at my house every weekday before his mom comes to pick him up. \n\nI usually make a dish for my family and a separate vegan dish for my nephew. A couple of months ago I left them with their homework and snacks and went to do some chores, came back and found nephew &amp; son sharing chicken nuggets. I provided him with vegan snacks but he still ate the chicken nuggets. I told him those weren't vegan and he told me he that he eats meat in school sometimes. His friends share their meals with him sometimes. I thought about telling my sister but decided not to. \n\nSo basically I continue to give him vegan options but don't say anything if he chooses the non vegan option. Usually he goes for the non vegan one. Maybe because because he never gets to at home. I know my sister would freak out if she knows he's eating meat. She's staunchly vegan and eating animal products goes against her ethical beliefs which I completely understand and respect. My husband thinks IATA for not telling her and being dishonest, but I think nephew is old enough to make his own dietary choices (he's 10 this year). \n\nSo, AITA? Should I tell my sister what's going on?  \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of the \"AITA\" post is in the wrong. The situation is about the author feeding their vegan nephew meat, even though the nephew's mom is vegan and they raised him that way. The author provides vegan options but sometimes the nephew eats the non-vegan food, and the author hasn't told the sister.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical aspects here. The sister is strict about veganism, and the nephew is 10 years old. The author is in a position of trust, so feeding the child non-vegan food might go against the mother's wishes. But the nephew is old enough to make his own choices, right? Maybe the author is allowing the child to decide what to eat when it's possible he's not getting that choice at home.\n\nOn one hand, the author is respecting the child's autonomy by not forcing vegan food and allowing him to choose. On the other hand, the mother might feel that the author is undermining her parenting by not adhering to her dietary rules. The husband thinks the author is being dishonest, which adds another layer. The key points are: the mother's values vs. the child's autonomy, and whether the author has a duty to inform the mother.\n\nThe user thinks the author is in the wrong, but I need to weigh both sides. If the author is aware that the mother would be upset, maybe they should have discussed it. However, the nephew is making the choice to eat the meat, so it's not directly the author's fault unless they are actively encouraging it. The author is providing options and not preventing the nephew from eating what he wants. Still, not informing the mother could be seen as a breach of trust. The answer might depend on whether the author has an obligation to report the nephew's choices to the mother. If the nephew is old enough to make choices, maybe the author isn't responsible for enforcing the mother's rules. Alternatively, since the author is acting as a caretaker for the child while the mother isn't present, they might be expected to follow the mother's guidelines. So, the answer could be either way. But given the mother's strictness, the author's decision not to inform her might be considered wrong. So, maybe answer A. But I'm a bit conflicted here. Let me check again. The author isn't forcing the meat on the nephew; the nephew is choosing it. The author is providing vegan options as instructed. However, if the mother wants the child to be vegan, the author might be indirectly supporting a deviation from that. The line is whether the author is responsible for the child's dietary compliance. Since the nephew is making his own choices, perhaps the author isn't at fault. But the author's husband argues they're being dishonest. Hmm. This is tricky. I think the answer could be A or B. But the user thinks A. I need to decide based on the reasoning. I think the key is whether the author has a duty to inform the mother. Since the mother raised him vegan and the child might be confused or rebellious, the author's silence could be seen as not respecting the mother's wishes. Therefore, the author is in the wrong (A). But another angle is that the child is making his own choices, so the author isn't forcing anything. Maybe B. This is a tough call. I'll go with A because the author has a duty to the mother to inform her about the child's actions, especially given the mother's strict stance. So, answer A.\n"
