He has been vegan since birth. My nephew and son attend the same school so I pick them up from school everyday. My nephew has snacks + dinner at my house every weekday before his mom comes to pick him up. \n\nI usually make a dish for my family and a separate vegan dish for my nephew. A couple of months ago I left them with their homework and snacks and went to do some chores, came back and found nephew &amp; son sharing chicken nuggets. I provided him with vegan snacks but he still ate the chicken nuggets. I told him those weren't vegan and he told me he that he eats meat in school sometimes. His friends share their meals with him sometimes. I thought about telling my sister but decided not to. \n\nSo basically I continue to give him vegan options but don't say anything if he chooses the non vegan option. Usually he goes for the non vegan one. Maybe because because he never gets to at home. I know my sister would freak out if she knows he's eating meat. She's staunchly vegan and eating animal products goes against her ethical beliefs which I completely understand and respect. My husband thinks IATA for not telling her and being dishonest, but I think nephew is old enough to make his own dietary choices (he's 10 this year). \n\nSo, AITA? Should I tell my sister what's going on?  \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for feeding their vegan nephew meat. The situation is that the nephew is raised vegan, but when he's at the author's house, he sometimes eats the non-vegan food provided. The author makes both vegan and non-vegan options, and the nephew often chooses the meat. The sister is strict about her vegan lifestyle, so the author is hesitant to tell her.\n\nSo, the key points here are about responsibility and consent. The nephew is 10 years old. At that age, he's not considered an adult, so maybe the parents have the final say in their child's diet. The author is providing non-vegan food, even though they know the parents' stance. But the nephew is choosing to eat it. The author's husband thinks they're being dishonest, but the author believes the nephew can make his own choices.\n\nNow, is the author in the wrong? It depends on a few factors. First, the parents have the right to decide their child's diet, especially for ethical reasons. The author is allowing the child to eat against his parents' wishes. Even though the author provides vegan options, by offering non-vegan food, they're enabling the child to make a choice that the parents wouldn't approve. The nephew might not fully understand the implications of his dietary choices yet. Also, the author is not informing the sister, which could be seen as withholding information. \n\nOn the other hand, maybe the nephew is curious about different foods, and the author is trying to be inclusive. However, since the parents have a strong ethical stance, the author's actions could be conflicting with that. The child's diet is a parent's responsibility, so the author should maybe have discussed this with the sister first. \n\nIn conclusion, the author might be in the wrong because they're allowing the child to consume non-vegan food without the parents' knowledge, even if the child is making the choice. The parents' consent is important, especially when it comes to a child's upbringing and ethical beliefs.\n"
