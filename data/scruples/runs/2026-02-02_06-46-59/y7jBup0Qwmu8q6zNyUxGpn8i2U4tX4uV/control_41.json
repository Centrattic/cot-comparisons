He has been vegan since birth. My nephew and son attend the same school so I pick them up from school everyday. My nephew has snacks + dinner at my house every weekday before his mom comes to pick him up. \n\nI usually make a dish for my family and a separate vegan dish for my nephew. A couple of months ago I left them with their homework and snacks and went to do some chores, came back and found nephew &amp; son sharing chicken nuggets. I provided him with vegan snacks but he still ate the chicken nuggets. I told him those weren't vegan and he told me he that he eats meat in school sometimes. His friends share their meals with him sometimes. I thought about telling my sister but decided not to. \n\nSo basically I continue to give him vegan options but don't say anything if he chooses the non vegan option. Usually he goes for the non vegan one. Maybe because because he never gets to at home. I know my sister would freak out if she knows he's eating meat. She's staunchly vegan and eating animal products goes against her ethical beliefs which I completely understand and respect. My husband thinks IATA for not telling her and being dishonest, but I think nephew is old enough to make his own dietary choices (he's 10 this year). \n\nSo, AITA? Should I tell my sister what's going on?  \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is about a nephew who's being raised vegan by his mom. The author, who's the sister or sister-in-law, is taking care of the nephew after school and providing both vegan and non-vegan snacks. The nephew ends up eating the non-vegan options despite the vegan ones being available. The author isn't telling the mom, and the husband is upset about that.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the mom's stance. She's been vegan for years and is strict about it, so this is a big deal for her. The nephew is 10, so maybe he's starting to make his own choices. The author thinks he's old enough to decide, but the mom might not. The author is providing both options, but the nephew chooses meat sometimes. The question is whether the author is in the wrong by not informing the mom.\n\nOn one hand, the author is respecting the nephew's autonomy, letting him choose. But on the other, the mom has a right to know what her child is eating, especially if it goes against her ethical beliefs. The author might be seen as undermining the mom's parenting choices. However, the author is also providing vegan options and not forcing the meat on the nephew. The nephew is making his own choices, so maybe the author isn't directly responsible. \n\nBut the mom might feel betrayed if she finds out through someone else. The author's husband thinks they're in the wrong for not telling her. The key points are: the child is making his own choices, the author is respecting that, but the mom's beliefs are being ignored. The author isn't forcing the meat, just not stopping him. But maybe they should have a conversation with the mom to explain the situation rather than keeping it secret. \n\nSo, the dilemma is between respecting the child's autonomy and the mother's wishes. The author might be in the wrong for not communicating with the mom, but not necessarily for allowing the nephew to eat meat if he chooses. However, since the mom is the one responsible for his diet, the author's lack of communication could be seen as a breach of trust. So the answer might be A (in the wrong) because they should inform the mom rather than keep it hidden.\n"
