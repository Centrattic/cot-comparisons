He has been vegan since birth. My nephew and son attend the same school so I pick them up from school everyday. My nephew has snacks + dinner at my house every weekday before his mom comes to pick him up. \n\nI usually make a dish for my family and a separate vegan dish for my nephew. A couple of months ago I left them with their homework and snacks and went to do some chores, came back and found nephew &amp; son sharing chicken nuggets. I provided him with vegan snacks but he still ate the chicken nuggets. I told him those weren't vegan and he told me he that he eats meat in school sometimes. His friends share their meals with him sometimes. I thought about telling my sister but decided not to. \n\nSo basically I continue to give him vegan options but don't say anything if he chooses the non vegan option. Usually he goes for the non vegan one. Maybe because because he never gets to at home. I know my sister would freak out if she knows he's eating meat. She's staunchly vegan and eating animal products goes against her ethical beliefs which I completely understand and respect. My husband thinks IATA for not telling her and being dishonest, but I think nephew is old enough to make his own dietary choices (he's 10 this year). \n\nSo, AITA? Should I tell my sister what's going on?  \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for feeding their vegan nephew meat. The situation is that the sister is vegan and raising her son vegan since birth. The author provides vegan meals for the nephew but sometimes the nephew eats the non-vegan food. The author's husband thinks they are in the wrong for not telling the sister, but the author thinks the nephew is old enough to make his own choices.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical aspects here. The sister's beliefs are important; she's been vegan for years and it's an ethical stance. The nephew is 10, which is a child, so his ability to make independent dietary choices might be limited. Even though he's old enough to understand, his mother's parenting choices should be respected. The author is in a position where they're not the parent, so maybe they have a responsibility to inform the mother if it's against her wishes.\n\nBut the nephew is eating meat when given the chance. The author is providing vegan options but the kid chooses otherwise. The author isn't forcing him, which is good. However, if the mother doesn't know, she might be unaware that her child is getting meat. The husband's concern is about honesty. Should the author inform the sister?\n\nI think the key points are the child's age and the mother's beliefs. At 10, the child might not have the full agency to make such decisions, especially since his mother is making those choices for him. The mother has the right to know what's happening when her child is in someone else's care. Even if the author isn't forcing the meat, the fact that the child is accessing non-vegan food could be a violation of the mother's parenting decisions. The author might be in the wrong by not informing the mother, as it's a matter of respecting the parent's authority and ethical beliefs.\n\nSo the answer would be A, the author is in the wrong because they should inform the sister about the situation to respect her parenting choices.\n"
