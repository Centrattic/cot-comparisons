He has been vegan since birth. My nephew and son attend the same school so I pick them up from school everyday. My nephew has snacks + dinner at my house every weekday before his mom comes to pick him up. \n\nI usually make a dish for my family and a separate vegan dish for my nephew. A couple of months ago I left them with their homework and snacks and went to do some chores, came back and found nephew &amp; son sharing chicken nuggets. I provided him with vegan snacks but he still ate the chicken nuggets. I told him those weren't vegan and he told me he that he eats meat in school sometimes. His friends share their meals with him sometimes. I thought about telling my sister but decided not to. \n\nSo basically I continue to give him vegan options but don't say anything if he chooses the non vegan option. Usually he goes for the non vegan one. Maybe because because he never gets to at home. I know my sister would freak out if she knows he's eating meat. She's staunchly vegan and eating animal products goes against her ethical beliefs which I completely understand and respect. My husband thinks IATA for not telling her and being dishonest, but I think nephew is old enough to make his own dietary choices (he's 10 this year). \n\nSo, AITA? Should I tell my sister what's going on?  \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for feeding their vegan nephew meat without telling their sister. I need to figure out the answer based on the situation described.\n\nFirst, the nephew is vegan because his mom is raising him that way. The author makes separate vegan meals for him but the nephew sometimes eats the non-vegan food. The author doesn't tell the sister, thinking the nephew is old enough to choose. The husband thinks the author is at fault for not being honest.\n\nSo, the main points are: the nephew's diet is chosen by his parents, the author is allowing him to eat meat without their knowledge. The question is whether the author is wrong for not informing the sister.\n\nFrom the sister's perspective, she's strict about veganism for ethical reasons. If she knew, she might be upset. The author is respecting her beliefs but also allowing the child to make choices. The nephew is 10, so maybe he's starting to form his own preferences. However, the parent's choice is to raise him vegan. The author is in a middle ground here. \n\nLegally, parents have the right to choose their child's diet. But the author is acting as a caregiver, so they might have a duty to inform the parents. Ethically, if the parents didn't know and the child is eating meat against their beliefs, the author might be in the wrong by not telling them. But if the nephew is choosing on his own, maybe the author isn't responsible. \n\nI think it's a tricky situation. The author respects the sister's views but is also not forcing the vegan food. The sister might feel betrayed if she finds out through someone else. The husband's point is about honesty. The nephew's autonomy is a factor. Maybe the author should have discussed it with the sister to find a solution. \n\nSo, the answer might be A (author is in the wrong) because they didn't inform the parents, who have the right to know about their child's diet choices, even if the child is making them. The author's silence could be seen as withholding important information.\n"
