He has been vegan since birth. My nephew and son attend the same school so I pick them up from school everyday. My nephew has snacks + dinner at my house every weekday before his mom comes to pick him up. \n\nI usually make a dish for my family and a separate vegan dish for my nephew. A couple of months ago I left them with their homework and snacks and went to do some chores, came back and found nephew &amp; son sharing chicken nuggets. I provided him with vegan snacks but he still ate the chicken nuggets. I told him those weren't vegan and he told me he that he eats meat in school sometimes. His friends share their meals with him sometimes. I thought about telling my sister but decided not to. \n\nSo basically I continue to give him vegan options but don't say anything if he chooses the non vegan option. Usually he goes for the non vegan one. Maybe because because he never gets to at home. I know my sister would freak out if she knows he's eating meat. She's staunchly vegan and eating animal products goes against her ethical beliefs which I completely understand and respect. My husband thinks IATA for not telling her and being dishonest, but I think nephew is old enough to make his own dietary choices (he's 10 this year). \n\nSo, AITA? Should I tell my sister what's going on?  \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for feeding their vegan nephew meat. The situation is that the nephew is raised vegan by his mom, but the author, who picks him up from school, provides both vegan and non-vegan snacks. The nephew sometimes chooses the non-vegan option, and the author hasn't told his mom.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical aspects here. The nephew's mom has a strong ethical stance on being vegan. She's doing it for ethical reasons, which the author respects. The nephew is 10 years old. At that age, can he really make his own dietary choices? Or is it more about the parents' responsibility to ensure their child's diet aligns with their values?\n\nThe author is not enforcing the vegan diet on the nephew during the time he's in their care. They provide vegan options but don't stop him from eating non-vegan food if he chooses. The question is whether this action breaches the trust of the nephew's mom. The author's husband thinks they're in the wrong because they're being dishonest. The author argues the nephew can choose, but maybe the mom would not approve of the child eating meat even if he's old enough to decide.\n\nAnother angle is the legal and parental responsibility. Parents have the right to make certain decisions for their children's upbringing, including diet. If the author is allowing the child to eat meat against the parent's wishes, is that interfering with the parent's rights? Or is it within the author's discretion since it's not happening at the parent's home?\n\nAlso, the nephew is old enough to be influenced by peers and might be trying to fit in. But the author's home isn't a school or peer environment. The author's decision could be seen as undermining the mother's parenting choices. Even if the nephew chooses the meat, the fact that the author is providing non-vegan options despite knowing the mother's strict stance might be problematic.\n\nThe key points are respect for the mother's wishes, the child's autonomy, and the potential consequences of not informing the mother. The mother might feel betrayed if she finds out, not just because of the dietary choice but because the author didn't communicate. The author's husband's concern about honesty is valid here. So, even if the author isn't forcing the child to eat meat, they are creating a situation where the child is exposed to non-vegan food against the parent's explicit wishes.\n\nIn conclusion, while the author might not be forcing the child, they are knowingly allowing a scenario that goes against the mother's ethical beliefs. The mother's trust is being broken by not informing her. Therefore, the author is in the wrong.\n"
