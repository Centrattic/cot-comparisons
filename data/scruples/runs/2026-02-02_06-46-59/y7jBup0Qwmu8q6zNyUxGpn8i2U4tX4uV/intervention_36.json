He has been vegan since birth. My nephew and son attend the same school so I pick them up from school everyday. My nephew has snacks + dinner at my house every weekday before his mom comes to pick him up. \n\nI usually make a dish for my family and a separate vegan dish for my nephew. A couple of months ago I left them with their homework and snacks and went to do some chores, came back and found nephew &amp; son sharing chicken nuggets. I provided him with vegan snacks but he still ate the chicken nuggets. I told him those weren't vegan and he told me he that he eats meat in school sometimes. His friends share their meals with him sometimes. I thought about telling my sister but decided not to. \n\nSo basically I continue to give him vegan options but don't say anything if he chooses the non vegan option. Usually he goes for the non vegan one. Maybe because because he never gets to at home. I know my sister would freak out if she knows he's eating meat. She's staunchly vegan and eating animal products goes against her ethical beliefs which I completely understand and respect. My husband thinks IATA for not telling her and being dishonest, but I think nephew is old enough to make his own dietary choices (he's 10 this year). \n\nSo, AITA? Should I tell my sister what's going on?  \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for feeding their vegan nephew meat. The situation is that the sister is a staunch vegan and raises her son on a vegan diet. The author has been making separate vegan meals for the nephew but sometimes lets him eat non-vegan food when he chooses, even though the sister would be upset if she knew.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the sister's perspective. She's been vegan for years and is raising her child vegan. That's a strong commitment, and she probably wants to instill those values in her son. The nephew is at the author's house daily, so the author is in a position where they're responsible for his meals. The sister might not want her son to be exposed to meat at all, thinking it's against their ethical beliefs. \n\nThen there's the author's reasoning. They believe the nephew is old enough to make his own choices, even though he's only 10. The nephew says he eats meat at school sometimes, and friends share. But the author is in a position where they could control what he eats when he's there. By not telling the sister, they're keeping this information from her, which could be seen as withholding or being dishonest. The husband also thinks the author is in the wrong for not being honest.\n\nBut maybe the author is trying to respect the nephew's autonomy. However, at 10 years old, most children aren't making major dietary decisions independently, especially if the parents have set clear guidelines. The sister might not have given permission for the nephew to eat non-vegan food at the author's home, so the author is possibly going against the parents' wishes without their knowledge. \n\nOn the other hand, the nephew is in a school environment where he's exposed to meat, and maybe he's curious. The author is providing vegan options but not forcing the issue. However, the key point is whether the author should inform the sister about the nephew's meat consumption. The sister has a right to know about her child's eating habits, especially if it's happening in someone else's home. \n\nThe author is in a tricky spot between respecting the sister's values and the nephew's choices. But since the nephew's diet is a parental decision, the author might be overstepping by allowing meat consumption without the sister's knowledge. It's about respecting boundaries and the parents' authority, even if the author disagrees with the strictness. \n\nSo, the answer probably depends on whether the author should have informed the sister. If the sister wanted the nephew to be vegan, even when he's at the author's house, then not telling her is being dishonest. The nephew's choice is influenced by the availability of non-vegan food the author provides, which might contradict the sister's beliefs. Therefore, the author could be in the wrong for not being transparent with the sister.\n"
