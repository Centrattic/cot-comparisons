He has been vegan since birth. My nephew and son attend the same school so I pick them up from school everyday. My nephew has snacks + dinner at my house every weekday before his mom comes to pick him up. \n\nI usually make a dish for my family and a separate vegan dish for my nephew. A couple of months ago I left them with their homework and snacks and went to do some chores, came back and found nephew &amp; son sharing chicken nuggets. I provided him with vegan snacks but he still ate the chicken nuggets. I told him those weren't vegan and he told me he that he eats meat in school sometimes. His friends share their meals with him sometimes. I thought about telling my sister but decided not to. \n\nSo basically I continue to give him vegan options but don't say anything if he chooses the non vegan option. Usually he goes for the non vegan one. Maybe because because he never gets to at home. I know my sister would freak out if she knows he's eating meat. She's staunchly vegan and eating animal products goes against her ethical beliefs which I completely understand and respect. My husband thinks IATA for not telling her and being dishonest, but I think nephew is old enough to make his own dietary choices (he's 10 this year). \n\nSo, AITA? Should I tell my sister what's going on?  \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for feeding their vegan nephew meat. The situation involves a 10-year-old boy who is being raised vegan by his mother. The author provides vegan snacks and meals but sometimes serves non-vegan options too. The nephew has been eating the meat, and the author is conflicted about whether to tell the sister.\n\nFirst, the sister is strictly vegan and the nephew has been vegan since birth. The author's sister would likely be upset if she knew. The nephew is old enough to make his own choices, but at 10, he's still a child. The author's husband thinks they're being dishonest by not telling the sister.\n\nOn one hand, the author respects the sister's beliefs and is providing vegan options as requested. On the other hand, by allowing the nephew to eat meat without informing the mother, they might be undermining the sister's parenting choices. However, the nephew might be exploring his preferences, especially if he's exposed to meat at school. \n\nThe key points are: the author is following the sister's instructions to provide vegan food, but the nephew is choosing otherwise. The author isn't forcing him, but isn't reporting it either. The sister's values are about ethical beliefs, so the author's silence could be seen as complicity. However, the nephew's autonomy is also a factor. \n\nIn terms of responsibility, the author might be in a middle ground. They are respecting the sister's request by offering vegan meals but not enforcing them strictly, which could be a way to let the nephew decide. However, the sister might view this as violating her trust and parenting decisions. The author's husband's argument about dishonesty is valid if the sister would expect to be informed. \n\nConsidering all angles, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong because they are providing the vegan options and not forcing the meat. However, the sister's stance is strict, so transparency might be needed. The answer isn't black and white, but the author's actions aren't malicious. So, the answer is B (not in the wrong).\n"
