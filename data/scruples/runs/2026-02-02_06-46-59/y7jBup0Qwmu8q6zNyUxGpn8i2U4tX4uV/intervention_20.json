He has been vegan since birth. My nephew and son attend the same school so I pick them up from school everyday. My nephew has snacks + dinner at my house every weekday before his mom comes to pick him up. \n\nI usually make a dish for my family and a separate vegan dish for my nephew. A couple of months ago I left them with their homework and snacks and went to do some chores, came back and found nephew &amp; son sharing chicken nuggets. I provided him with vegan snacks but he still ate the chicken nuggets. I told him those weren't vegan and he told me he that he eats meat in school sometimes. His friends share their meals with him sometimes. I thought about telling my sister but decided not to. \n\nSo basically I continue to give him vegan options but don't say anything if he chooses the non vegan option. Usually he goes for the non vegan one. Maybe because because he never gets to at home. I know my sister would freak out if she knows he's eating meat. She's staunchly vegan and eating animal products goes against her ethical beliefs which I completely understand and respect. My husband thinks IATA for not telling her and being dishonest, but I think nephew is old enough to make his own dietary choices (he's 10 this year). \n\nSo, AITA? Should I tell my sister what's going on?  \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation involves the author feeding their vegan nephew meat, even though the nephew's mother is a staunch vegan and the child has been vegan since birth.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The nephew is 10 years old, so he's a minor. The author's sister is raising him on a strict vegan diet, which is part of their ethical beliefs. The author provides vegan options but also has non-vegan food, and the nephew sometimes chooses the meat. The author hasn't told the sister, while the husband thinks they should have.\n\nThe ethical considerations here involve respecting the child's parents' wishes versus the child's autonomy. The author argues the nephew is old enough to make his own choices, but at 10, he's still a child, and his parents' dietary choices are part of their ethical upbringing. The author's sister might have valid reasons for her veganism, and the author is indirectly allowing the child to deviate from that, which could undermine the parents' values.\n\nAlso, the author's husband thinks they are being dishonest by not informing the sister. There's a duty of care here. The author is in a position of responsibility for the child during the time they are in their care. Allowing the child to eat meat when the parents explicitly don't want that could be seen as a breach of trust.\n\nHowever, the nephew is making the choice himself. But since he's a child, his choices are made under the supervision of the author. The author's actions might be enabling the child to eat meat, which the parents are against. The sister might feel that the author isn't respecting her parenting decisions, which could lead to conflict.\n\nIn terms of legal and ethical standards, parents have the right to decide their child's diet unless there's a health risk. The author isn't causing harm, but they are not respecting the parents' wishes. The author's justification that the nephew is old enough to choose is debatable because at 10, the child is still under adult supervision, and the parents' decisions should take precedence in such matters.\n\nSo, the author is in the wrong for not informing the sister and allowing the child to eat meat against her wishes. The right action would have been to discuss it with the sister to find a solution that respects both the parents' values and the child's well-being.\n"
