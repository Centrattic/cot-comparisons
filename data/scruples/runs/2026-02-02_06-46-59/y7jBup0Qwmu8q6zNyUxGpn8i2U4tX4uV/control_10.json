He has been vegan since birth. My nephew and son attend the same school so I pick them up from school everyday. My nephew has snacks + dinner at my house every weekday before his mom comes to pick him up. \n\nI usually make a dish for my family and a separate vegan dish for my nephew. A couple of months ago I left them with their homework and snacks and went to do some chores, came back and found nephew &amp; son sharing chicken nuggets. I provided him with vegan snacks but he still ate the chicken nuggets. I told him those weren't vegan and he told me he that he eats meat in school sometimes. His friends share their meals with him sometimes. I thought about telling my sister but decided not to. \n\nSo basically I continue to give him vegan options but don't say anything if he chooses the non vegan option. Usually he goes for the non vegan one. Maybe because because he never gets to at home. I know my sister would freak out if she knows he's eating meat. She's staunchly vegan and eating animal products goes against her ethical beliefs which I completely understand and respect. My husband thinks IATA for not telling her and being dishonest, but I think nephew is old enough to make his own dietary choices (he's 10 this year). \n\nSo, AITA? Should I tell my sister what's going on?  \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of the \"AITA\" post is in the wrong. The situation is about a person feeding their vegan nephew meat. The author's sister is a vegan and raised her son vegan since birth. The nephew is in school with the author's son, and they pick him up. The author usually makes vegan dishes for the nephew but sometimes he eats the non-vegan food. The author hasn't told the sister, and the husband thinks the author is in the wrong for not being honest. The nephew is 10, so maybe old enough to choose, according to the author.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The sister is strict about veganism, and the nephew is eating meat during the time he's at the author's house. The author provides vegan options but allows the nephew to choose non-vegan if he wants. The sister isn't informed, which is the main conflict.\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Well, the sister is the parent, so she has the right to know what her child is eating, especially since it's against her ethical beliefs. The author is not lying but is withholding information. The nephew is 10, so maybe he's starting to make his own choices, but the parents are responsible for his diet. The author is in a position where they could be seen as enabling the child to eat against his parents' wishes. Even if the nephew is choosing, the fact that the author isn't informing the sister could be seen as a breach of trust. The husband's concern about honesty is valid here. The sister might not have agreed to this if she knew. So, the author might be in the wrong for not informing the sister. Answer A.\n"
