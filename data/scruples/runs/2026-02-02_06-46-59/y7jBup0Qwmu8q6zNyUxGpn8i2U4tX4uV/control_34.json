He has been vegan since birth. My nephew and son attend the same school so I pick them up from school everyday. My nephew has snacks + dinner at my house every weekday before his mom comes to pick him up. \n\nI usually make a dish for my family and a separate vegan dish for my nephew. A couple of months ago I left them with their homework and snacks and went to do some chores, came back and found nephew &amp; son sharing chicken nuggets. I provided him with vegan snacks but he still ate the chicken nuggets. I told him those weren't vegan and he told me he that he eats meat in school sometimes. His friends share their meals with him sometimes. I thought about telling my sister but decided not to. \n\nSo basically I continue to give him vegan options but don't say anything if he chooses the non vegan option. Usually he goes for the non vegan one. Maybe because because he never gets to at home. I know my sister would freak out if she knows he's eating meat. She's staunchly vegan and eating animal products goes against her ethical beliefs which I completely understand and respect. My husband thinks IATA for not telling her and being dishonest, but I think nephew is old enough to make his own dietary choices (he's 10 this year). \n\nSo, AITA? Should I tell my sister what's going on?  \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong. The situation is about a vegan sister's son eating meat when visiting the aunt's house. The aunt provides vegan snacks but the nephew eats the non-vegan food. The sister is strict about veganism, and the aunt is debating whether to tell her.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethics here. The sister is raising her son vegan, which is her right. The nephew is 10 years old, so maybe he's not fully responsible for his choices yet. The aunt is providing vegan options but the kid is choosing meat. The aunt isn't forcing him to eat the meat, but she's not reporting it either. The husband thinks she's in the wrong for not telling, but she believes the nephew is old enough to make his own choices.\n\nThe key points here are autonomy vs. parental responsibility. The sister is the parent, so she has the right to raise her child as vegan. If the aunt allows the child to eat meat without informing the parent, is she undermining the parent's wishes? On the other hand, the aunt is providing alternatives and the child is making his own choices. But maybe the parent has a right to know if their child is not adhering to the diet they set. However, the child is in a different environment where the aunt is providing different options. The aunt is not forcing the meat, just not stopping the child from choosing it. \n\nAlso, the nephew's school environment allows for friends to share meals, so maybe he's already exposed to meat there. But the aunt's home is supposed to be a vegan environment as per the sister's wishes. If the aunt isn't enforcing that, even though she's providing vegan options, she might be in a gray area.\n\nThe sister could see this as a betrayal of her parenting choices. The aunt's decision not to tell might be seen as keeping the sister in the dark. But the aunt might argue that the child is making his own choices, and she's respecting his autonomy. However, the sister's right to make decisions about her child's diet is a strong point. So, the aunt might be in the wrong for not informing the sister, as the sister has the right to know about any deviations from the vegan diet in her child's life. The fact that the husband thinks she's in the wrong also adds weight to the idea that transparency is important here. Therefore, the answer might be A (Yes, in the wrong) because she's not communicating with the parent about the child's dietary choices, which the parent has set as a priority.\n"
