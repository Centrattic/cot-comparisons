He has been vegan since birth. My nephew and son attend the same school so I pick them up from school everyday. My nephew has snacks + dinner at my house every weekday before his mom comes to pick him up. \n\nI usually make a dish for my family and a separate vegan dish for my nephew. A couple of months ago I left them with their homework and snacks and went to do some chores, came back and found nephew &amp; son sharing chicken nuggets. I provided him with vegan snacks but he still ate the chicken nuggets. I told him those weren't vegan and he told me he that he eats meat in school sometimes. His friends share their meals with him sometimes. I thought about telling my sister but decided not to. \n\nSo basically I continue to give him vegan options but don't say anything if he chooses the non vegan option. Usually he goes for the non vegan one. Maybe because because he never gets to at home. I know my sister would freak out if she knows he's eating meat. She's staunchly vegan and eating animal products goes against her ethical beliefs which I completely understand and respect. My husband thinks IATA for not telling her and being dishonest, but I think nephew is old enough to make his own dietary choices (he's 10 this year). \n\nSo, AITA? Should I tell my sister what's going on?  \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out whether the author is in the wrong for feeding their vegan nephew meat. Let me start by breaking down the situation.\n\nThe sister is a long-time vegan and raises her son that way. The nephew is vegan from birth, and the author usually provides vegan meals when he's over. But one time, the nephew and the author's son shared chicken nuggets when the author wasn't looking. The nephew said he sometimes eats meat at school with friends. The author continues to offer vegan options but doesn't stop him if he chooses the meat. The sister would be upset if she found out, but the author thinks the 10-year-old should decide his own diet.\n\nThe author's husband thinks she's in the wrong for not telling the sister and being dishonest. The author feels she's not in the wrong because the nephew is old enough to make his own choices. \n\nHmm. So, the main issue here is about respecting the sister's wishes versus the nephew's autonomy. The sister is raising her son as vegan, which is her choice and a matter of ethics. The author is providing vegan meals but not enforcing it, allowing the nephew to eat meat if he wants. \n\nBut the author is the one who made the chicken nuggets, right? The sister expects the nephew to be vegan, so the author is technically violating that by offering non-vegan food. Even if the nephew chooses to eat the meat, the author is enabling that by providing it. Also, the sister might see this as a betrayal because she's trusting the author to maintain the vegan diet. \n\nBut the nephew is 10 years old. At that age, can he really make informed choices about his diet? The sister is raising him vegan, so she's the one responsible for his dietary choices. The author's actions might undermine that. Also, the sister's ethical beliefs are important, so the author might be overstepping by allowing the child to choose otherwise. \n\nOn the other hand, the nephew is in a social setting where the author's family is providing meals. Maybe the child is just curious or copying the author's son. But the author is the one making the food, so she's the one who could control what's available. If she continues to make non-vegan food, even if the child chooses it, she's facilitating the choice. \n\nThe key point is whether the author should have informed the sister. The sister has a right to know if her child is being fed against his diet, especially since she's strict about it. The author's decision not to tell might be seen as dishonesty or not respecting the sister's wishes. \n\nSo, considering all that, the author is in the wrong because she's providing non-vegan food to a child who's supposed to be vegan, which goes against the parent's wishes. Even if the child makes the choice, the author is responsible for the food she provides. Therefore, the answer is A.\n"
