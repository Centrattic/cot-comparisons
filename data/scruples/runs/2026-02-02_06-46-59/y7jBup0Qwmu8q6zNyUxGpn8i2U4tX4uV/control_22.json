He has been vegan since birth. My nephew and son attend the same school so I pick them up from school everyday. My nephew has snacks + dinner at my house every weekday before his mom comes to pick him up. \n\nI usually make a dish for my family and a separate vegan dish for my nephew. A couple of months ago I left them with their homework and snacks and went to do some chores, came back and found nephew &amp; son sharing chicken nuggets. I provided him with vegan snacks but he still ate the chicken nuggets. I told him those weren't vegan and he told me he that he eats meat in school sometimes. His friends share their meals with him sometimes. I thought about telling my sister but decided not to. \n\nSo basically I continue to give him vegan options but don't say anything if he chooses the non vegan option. Usually he goes for the non vegan one. Maybe because because he never gets to at home. I know my sister would freak out if she knows he's eating meat. She's staunchly vegan and eating animal products goes against her ethical beliefs which I completely understand and respect. My husband thinks IATA for not telling her and being dishonest, but I think nephew is old enough to make his own dietary choices (he's 10 this year). \n\nSo, AITA? Should I tell my sister what's going on?  \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The question is whether the person who wrote the story is in the wrong for feeding their vegan nephew meat. \n\nFirst, I need to look at the situation. The sister is a vegan and has been raising her son vegan since birth. The nephew is 10 years old and attends the same school as the author's son. The author provides vegan snacks and dinners for the nephew, but sometimes the nephew eats the non-vegan options (like chicken nuggets) when left alone with the kids. The author doesn't tell the sister about this, even though the sister would be upset if she knew.\n\nThe author's husband thinks they're in the wrong for not telling and being dishonest. The author thinks the nephew is old enough to choose his own diet. But the sister's beliefs are strong, and the author is respecting that by not informing her.\n\nSo, the key points are: the nephew is making his own choices, the author is providing vegan options but not forcing him, and the sister isn't informed. The question is whether the author is wrong for not telling the sister. \n\nLegally, there's no law against feeding a child meat unless it's against medical advice, which isn't mentioned here. Ethically, it's about respecting the parents' wishes versus the child's autonomy. The nephew is 10, which is a bit young to make fully informed decisions, but the author might think he's beginning to understand. However, the sister's strict vegan ethics are part of her parenting. By not informing her, the author is keeping a secret that might go against the sister's wishes. \n\nBut the author isn't forcing the nephew to eat meat; they're just not preventing him from choosing it when left alone. The author is providing vegan options, so maybe they're not directly responsible. However, the sister might feel that the author is undermining her parenting if she finds out. \n\nIn AITA situations, it's about social norms and expectations. The sister might expect the author to uphold the vegan diet, so the author's secrecy could be seen as a breach of trust. On the other hand, the author is giving the nephew a choice, which some might argue is fair given his age. \n\nI think the answer depends on how much the sister's expectations are. Since the author is aware of the sister's strong stance and is concealing the nephew's choices, it's a gray area. However, because the author is actively providing non-vegan food options (chicken nuggets) when the sister expects vegan, even if the nephew chooses it on his own, the author might be in the wrong by not informing the sister. The sister has a right to know if her child's diet is being compromised against her wishes. So the answer might be A (yes, in the wrong). But others might argue the nephew is making his own choices. Hmm.\n"
