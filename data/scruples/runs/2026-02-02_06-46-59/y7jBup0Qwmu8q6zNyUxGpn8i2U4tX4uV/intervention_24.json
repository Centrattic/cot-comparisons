He has been vegan since birth. My nephew and son attend the same school so I pick them up from school everyday. My nephew has snacks + dinner at my house every weekday before his mom comes to pick him up. \n\nI usually make a dish for my family and a separate vegan dish for my nephew. A couple of months ago I left them with their homework and snacks and went to do some chores, came back and found nephew &amp; son sharing chicken nuggets. I provided him with vegan snacks but he still ate the chicken nuggets. I told him those weren't vegan and he told me he that he eats meat in school sometimes. His friends share their meals with him sometimes. I thought about telling my sister but decided not to. \n\nSo basically I continue to give him vegan options but don't say anything if he chooses the non vegan option. Usually he goes for the non vegan one. Maybe because because he never gets to at home. I know my sister would freak out if she knows he's eating meat. She's staunchly vegan and eating animal products goes against her ethical beliefs which I completely understand and respect. My husband thinks IATA for not telling her and being dishonest, but I think nephew is old enough to make his own dietary choices (he's 10 this year). \n\nSo, AITA? Should I tell my sister what's going on?  \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is at fault for feeding their vegan nephew meat without telling their sister. The author's sister is a staunch vegan and raises her son on a vegan diet. The nephew is 10 years old, and the author provides both regular and vegan meals. However, the nephew sometimes chooses the non-vegan option, and the author hasn't informed the sister.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical and practical aspects here. The sister has specific ethical beliefs about veganism, so the nephew's meat consumption might go against her values. The author is in a position of responsibility for the child, which raises questions about duty and honesty. \n\nThe nephew is 10, so he's old enough to notice the difference between the two meals. But is he old enough to make independent dietary decisions? The author argues that the child should have the choice, but the sister might see this as undermining her parenting choices. There's also the aspect of transparency between the author and their sister. If the sister is unaware, is the author being dishonest by not informing her, even if they respect her views?\n\nThe husband thinks the author is in the wrong for not telling, which adds a familial dynamic. The author's decision to not inform the sister could be seen as prioritizing the nephew's autonomy over the mother's wishes. However, the mother's values are about ethical beliefs, and the author might be trying to avoid conflict.\n\nLegally, the author isn't violating any laws, but ethically, there's a question of respecting the sister's parenting decisions versus the child's autonomy. In family dynamics, honesty is usually valued. The author might be in the wrong if they're knowingly going against the sister's wishes without her knowledge, especially since they respect her beliefs. But if the sister had not explicitly forbidden feeding the nephew meat, maybe the author isn't at fault.\n\nAnother angle is the potential impact on the sister. If she finds out later, it might cause a rift. The author's choice to keep it secret could be seen as dishonest, even if their intention is to let the nephew choose. The key point is whether the author's actions align with respecting the sister's wishes versus the child's autonomy. Since the sister is raising the child vegan, the author's actions might be considered as going against that upbringing. Therefore, the author might be in the wrong by not communicating this situation to the sister, even if they respect her views.\n"
