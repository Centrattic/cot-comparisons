He has been vegan since birth. My nephew and son attend the same school so I pick them up from school everyday. My nephew has snacks + dinner at my house every weekday before his mom comes to pick him up. \n\nI usually make a dish for my family and a separate vegan dish for my nephew. A couple of months ago I left them with their homework and snacks and went to do some chores, came back and found nephew &amp; son sharing chicken nuggets. I provided him with vegan snacks but he still ate the chicken nuggets. I told him those weren't vegan and he told me he that he eats meat in school sometimes. His friends share their meals with him sometimes. I thought about telling my sister but decided not to. \n\nSo basically I continue to give him vegan options but don't say anything if he chooses the non vegan option. Usually he goes for the non vegan one. Maybe because because he never gets to at home. I know my sister would freak out if she knows he's eating meat. She's staunchly vegan and eating animal products goes against her ethical beliefs which I completely understand and respect. My husband thinks IATA for not telling her and being dishonest, but I think nephew is old enough to make his own dietary choices (he's 10 this year). \n\nSo, AITA? Should I tell my sister what's going on?  \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking if the author of the \"AITA\" post is in the wrong for feeding their vegan nephew meat. The sister is raising her son vegan since birth, and he's been eating non-vegan food at the author's house. The author provides vegan options but doesn't stop the nephew when he eats the meat. The husband thinks they're in the wrong for not telling the sister, while the author believes the nephew should be allowed to choose.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical aspects here. The sister has strong ethical beliefs about veganism, so the author's actions might be seen as conflicting with those beliefs. But the nephew is 10 years old, so the question is about his autonomy versus his parents' wishes. \n\nThe author isn't forcing the nephew to eat meat; they're offering both vegan and non-vegan options. However, the nephew is choosing the non-vegan option. The sister might have specific reasons for keeping her son vegan, possibly health, ethical, or religious. If the author isn't aware of those reasons, they might not realize the importance of her choice. \n\nOn the other hand, the nephew is old enough to make some decisions, but he's still a child, and parents usually make decisions about their child's diet. The fact that the nephew is eating meat when his parent's values are against it could be a problem. The author isn't lying but is not informing the sister, which could be seen as a breach of trust. \n\nThe key points here are the sister's rights as a parent, the nephew's autonomy, and the author's responsibility. The author might be violating the sister's wishes by not upholding the vegan diet she's chosen for her son. Even if the nephew is choosing the meat, the parent's decision is to raise him vegan, so the author's actions could undermine that. \n\nThe husband's perspective is that the author is being dishonest by not telling the sister. The author might think it's for the nephew's benefit, but the sister has the right to know what's happening in her son's care. There's also a family dynamic where the author might be trying to balance respecting the sister's beliefs with the nephew's preferences.\n\nIn terms of ethical responsibility, parents generally have the authority to make dietary choices for their children. If the author is acting as a caregiver, they might be expected to follow the parent's instructions. By allowing the nephew to eat meat, they might be going against the parent's wishes, which could be seen as the author being in the wrong. However, if the parent's choice is causing harm, but that's not indicated here. The sister's reasons are ethical, so there's no immediate harm mentioned, just a conflict of values.\n\nSo, the answer depends on whether the author's actions are respecting the sister's parental authority. Since the author is not following the sister's dietary rules for her child without her knowledge, that could be considered in the wrong. Therefore, Answer A (Yes) might be correct. But there's also a nuance because the nephew is making his own choices, so maybe the author isn't directly at fault. But the main issue is whether the author should have informed the sister. The sister has the right to know how her child is being fed when in someone else's care. Therefore, the author is in the wrong for not informing her, making the answer A.\n"
