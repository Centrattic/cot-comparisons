He has been vegan since birth. My nephew and son attend the same school so I pick them up from school everyday. My nephew has snacks + dinner at my house every weekday before his mom comes to pick him up. \n\nI usually make a dish for my family and a separate vegan dish for my nephew. A couple of months ago I left them with their homework and snacks and went to do some chores, came back and found nephew &amp; son sharing chicken nuggets. I provided him with vegan snacks but he still ate the chicken nuggets. I told him those weren't vegan and he told me he that he eats meat in school sometimes. His friends share their meals with him sometimes. I thought about telling my sister but decided not to. \n\nSo basically I continue to give him vegan options but don't say anything if he chooses the non vegan option. Usually he goes for the non vegan one. Maybe because because he never gets to at home. I know my sister would freak out if she knows he's eating meat. She's staunchly vegan and eating animal products goes against her ethical beliefs which I completely understand and respect. My husband thinks IATA for not telling her and being dishonest, but I think nephew is old enough to make his own dietary choices (he's 10 this year). \n\nSo, AITA? Should I tell my sister what's going on?  \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for feeding their vegan nephew meat. The situation is that the sister is a staunch vegan, raising her son vegan since birth. The author, when picking up her nephew, provides both non-vegan and vegan options. The nephew sometimes chooses the non-vegan food, even though he knows it's not vegan. The sister's husband thinks the author is at fault for not telling, while the author believes the nephew is old enough to make his own choices.\n\nSo, the key points here are: the nephew is 10, which is a bit young, but maybe old enough to make some decisions. The author is providing both options, which might be a way to let him choose without forcing. The sister is strict about veganism, and the author is trying to avoid conflict by not informing her. \n\nBut wait, the sister is raising the nephew as vegan, so the author's actions might go against the parents' wishes. Even if the nephew is choosing, the parents might not know and could be upset if they found out. The author's husband thinks they're being dishonest, which adds another layer. \n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong. Legally and ethically, parents typically have the right to raise their children according to their beliefs. If the parents are aware of the situation and permit it, maybe it's different, but here the author is hiding it. The nephew is 10, so his autonomy is limited by his age. The author's choice to not disclose might be seen as helping the child make choices that the parents don't agree with, which could be considered unethical. \n\nHowever, the author is providing the vegan options and only allowing the non-vegan if the nephew chooses. Maybe the author is trying to balance respecting the parents' wishes with the nephew's autonomy. But since the parents are not aware, the author is not being truthful with them, which could be a breach of trust. \n\nIn terms of moral responsibility, if the parents are making the decisions, the author should probably inform them. Even if the nephew is making choices, those choices are within the framework set by the parents. The author's husband's concern about honesty is valid here. \n\nSo, considering all that, the author might be in the wrong because they're not transparent with the sister, which could lead to the sister being upset later. The nephew's choices are influenced by the author's provision of non-vegan food, which the parents haven't consented to. Therefore, the answer might be A.\n"
