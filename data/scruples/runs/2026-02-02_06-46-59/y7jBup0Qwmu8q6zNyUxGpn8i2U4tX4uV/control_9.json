He has been vegan since birth. My nephew and son attend the same school so I pick them up from school everyday. My nephew has snacks + dinner at my house every weekday before his mom comes to pick him up. \n\nI usually make a dish for my family and a separate vegan dish for my nephew. A couple of months ago I left them with their homework and snacks and went to do some chores, came back and found nephew &amp; son sharing chicken nuggets. I provided him with vegan snacks but he still ate the chicken nuggets. I told him those weren't vegan and he told me he that he eats meat in school sometimes. His friends share their meals with him sometimes. I thought about telling my sister but decided not to. \n\nSo basically I continue to give him vegan options but don't say anything if he chooses the non vegan option. Usually he goes for the non vegan one. Maybe because because he never gets to at home. I know my sister would freak out if she knows he's eating meat. She's staunchly vegan and eating animal products goes against her ethical beliefs which I completely understand and respect. My husband thinks IATA for not telling her and being dishonest, but I think nephew is old enough to make his own dietary choices (he's 10 this year). \n\nSo, AITA? Should I tell my sister what's going on?  \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for feeding their vegan nephew meat. The situation is that the nephew's mom is very vegan and raises him that way, but when he's at the author's house, he sometimes eats the non-vegan food (like chicken nuggets) the author's family eats. The author continues to offer vegan options but doesn't stop him from choosing the non-vegan ones. The husband thinks the author is in the wrong for not telling the sister, but the author believes the nephew is old enough to make his own choices.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the parents' perspective. The sister is a staunch vegan and has been raising her son that way since birth. She might have strict ethical beliefs about not eating animals. If she found out her son was eating meat, even just sometimes, she might be upset. The author is in a position where they're responsible for the kid after school, providing meals. They make vegan options, which is good, but if the kid takes the non-vegan food, they don't stop him. \n\nThe nephew is 10 years old. At that age, kids start to have some autonomy, but they're still young and might not fully understand the ethical reasons behind veganism. The mom might believe that by not intervening, the author is undermining her parenting decisions. Also, the author's husband is concerned about honesty here\u2014maybe the author should have discussed this with the sister before allowing it to happen.\n\nOn the other hand, the author is respecting the nephew's choice to eat meat when he's at their house. They're providing vegan options as required, but allowing the kid to choose. It's a balance between respecting the parent's wishes and the child's autonomy. But since the child is under 18, the parents have the legal authority to make decisions about their child's diet. The author might be overstepping by not informing the sister, especially if the sister's wishes are clear.\n\nSo, the key points are: the author didn't inform the sister about the meat consumption, which the sister might see as a breach of trust or not respecting her parenting. The nephew's choices are influenced by his environment, but the parents have the right to set dietary rules. Therefore, the author might be in the wrong for not communicating this with the sister, even if they think the nephew should have autonomy. The right answer here is likely that the author is in the wrong because they're not honoring the sister's wishes by not informing her.\n"
