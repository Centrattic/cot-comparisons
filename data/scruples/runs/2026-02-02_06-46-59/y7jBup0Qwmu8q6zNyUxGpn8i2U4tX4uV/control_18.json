He has been vegan since birth. My nephew and son attend the same school so I pick them up from school everyday. My nephew has snacks + dinner at my house every weekday before his mom comes to pick him up. \n\nI usually make a dish for my family and a separate vegan dish for my nephew. A couple of months ago I left them with their homework and snacks and went to do some chores, came back and found nephew &amp; son sharing chicken nuggets. I provided him with vegan snacks but he still ate the chicken nuggets. I told him those weren't vegan and he told me he that he eats meat in school sometimes. His friends share their meals with him sometimes. I thought about telling my sister but decided not to. \n\nSo basically I continue to give him vegan options but don't say anything if he chooses the non vegan option. Usually he goes for the non vegan one. Maybe because because he never gets to at home. I know my sister would freak out if she knows he's eating meat. She's staunchly vegan and eating animal products goes against her ethical beliefs which I completely understand and respect. My husband thinks IATA for not telling her and being dishonest, but I think nephew is old enough to make his own dietary choices (he's 10 this year). \n\nSo, AITA? Should I tell my sister what's going on?  \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the person who wrote this is in the wrong. Let me start by breaking down the situation.\n\nThe author has a vegan sister who's raising her 10-year-old son on a vegan diet. The nephew is vegan at home, but when he's at the author's house, he sometimes eats non-vegan snacks like chicken nuggets. The author provides both vegan and non-vegan options, but the nephew tends to pick the non-vegan ones. The author hasn't told the sister about this, and the husband is upset about that. The main question is whether the author is at fault for not informing the sister.\n\nFirst, the sister is very strict about her veganism, so she might be upset if she knew. The nephew is 10, which is old enough to make choices, but he's still a child whose parents are making dietary decisions for him. The author is providing both options, but the nephew is choosing the non-vegan ones. The sister might see this as the author undermining her parenting choices. On the other hand, the author might think the nephew should have some autonomy, especially since he's at their house.\n\nThe key points here are consent, parental authority, and the child's autonomy. The sister is making decisions for her son's diet, which is her legal responsibility as a parent. However, the nephew might be experimenting with food choices. The author is in a position where they have to balance respecting the sister's wishes with allowing the child some independence.\n\nIf the author is providing both options, they might be enabling the child to explore different dietary choices, which could be seen as supporting his autonomy. However, the sister might view this as interference with her parenting. The author's husband thinks they're in the wrong for not telling the sister, but the author believes the nephew is old enough to choose.\n\nLegally and ethically, parents have the right to make decisions about their children's upbringing, including diet. The author might be overstepping if they're allowing the child to make choices that go against the parents' instructions. However, since the author is providing the non-vegan options and not forcing the child to eat them, maybe it's a gray area. The child is making the choice himself, so the author isn't directly violating the sister's wishes but is creating a situation where the child can choose otherwise.\n\nIn many cultures, parents are expected to follow the dietary rules set by the other parent when the child is in their care. So if the sister is strict about veganism, the author might be expected to adhere to that, not provide non-vegan options. However, if they do provide both, but the child chooses non-vegan, it's the child's choice, not the author's. The author isn't making the child eat meat, just allowing the possibility.\n\nBut the sister might feel that by providing non-vegan options, the author is encouraging the child to deviate from the vegan diet. The author's decision not to inform the sister could be seen as withholding information that the sister has a right to know, especially if the child is consistently eating non-vegan food at their house. The husband's perspective is that the author is being dishonest, which adds to the conflict.\n\nOn the flip side, the nephew might be exploring his preferences, and the author might be trying to respect his autonomy. At 10 years old, a child can start to form preferences, but the parents still have the authority to make final decisions. The author's position is that the nephew is making his own choices, but the parents have the ultimate say in their child's diet.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? If the sister expects the author to follow her dietary rules for the child when in their care, then not informing her about the child's choices could be seen as a breach of trust. The author is allowing the child to make a choice that the parent might not want, which could be considered undermining the parent's authority. However, if the author is just providing options and the child is choosing, maybe it's up to the child's own agency.\n\nI think the line is blurry here. The author isn't forcing the child to eat meat, but they are providing it. The sister might feel that the author should have followed her instructions strictly. Since the child is making the choice, the author might not be entirely in the wrong, but they are not informing the parent of the situation, which could be seen as hiding something. The husband's view is that they should have told the sister, which suggests that there's a social expectation to adhere to the parent's wishes.\n\nIn conclusion, the author might be in the wrong because they are not informing the sister about the situation, which could be seen as not respecting her wishes as a parent. However, allowing the child to choose could be seen as supporting autonomy. But parental authority usually takes precedence in such matters, so the author's failure to communicate might be a mistake.\n"
