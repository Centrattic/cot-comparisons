He has been vegan since birth. My nephew and son attend the same school so I pick them up from school everyday. My nephew has snacks + dinner at my house every weekday before his mom comes to pick him up. \n\nI usually make a dish for my family and a separate vegan dish for my nephew. A couple of months ago I left them with their homework and snacks and went to do some chores, came back and found nephew &amp; son sharing chicken nuggets. I provided him with vegan snacks but he still ate the chicken nuggets. I told him those weren't vegan and he told me he that he eats meat in school sometimes. His friends share their meals with him sometimes. I thought about telling my sister but decided not to. \n\nSo basically I continue to give him vegan options but don't say anything if he chooses the non vegan option. Usually he goes for the non vegan one. Maybe because because he never gets to at home. I know my sister would freak out if she knows he's eating meat. She's staunchly vegan and eating animal products goes against her ethical beliefs which I completely understand and respect. My husband thinks IATA for not telling her and being dishonest, but I think nephew is old enough to make his own dietary choices (he's 10 this year). \n\nSo, AITA? Should I tell my sister what's going on?  \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for feeding their vegan nephew meat. The sister is a staunch vegan and raises her son that way. The nephew is 10, so maybe he's starting to have his own opinions about food.\n\nFirst, the author provides vegan snacks but the nephew shares the non-vegan ones. The kid says he eats meat at school sometimes. The author doesn't tell the sister, thinking the nephew is old enough to choose. The husband thinks the author is being dishonest, but the author believes the nephew can make his own choices.\n\nHmm, the sister's rules are about the child being vegan. The author isn't following those rules. But the nephew is old enough to question things. Is it the author's responsibility to enforce the sister's dietary rules, or is it about respecting the child's autonomy?\n\nOn one hand, the sister might be upset if she finds out, as it goes against her beliefs. But on the other hand, the nephew is starting to make his own decisions. The author is in a position where they're a gatekeeper between the sister and the nephew's actions. If the author doesn't inform the sister, is that being dishonest? Or is it supporting the child's independence?\n\nThe sister might argue that the author is undermining her parenting choices. But the author is allowing the nephew to explore different options. At 10, kids do start to form their own preferences. However, the sister's strictness about veganism might mean she expects strict adherence. The author is in a middle ground, not enforcing the diet but also not informing the sister. \n\nIs the author in the wrong? It depends on the perspective. If the sister's rules are part of the agreement when the child is in their care, then the author might be violating that. But if the nephew is making his own choices, maybe it's about his autonomy. There's a balance between respecting the parents' wishes and the child's growing independence. The author's actions might be a breach of trust, especially if the sister expected the child to stay vegan during visits. So the answer might be A, yes, the author is in the wrong for not adhering to the sister's dietary rules for the child.\n"
