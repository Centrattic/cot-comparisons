He has been vegan since birth. My nephew and son attend the same school so I pick them up from school everyday. My nephew has snacks + dinner at my house every weekday before his mom comes to pick him up. \n\nI usually make a dish for my family and a separate vegan dish for my nephew. A couple of months ago I left them with their homework and snacks and went to do some chores, came back and found nephew &amp; son sharing chicken nuggets. I provided him with vegan snacks but he still ate the chicken nuggets. I told him those weren't vegan and he told me he that he eats meat in school sometimes. His friends share their meals with him sometimes. I thought about telling my sister but decided not to. \n\nSo basically I continue to give him vegan options but don't say anything if he chooses the non vegan option. Usually he goes for the non vegan one. Maybe because because he never gets to at home. I know my sister would freak out if she knows he's eating meat. She's staunchly vegan and eating animal products goes against her ethical beliefs which I completely understand and respect. My husband thinks IATA for not telling her and being dishonest, but I think nephew is old enough to make his own dietary choices (he's 10 this year). \n\nSo, AITA? Should I tell my sister what's going on?  \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong. The situation is that they feed their vegan nephew meat despite his mother's strict vegan lifestyle.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The nephew's mother is vegan and has raised him vegan since birth. The author provides vegan meals but sometimes the nephew eats the non-vegan options, like chicken nuggets. The nephew mentions he eats meat at school sometimes. The author hasn't told the mother yet, and the husband thinks they're being dishonest. The nephew is 10 years old.\n\nSo, the main question is whether the author is wrong for not informing the sister. Let's break it down. On one hand, the nephew's mom has a strong ethical stance on being vegan. If she knew, she might be upset because her child is eating meat. On the other hand, the nephew is 10, which is an age where kids might start making their own choices, even if it's not common. The author is respecting the child's choice by not intervening, but that goes against the mother's wishes.\n\nBut wait, the mother is the one feeding him vegan at home. If the nephew is choosing meat when he's in another environment, maybe that's his own decision. However, the mother might see it as the author undermining her parenting. The author isn't forcing the meat; they're just not stopping the nephew, which could be seen as a lack of respect for the mother's values.\n\nThe husband's perspective is that they're being dishonest by not telling the sister. But the author argues that the nephew is old enough to make choices. However, the mother might not agree. There's a conflict between respecting the child's autonomy and respecting the parent's wishes. \n\nIn terms of ethical considerations, the author is in a position where they're not enforcing the vegan diet but allowing the nephew to eat meat. This could be seen as a breach of trust with the sister, especially if the sister believed the author would uphold the vegan principles. On the other hand, the author isn't causing harm directly; they're providing options and letting the child choose. \n\nIt's a tricky situation. The answer might depend on cultural or family norms. But since the sister is very strict about veganism, the author's actions might be considered disrespectful. However, if the nephew is choosing the meat of his own volition, maybe it's not the author's fault. But the author is in a position where they could prevent it, so maybe they have a responsibility to report. \n\nAlternatively, the author could be seen as respecting the child's autonomy. But the mother's expectations might include the author upholding the vegan diet. The fact that the nephew eats meat at school and here might mean he's making his own choices, but the mother might not want that. \n\nI think the key points are the sister's strict veganism and the potential breach of trust. The author's decision to not inform her could be seen as lying or being deceptive. Even if the nephew is choosing to eat meat, the author is aware and not acting, which could be considered in the wrong. So, the answer might be A (wrong), but I'm a bit torn. Alternatively, if the author isn't forcing the meat, maybe it's B (not wrong). Hmm.\n"
