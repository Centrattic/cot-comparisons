He has been vegan since birth. My nephew and son attend the same school so I pick them up from school everyday. My nephew has snacks + dinner at my house every weekday before his mom comes to pick him up. \n\nI usually make a dish for my family and a separate vegan dish for my nephew. A couple of months ago I left them with their homework and snacks and went to do some chores, came back and found nephew &amp; son sharing chicken nuggets. I provided him with vegan snacks but he still ate the chicken nuggets. I told him those weren't vegan and he told me he that he eats meat in school sometimes. His friends share their meals with him sometimes. I thought about telling my sister but decided not to. \n\nSo basically I continue to give him vegan options but don't say anything if he chooses the non vegan option. Usually he goes for the non vegan one. Maybe because because he never gets to at home. I know my sister would freak out if she knows he's eating meat. She's staunchly vegan and eating animal products goes against her ethical beliefs which I completely understand and respect. My husband thinks IATA for not telling her and being dishonest, but I think nephew is old enough to make his own dietary choices (he's 10 this year). \n\nSo, AITA? Should I tell my sister what's going on?  \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The situation is about a vegan sister who's raising her son vegan since birth. The author, who is probably the sister's sibling, is taking care of the nephew after school and offers both vegan snacks and non-vegan ones. The nephew sometimes eats the non-vegan food, but the author doesn't tell the sister. The sister's husband thinks the author is at fault for not telling, but the author believes the 10-year-old should choose his own diet.\n\nHmm, so the main points here are about respect for the sister's wishes and the child's autonomy. The sister is strict about her veganism, so the author might be going against that by not enforcing the vegan diet. But on the other hand, the nephew is 10, which is old enough to start making some choices, but maybe not fully aware of the ethical reasons behind veganism. \n\nThe author isn't actively encouraging the nephew to eat meat, just providing options. However, by not informing the sister, there's a possibility of undermining her parenting choices. The sister might feel betrayed if she finds out. But the author argues that the child should have some autonomy. \n\nI think it's a balance between respecting the parents' wishes and the child's own choices. Since the sister is the parent and the child is under her care, the author might be in the wrong by not upholding the dietary rules she set. Even if the nephew is trying meat, the parents have the right to enforce their values. The author's husband is right in thinking that honesty is important here. So the answer might be A (Yes, the author is in the wrong) because they're not respecting the sister's parenting decisions.\n"
