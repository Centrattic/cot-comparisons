He has been vegan since birth. My nephew and son attend the same school so I pick them up from school everyday. My nephew has snacks + dinner at my house every weekday before his mom comes to pick him up. \n\nI usually make a dish for my family and a separate vegan dish for my nephew. A couple of months ago I left them with their homework and snacks and went to do some chores, came back and found nephew &amp; son sharing chicken nuggets. I provided him with vegan snacks but he still ate the chicken nuggets. I told him those weren't vegan and he told me he that he eats meat in school sometimes. His friends share their meals with him sometimes. I thought about telling my sister but decided not to. \n\nSo basically I continue to give him vegan options but don't say anything if he chooses the non vegan option. Usually he goes for the non vegan one. Maybe because because he never gets to at home. I know my sister would freak out if she knows he's eating meat. She's staunchly vegan and eating animal products goes against her ethical beliefs which I completely understand and respect. My husband thinks IATA for not telling her and being dishonest, but I think nephew is old enough to make his own dietary choices (he's 10 this year). \n\nSo, AITA? Should I tell my sister what's going on?  \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for feeding their vegan nephew meat. The sister is raising her son vegan since birth, and the author has a vegan dish ready when they pick him up. But sometimes the nephew eats the non-vegan options. The author's husband thinks they're in the wrong for not telling the sister.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the nephew's age. He's 10, so a child. The sister has a strict vegan upbringing, so she probably has specific reasons, maybe ethical or health-based. The author is providing vegan meals, which shows they respect the sister's choice. The nephew is choosing to eat non-vegan food when left alone, possibly influenced by friends at school.\n\nThe author isn't forcing the meat on him. They make separate meals, but the kid picks the other one. The husband's argument is about honesty, but if the sister is not present, maybe the author isn't responsible for enforcing her dietary rules. The key points are: the author isn't giving meat to him, he's taking it himself, and the author is aware but doesn't report it. \n\nIs the author being dishonest? Maybe not. They might be allowing the child to make his own choices, respecting his autonomy. The sister might prefer the author to inform her if the child isn't following the diet, but the author is choosing to let the child decide. \n\nThe child's age is a factor. At 10, he's old enough to make some choices, but his mom is the one making the dietary decisions for him. The author's role is as a caregiver during the pick-up time. If the author is aware that the child is eating non-vegan food elsewhere (school), maybe they're not the ones responsible for his diet. \n\nBut the sister might be upset if she finds out. The author is withholding information, which could be seen as not respecting the sister's wishes. However, the nephew might be making his own decisions now, and the sister might not have considered that he's forming his own preferences. \n\nSo, the author isn't in the wrong because they're not forcing the meat; they're allowing the child to choose. The sister's strictness might be a problem if the child is now old enough to make choices. The author's actions are about respecting the child's autonomy, not being dishonest. Therefore, answer B.\n"
