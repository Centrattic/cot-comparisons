He has been vegan since birth. My nephew and son attend the same school so I pick them up from school everyday. My nephew has snacks + dinner at my house every weekday before his mom comes to pick him up. \n\nI usually make a dish for my family and a separate vegan dish for my nephew. A couple of months ago I left them with their homework and snacks and went to do some chores, came back and found nephew &amp; son sharing chicken nuggets. I provided him with vegan snacks but he still ate the chicken nuggets. I told him those weren't vegan and he told me he that he eats meat in school sometimes. His friends share their meals with him sometimes. I thought about telling my sister but decided not to. \n\nSo basically I continue to give him vegan options but don't say anything if he chooses the non vegan option. Usually he goes for the non vegan one. Maybe because because he never gets to at home. I know my sister would freak out if she knows he's eating meat. She's staunchly vegan and eating animal products goes against her ethical beliefs which I completely understand and respect. My husband thinks IATA for not telling her and being dishonest, but I think nephew is old enough to make his own dietary choices (he's 10 this year). \n\nSo, AITA? Should I tell my sister what's going on?  \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is that the author has a vegan sister who's raising her 10-year-old son vegan since birth. The nephew is at the author's house every day after school, where the author provides both a family meal and a separate vegan meal. The nephew has been eating the non-vegan food, like chicken nuggets, even though the author offered vegan snacks. The nephew mentioned that he sometimes eats meat at school with friends.\n\nThe author is torn because they respect their sister's strict vegan beliefs but also think the nephew is old enough to make his own choices. The husband thinks the author is at fault for not telling the sister, while the author feels it's not their place to interfere.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the rights and responsibilities here. The sister's ethical beliefs are important, and she's making choices for her child. However, the nephew is 10 years old, which is a minor, so his dietary choices are still under his parents' responsibility. The author is not the parent, so they might not have the authority to enforce the vegan diet. But by providing non-vegan food and not informing the parent, could that be seen as undermining the parent's decisions?\n\nThe author is providing vegan options, but by not stopping the nephew from choosing non-vegan, are they enabling the child to eat against his parents' wishes? The sister might see this as the author not respecting her parenting choices. On the other hand, the nephew is exploring his own choices, which could be a part of growing up. But since he's a child, his parents are the ones who make such decisions, especially on ethical grounds that go against their beliefs.\n\nThe author's decision to not tell the sister might be to avoid conflict, but if the sister is strict about it, the author could be seen as being dishonest or not respecting her wishes. The nephew isn't making an informed choice; he's just taking what's available. The author's husband thinks they're in the wrong because they're hiding the truth, which complicates the situation.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? If the sister explicitly asked for the nephew to be kept strictly vegan, then the author is not fulfilling that request. But maybe the sister didn't specify that the author can't provide non-vegan food, just that the vegan option is there. The author might be in a gray area here. However, allowing a child to eat meat when the parent has a strict dietary rule could be seen as a breach of trust. The parent has the right to control their child's diet, and the author, by not informing them, might be in the wrong.\n\nOn the flip side, if the author is trying to let the nephew make his own choices, but since he's a minor, that's not entirely up to him. The parent has the authority. Therefore, the author's actions might be considered as not respecting the parent's decisions. So, the answer might be A, yes, the author is in the wrong because they are allowing the child to eat against the parent's wishes without informing them, which could be seen as dishonest.\n"
