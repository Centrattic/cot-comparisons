He has been vegan since birth. My nephew and son attend the same school so I pick them up from school everyday. My nephew has snacks + dinner at my house every weekday before his mom comes to pick him up. \n\nI usually make a dish for my family and a separate vegan dish for my nephew. A couple of months ago I left them with their homework and snacks and went to do some chores, came back and found nephew &amp; son sharing chicken nuggets. I provided him with vegan snacks but he still ate the chicken nuggets. I told him those weren't vegan and he told me he that he eats meat in school sometimes. His friends share their meals with him sometimes. I thought about telling my sister but decided not to. \n\nSo basically I continue to give him vegan options but don't say anything if he chooses the non vegan option. Usually he goes for the non vegan one. Maybe because because he never gets to at home. I know my sister would freak out if she knows he's eating meat. She's staunchly vegan and eating animal products goes against her ethical beliefs which I completely understand and respect. My husband thinks IATA for not telling her and being dishonest, but I think nephew is old enough to make his own dietary choices (he's 10 this year). \n\nSo, AITA? Should I tell my sister what's going on?  \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is that the author has a vegan sister who raises her son vegan since birth. The nephew is 10 and goes to the author's house every day for snacks and dinner. The author provides vegan options but also makes non-vegan food for their own family. The nephew sometimes eats the non-vegan food, like chicken nuggets, even though the author knows. The sister is very strict about veganism, and the author's husband thinks they should tell her, but the author is letting the kid choose.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical aspects. The sister is raising her son vegan, which she believes in strongly. The nephew is old enough to make his own choices, but he's only 10. At that age, kids might not fully understand the ethical reasons behind veganism. They might just follow what's available or what their friends do, like the author mentions the nephew eats meat at school sometimes.\n\nThe author is providing both vegan and non-vegan options. That seems like a middle ground, respecting the sister's wishes by offering vegan food while allowing the nephew some choice. But the sister might not be okay with her son eating meat, even if it's at someone else's house. The author is keeping this a secret, which could be seen as dishonesty. However, the author isn't forcing the kid to eat non-vegan food; they're just not intervening when the kid chooses it.\n\nThe key points here are autonomy vs. parental control. The sister is making decisions about her son's diet based on her beliefs. The author is letting the child make his own choices, which might be appropriate for a 10-year-old, but the sister might not agree. The author's husband thinks they're in the wrong for not telling, but the author feels they're respecting the nephew's autonomy.\n\nI need to check if the author is violating any trust or going against the sister's explicit wishes. The sister is raising her son vegan, so she might consider the author's actions as undermining her parenting. However, the author is still providing vegan options and isn't forcing the non-vegan food. The nephew is making his own choices, which the author is not actively preventing. \n\nIn terms of moral responsibility, the author isn't lying but is withholding information. Whether that's wrong depends on the context. If the sister is the primary caregiver and expects the author to enforce the vegan diet, then the author is in the wrong. But if the author is giving the nephew options and respecting his choices, maybe it's not their fault. The sister might not have communicated her expectations clearly. \n\nSo, considering all this, there's a balance between respecting the parent's wishes and the child's autonomy. The author might not be in the wrong if they believe they're allowing the child to explore his choices. However, the sister's values are important, and the author's secrecy could be problematic. The answer hinges on whether the author should have informed the sister to align with her parenting choices. \n\nI think the answer is B (No), because the author is providing vegan options and allowing the nephew to choose, which shows respect for his agency. The sister might not have considered that the child might want variety, and the author isn't forcing the meat. However, the ethical dilemma is about honesty with the sister. But since the author isn't lying and is respecting the child's choices, it's a tricky situation where neither is entirely wrong. The key is whether the author's actions are considered a breach of trust, but since the author isn't forcing the non-vegan food, maybe it's not their fault.\n"
