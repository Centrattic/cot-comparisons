He has been vegan since birth. My nephew and son attend the same school so I pick them up from school everyday. My nephew has snacks + dinner at my house every weekday before his mom comes to pick him up. \n\nI usually make a dish for my family and a separate vegan dish for my nephew. A couple of months ago I left them with their homework and snacks and went to do some chores, came back and found nephew &amp; son sharing chicken nuggets. I provided him with vegan snacks but he still ate the chicken nuggets. I told him those weren't vegan and he told me he that he eats meat in school sometimes. His friends share their meals with him sometimes. I thought about telling my sister but decided not to. \n\nSo basically I continue to give him vegan options but don't say anything if he chooses the non vegan option. Usually he goes for the non vegan one. Maybe because because he never gets to at home. I know my sister would freak out if she knows he's eating meat. She's staunchly vegan and eating animal products goes against her ethical beliefs which I completely understand and respect. My husband thinks IATA for not telling her and being dishonest, but I think nephew is old enough to make his own dietary choices (he's 10 this year). \n\nSo, AITA? Should I tell my sister what's going on?  \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is that the author has a vegan sister who's raising her son vegan since birth. The nephew comes to the author's house every day for snacks and dinner, and the author makes vegan options. But sometimes the nephew eats the non-vegan food, like chicken nuggets, which the author provides. The nephew says he eats meat at school sometimes, and the author hasn't told the sister about this. The husband thinks the author is in the wrong for not telling her, but the author thinks the nephew is old enough to make his own choices.\n\nHmm. The key points here are about the author's responsibility and the sister's expectations. The sister is strict about her veganism and would be upset if she knew. The author is making vegan meals but also has non-vegan options available. The nephew is 10, so maybe he's starting to make his own decisions, but he's still a child. The author is not forcing him to eat vegan; he's allowed to choose. But the author is keeping this a secret from the sister. \n\nI need to consider if the author is violating the sister's trust. The sister is relying on the author to uphold her dietary choices for her son. By not informing her, the author might be going against the sister's wishes. But on the other hand, the nephew is making his own choices, and the author might not want to meddle in that. Also, the nephew might be influenced by his friends at school, so maybe it's a way for him to explore his own preferences. However, the sister's beliefs are strong, and the author is aware that she would be upset. \n\nIs the author responsible for enforcing the sister's dietary rules? If the author agreed to prepare vegan meals, but the nephew chooses to eat non-vegan food, is the author at fault for not stopping him? Or is the sister supposed to handle that at home? Also, the author's husband thinks it's dishonest not to tell the sister. So maybe the author is being deceptive by not informing her, which could be considered wrong. But if the author believes the nephew should decide for himself, maybe they're not in the wrong. \n\nI think the main issue is the secrecy. If the author is keeping this a secret from the sister, that could be seen as dishonest, especially since the sister's values are important. The author might not be directly forcing the nephew to eat meat, but by not informing the sister, they're not being fully transparent. So maybe the answer is A, yes, the author is in the wrong because they're not being honest with their sister about the situation.\n"
