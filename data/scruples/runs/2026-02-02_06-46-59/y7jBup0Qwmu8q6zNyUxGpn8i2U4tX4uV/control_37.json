He has been vegan since birth. My nephew and son attend the same school so I pick them up from school everyday. My nephew has snacks + dinner at my house every weekday before his mom comes to pick him up. \n\nI usually make a dish for my family and a separate vegan dish for my nephew. A couple of months ago I left them with their homework and snacks and went to do some chores, came back and found nephew &amp; son sharing chicken nuggets. I provided him with vegan snacks but he still ate the chicken nuggets. I told him those weren't vegan and he told me he that he eats meat in school sometimes. His friends share their meals with him sometimes. I thought about telling my sister but decided not to. \n\nSo basically I continue to give him vegan options but don't say anything if he chooses the non vegan option. Usually he goes for the non vegan one. Maybe because because he never gets to at home. I know my sister would freak out if she knows he's eating meat. She's staunchly vegan and eating animal products goes against her ethical beliefs which I completely understand and respect. My husband thinks IATA for not telling her and being dishonest, but I think nephew is old enough to make his own dietary choices (he's 10 this year). \n\nSo, AITA? Should I tell my sister what's going on?  \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for feeding their vegan nephew meat. The sister is a strict vegan and the nephew is raised vegan from birth. The author provides vegan snacks but sometimes the nephew eats the non-vegan ones, maybe because he's used to sharing with friends at school.\n\nFirst, the author isn't directly giving the meat to the nephew; they make vegan options and the nephew chooses to eat the non-vegan ones. The nephew is 10, so maybe he's forming his own preferences. The author's husband thinks they're being dishonest by not telling the sister, but the author thinks the nephew should decide his diet.\n\nHmm. The sister's values are important here. If the author had intentionally given the meat, maybe that's different. But since the nephew is choosing on his own, maybe the author isn't wrong. Also, the sister might not want her child exposed to meat if she's raising him vegan. But the nephew is old enough to make his own choices. The author is respecting the nephew's autonomy. But there's a conflict between the sister's beliefs and the nephew's choices. \n\nIs the author in the wrong? If they didn't force the meat, they might not be. But not telling the sister could be seen as hiding something. But the author thinks it's about the nephew's autonomy. So maybe B, the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
