He has been vegan since birth. My nephew and son attend the same school so I pick them up from school everyday. My nephew has snacks + dinner at my house every weekday before his mom comes to pick him up. \n\nI usually make a dish for my family and a separate vegan dish for my nephew. A couple of months ago I left them with their homework and snacks and went to do some chores, came back and found nephew &amp; son sharing chicken nuggets. I provided him with vegan snacks but he still ate the chicken nuggets. I told him those weren't vegan and he told me he that he eats meat in school sometimes. His friends share their meals with him sometimes. I thought about telling my sister but decided not to. \n\nSo basically I continue to give him vegan options but don't say anything if he chooses the non vegan option. Usually he goes for the non vegan one. Maybe because because he never gets to at home. I know my sister would freak out if she knows he's eating meat. She's staunchly vegan and eating animal products goes against her ethical beliefs which I completely understand and respect. My husband thinks IATA for not telling her and being dishonest, but I think nephew is old enough to make his own dietary choices (he's 10 this year). \n\nSo, AITA? Should I tell my sister what's going on?  \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person in the AITA scenario is in the wrong. The situation involves a vegan sister whose son is also vegan, and the author (AITA) is feeding the nephew meat without telling the sister. The key points here are about respecting dietary choices and the age of the child.\n\nFirst, the sister is strictly vegan and raised her son that way. The nephew is 10 years old, so he's in a stage where he might be curious about trying different foods, especially if his friends share theirs. The author is providing vegan options but not stopping the nephew when he chooses the non-vegan food. The husband thinks the author is in the wrong for not telling the sister, while the author believes the nephew should make his own choices.\n\nI need to consider the ethical implications. The sister's beliefs are important, and she might feel betrayed if she found out. However, the nephew is old enough to make some choices, and the author isn't forcing him to eat the meat; he's choosing it. But the author is still providing non-vegan food in a situation where the parents have a strict dietary rule. There's a conflict between respecting the parents' wishes and the child's autonomy.\n\nIn some cases, parents set rules that others might not enforce, but there's a line when those rules are based on ethical or health reasons. The sister's veganism is ethical, so she might see the child eating meat as a violation. The author isn't lying but is omitting information, which could be seen as dishonesty. The child's choices are part of the issue, but the author's role is in not informing the parent. The answer might depend on whether not informing the sister is considered deceitful, even if the nephew is making his own choices.\n"
