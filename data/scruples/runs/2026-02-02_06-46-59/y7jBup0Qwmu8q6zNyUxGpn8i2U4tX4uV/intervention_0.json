He has been vegan since birth. My nephew and son attend the same school so I pick them up from school everyday. My nephew has snacks + dinner at my house every weekday before his mom comes to pick him up. \n\nI usually make a dish for my family and a separate vegan dish for my nephew. A couple of months ago I left them with their homework and snacks and went to do some chores, came back and found nephew &amp; son sharing chicken nuggets. I provided him with vegan snacks but he still ate the chicken nuggets. I told him those weren't vegan and he told me he that he eats meat in school sometimes. His friends share their meals with him sometimes. I thought about telling my sister but decided not to. \n\nSo basically I continue to give him vegan options but don't say anything if he chooses the non vegan option. Usually he goes for the non vegan one. Maybe because because he never gets to at home. I know my sister would freak out if she knows he's eating meat. She's staunchly vegan and eating animal products goes against her ethical beliefs which I completely understand and respect. My husband thinks IATA for not telling her and being dishonest, but I think nephew is old enough to make his own dietary choices (he's 10 this year). \n\nSo, AITA? Should I tell my sister what's going on?  \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user wants to know if the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong. The situation is about a parent who is vegan and raises their son vegan. The author, their sibling, feeds the nephew both vegan and non-vegan options, but when the nephew chooses the meat, the author doesn't correct them, even though they know the sister would be upset.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The nephew is 10 years old. The sister is strict about veganism, and the author is providing both types of food. The nephew is eating the meat, possibly influenced by friends. The author is not informing the sister, and the husband is upset about this. The main question is whether the author is at fault for not telling the sister and allowing the nephew to eat meat.\n\nFrom a rights and responsibilities perspective, the sister has the right to know what's happening with her child's diet, especially since she's raising him vegan. The author isn't directly forcing the meat on the nephew, but by not correcting him when he chooses the non-vegan option, they might be enabling a choice that the parent disagrees with. However, the nephew is old enough to make some decisions, but at 10, he's still a child, and his parents are responsible for his diet. \n\nOn the other hand, the author is respecting the sister's wishes by providing vegan options, but by not enforcing them strictly. The sister might have expectations that the author should ensure the nephew only eats vegan food when in their care. The author's decision not to inform the sister could be seen as a breach of trust, as the sister's beliefs are important to her. \n\nBut there's also the argument that the nephew is making his own choices, and the author isn't forcing the meat on him. The author is providing both options, which could be seen as respecting the child's autonomy. However, since the child's diet is a parental decision, the parent should be aware of any deviations. \n\nSo, the conflict is between respecting the parent's wishes and allowing the child some autonomy. The author's silence might be considered dishonesty if they knew the sister would be upset. However, the author isn't lying; they're just not informing her. It's a gray area. \n\nIn terms of ethics, the sister's ethical stance is about not eating animals. If the nephew is eating meat without her knowledge, that could be a violation of her values. The author's role as a caretaker might require them to uphold the parent's dietary rules unless they're given permission to allow flexibility. \n\nTherefore, the author might be in the wrong by not communicating with the sister about the nephew's choices, as it could be seen as undermining her parenting decisions.\n"
