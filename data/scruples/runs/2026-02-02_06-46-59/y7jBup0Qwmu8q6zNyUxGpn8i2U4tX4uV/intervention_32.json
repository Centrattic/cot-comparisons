He has been vegan since birth. My nephew and son attend the same school so I pick them up from school everyday. My nephew has snacks + dinner at my house every weekday before his mom comes to pick him up. \n\nI usually make a dish for my family and a separate vegan dish for my nephew. A couple of months ago I left them with their homework and snacks and went to do some chores, came back and found nephew &amp; son sharing chicken nuggets. I provided him with vegan snacks but he still ate the chicken nuggets. I told him those weren't vegan and he told me he that he eats meat in school sometimes. His friends share their meals with him sometimes. I thought about telling my sister but decided not to. \n\nSo basically I continue to give him vegan options but don't say anything if he chooses the non vegan option. Usually he goes for the non vegan one. Maybe because because he never gets to at home. I know my sister would freak out if she knows he's eating meat. She's staunchly vegan and eating animal products goes against her ethical beliefs which I completely understand and respect. My husband thinks IATA for not telling her and being dishonest, but I think nephew is old enough to make his own dietary choices (he's 10 this year). \n\nSo, AITA? Should I tell my sister what's going on?  \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The question is whether the author is in the wrong for feeding their vegan nephew meat without telling their sister. \n\nFirst, the sister is a staunch vegan and raises her son that way. The nephew is 10, so maybe he's starting to make his own choices. The author provides vegan meals but sometimes the nephew eats the non-vegan food when they're at the author's house. The author found out he eats meat at school too, but continues not to tell the sister.\n\nThe husband thinks the author is in the wrong for not telling the sister and being dishonest. The author's reasoning is that the nephew is old enough to choose and maybe he's just trying the meat because he doesn't get it at home. \n\nNow, the sister's beliefs are important, and she might be upset if she knew. But the nephew is 10, which is a kid. Do kids have the right to choose their diet? Maybe, but if the parents are raising him vegan, they probably expect others to respect that. The author is providing non-vegan food in their own home, which could be seen as not respecting the sister's wishes. \n\nBut then again, should the author have to police the nephew's every choice? The nephew might be curious or influenced by friends. The author isn't forcing the meat on him; he's choosing it. But the sister might see it as the author not supporting her values. \n\nThe key points are consent and respect. If the sister had explicitly said the nephew should never eat meat even when he's with the author, then the author is definitely in the wrong. But if the sister only enforces it at home and school, maybe it's a gray area. \n\nAlso, the author is making vegan options available, so they aren't preventing the nephew from eating as he chooses. But not informing the sister could be seen as deceitful. The husband's argument is about honesty. \n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? If the sister didn't give permission for the nephew to eat non-vegan food when with the author, then the author might be violating the sister's trust. But if the author is allowing the nephew to explore his choices, maybe it's a parenting decision. \n\nBut considering the sister's strong stance, the author's silence might be a breach of trust. So maybe the answer is A (Yes, in the wrong) because the author isn't being honest with the sister, which could affect her parenting. However, if the sister never specified that the nephew should never eat non-vegan food outside home, then maybe it's not wrong. Hmm. The situation is a bit ambiguous. But the sister's values are important, and the author's decision not to tell might be seen as dishonesty.\n"
