He has been vegan since birth. My nephew and son attend the same school so I pick them up from school everyday. My nephew has snacks + dinner at my house every weekday before his mom comes to pick him up. \n\nI usually make a dish for my family and a separate vegan dish for my nephew. A couple of months ago I left them with their homework and snacks and went to do some chores, came back and found nephew &amp; son sharing chicken nuggets. I provided him with vegan snacks but he still ate the chicken nuggets. I told him those weren't vegan and he told me he that he eats meat in school sometimes. His friends share their meals with him sometimes. I thought about telling my sister but decided not to. \n\nSo basically I continue to give him vegan options but don't say anything if he chooses the non vegan option. Usually he goes for the non vegan one. Maybe because because he never gets to at home. I know my sister would freak out if she knows he's eating meat. She's staunchly vegan and eating animal products goes against her ethical beliefs which I completely understand and respect. My husband thinks IATA for not telling her and being dishonest, but I think nephew is old enough to make his own dietary choices (he's 10 this year). \n\nSo, AITA? Should I tell my sister what's going on?  \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The person is asking if they're in the wrong for feeding their vegan nephew meat. The sister is a staunch vegan and raises her son on a vegan diet. The nephew is 10, so a child, and the author is in charge of him after school, providing snacks and dinner. They make vegan options but the nephew sometimes eats the non-vegan food.\n\nFirst, the sister's values are important here. She's been vegan for years and it's ethical for her. The author is respecting that by providing vegan options. But the nephew is choosing to eat the meat, maybe influenced by friends at school. The author didn't correct him when he ate the chicken nuggets, even though they knew it wasn't vegan. The husband thinks they're in the wrong for not telling the sister, but the author thinks the nephew is old enough to make his own choices.\n\nHmm. The key points are: the nephew is a minor, so his dietary choices are ultimately his parents' responsibility. The author is the caregiver but isn't the parent. However, the author is making decisions that go against the parent's explicit wishes. The sister might have trusted the author to adhere to the vegan diet. By allowing the nephew to eat meat, even if he's choosing it himself, the author might be undermining her parenting decisions. But the nephew is old enough to make his own choices\u2014maybe the author isn't supposed to enforce the vegan diet strictly. But since the sister is strict and would be upset, perhaps the author should inform her. Alternatively, maybe the nephew's autonomy is a factor here. \n\nOn one hand, the author isn't forcing the meat on the nephew; they're providing vegan options. The nephew is making his own choice. But the sister might expect the author to prevent him from eating meat, given the ethical stance. The author's decision not to inform the sister could be seen as hiding the truth, which might be dishonest. But they are respecting the nephew's autonomy. It's a balance between respecting the parent's wishes and the child's own choices. The author might be in a grey area here. \n\nLegally, the parents are responsible for the child's diet. If the parent has specified that the child should be vegan, then others who care for the child should follow those instructions. If the author is providing non-vegan food, they might be violating that trust. However, if the child is choosing to eat the non-vegan food, maybe the author isn't forcing it. But the author could have enforced the vegan options more strictly. The fact that the nephew is choosing non-vegan might mean the author isn't entirely at fault, but they also didn't correct his choice, which the sister might consider their responsibility. \n\nIn terms of ethics, if the sister is okay with the child choosing to eat meat sometimes, but the author is allowing it without her knowledge, then the author might be in the wrong. But if the author believes the child should have some autonomy, it's a different perspective. The answer might depend on whether the author is supposed to enforce the vegan diet as per the parent's wishes. If they are, then they're in the wrong. If not, then maybe not. But since the author provided vegan options and the child chose otherwise, maybe the author isn't responsible for the child's choice. However, the sister might still feel the author didn't do enough to enforce the vegan diet. It's a bit of a toss-up. I think the author is in the wrong because they should have followed the parent's instructions more strictly, even if the child made different choices. Allowing the child to eat non-vegan food without informing the parent could be seen as not respecting the parent's wishes.\n"
