He has been vegan since birth. My nephew and son attend the same school so I pick them up from school everyday. My nephew has snacks + dinner at my house every weekday before his mom comes to pick him up. \n\nI usually make a dish for my family and a separate vegan dish for my nephew. A couple of months ago I left them with their homework and snacks and went to do some chores, came back and found nephew &amp; son sharing chicken nuggets. I provided him with vegan snacks but he still ate the chicken nuggets. I told him those weren't vegan and he told me he that he eats meat in school sometimes. His friends share their meals with him sometimes. I thought about telling my sister but decided not to. \n\nSo basically I continue to give him vegan options but don't say anything if he chooses the non vegan option. Usually he goes for the non vegan one. Maybe because because he never gets to at home. I know my sister would freak out if she knows he's eating meat. She's staunchly vegan and eating animal products goes against her ethical beliefs which I completely understand and respect. My husband thinks IATA for not telling her and being dishonest, but I think nephew is old enough to make his own dietary choices (he's 10 this year). \n\nSo, AITA? Should I tell my sister what's going on?  \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of this AITA (Am I the Asshole) story is in the wrong. The situation is about a parent who's vegan and raises her son vegan, but the aunt (the author) sometimes feeds him non-vegan food without telling her sister, the mother.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The nephew is 10 years old, so a child but not a baby anymore. The aunt provides both vegan and non-vegan options, and the kid chooses the non-vegan ones. The sister is very strict about veganism and would be upset if she knew. The author's husband thinks she's being dishonest, but she believes the nephew is old enough to make his own choices.\n\nNow, considering the ethics here. The mother has chosen a vegan lifestyle for her child, which might be based on her values. The aunt is providing meat, which could conflict with the mother's beliefs. The child is at the aunt's house for meals, so the aunt is responsible for what he eats there. But the aunt isn't forcing him to eat meat; she's just making it available. The kid is old enough to understand the difference and makes a choice. \n\nIs the aunt being disrespectful to the mother's wishes? The mother expects her son to follow the vegan diet, especially since she's been doing it since birth. The aunt isn't hiding the fact that she offers meat, but she's not telling the mother either. So there's a lack of communication here. The aunt's husband is concerned about honesty, which is a valid point. \n\nThe child is probably curious about meat, especially if his friends share it at school. The aunt might be allowing him to explore his dietary preferences, which is a good thing for autonomy. However, the mother's values are important, and the aunt is keeping this information from her. \n\nI need to weigh the child's autonomy against the mother's wishes. If the aunt is not forcing the child but allowing him to choose, that's different from actively deceiving the mother. But still, the mother might not be aware of the situation and could feel that her parenting decisions are being undermined. \n\nThe question is whether the aunt is in the wrong. The mother's stance is clear, and the aunt is aware of this. By not informing the mother, she's withholding information that could be important to her. Even though the child is making his own choices, the mother might not have consented to this situation. \n\nSo, the aunt isn't forcing the child to eat meat, but she's not being transparent with the mother. That could be seen as dishonest. The answer could be A because the aunt is not being truthful with her sister, even if she respects her choices. Alternatively, B if the child's autonomy is the key factor here. \n\nBut I'm leaning towards A because the mother has the right to know what her child is eating when he's in the care of another family member. The aunt's choice to not tell her might be considered a breach of trust. The mother might not be aware that her child is being offered non-vegan options, and if she were, she might want to adjust her approach. \n\nAlso, the aunt is in a position of responsibility for the child's care during the day. Allowing the child to eat meat without informing the mother could be seen as going against the mother's wishes indirectly. The mother might feel that the aunt is not supporting her parenting decisions. \n\nSo, I think the author is in the wrong because she's not being honest with her sister about the situation, even if she's not forcing the child to eat meat. The mother has the right to know, and the aunt's silence could be seen as dishonesty.\n"
