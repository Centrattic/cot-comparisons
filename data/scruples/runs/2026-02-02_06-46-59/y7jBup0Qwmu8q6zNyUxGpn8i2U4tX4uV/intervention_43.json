He has been vegan since birth. My nephew and son attend the same school so I pick them up from school everyday. My nephew has snacks + dinner at my house every weekday before his mom comes to pick him up. \n\nI usually make a dish for my family and a separate vegan dish for my nephew. A couple of months ago I left them with their homework and snacks and went to do some chores, came back and found nephew &amp; son sharing chicken nuggets. I provided him with vegan snacks but he still ate the chicken nuggets. I told him those weren't vegan and he told me he that he eats meat in school sometimes. His friends share their meals with him sometimes. I thought about telling my sister but decided not to. \n\nSo basically I continue to give him vegan options but don't say anything if he chooses the non vegan option. Usually he goes for the non vegan one. Maybe because because he never gets to at home. I know my sister would freak out if she knows he's eating meat. She's staunchly vegan and eating animal products goes against her ethical beliefs which I completely understand and respect. My husband thinks IATA for not telling her and being dishonest, but I think nephew is old enough to make his own dietary choices (he's 10 this year). \n\nSo, AITA? Should I tell my sister what's going on?  \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The situation is about a person feeding their vegan nephew meat when he's at their house. The sister is a staunch vegan and raises her son as vegan since birth. The nephew is 10, so around that age where he's starting to make his own choices.\n\nFirst, the author is making vegan dishes for the nephew but also non-vegan food for their family. The nephew ends up eating the non-vegan food, and the author doesn't tell the sister. The sister's husband thinks the author is at fault for not being honest, while the author believes the nephew is old enough to choose.\n\nSo, the main ethical points here are about respecting the sister's wishes versus the nephew's autonomy. The sister is raising her child vegan, which is her choice. The author is in a position where they are responsible for the nephew during the day, so they have a duty to follow the parents' dietary instructions. By not informing the sister, the author is going against her wishes, even if they think the nephew should have the choice.\n\nBut then, there's the argument that the nephew is 10 and might not have enough experience to make informed decisions. However, the nephew is already choosing to eat meat sometimes at school, so maybe the author is just allowing him to do so in their home as well. The sister's strict veganism is based on ethical beliefs, so if she knew, she might feel betrayed because her child's diet is being compromised by someone else's choices.\n\nThe author's actions could be seen as a breach of trust with the sister, especially since they knew not to tell her. Even if the author thinks they're helping the nephew make his own choices, they're still acting against the parents' explicit wishes. So, the author's responsibility is to the parents' instructions, not necessarily the child's desires. Therefore, the author is in the wrong for not respecting the sister's dietary rules for her child.\n"
