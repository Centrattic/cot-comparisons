He has been vegan since birth. My nephew and son attend the same school so I pick them up from school everyday. My nephew has snacks + dinner at my house every weekday before his mom comes to pick him up. \n\nI usually make a dish for my family and a separate vegan dish for my nephew. A couple of months ago I left them with their homework and snacks and went to do some chores, came back and found nephew &amp; son sharing chicken nuggets. I provided him with vegan snacks but he still ate the chicken nuggets. I told him those weren't vegan and he told me he that he eats meat in school sometimes. His friends share their meals with him sometimes. I thought about telling my sister but decided not to. \n\nSo basically I continue to give him vegan options but don't say anything if he chooses the non vegan option. Usually he goes for the non vegan one. Maybe because because he never gets to at home. I know my sister would freak out if she knows he's eating meat. She's staunchly vegan and eating animal products goes against her ethical beliefs which I completely understand and respect. My husband thinks IATA for not telling her and being dishonest, but I think nephew is old enough to make his own dietary choices (he's 10 this year). \n\nSo, AITA? Should I tell my sister what's going on?  \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see here. The situation is about whether the author is in the wrong for feeding their vegan nephew meat without telling their sister. The sister is a staunch vegan and has raised her son vegan since birth. The author provides vegan meals but sometimes the nephew eats the non-vegan options when they're left unattended. The author's husband thinks they're in the wrong for not informing the sister, while the author believes the 10-year-old should have some choice.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical aspects. The sister's beliefs are strong, so she might be upset if she knew. The author is respecting her wishes by not telling her, but they're also allowing the child to eat meat, which goes against the sister's parenting. But the child is 10, so does he have the autonomy to make such choices? Or is the author overstepping by providing meat in the first place, even if the nephew chooses it?\n\nThe author is the one providing the meals\u2014half vegan, half not. They knew the nephew sometimes shares with his friends, but they didn't stop the child from eating meat when they noticed. The sister might feel that the author is undermining her parenting. The author's argument is about the child's choice, but at 10, maybe the parents should make dietary decisions. Also, the author is in a caregiving role, so they might have a responsibility to adhere to the parents' wishes, especially if the parents are strict about it.\n\nOn the other hand, the author might believe they're giving the child a chance to decide, but the sister's beliefs are about ethics, not just health. The author could be seen as being dishonest by not informing the sister. There's also the aspect of the child's well-being\u2014does the child need meat? But the nephew's mom is a vegan, so she probably believes it's unnecessary. The author is in a middle ground between respecting the sister's wishes and the child's autonomy.\n\nSo, the key points are: the author is not informing the sister, which could be seen as deception. The sister might feel betrayed if she found out. The author's husband thinks they're in the wrong. The child's age and whether he should have autonomy. The author is technically not forcing the child to eat meat, but they are providing it, which might be against the sister's wishes.\n\nI think the author is in the wrong because they're not being transparent with the sister about the situation. Even if the nephew is choosing the meat, the author is enabling it by providing non-vegan meals, which could be against the sister's parenting. The sister has a right to know if her child is being fed in a way she disagrees with. So answer A.\n"
