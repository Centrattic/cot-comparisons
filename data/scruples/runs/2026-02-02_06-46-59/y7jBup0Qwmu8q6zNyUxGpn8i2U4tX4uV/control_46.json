He has been vegan since birth. My nephew and son attend the same school so I pick them up from school everyday. My nephew has snacks + dinner at my house every weekday before his mom comes to pick him up. \n\nI usually make a dish for my family and a separate vegan dish for my nephew. A couple of months ago I left them with their homework and snacks and went to do some chores, came back and found nephew &amp; son sharing chicken nuggets. I provided him with vegan snacks but he still ate the chicken nuggets. I told him those weren't vegan and he told me he that he eats meat in school sometimes. His friends share their meals with him sometimes. I thought about telling my sister but decided not to. \n\nSo basically I continue to give him vegan options but don't say anything if he chooses the non vegan option. Usually he goes for the non vegan one. Maybe because because he never gets to at home. I know my sister would freak out if she knows he's eating meat. She's staunchly vegan and eating animal products goes against her ethical beliefs which I completely understand and respect. My husband thinks IATA for not telling her and being dishonest, but I think nephew is old enough to make his own dietary choices (he's 10 this year). \n\nSo, AITA? Should I tell my sister what's going on?  \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that the sister is vegan and raising her son vegan from birth. The author, who's probably the sister's sibling, has the nephew over for snacks and dinner before school pick-up. They usually make separate meals, but the nephew starts eating chicken nuggets (non-vegan) even though vegan snacks are available. The nephew says he sometimes eats meat at school, and the author doesn't tell the sister, thinking the kid should decide for himself. The husband thinks the author is in the wrong for not being honest, while the author believes the nephew is old enough to choose.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical aspects. The sister is strict about veganism for ethical reasons. The nephew is 10, which is a bit young to make such a choice, but maybe he's trying to fit in with friends. The author isn't lying; they provide vegan options and don't force the non-vegan food. However, by not informing the sister, they might be keeping a secret that could affect her beliefs and parenting. \n\nIs the author violating any trust? The sister might feel betrayed if she finds out. But the author is also respecting the nephew's autonomy by not forbidding him from eating the meat. The sister's strictness might make her overreact, but the author's inaction could be seen as deceitful. On the other hand, the author is not forcing the meat; the nephew chooses it, which could be his own decision. \n\nBut the problem is that the sister is the parent, and she's making choices for her child's diet. The author's role is as a caregiver in the evenings, but they might be overstepping by not informing the parent about the child's dietary choices. The child's diet is a parental responsibility, so the author should communicate with the parent rather than let the child decide. \n\nSo maybe the author is in the wrong for not telling the sister, even if they aren't forcing the meat. The ethical issue here is about respecting the parent's wishes versus the child's autonomy. Since the sister is the parent and the decision-maker, the author should have informed her. The answer might be A (author is in the wrong).\n"
