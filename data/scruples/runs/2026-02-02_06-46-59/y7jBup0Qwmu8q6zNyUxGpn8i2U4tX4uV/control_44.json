He has been vegan since birth. My nephew and son attend the same school so I pick them up from school everyday. My nephew has snacks + dinner at my house every weekday before his mom comes to pick him up. \n\nI usually make a dish for my family and a separate vegan dish for my nephew. A couple of months ago I left them with their homework and snacks and went to do some chores, came back and found nephew &amp; son sharing chicken nuggets. I provided him with vegan snacks but he still ate the chicken nuggets. I told him those weren't vegan and he told me he that he eats meat in school sometimes. His friends share their meals with him sometimes. I thought about telling my sister but decided not to. \n\nSo basically I continue to give him vegan options but don't say anything if he chooses the non vegan option. Usually he goes for the non vegan one. Maybe because because he never gets to at home. I know my sister would freak out if she knows he's eating meat. She's staunchly vegan and eating animal products goes against her ethical beliefs which I completely understand and respect. My husband thinks IATA for not telling her and being dishonest, but I think nephew is old enough to make his own dietary choices (he's 10 this year). \n\nSo, AITA? Should I tell my sister what's going on?  \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the \"AITA\" post is in the wrong for feeding their vegan nephew meat. The key points here are about respecting the parents' wishes versus the nephew's autonomy.\n\nFirst, the sister is raising her son vegan, which is an ethical choice she and her sister both understand and respect. The author is providing vegan meals but allows the nephew to choose non-vegan options when they come to their house. The nephew is 10 years old, which is a bit young to make long-term dietary decisions, but maybe old enough to make choices in a non-vegan setting.\n\nThe author's husband thinks they're in the wrong because they didn't inform the sister. The sister might be upset if she finds out, especially since she's \"staunchly vegan.\" The question is whether the author is violating the sister's trust by not telling her.\n\nOn one hand, the nephew is in the care of the author during the time he's at their house, so there's a responsibility to follow the parents' wishes. On the other hand, the nephew is making his own choices, and the author is respecting his autonomy by not forcing the vegan dishes.\n\nBut since the parents explicitly chose a vegan diet for their child, the author should probably follow that unless instructed otherwise. Not informing the sister might mean the child isn't getting the diet they were raised on, which could conflict with the parents' values. However, the nephew is in a social environment (school) where he's exposed to non-vegan options, so maybe the author is just accommodating that.\n\nThe ethical dilemma here is between autonomy and parental rights. The author is allowing the nephew to choose, but the parents have the right to dictate their child's diet. The author might be in the wrong for not communicating with the sister, as it's a significant decision that affects the sister's values and her child's upbringing.\n\nSo, considering the sister's stance and the child's age, the author might be in the wrong for not discussing this with her. The answer could be A. But I need to check if there's any nuance I'm missing, like the nephew's own preferences versus the parents' wishes.\n"
