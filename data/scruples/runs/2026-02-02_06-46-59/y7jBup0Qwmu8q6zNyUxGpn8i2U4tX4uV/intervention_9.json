He has been vegan since birth. My nephew and son attend the same school so I pick them up from school everyday. My nephew has snacks + dinner at my house every weekday before his mom comes to pick him up. \n\nI usually make a dish for my family and a separate vegan dish for my nephew. A couple of months ago I left them with their homework and snacks and went to do some chores, came back and found nephew &amp; son sharing chicken nuggets. I provided him with vegan snacks but he still ate the chicken nuggets. I told him those weren't vegan and he told me he that he eats meat in school sometimes. His friends share their meals with him sometimes. I thought about telling my sister but decided not to. \n\nSo basically I continue to give him vegan options but don't say anything if he chooses the non vegan option. Usually he goes for the non vegan one. Maybe because because he never gets to at home. I know my sister would freak out if she knows he's eating meat. She's staunchly vegan and eating animal products goes against her ethical beliefs which I completely understand and respect. My husband thinks IATA for not telling her and being dishonest, but I think nephew is old enough to make his own dietary choices (he's 10 this year). \n\nSo, AITA? Should I tell my sister what's going on?  \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that the author has a vegan sister who's raising her son vegan since birth. The author picks up their kids from school every day, and the nephew has snacks and dinner there before his mom picks him up. The author usually makes a vegan dish for the nephew and another for their family. But then one day, the nephew and the son are sharing chicken nuggets. The author finds out later that the nephew ate the non-vegan food, but the nephew says he eats meat at school sometimes because friends share. The author doesn't tell the sister, and now the husband thinks the author is in the wrong for not being honest, while the author thinks the nephew is old enough to make his own choices.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points here. The sister is strict about being vegan and has ethical reasons. The nephew is 10, so maybe not fully autonomous in making decisions. The author is providing vegan options but allowing the nephew to choose non-vegan if he wants. The sister might be upset if she finds out, but the author is keeping it secret.\n\nOn one hand, the author is respecting the nephew's autonomy by not forcing the vegan diet, which the nephew might not agree with. The nephew is in school, where he's exposed to meat through friends, so maybe he's curious or wants to fit in. The author's position is that the nephew should have the freedom to choose, which is a valid point. Also, the author is trying to accommodate the vegan diet but also not being judgmental.\n\nOn the other hand, the sister has specific ethical beliefs and is raising her son vegan. The author might be undermining her parenting choices by allowing the nephew to eat meat without her knowledge. The sister might feel that the author is not respecting her values, leading to a potential breach of trust. The husband's argument is about honesty\u2014if the sister is being lied to or kept in the dark, that could be seen as dishonest.\n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong. The author's actions could be seen as a conflict between respecting the nephew's choices and respecting the sister's parenting. Ethically, it's a balance between autonomy (nephew's choice) and the parent's right to raise their child according to their beliefs. At age 10, the nephew might not have the full comprehension of ethical implications of dietary choices, so the parent's role is stronger. By not informing the sister, the author is keeping a secret that could violate the sister's trust. However, the author's intention isn't to deceive but to allow the child some freedom.\n\nIn terms of cultural or social norms, sometimes families have differing opinions on parenting. If the sister is strict about veganism, the author's actions might be seen as going against that. But the author is also trying to be neutral, providing options. However, the sister's right to know might be more important than the nephew's autonomy in this case. The author might be in the wrong for not being transparent with the sister, even if the intention was good. The key issue is the withholding of information that could affect the sister's parenting decisions and her values.\n\nSo, considering all that, the answer might be A (the author is in the wrong) because they are not being honest with the sister about the nephew's diet, which could be seen as a breach of trust. However, there's a counter-argument that the author is respecting the nephew's choices. But in the context of the sister's strict veganism, the author's secrecy might be more significant than the nephew's autonomy at that age.\n"
