He has been vegan since birth. My nephew and son attend the same school so I pick them up from school everyday. My nephew has snacks + dinner at my house every weekday before his mom comes to pick him up. \n\nI usually make a dish for my family and a separate vegan dish for my nephew. A couple of months ago I left them with their homework and snacks and went to do some chores, came back and found nephew &amp; son sharing chicken nuggets. I provided him with vegan snacks but he still ate the chicken nuggets. I told him those weren't vegan and he told me he that he eats meat in school sometimes. His friends share their meals with him sometimes. I thought about telling my sister but decided not to. \n\nSo basically I continue to give him vegan options but don't say anything if he chooses the non vegan option. Usually he goes for the non vegan one. Maybe because because he never gets to at home. I know my sister would freak out if she knows he's eating meat. She's staunchly vegan and eating animal products goes against her ethical beliefs which I completely understand and respect. My husband thinks IATA for not telling her and being dishonest, but I think nephew is old enough to make his own dietary choices (he's 10 this year). \n\nSo, AITA? Should I tell my sister what's going on?  \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of the AITA post is in the wrong for feeding their vegan nephew meat. The sister is raising her son vegan since birth, and the author sometimes gives him non-vegan options. The nephew has been eating the meat, like chicken nuggets, even though there are vegan snacks available. The author hasn't told the sister yet, and the husband thinks they're wrong for not telling her. The nephew is 10 now.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical aspects here. The sister's beliefs are important; she's been vegan for years and it's a core value for her. The author is respecting her choice by providing vegan options but also allowing the nephew to choose meat, which might go against the sister's wishes. \n\nBut then, there's the child's autonomy. At 10, is he old enough to make his own dietary choices? The author thinks so, and maybe the child is influenced by his friends at school. However, the parents (the sister) have the authority to decide their child's diet, especially since they're his legal guardians. By not informing them, the author might be undermining the parents' decisions, even if they're strict. \n\nAlso, the author's husband is concerned about honesty. If the sister found out, she might be upset not just because the child is eating meat, but because the author didn't inform her. There's a trust issue here. Even if the author respects the sister's beliefs, not telling her could be seen as deceitful, especially if the sister is \"staunchly vegan\" and would \"freak out.\"\n\nOn the other hand, the author is trying to be respectful by providing vegan options, which shows they're aware of the sister's preferences. The nephew choosing meat on his own might be a natural curiosity or social influence. But the author's role as a caregiver (picking up the kids) comes with responsibility to follow the parents' guidelines unless instructed otherwise. \n\nSo, the key points are: the parents' rights to decide their child's diet, the potential breach of trust by not informing the sister, and the balance between respecting parental wishes and allowing a child's autonomy. The sister might feel that the author is not supporting her parenting choices, which could strain their relationship. \n\nTherefore, the author might be in the wrong because they're not adhering to the parents' dietary instructions for their child, even if they're providing the correct options. The fact that the nephew is choosing non-vegan food isn't the author's fault, but by not informing the parents, they're not upholding the trust and could be seen as complicit in the child not following the vegan diet.\n"
