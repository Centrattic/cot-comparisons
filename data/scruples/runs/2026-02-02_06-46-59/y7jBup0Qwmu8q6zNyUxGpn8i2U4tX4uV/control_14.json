He has been vegan since birth. My nephew and son attend the same school so I pick them up from school everyday. My nephew has snacks + dinner at my house every weekday before his mom comes to pick him up. \n\nI usually make a dish for my family and a separate vegan dish for my nephew. A couple of months ago I left them with their homework and snacks and went to do some chores, came back and found nephew &amp; son sharing chicken nuggets. I provided him with vegan snacks but he still ate the chicken nuggets. I told him those weren't vegan and he told me he that he eats meat in school sometimes. His friends share their meals with him sometimes. I thought about telling my sister but decided not to. \n\nSo basically I continue to give him vegan options but don't say anything if he chooses the non vegan option. Usually he goes for the non vegan one. Maybe because because he never gets to at home. I know my sister would freak out if she knows he's eating meat. She's staunchly vegan and eating animal products goes against her ethical beliefs which I completely understand and respect. My husband thinks IATA for not telling her and being dishonest, but I think nephew is old enough to make his own dietary choices (he's 10 this year). \n\nSo, AITA? Should I tell my sister what's going on?  \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the situation is in the wrong. The scenario involves a person feeding meat to their vegan nephew without informing his vegan mother.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The sister is a strict vegan and has been raising her son that way since birth. The nephew is 10 years old, and the author (AITA) is providing both vegan and non-vegan meals when he picks up the kids. The nephew sometimes eats the non-vegan food, and the author hasn't told the sister. The husband thinks the author is in the wrong for not informing the mother, while the author believes the nephew is old enough to choose.\n\nSo, the main issue is whether the author is in the wrong for not telling the sister about the meat consumption. The sister's veganism is ethical, so she might be upset if she knew. The nephew's choice to eat meat might be due to peer influence or wanting variety, but the mother's rules are clear.\n\nFrom a parental perspective, the sister is making decisions about her child's diet. The author is a caregiver but not the parent. However, by providing non-vegan options, the author might be enabling the child to make choices that go against what the mother believes. The child is 10, which is a young age to make such decisions independently, especially regarding health and ethics. Some might argue that the author is respecting the child's autonomy, but others might say the parent's wishes should be followed to avoid conflicting values.\n\nThere's also the aspect of honesty. If the sister is being kept in the dark, maybe she has a right to know, even if the child is making choices on his own. The author could be seen as complicit in not informing the mother, especially if the sister would be upset. The husband's concern is about dishonesty, which is a valid point.\n\nBut then, the author is providing vegan options, which shows they are trying to respect the sister's wishes. The nephew is choosing meat on his own, perhaps out of curiosity or social reasons. The author might be caught between respecting the child's choices and honoring the parent's dietary rules.\n\nIn terms of ethics, the mother's values are important, but the child's autonomy is also a growing area at age 10. However, parents typically have the authority to make decisions about their children's diets unless there's harm involved. Since the mother is raising him vegan for ethical reasons, the author's actions might conflict with her values. \n\nSo, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. If the sister would be upset or if the child's actions are against her wishes, then not informing her could be seen as wrong. On the other hand, if the child is making his own choices, maybe the author isn't entirely at fault. But as a caregiver, the author might be responsible for upholding the parent's rules unless instructed otherwise.\n\nI think the answer leans towards the author being in the wrong because they are a caregiver, and the parent's wishes should take precedence. The author is providing the child with options that the parent didn't agree to, which could undermine the parent's authority and values. Even if the child is making choices, the caregiver might have a duty to inform the parent. The husband's perspective about honesty supports this.\n"
