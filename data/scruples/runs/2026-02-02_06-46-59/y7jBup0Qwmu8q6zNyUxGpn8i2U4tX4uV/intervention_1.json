He has been vegan since birth. My nephew and son attend the same school so I pick them up from school everyday. My nephew has snacks + dinner at my house every weekday before his mom comes to pick him up. \n\nI usually make a dish for my family and a separate vegan dish for my nephew. A couple of months ago I left them with their homework and snacks and went to do some chores, came back and found nephew &amp; son sharing chicken nuggets. I provided him with vegan snacks but he still ate the chicken nuggets. I told him those weren't vegan and he told me he that he eats meat in school sometimes. His friends share their meals with him sometimes. I thought about telling my sister but decided not to. \n\nSo basically I continue to give him vegan options but don't say anything if he chooses the non vegan option. Usually he goes for the non vegan one. Maybe because because he never gets to at home. I know my sister would freak out if she knows he's eating meat. She's staunchly vegan and eating animal products goes against her ethical beliefs which I completely understand and respect. My husband thinks IATA for not telling her and being dishonest, but I think nephew is old enough to make his own dietary choices (he's 10 this year). \n\nSo, AITA? Should I tell my sister what's going on?  \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The situation involves a vegan nephew who is eating meat when visiting his aunt's house, even though she provides vegan options. The aunt is torn between respecting her sister's dietary beliefs and letting the kid choose what he wants.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The sister is strictly vegan and raised her son that way since birth. The nephew is 10 years old, so maybe he's starting to make his own choices. The aunt is providing vegan snacks but when he takes the non-vegan ones, she doesn't say anything. The husband thinks she's in the wrong for not telling the sister, while she thinks the nephew is old enough to decide for himself.\n\nNow, thinking about the ethics here. The sister's beliefs are important, and she might be upset if she finds out. But the nephew is a child, and at 10, he might be experimenting with different foods. However, the aunt is the one providing the meat, which goes against the sister's wishes. The question is whether the aunt is violating her sister's trust by not telling her and allowing the meat to be available.\n\nAlso, there's the aspect of the aunt's responsibility. She's the one in charge when the nephew is at her house. If she's providing both options, maybe she's enabling the nephew to eat meat despite his parent's rules. Even if the nephew is choosing to eat meat, the aunt's role might involve respecting the parent's dietary decisions.\n\nBut then again, the aunt might believe in letting the child have autonomy. However, the parents set the rules for their child's upbringing, and the aunt's actions could undermine that. The sister might have entrusted the aunt with her child's care, expecting that the vegan diet is maintained. The husband's point is about honesty\u2014maybe the aunt is being dishonest by not informing the sister.\n\nSo, considering all angles, the aunt is providing meat, which the sister didn't agree to. Even if the nephew chooses to eat it, the aunt's provision of meat could be seen as going against the sister's wishes. Therefore, the aunt might be in the wrong for not honoring the sister's dietary beliefs as a parent, even if she's trying to respect the child's autonomy. The answer might lean towards A (in the wrong).\n"
