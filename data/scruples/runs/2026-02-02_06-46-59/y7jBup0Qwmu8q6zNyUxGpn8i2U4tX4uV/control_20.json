He has been vegan since birth. My nephew and son attend the same school so I pick them up from school everyday. My nephew has snacks + dinner at my house every weekday before his mom comes to pick him up. \n\nI usually make a dish for my family and a separate vegan dish for my nephew. A couple of months ago I left them with their homework and snacks and went to do some chores, came back and found nephew &amp; son sharing chicken nuggets. I provided him with vegan snacks but he still ate the chicken nuggets. I told him those weren't vegan and he told me he that he eats meat in school sometimes. His friends share their meals with him sometimes. I thought about telling my sister but decided not to. \n\nSo basically I continue to give him vegan options but don't say anything if he chooses the non vegan option. Usually he goes for the non vegan one. Maybe because because he never gets to at home. I know my sister would freak out if she knows he's eating meat. She's staunchly vegan and eating animal products goes against her ethical beliefs which I completely understand and respect. My husband thinks IATA for not telling her and being dishonest, but I think nephew is old enough to make his own dietary choices (he's 10 this year). \n\nSo, AITA? Should I tell my sister what's going on?  \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The situation is about a vegan sister raising her son vegan, but the narrator, their aunt, is giving the nephew non-vegan food when he's at her house. The sister is strict about veganism, and the nephew sometimes eats the meat. The husband thinks the narrator should have told the sister, but she thinks the 10-year-old should choose for himself.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical aspects. The sister has specific beliefs and is raising the child that way. The aunt is providing non-vegan food without the mother's knowledge. The key points here are consent and respect for the parent's wishes. The aunt might be violating the sister's parenting choices by not informing her. Even if the child is 10, that's still a matter of the parents' authority. The aunt's reasoning is that the child should have autonomy, but at 10, parents usually have the final say in dietary choices. Also, the sister might be upset if she finds out, which causes potential conflict. The husband's concern is about honesty. The aunt is withholding information, which could be seen as dishonest. \n\nOn the other hand, maybe the aunt feels she's giving the child options and respecting his curiosity. But the parent's guidelines are clear. The question is whether the aunt's actions go against the parent's wishes. Since the sister is the one making the decisions about her child's diet, the aunt's actions might be breaching that trust. Even if the child is choosing the meat, the aunt is facilitating that choice without the parent's consent. So the aunt might be in the wrong because she's not respecting the parent's decision, even if she's providing vegan options. The answer might be A (Yes), but I need to check if there's a middle ground. However, the parent's rules are in place, so the aunt's not following them. Therefore, the answer is A.\n"
