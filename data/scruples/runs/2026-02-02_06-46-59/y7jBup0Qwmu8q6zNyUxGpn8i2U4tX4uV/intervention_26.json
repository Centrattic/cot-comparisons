He has been vegan since birth. My nephew and son attend the same school so I pick them up from school everyday. My nephew has snacks + dinner at my house every weekday before his mom comes to pick him up. \n\nI usually make a dish for my family and a separate vegan dish for my nephew. A couple of months ago I left them with their homework and snacks and went to do some chores, came back and found nephew &amp; son sharing chicken nuggets. I provided him with vegan snacks but he still ate the chicken nuggets. I told him those weren't vegan and he told me he that he eats meat in school sometimes. His friends share their meals with him sometimes. I thought about telling my sister but decided not to. \n\nSo basically I continue to give him vegan options but don't say anything if he chooses the non vegan option. Usually he goes for the non vegan one. Maybe because because he never gets to at home. I know my sister would freak out if she knows he's eating meat. She's staunchly vegan and eating animal products goes against her ethical beliefs which I completely understand and respect. My husband thinks IATA for not telling her and being dishonest, but I think nephew is old enough to make his own dietary choices (he's 10 this year). \n\nSo, AITA? Should I tell my sister what's going on?  \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) story is in the wrong for feeding their vegan nephew meat.\n\nFirst, the key points: The sister is vegan and raises her son as such. The nephew is 10, in school with the author's son. The author provides vegan meals but sometimes the nephew eats non-vegan options like chicken nuggets. The nephew even says he eats meat at school sometimes. The author's husband thinks they're in the wrong for not telling the sister. The author thinks the nephew is old enough to make his own choices.\n\nSo, the main issue is whether feeding the nephew non-vegan food violates the sister's wishes and ethical beliefs. The sister is \"staunchly vegan,\" which implies that she has strong ethical reasons. The nephew is 10, which is a child, so his dietary choices are typically guided by his parents. By giving him non-vegan options, the author might be undermining the sister's parenting decisions. \n\nBut the nephew is choosing to eat the meat on his own, right? The author doesn't force him; he picks the non-vegan option. The author says they make separate vegan dishes, but the nephew still goes for the meat. However, the sister's rules are that her son is vegan, so the author might be enabling him to break those rules. \n\nThe question is about whether the author is in the wrong. If the sister is aware that the nephew sometimes eats meat at school, maybe she's already okay with that. But the author's home is a controlled environment where the sister expects the vegan diet to be followed. The author isn't enforcing the vegan diet, which could be seen as not respecting the sister's wishes. \n\nBut the nephew is old enough to make choices, according to the author. However, a 10-year-old's dietary choices are usually under parental control. The sister is the parent, so the author's actions might be interfering with that parent's decisions. \n\nOn the other hand, the author isn't forcing the meat on the nephew; he's choosing it himself. The author could argue that they're providing options, and the child is making his own choice. But the sister might see this as the author not upholding her strict vegan rules. \n\nThe husband's perspective is that the author is being dishonest by not telling the sister. The sister has the right to know if her child is being fed non-vegan food, especially if it's against her ethical beliefs. \n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? If the sister's rules are about the child's diet, then the author is violating those rules by allowing the nephew to eat meat. Even if the nephew chooses it himself, the author is the one providing the non-vegan food, which could be seen as complicit in not enforcing the sister's wishes. \n\nTherefore, the answer would be A, the author is in the wrong. They should inform the sister about the situation to respect her parenting choices and ethical beliefs.\n"
