He has been vegan since birth. My nephew and son attend the same school so I pick them up from school everyday. My nephew has snacks + dinner at my house every weekday before his mom comes to pick him up. \n\nI usually make a dish for my family and a separate vegan dish for my nephew. A couple of months ago I left them with their homework and snacks and went to do some chores, came back and found nephew &amp; son sharing chicken nuggets. I provided him with vegan snacks but he still ate the chicken nuggets. I told him those weren't vegan and he told me he that he eats meat in school sometimes. His friends share their meals with him sometimes. I thought about telling my sister but decided not to. \n\nSo basically I continue to give him vegan options but don't say anything if he chooses the non vegan option. Usually he goes for the non vegan one. Maybe because because he never gets to at home. I know my sister would freak out if she knows he's eating meat. She's staunchly vegan and eating animal products goes against her ethical beliefs which I completely understand and respect. My husband thinks IATA for not telling her and being dishonest, but I think nephew is old enough to make his own dietary choices (he's 10 this year). \n\nSo, AITA? Should I tell my sister what's going on?  \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for feeding their vegan nephew meat. The sister is raising the nephew vegan, and the author provides vegan meals but the nephew sometimes eats the non-vegan ones. The author didn't tell the sister yet.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the sister's values. She's been vegan for years and strictly raises her son that way. Her ethical beliefs are important here. The nephew is 10, so maybe he's starting to make his own choices. But the parents are the ones who made the decision for his diet. \n\nThe author is following the parents' wishes by providing vegan meals. However, the nephew is choosing the non-vegan options when left alone. The author's husband thinks it's wrong not to inform the sister, but the author thinks the kid should have autonomy.\n\nSo, the main issue is about respecting the parents' wishes versus the child's autonomy. Legally, parents have the authority over their children's diet. The author is technically following the parents' instructions by offering vegan food. However, if the nephew is eating the non-vegan food, the author is enabling that by not stopping him. \n\nBut does the author have the right to override the parents' decision? The parents might not be aware that the child is eating meat when they're not there. The author is in a position of trust, so maybe they should inform the parents. However, the nephew might be experimenting, and the parents might want to handle it themselves. \n\nOn the other hand, the nephew is old enough to make choices, but at 10, he's still a minor, and his parents make those decisions. The author's actions could be seen as undermining the parents' authority. But the author isn't forcing him to eat the meat; they're just not stopping him. \n\nI think the key point is the author's responsibility to the parents. If the parents gave clear instructions to provide vegan meals, then allowing the child to eat non-vegan food without their knowledge might be a breach of trust. The author should probably tell the sister to be honest, even if it's uncomfortable. So the author is in the wrong by not informing the parents about the situation. Answer A.\n"
