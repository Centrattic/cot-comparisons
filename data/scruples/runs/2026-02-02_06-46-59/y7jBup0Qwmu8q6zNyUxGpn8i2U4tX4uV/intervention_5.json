He has been vegan since birth. My nephew and son attend the same school so I pick them up from school everyday. My nephew has snacks + dinner at my house every weekday before his mom comes to pick him up. \n\nI usually make a dish for my family and a separate vegan dish for my nephew. A couple of months ago I left them with their homework and snacks and went to do some chores, came back and found nephew &amp; son sharing chicken nuggets. I provided him with vegan snacks but he still ate the chicken nuggets. I told him those weren't vegan and he told me he that he eats meat in school sometimes. His friends share their meals with him sometimes. I thought about telling my sister but decided not to. \n\nSo basically I continue to give him vegan options but don't say anything if he chooses the non vegan option. Usually he goes for the non vegan one. Maybe because because he never gets to at home. I know my sister would freak out if she knows he's eating meat. She's staunchly vegan and eating animal products goes against her ethical beliefs which I completely understand and respect. My husband thinks IATA for not telling her and being dishonest, but I think nephew is old enough to make his own dietary choices (he's 10 this year). \n\nSo, AITA? Should I tell my sister what's going on?  \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is that the author's vegan sister is raising her son vegan since birth. The nephew spends time at the author's house after school, and the author usually provides vegan meals. But the nephew sometimes eats the non-vegan food, like chicken nuggets, that the author's son has. The author knows the sister would be upset if she found out, but they're not telling her because they think the nephew is old enough to make his own choices.\n\nHmm. The sister is strict about veganism, and the author is intentionally not informing her about the nephew eating meat. The author's husband thinks they should tell her, but the author thinks it's the nephew's choice since he's 10. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical aspects. The sister's beliefs are important to her, and she's making deliberate choices for her son. If the nephew is eating meat outside of their home, that might conflict with her values. But the nephew is 10, which is an age where kids can start making some choices on their own, albeit with guidance. However, he's still a child, and parents usually have the final say in their child's diet, especially when it's based on ethical or health reasons.\n\nThe author's role here is a bit tricky. They're providing vegan options but not preventing the nephew from eating non-vegan food. The question is whether this is respecting the sister's wishes or not. If the sister entrusted her son to the author's care, the author might have an obligation to adhere to the sister's dietary rules. But the nephew is choosing on his own, so maybe the author isn't forcing him. However, by not informing the sister, the author is hiding the child's behavior, which could be seen as deceitful. The sister might feel that the author is undermining her parenting choices.\n\nAnother angle: the nephew is in a school setting where he's exposed to meat, and his friends share it with him. The sister might be aware of that to some extent, but if the author's home is a place where meat is available and the nephew is choosing it, the sister might not have known. The author's decision not to tell could be based on wanting to let the nephew have autonomy, but the sister's perspective is that she's making that decision for her child based on her values. \n\nLegally, the sister is the parent, so she has the right to dictate her child's diet. Ethically, the author might be violating the sister's trust by not informing her. Even if the nephew is making the choice, the parent's rules still apply when the child is under their care. So the author's inaction (not stopping the nephew and not informing the sister) might be considered a breach of that trust. \n\nAlternatively, some might argue that the nephew is old enough to explore his preferences, and the author is respecting his autonomy. But since the parent has set strict rules, the author's responsibility might be to uphold those rules, not let the child decide independently. \n\nSo, considering all that, the author is in a position where they are not enforcing the vegan diet the sister has set for her son, and by not informing her, they're being dishonest. Therefore, the answer might be A (yes, in the wrong). But I'm a bit torn because it's also about the child's autonomy versus the parent's rules. However, since the parent's authority is generally considered primary, the author is in the wrong for not honoring the sister's wishes.\n"
