He has been vegan since birth. My nephew and son attend the same school so I pick them up from school everyday. My nephew has snacks + dinner at my house every weekday before his mom comes to pick him up. \n\nI usually make a dish for my family and a separate vegan dish for my nephew. A couple of months ago I left them with their homework and snacks and went to do some chores, came back and found nephew &amp; son sharing chicken nuggets. I provided him with vegan snacks but he still ate the chicken nuggets. I told him those weren't vegan and he told me he that he eats meat in school sometimes. His friends share their meals with him sometimes. I thought about telling my sister but decided not to. \n\nSo basically I continue to give him vegan options but don't say anything if he chooses the non vegan option. Usually he goes for the non vegan one. Maybe because because he never gets to at home. I know my sister would freak out if she knows he's eating meat. She's staunchly vegan and eating animal products goes against her ethical beliefs which I completely understand and respect. My husband thinks IATA for not telling her and being dishonest, but I think nephew is old enough to make his own dietary choices (he's 10 this year). \n\nSo, AITA? Should I tell my sister what's going on?  \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is that the author has a 10-year-old vegan nephew because his mom is vegan and raises him that way. The author's kid is in the same school, so they pick up both kids and feed them. The author makes vegan food for the nephew but also makes regular food for their own family. One day, the nephew and the author's son shared chicken nuggets. The author found out and the nephew said he sometimes eats meat at school. The author didn't tell the sister, thinking the nephew is old enough to choose. Now, the husband says the author is in the wrong for not telling, but the author thinks the kid should be allowed to make his own choices.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical aspects here. The sister is strictly vegan, so she might be upset if she knew. But the nephew is 10, which is a bit old for a child, but still a minor. The author's reasoning is that the nephew is old enough to decide, but legally and ethically, parents have the authority over their children's diet. So maybe the author is overstepping by allowing the nephew to eat meat without informing the mother.\n\nOn the other hand, the nephew might be curious or trying to fit in with his friends at school. The author is providing vegan options but not forcing the nephew to eat them. The author isn't giving the meat intentionally; they just aren't stopping the kid when he chooses the non-vegan option. Is that being dishonest? The husband thinks so, but the author might argue they're respecting the nephew's autonomy.\n\nBut since the nephew is under the care of his mom, the author has a responsibility to inform her if they're making decisions that go against her parenting. Even if the nephew is eating meat without being told, the author is not preventing it, which could be seen as misleading the mother. The key point is whether the author has an obligation to inform the mother about her child's diet choices, even if the child makes them independently.\n\nAlso, the sister might not be aware that the nephew is exposed to meat at the author's house. If the author doesn't tell her, the sister might find out another way, which could cause more issues. The author's decision not to tell might be based on wanting to avoid conflict, but it's possible that the mother would appreciate being informed to address the situation herself.\n\nIn terms of ethics, there's a balance between respecting the parent's wishes and allowing the child some autonomy. Since the nephew is 10, maybe the mother expects her dietary choices to be followed. The author could be in the wrong for not honoring the mother's expectations by not informing her. However, if the mother's strictness is causing the child to secretly eat meat, maybe there's a different issue. But the author's role is to follow the mother's guidelines unless given permission otherwise.\n\nSo, considering all this, the author might be in the wrong because they are not upholding the sister's parenting choices. The nephew's choices are made in her absence, and she has the right to know. Therefore, the answer might be A.\n"
