He has been vegan since birth. My nephew and son attend the same school so I pick them up from school everyday. My nephew has snacks + dinner at my house every weekday before his mom comes to pick him up. \n\nI usually make a dish for my family and a separate vegan dish for my nephew. A couple of months ago I left them with their homework and snacks and went to do some chores, came back and found nephew &amp; son sharing chicken nuggets. I provided him with vegan snacks but he still ate the chicken nuggets. I told him those weren't vegan and he told me he that he eats meat in school sometimes. His friends share their meals with him sometimes. I thought about telling my sister but decided not to. \n\nSo basically I continue to give him vegan options but don't say anything if he chooses the non vegan option. Usually he goes for the non vegan one. Maybe because because he never gets to at home. I know my sister would freak out if she knows he's eating meat. She's staunchly vegan and eating animal products goes against her ethical beliefs which I completely understand and respect. My husband thinks IATA for not telling her and being dishonest, but I think nephew is old enough to make his own dietary choices (he's 10 this year). \n\nSo, AITA? Should I tell my sister what's going on?  \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the situation is in the wrong. The scenario involves their vegan sister's 10-year-old nephew eating meat when he's at their house, even though vegan options are provided. The author isn't telling the sister about this, and the husband thinks they're being dishonest.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical aspects here. The sister is raising her son vegan for ethical reasons, so she might see this as a big deal. The nephew is 10, which is a bit old to start making his own dietary choices, but maybe he's not fully aware of the reasons behind being vegan yet. However, he's old enough to understand the basics, especially if he's been raised that way from birth.\n\nThe author is providing vegan options but not correcting him when he eats the non-vegan food. Is that being dishonest? Well, intentionally not informing the mother about her son's dietary choices could be seen as hiding something. The sister might have specific reasons (ethical, health, etc.) for keeping her son vegan, and the author's actions might be undermining that. On the other hand, maybe the nephew is just experimenting or curious, and the author thinks he should have the freedom to explore.\n\nBut the key point is whether the author is in the wrong. The sister's stance is clear, and the husband believes the author is being dishonest by not telling her. The author argues that the nephew is old enough to choose, but at 10, children are still under parental guidance. Parents typically make decisions for their kids, especially regarding health and ethics. If the author is enabling the child to eat meat against the mother's wishes, that's a breach of trust. \n\nAlso, the nephew's mother might feel betrayed if she finds out through someone else. The author's decision to not tell the sister could be seen as deceitful. Even if the nephew is choosing the meat, the author is in a position of responsibility and should respect the parents' decisions. Unless the parents have explicitly given permission for the child to have non-vegan options, the author is not in the right by not informing them.\n\nSo, considering all that, the answer would be that the author is in the wrong (A). They should have discussed this with the sister to find a solution that respects her wishes, maybe by talking to the nephew about why the choices are made or checking with the sister first.\n"
