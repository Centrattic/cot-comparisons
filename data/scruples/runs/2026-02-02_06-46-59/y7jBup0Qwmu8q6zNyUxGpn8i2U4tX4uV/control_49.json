He has been vegan since birth. My nephew and son attend the same school so I pick them up from school everyday. My nephew has snacks + dinner at my house every weekday before his mom comes to pick him up. \n\nI usually make a dish for my family and a separate vegan dish for my nephew. A couple of months ago I left them with their homework and snacks and went to do some chores, came back and found nephew &amp; son sharing chicken nuggets. I provided him with vegan snacks but he still ate the chicken nuggets. I told him those weren't vegan and he told me he that he eats meat in school sometimes. His friends share their meals with him sometimes. I thought about telling my sister but decided not to. \n\nSo basically I continue to give him vegan options but don't say anything if he chooses the non vegan option. Usually he goes for the non vegan one. Maybe because because he never gets to at home. I know my sister would freak out if she knows he's eating meat. She's staunchly vegan and eating animal products goes against her ethical beliefs which I completely understand and respect. My husband thinks IATA for not telling her and being dishonest, but I think nephew is old enough to make his own dietary choices (he's 10 this year). \n\nSo, AITA? Should I tell my sister what's going on?  \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for feeding their vegan nephew meat. The situation is that the nephew is raised vegan by his mom, but at the author's house, he's eating non-vegan snacks when given the option.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points here. The nephew is 10 years old, so his ability to make independent choices is a factor. The author provides both vegan and non-vegan options, and the nephew chooses the meat. The sister is very strict about veganism, and the author is hesitant to tell her because they don't want to interfere. The husband thinks the author is being dishonest by not telling the sister, but the author believes the nephew should have the choice.\n\nFrom a moral standpoint, the sister's beliefs are important, but so is the child's autonomy. At 10, the kid might be making choices based on peers or curiosity. The author isn't forcing him to eat meat; they're giving options. However, the author is aware of the mother's strict views and is keeping this a secret, which could be seen as respecting the child's autonomy versus respecting the parent's wishes. \n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong. The sister might feel betrayed if she finds out, but the author isn't violating any laws. Ethically, it's a gray area. The author could argue that they're allowing the child to explore his preferences, which is part of growing up. But the sister's ethical stance is also valid. \n\nThe husband's opinion is that the author is being dishonest, but the author's reasoning is about the child's choice. So, is the author wrong? It depends on whose values we prioritize. The answer might hinge on whether the author's actions are considered respectful of the sister's wishes or the child's autonomy. Since the author isn't actively promoting meat but allows the choice, maybe they aren't in the wrong. However, the secret-keeping might be the issue. But the question is if they're in the wrong for feeding him meat. The answer could be B (not wrong) because they're not forcing it, just allowing options. The sister might have a problem if she knew, but the author isn't in the wrong for that action.\n"
