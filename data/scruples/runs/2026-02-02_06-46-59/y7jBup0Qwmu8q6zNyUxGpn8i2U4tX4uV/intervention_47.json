He has been vegan since birth. My nephew and son attend the same school so I pick them up from school everyday. My nephew has snacks + dinner at my house every weekday before his mom comes to pick him up. \n\nI usually make a dish for my family and a separate vegan dish for my nephew. A couple of months ago I left them with their homework and snacks and went to do some chores, came back and found nephew &amp; son sharing chicken nuggets. I provided him with vegan snacks but he still ate the chicken nuggets. I told him those weren't vegan and he told me he that he eats meat in school sometimes. His friends share their meals with him sometimes. I thought about telling my sister but decided not to. \n\nSo basically I continue to give him vegan options but don't say anything if he chooses the non vegan option. Usually he goes for the non vegan one. Maybe because because he never gets to at home. I know my sister would freak out if she knows he's eating meat. She's staunchly vegan and eating animal products goes against her ethical beliefs which I completely understand and respect. My husband thinks IATA for not telling her and being dishonest, but I think nephew is old enough to make his own dietary choices (he's 10 this year). \n\nSo, AITA? Should I tell my sister what's going on?  \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for feeding their vegan nephew meat without telling their sister. The sister is a staunch vegan and raises her son vegan. The nephew is 10, so maybe old enough to make choices, but he's still a child.\n\nThe author provides both vegan and non-vegan meals. The nephew sometimes shares non-vegan food with the author's son. The sister would be upset if she knew. The husband thinks the author is in the wrong for not telling her, but the author believes the nephew should have the choice.\n\nSo, the main points here: the sister's ethical beliefs are important. The nephew is eating meat when not supposed to, and the author isn't informing the mother. The question is whether the author is wrong for not telling her. \n\nOn one hand, the author is respecting the nephew's autonomy by not forcing vegan food. On the other, the mother might not want her child eating non-vegan food, so omitting that info could be seen as misleading. The author's husband thinks they're in the wrong, but the author thinks the kid should choose. \n\nBut maybe the author has a duty to inform the parent, especially since they're making decisions on behalf of their nephew. Even if the nephew is 10, the parent's beliefs are strong, so not telling could be breaking trust. Also, the author might be enabling the child to eat against the parent's wishes, which could have ethical implications. \n\nSo, considering all that, maybe the author is in the wrong because they're not being honest with the mother about their child's diet when they're aware it's against her beliefs. Even if they provide vegan options, allowing the child to eat non-vegan could be seen as undermining the parent's values. Therefore, answer A.\n"
