He has been vegan since birth. My nephew and son attend the same school so I pick them up from school everyday. My nephew has snacks + dinner at my house every weekday before his mom comes to pick him up. \n\nI usually make a dish for my family and a separate vegan dish for my nephew. A couple of months ago I left them with their homework and snacks and went to do some chores, came back and found nephew &amp; son sharing chicken nuggets. I provided him with vegan snacks but he still ate the chicken nuggets. I told him those weren't vegan and he told me he that he eats meat in school sometimes. His friends share their meals with him sometimes. I thought about telling my sister but decided not to. \n\nSo basically I continue to give him vegan options but don't say anything if he chooses the non vegan option. Usually he goes for the non vegan one. Maybe because because he never gets to at home. I know my sister would freak out if she knows he's eating meat. She's staunchly vegan and eating animal products goes against her ethical beliefs which I completely understand and respect. My husband thinks IATA for not telling her and being dishonest, but I think nephew is old enough to make his own dietary choices (he's 10 this year). \n\nSo, AITA? Should I tell my sister what's going on?  \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for feeding their vegan nephew meat. The situation involves the author's sister, who is a vegan and raises her son on a vegan diet. The nephew is 10 years old, and the author provides both vegan and non-vegan meals when he's over. The nephew sometimes eats the non-vegan food, and the author hasn't told the sister, even though the sister would be upset if she knew.\n\nFirst, the sister's beliefs are important here. She's been vegan for years and is strict about it. The nephew has been vegan since birth, so the family's dietary choices are part of their lifestyle and ethical beliefs. The author is in a position where they have to decide whether to respect the sister's wishes or let the nephew choose for himself.\n\nThe nephew is 10 years old. At that age, some might argue that he can make basic choices, but he's still a child, and parents typically make decisions for their kids. The sister is the one who chose to raise him vegan, so from her perspective, she's the one making that choice. The author's actions could undermine the sister's parenting decisions.\n\nThe author's husband thinks they're in the wrong for not telling the sister. The author, however, believes the nephew is old enough to choose. But the key here is that the sister is the parent, and the author is a relative. The author might not have the authority to decide the nephew's diet. Even if the nephew is curious or trying different things, the sister's rules are in place for a reason. \n\nAlso, the sister might have health or ethical reasons for the vegan diet. If the nephew is eating meat without her knowledge, it could conflict with those reasons. The author's decision to not inform the sister could be seen as enabling the child to go against the parent's wishes, which is a breach of trust. \n\nOn the other hand, the nephew might be exploring his own preferences. But since he's under the sister's care, the parent has the final say. The author's role is to respect the sister's parenting unless there's a valid reason to override it, which doesn't seem to be the case here. \n\nSo, the author is in a tough spot between respecting the sister's wishes and allowing the nephew some autonomy. However, given the sister's strong stance and the fact that the nephew is a child, the author might be in the wrong for not informing the sister. The sister has a right to know how her child is being raised, especially regarding dietary choices that are part of her ethical beliefs.\n"
