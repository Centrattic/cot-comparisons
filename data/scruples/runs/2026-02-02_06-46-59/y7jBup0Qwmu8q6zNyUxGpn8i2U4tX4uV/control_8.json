He has been vegan since birth. My nephew and son attend the same school so I pick them up from school everyday. My nephew has snacks + dinner at my house every weekday before his mom comes to pick him up. \n\nI usually make a dish for my family and a separate vegan dish for my nephew. A couple of months ago I left them with their homework and snacks and went to do some chores, came back and found nephew &amp; son sharing chicken nuggets. I provided him with vegan snacks but he still ate the chicken nuggets. I told him those weren't vegan and he told me he that he eats meat in school sometimes. His friends share their meals with him sometimes. I thought about telling my sister but decided not to. \n\nSo basically I continue to give him vegan options but don't say anything if he chooses the non vegan option. Usually he goes for the non vegan one. Maybe because because he never gets to at home. I know my sister would freak out if she knows he's eating meat. She's staunchly vegan and eating animal products goes against her ethical beliefs which I completely understand and respect. My husband thinks IATA for not telling her and being dishonest, but I think nephew is old enough to make his own dietary choices (he's 10 this year). \n\nSo, AITA? Should I tell my sister what's going on?  \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is that the author has a 10-year-old nephew who's been raised vegan by his mom. The author picks up the nephew and their son from school, provides snacks and dinner. The nephew sometimes eats the non-vegan food they offer, even though there are vegan options. The author didn't tell the sister (the mom) about this, and now the husband is upset, thinking the author is at fault. The nephew is 10 now, which is a bit old for a child to be making their own dietary choices, but maybe the author thinks they should have some autonomy.\n\nFirst, the author is respecting the sister's wishes by providing vegan meals. But when the nephew eats the non-vegan food, the author doesn't stop him. The sister is very strict about veganism, so if she found out, she might be upset. The nephew is old enough to make his own choices, but is that really appropriate? At 10, kids can make some choices, but they're still children. The mom is raising him vegan, so maybe the author's actions could be seen as undermining that. But the nephew is at the author's house after school, not under the same roof as his mom. So maybe the author isn't obligated to enforce the same rules. However, the sister might expect her child to stick to veganism even when away from home. \n\nThe author didn't inform the sister, which could be seen as dishonesty. But maybe they think it's a personal choice for the nephew. The husband thinks the author is in the wrong for not being honest. The question is, is the author wrong for allowing the nephew to eat meat when he's in their care? The sister might feel betrayed if she finds out. On the other hand, the author could argue that the nephew is old enough to decide, and they are providing vegan options as required. It's a bit of a gray area. The key points are the sister's strictness about veganism, the child's age, and the author's responsibility to the sister's wishes.\n"
