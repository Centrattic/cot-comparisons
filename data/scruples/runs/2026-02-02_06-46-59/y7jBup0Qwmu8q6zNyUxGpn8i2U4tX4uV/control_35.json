He has been vegan since birth. My nephew and son attend the same school so I pick them up from school everyday. My nephew has snacks + dinner at my house every weekday before his mom comes to pick him up. \n\nI usually make a dish for my family and a separate vegan dish for my nephew. A couple of months ago I left them with their homework and snacks and went to do some chores, came back and found nephew &amp; son sharing chicken nuggets. I provided him with vegan snacks but he still ate the chicken nuggets. I told him those weren't vegan and he told me he that he eats meat in school sometimes. His friends share their meals with him sometimes. I thought about telling my sister but decided not to. \n\nSo basically I continue to give him vegan options but don't say anything if he chooses the non vegan option. Usually he goes for the non vegan one. Maybe because because he never gets to at home. I know my sister would freak out if she knows he's eating meat. She's staunchly vegan and eating animal products goes against her ethical beliefs which I completely understand and respect. My husband thinks IATA for not telling her and being dishonest, but I think nephew is old enough to make his own dietary choices (he's 10 this year). \n\nSo, AITA? Should I tell my sister what's going on?  \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation involves the author feeding their vegan nephew meat without telling their sister. The nephew is 10, and his mom is a strict vegan who raised him that way. The author provides vegan options but the nephew sometimes eats the non-vegan food, like chicken nuggets. The husband thinks the author is in the wrong for not informing the sister, while the author believes the nephew should decide his own diet.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical aspects. The sister's beliefs are important here. She's vegan due to ethical reasons, so she might be upset if she knew her son was eating meat. The author is respecting her wishes by not telling her, but is this the right approach?\n\nParental rights come into play. The nephew is a minor, so his mom has authority over his diet. The author's husband argues that the author is being dishonest by not informing the sister. However, the author might think the nephew is old enough to make choices. But at 10, is that a valid assumption? Legally, the parents make dietary decisions for their children.\n\nThere's also the aspect of autonomy. The nephew might be curious or influenced by friends, but the mother's wishes are clear. The author's actions could undermine the mother's parenting choices. Even if the nephew is choosing non-vegan options, the mother's consent isn't there. The author is providing meat, which could be seen as going against the mother's wishes, even if done in her absence.\n\nHypothetically, if the mother finds out, she might feel betrayed. The author is in a position where they're supposed to respect the mother's dietary rules. The fact that the nephew is eating meat in school sometimes doesn't justify the author's actions. The key issue is whether the author should have informed the sister, given the potential conflict with the mother's beliefs.\n\nIn terms of responsibility, the author is the caregiver for the nephew during pick-up. They have a duty to follow the parent's instructions unless there's a compelling reason not to. The nephew's age doesn't override the parent's authority on diet. The author's choice to not tell the sister could be seen as prioritizing the nephew's autonomy over the parent's wishes, which might be ethically questionable.\n\nSo, the author's actions might be considered wrong because they're not honoring the mother's dietary decisions for her child. Even with good intentions, the mother's wishes are paramount here. The husband's viewpoint that the author is being dishonest has merit. Therefore, the answer would be A (the author is in the wrong).\n"
