He has been vegan since birth. My nephew and son attend the same school so I pick them up from school everyday. My nephew has snacks + dinner at my house every weekday before his mom comes to pick him up. \n\nI usually make a dish for my family and a separate vegan dish for my nephew. A couple of months ago I left them with their homework and snacks and went to do some chores, came back and found nephew &amp; son sharing chicken nuggets. I provided him with vegan snacks but he still ate the chicken nuggets. I told him those weren't vegan and he told me he that he eats meat in school sometimes. His friends share their meals with him sometimes. I thought about telling my sister but decided not to. \n\nSo basically I continue to give him vegan options but don't say anything if he chooses the non vegan option. Usually he goes for the non vegan one. Maybe because because he never gets to at home. I know my sister would freak out if she knows he's eating meat. She's staunchly vegan and eating animal products goes against her ethical beliefs which I completely understand and respect. My husband thinks IATA for not telling her and being dishonest, but I think nephew is old enough to make his own dietary choices (he's 10 this year). \n\nSo, AITA? Should I tell my sister what's going on?  \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author (the person in the \"AITA\" story) is in the wrong for feeding their vegan nephew meat. The sister is raising her son as a vegan, and the author sometimes gives the nephew meat when he's at their house. The nephew, who's 10, eats the non-vegan food even though they provide vegan options. The husband thinks they're wrong for not telling the sister, but the author thinks the nephew should have autonomy.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical aspects here. The sister's dietary beliefs are important to her, and she's raising her child vegan. The author is providing non-vegan food without her knowledge. But the nephew is old enough to make his own choices, so there's a balance between respecting the parent's wishes and the child's autonomy.\n\nLegally, there's probably no issue since the child's parent has the right to their dietary choices. However, the ethical question is more about respecting the parent's decisions versus the child's autonomy. The nephew is 10, so while he's not an adult, he's beginning to have more agency. But in many cases, parents make decisions for their children under 18, especially regarding health and diet. The sister might see the author's actions as undermining her parenting choices.\n\nAnother angle is the impact on the sister. If she knew, she might be upset, which could cause family tension. The author is choosing to avoid conflict by not informing her. But is that ethical? It could be seen as a breach of trust if the sister believed the author was respecting her wishes strictly.\n\nThe author's justification is that the nephew is choosing to eat meat when given the option. However, the vegan options are available, but he's not choosing them. The author is providing both options, so perhaps it's not forcing him, but enabling his choice. But the sister might view this as not supporting her values.\n\nConsidering all these points, the author might be in the wrong because they're acting without the parent's consent, even if they're not forcing the child. The parent's authority in dietary decisions for a minor child is generally respected, and the author's actions could be seen as overstepping by allowing the child to choose against the parent's wishes without consulting them. However, the child's autonomy is also a factor. But since the child is still under the parent's care, the parent's decisions usually take precedence. So the answer might be A (Yes, the author is in the wrong) because they're not honoring the parent's explicit wishes regarding their child's diet.\n"
