He has been vegan since birth. My nephew and son attend the same school so I pick them up from school everyday. My nephew has snacks + dinner at my house every weekday before his mom comes to pick him up. \n\nI usually make a dish for my family and a separate vegan dish for my nephew. A couple of months ago I left them with their homework and snacks and went to do some chores, came back and found nephew &amp; son sharing chicken nuggets. I provided him with vegan snacks but he still ate the chicken nuggets. I told him those weren't vegan and he told me he that he eats meat in school sometimes. His friends share their meals with him sometimes. I thought about telling my sister but decided not to. \n\nSo basically I continue to give him vegan options but don't say anything if he chooses the non vegan option. Usually he goes for the non vegan one. Maybe because because he never gets to at home. I know my sister would freak out if she knows he's eating meat. She's staunchly vegan and eating animal products goes against her ethical beliefs which I completely understand and respect. My husband thinks IATA for not telling her and being dishonest, but I think nephew is old enough to make his own dietary choices (he's 10 this year). \n\nSo, AITA? Should I tell my sister what's going on?  \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong. The situation involves a vegan sister whose son is raised vegan, but when he's at the author's house, he sometimes eats meat provided for the author's own children. The author hasn't told the sister about this.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The sister is strictly vegan and has ethical reasons for her diet. The nephew is 10 years old, so the author is allowing him to choose non-vegan options when available. The author's husband thinks they're in the wrong for not being honest with the sister. The author argues that the nephew should be allowed to make his own choices.\n\nSo, the main issue here is whether the author is wrong for not informing the sister about her son eating meat. On one hand, the sister has a right to know how her child is being raised, especially regarding dietary choices that are important to her. On the other hand, the nephew is old enough to make decisions, and the author is respecting his autonomy by not forcing the vegan diet.\n\nBut there's a trust issue here. The sister is relying on the author to maintain her dietary preferences for her child. By not telling her, the author might be breaking that trust. Even if the nephew is choosing meat, the sister might want to address this with him. The author's decision could lead to the sister feeling betrayed if she finds out later. Also, the author is in a position where they're responsible for the child during pickup times, so there's an implied responsibility to adhere to the parent's wishes unless there's a compelling reason to do otherwise.\n\nAnother angle is the child's well-being. If the sister is strict about veganism, maybe the child isn't getting enough protein or other nutrients from the vegan options. However, the author is providing vegan snacks, so that might not be the case. The child might just prefer meat when given the option. But the sister's beliefs are important, and she might want to enforce them at all times.\n\nThe author's husband thinks they're in the wrong for being dishonest. Dishonesty can damage relationships, even if the intention is good. The author is choosing not to inform the sister, which could be seen as keeping secrets that might come back to haunt them. The sister has a right to be informed about her child's diet, especially if it's contrary to their household rules.\n\nHowever, the author could argue that they're not preventing the child from being vegan but are allowing him to explore his choices. At 10, the child is starting to form his own opinions, and the author might be supporting his autonomy. But the sister's ethical stance is about not consuming animal products, so she might see this as a betrayal of her values.\n\nIn terms of ethics, there's a conflict between respecting the parent's wishes and the child's autonomy. The answer might depend on cultural or family norms. In some cases, parents might expect others to follow their rules when caring for their child. If the author is in a position of responsibility, breaking the parent's rules without their consent could be seen as wrong.\n\nConsidering all this, the author might be in the wrong for not being honest with the sister. The sister has a right to know about her child's dietary choices, and the author's decision to keep it secret could lead to trust issues. Even if the nephew is choosing meat, the parent should be informed to make decisions consistent with her values. The author's husband's perspective about dishonesty makes sense here.\n"
