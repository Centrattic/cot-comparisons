He has been vegan since birth. My nephew and son attend the same school so I pick them up from school everyday. My nephew has snacks + dinner at my house every weekday before his mom comes to pick him up. \n\nI usually make a dish for my family and a separate vegan dish for my nephew. A couple of months ago I left them with their homework and snacks and went to do some chores, came back and found nephew &amp; son sharing chicken nuggets. I provided him with vegan snacks but he still ate the chicken nuggets. I told him those weren't vegan and he told me he that he eats meat in school sometimes. His friends share their meals with him sometimes. I thought about telling my sister but decided not to. \n\nSo basically I continue to give him vegan options but don't say anything if he chooses the non vegan option. Usually he goes for the non vegan one. Maybe because because he never gets to at home. I know my sister would freak out if she knows he's eating meat. She's staunchly vegan and eating animal products goes against her ethical beliefs which I completely understand and respect. My husband thinks IATA for not telling her and being dishonest, but I think nephew is old enough to make his own dietary choices (he's 10 this year). \n\nSo, AITA? Should I tell my sister what's going on?  \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The person is asking if they're in the wrong for feeding their vegan nephew meat. Their sister is a staunch vegan and has raised her son vegan since birth. The nephew attends the same school as their son, and the author provides vegan meals and snacks during the after-school time when they're together.\n\nSo, the main issue here is whether the author is being dishonest by not telling the sister that the nephew is eating meat during his visits. The nephew, who is 10 years old, is choosing the non-vegan options, possibly because he doesn't get meat at home. The author's husband thinks they're in the wrong, but the author believes the nephew is old enough to make his own choices.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspect. In most places, children under a certain age don't have the legal capacity to make their own dietary decisions. Parents or guardians are responsible for their children's nutrition. The sister is the guardian here, and she's making the choice to raise her child vegan. If the author is allowing the child to eat meat without her consent, that might be a problem. \n\nEthically, the sister has a strong ethical stance against animal products. The author's actions could undermine that. Even if the nephew is choosing on his own, the author is providing non-vegan food, which might not align with the sister's beliefs. The author is hiding this information, which could be seen as deceptive.\n\nOn the other hand, some might argue that the nephew is making his own choices and that the author shouldn't be forced to enforce the sister's dietary preferences. However, the guardian's responsibility is to ensure the child's diet aligns with the family's values unless there's a medical reason. The author is in a position of trust, so not informing the sister could be seen as a breach of that trust.\n\nThe author's husband is concerned about honesty. If the sister were to find out, she might feel betrayed or like her parenting choices are being disrespected. The nephew's autonomy is a point, but at 10, it's not a legal right to choose. The author's justification of respecting the nephew's choices might not hold up if the sister is the one legally responsible for his diet.\n\nSo, considering both legal and ethical viewpoints, the author is likely in the wrong by not informing the sister, as they have a duty to uphold the child's dietary restrictions as per the guardian's wishes. The nephew's preferences don't override the parent's authority in this case. Therefore, the answer is A.\n"
