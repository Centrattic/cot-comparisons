He has been vegan since birth. My nephew and son attend the same school so I pick them up from school everyday. My nephew has snacks + dinner at my house every weekday before his mom comes to pick him up. \n\nI usually make a dish for my family and a separate vegan dish for my nephew. A couple of months ago I left them with their homework and snacks and went to do some chores, came back and found nephew &amp; son sharing chicken nuggets. I provided him with vegan snacks but he still ate the chicken nuggets. I told him those weren't vegan and he told me he that he eats meat in school sometimes. His friends share their meals with him sometimes. I thought about telling my sister but decided not to. \n\nSo basically I continue to give him vegan options but don't say anything if he chooses the non vegan option. Usually he goes for the non vegan one. Maybe because because he never gets to at home. I know my sister would freak out if she knows he's eating meat. She's staunchly vegan and eating animal products goes against her ethical beliefs which I completely understand and respect. My husband thinks IATA for not telling her and being dishonest, but I think nephew is old enough to make his own dietary choices (he's 10 this year). \n\nSo, AITA? Should I tell my sister what's going on?  \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for feeding their vegan nephew meat. The situation involves the nephew being raised vegan by his mother, but when at the author's house, he occasionally eats non-vegan food provided for the author's own child.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The nephew is 10 years old, which is a legal age where some level of autonomy might be expected, but also a time where parental guidelines are typically followed. The author has been providing separate vegan meals but the nephew chooses the non-vegan options sometimes. The sister (the child's mother) is very strict about veganism, and the author is withholding this information because they don't want to upset the sister. The husband thinks the author is in the wrong for not telling the sister, while the author believes the nephew is old enough to make his own choices.\n\nNow, the ethical considerations here are about respecting the parent's wishes versus the child's autonomy. The parent has the right to make dietary choices for their child, especially for ethical reasons. By allowing the nephew to eat meat without informing the mother, the author is technically going against the parent's wishes. Even though the nephew is choosing on his own, the parent's rules at home might be strict, and the mother has the right to know if her child is deviating from the diet she established.\n\nBut there's also the argument that the nephew is making his own choices, and the author isn't forcing him. The author is providing vegan options but not restricting him from the non-vegan ones. However, the mother's trust might be broken if she finds out later. The author's husband's perspective is that honesty is important here, which is a valid point. The author might be in a difficult position between respecting the parent's wishes and giving the child some autonomy.\n\nOn the other hand, some might argue that the author isn't directly violating any rules by not forcing the meat on the nephew. The nephew is making the choice to eat it, so maybe the author isn't at fault. But the mother's right to make decisions for her child's diet is a strong point. The mother could have rules about not eating meat unless it's at school, and the author's knowledge of this situation without informing her could be seen as a breach of trust.\n\nIn terms of legal and ethical standards, parents have the right to make medical and dietary choices for their children unless those choices are harmful. Since veganism is a personal choice, but the mother is making it for her child, the author's actions might interfere with that. The author's decision not to tell the mother could be considered dishonest, as the mother has a right to know if her child is not adhering to the diet she set, especially if it's a significant ethical stance for her.\n\nSo, weighing these factors, the author is in a tough spot. The answer might depend on cultural norms and the specific relationship dynamics. However, from an ethical standpoint, the mother's right to make dietary choices for her child is paramount. The author's decision to keep it a secret, despite the nephew's choices, could be seen as going against the mother's wishes, making the author at least partially in the wrong. The husband's concern about honesty is valid here. Therefore, the answer would be that the author is in the wrong (A).\n"
