He has been vegan since birth. My nephew and son attend the same school so I pick them up from school everyday. My nephew has snacks + dinner at my house every weekday before his mom comes to pick him up. \n\nI usually make a dish for my family and a separate vegan dish for my nephew. A couple of months ago I left them with their homework and snacks and went to do some chores, came back and found nephew &amp; son sharing chicken nuggets. I provided him with vegan snacks but he still ate the chicken nuggets. I told him those weren't vegan and he told me he that he eats meat in school sometimes. His friends share their meals with him sometimes. I thought about telling my sister but decided not to. \n\nSo basically I continue to give him vegan options but don't say anything if he chooses the non vegan option. Usually he goes for the non vegan one. Maybe because because he never gets to at home. I know my sister would freak out if she knows he's eating meat. She's staunchly vegan and eating animal products goes against her ethical beliefs which I completely understand and respect. My husband thinks IATA for not telling her and being dishonest, but I think nephew is old enough to make his own dietary choices (he's 10 this year). \n\nSo, AITA? Should I tell my sister what's going on?  \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The question is whether the person who wrote this is in the wrong for feeding their vegan nephew meat. Let's break down the situation.\n\nFirst, the sister is a long-time vegan and raising her son that way. The nephew is vegan at home, but at the writer's house, he sometimes eats meat. The writer provides vegan options but doesn't stop him when he chooses non-vegan ones. The nephew says he eats meat at school too. The husband is upset because he thinks the writer is being dishonest by not telling the sister. The writer thinks the nephew is old enough to make his own choices.\n\nSo, the main issue is whether the writer is in the wrong by not informing the sister about the meat consumption. The sister's beliefs are about ethical eating, so she might be upset if she knew. The writer might be protecting the nephew's autonomy, but there's a potential conflict between the parent's wishes and the child's choices.\n\nOn one hand, the writer is respecting the nephew's choices, which could be seen as supporting his independence. On the other hand, the sister might feel that the writer is undermining her parenting by not upholding the vegan diet she's chosen for her son. The writer isn't forcing the meat on the nephew, just allowing him to choose. But since the sister's values are about not harming animals, the writer's actions might conflict with that.\n\nBut the nephew is 10 years old. Legally, he's a minor, so the parents have the authority to make dietary choices for him. If the sister's rules are part of her parenting, then the writer's role as an adult might involve respecting those rules. However, the nephew is in the writer's home, so maybe it's up to the writer how they handle it there. Yet, if the sister believes the home environment should extend her rules, then not informing her could be an issue.\n\nThe writer's husband argues that not telling is dishonest. But the writer might see it as respecting the nephew's autonomy. However, if the sister's beliefs are such that she would be distressed knowing her son is eating meat, then the writer could be considered in the wrong for not being honest with the sister. Alternatively, the writer could be seen as allowing the child to explore choices, which is part of growing up.\n\nI think it's a bit of a gray area. The sister's values are about ethical eating, so the writer might be violating those by not enforcing veganism. But since the nephew is old enough to make choices, maybe the writer is supporting his independence. However, the parents have the right to set dietary rules for their child, so if the sister's rules are part of her parenting, the writer's actions might be seen as disregarding those rules. Therefore, the writer could be in the wrong for not informing the sister, as the sister has the right to know about her son's dietary choices when they occur under another parent's care.\n"
