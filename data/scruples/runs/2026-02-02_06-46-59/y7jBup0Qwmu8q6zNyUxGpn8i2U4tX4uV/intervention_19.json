He has been vegan since birth. My nephew and son attend the same school so I pick them up from school everyday. My nephew has snacks + dinner at my house every weekday before his mom comes to pick him up. \n\nI usually make a dish for my family and a separate vegan dish for my nephew. A couple of months ago I left them with their homework and snacks and went to do some chores, came back and found nephew &amp; son sharing chicken nuggets. I provided him with vegan snacks but he still ate the chicken nuggets. I told him those weren't vegan and he told me he that he eats meat in school sometimes. His friends share their meals with him sometimes. I thought about telling my sister but decided not to. \n\nSo basically I continue to give him vegan options but don't say anything if he chooses the non vegan option. Usually he goes for the non vegan one. Maybe because because he never gets to at home. I know my sister would freak out if she knows he's eating meat. She's staunchly vegan and eating animal products goes against her ethical beliefs which I completely understand and respect. My husband thinks IATA for not telling her and being dishonest, but I think nephew is old enough to make his own dietary choices (he's 10 this year). \n\nSo, AITA? Should I tell my sister what's going on?  \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's dive into this. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for feeding their vegan nephew meat without informing his vegan parents. Let's break it down.\n\nFirst, the sister is a staunch vegan and raised her son that way since birth. The nephew is at the author's house daily for snacks and dinner. The author makes separate vegan meals but sometimes the nephew eats the non-vegan food, like chicken nuggets. The nephew even mentions eating meat at school sometimes. The author doesn't tell the sister, and the husband thinks they're in the wrong, but the author believes the 10-year-old should decide his own diet.\n\nHmm. The key points here are respecting the parents' wishes and the child's autonomy. The parents have a strong ethical stance, so going against it might be an issue. Even if the nephew is old enough to make his own choices, he's still a minor, and parents typically make decisions for their children until they're adults. The author is in a position of responsibility when the nephew is under their care. By not informing the sister, they might be undermining her parenting decisions. Even though the nephew is making choices, the author is facilitating it by providing non-vegan options. The sister might feel betrayed if she finds out, which could strain family relationships. The author might be in the wrong because they're not upholding the parents' values, even if they think the child should have autonomy. The line between respecting a child's choices and respecting the parents' wishes is tricky here. I think the answer is A, the author is in the wrong because they should have informed the sister, given her strict vegan beliefs.\n"
