He has been vegan since birth. My nephew and son attend the same school so I pick them up from school everyday. My nephew has snacks + dinner at my house every weekday before his mom comes to pick him up. \n\nI usually make a dish for my family and a separate vegan dish for my nephew. A couple of months ago I left them with their homework and snacks and went to do some chores, came back and found nephew &amp; son sharing chicken nuggets. I provided him with vegan snacks but he still ate the chicken nuggets. I told him those weren't vegan and he told me he that he eats meat in school sometimes. His friends share their meals with him sometimes. I thought about telling my sister but decided not to. \n\nSo basically I continue to give him vegan options but don't say anything if he chooses the non vegan option. Usually he goes for the non vegan one. Maybe because because he never gets to at home. I know my sister would freak out if she knows he's eating meat. She's staunchly vegan and eating animal products goes against her ethical beliefs which I completely understand and respect. My husband thinks IATA for not telling her and being dishonest, but I think nephew is old enough to make his own dietary choices (he's 10 this year). \n\nSo, AITA? Should I tell my sister what's going on?  \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person in the scenario is in the wrong. The situation involves a vegan sister whose son is being raised vegan. The author, the sister's sibling, is feeding the nephew meat. The key points here are the age of the nephew, the sister's strict vegan beliefs, and the author's decision not to inform the sister about the meat consumption.\n\nFirst, the nephew is 10 years old. At that age, children can start making some choices, but they're still under their parents' care. The sister is raising him vegan because of ethical beliefs, which the author respects. However, the author is providing non-vegan food, possibly out of the sister's knowledge. The sister might be upset if she found out, and the author's husband thinks she's being dishonest by not telling.\n\nThe author argues that the nephew should have the choice, but the parents have the right to decide their child's diet. The author is in a position where they're allowing the child to eat meat, which goes against the parents' wishes. Even if the nephew is choosing the meat, the parents' authority in dietary decisions is important here. The author isn't the parent, so they might be overstepping by providing non-vegan options without the mother's consent. \n\nAlso, the sister's ethical stance is strong, so the author's inaction in not informing her could be seen as deceit. The nephew is in their care for part of the day, so the author has a responsibility to follow the parents' wishes unless there's a valid reason not to. Since the author is providing separate vegan meals but the nephew chooses otherwise, maybe the issue is whether the author should enforce the vegan diet during their time with him.\n\nBut the nephew is at school and friends might share meat, so maybe he's already exposed to non-vegan food. However, the parents' home is where the vegan diet is enforced. The author's home is part of that environment, so allowing meat there could undermine the parents' efforts. The author's decision to not tell could be seen as not respecting the parents' wishes, even if they're trying to be lenient.\n\nSo, the author is in the wrong because they're allowing the child to consume non-vegan food without the parents' knowledge, which goes against the parents' ethical beliefs and decisions as caregivers. The answer would be A.\n"
