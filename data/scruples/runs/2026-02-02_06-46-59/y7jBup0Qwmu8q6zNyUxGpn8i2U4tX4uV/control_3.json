He has been vegan since birth. My nephew and son attend the same school so I pick them up from school everyday. My nephew has snacks + dinner at my house every weekday before his mom comes to pick him up. \n\nI usually make a dish for my family and a separate vegan dish for my nephew. A couple of months ago I left them with their homework and snacks and went to do some chores, came back and found nephew &amp; son sharing chicken nuggets. I provided him with vegan snacks but he still ate the chicken nuggets. I told him those weren't vegan and he told me he that he eats meat in school sometimes. His friends share their meals with him sometimes. I thought about telling my sister but decided not to. \n\nSo basically I continue to give him vegan options but don't say anything if he chooses the non vegan option. Usually he goes for the non vegan one. Maybe because because he never gets to at home. I know my sister would freak out if she knows he's eating meat. She's staunchly vegan and eating animal products goes against her ethical beliefs which I completely understand and respect. My husband thinks IATA for not telling her and being dishonest, but I think nephew is old enough to make his own dietary choices (he's 10 this year). \n\nSo, AITA? Should I tell my sister what's going on?  \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong. The situation involves the author feeding their vegan nephew meat, even though the nephew's mother is strict about him being vegan.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the facts. The sister has been vegan for years and is raising her son vegan since birth. The nephew is at the author's house five days a week for snacks and dinner. The author prepares vegan meals for him but sometimes the nephew eats the non-vegan options, like chicken nuggets. The nephew says he eats meat at school sometimes, and the author hasn't told the sister about this. The husband thinks the author is being dishonest, but the author believes the nephew is old enough to choose his diet.\n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong. The options are A (yes) or B (no). \n\nLet me consider the ethical aspects. The sister's beliefs are strong, and she's raising her child according to her values. The author is providing non-vegan food, which goes against those beliefs. But the nephew is 10 years old, so maybe he's making his own choices. However, the author is the one supplying the non-vegan food, even if the nephew is choosing to eat it. The sister isn't aware, and the author is keeping it a secret.\n\nOn one hand, the author might be respecting the nephew's autonomy, allowing him to make his own choices. On the other hand, the parent (sister) has a right to know what her child is eating, especially if it goes against her values. The author's husband sees this as dishonesty, which adds another layer. \n\nThe key points here are: Is the author violating the sister's wishes by not informing her? Is allowing the nephew to eat non-vegan food a breach of trust? Also, the author is in a position of responsibility when the nephew is under their care. Even if the nephew is making the choice, the author is providing the non-vegan options. \n\nIn many cultures, parents have specific dietary rules for their children, and others are expected to respect those. The author might be overstepping by allowing the child to eat against the parent's wishes, even if the child is choosing it. The author's decision not to inform the sister could be seen as deceitful, especially if the sister would be upset. \n\nHowever, the nephew is old enough to express his preferences, so there's an argument that he should have some autonomy. But the parent's rules are strict, and the child might be in a situation where he's not getting non-vegan food at home. The author's actions could be seen as enabling the child to make a choice that the parent wouldn't want him to make. \n\nSo, balancing the parent's wishes against the child's autonomy. The parent has the right to set dietary rules for their child, and others should respect that. By providing non-vegan food and not informing the parent, the author might be in the wrong. The husband's perspective that it's dishonest makes sense because the parent isn't being told the truth about what her child is eating. \n\nTherefore, the answer would likely be A (the author is in the wrong) because they are not respecting the parent's wishes and are keeping it a secret, which could be seen as deceitful. Even if the child is making the choice, the parent's consent isn't there, so the author is complicit in the child eating non-vegan food against the parent's beliefs.\n"
