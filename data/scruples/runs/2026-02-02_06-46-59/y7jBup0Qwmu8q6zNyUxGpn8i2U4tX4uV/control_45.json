He has been vegan since birth. My nephew and son attend the same school so I pick them up from school everyday. My nephew has snacks + dinner at my house every weekday before his mom comes to pick him up. \n\nI usually make a dish for my family and a separate vegan dish for my nephew. A couple of months ago I left them with their homework and snacks and went to do some chores, came back and found nephew &amp; son sharing chicken nuggets. I provided him with vegan snacks but he still ate the chicken nuggets. I told him those weren't vegan and he told me he that he eats meat in school sometimes. His friends share their meals with him sometimes. I thought about telling my sister but decided not to. \n\nSo basically I continue to give him vegan options but don't say anything if he chooses the non vegan option. Usually he goes for the non vegan one. Maybe because because he never gets to at home. I know my sister would freak out if she knows he's eating meat. She's staunchly vegan and eating animal products goes against her ethical beliefs which I completely understand and respect. My husband thinks IATA for not telling her and being dishonest, but I think nephew is old enough to make his own dietary choices (he's 10 this year). \n\nSo, AITA? Should I tell my sister what's going on?  \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is about the author feeding their vegan nephew meat, even though their sister is raising him vegan. The nephew is 10, and he sometimes eats the non-vegan snacks the author provides. The author's sister is very strict about veganism, and the author's husband thinks they should have told the sister, but the author thinks the kid should be allowed to choose.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the parents' rights. The sister is raising her son as vegan, which is their right. The nephew is under her custody, so the author's sister has the authority to make decisions about his diet. By allowing the nephew to eat meat when she's in charge, the author might be undermining the parents' choices. Even though the author is providing vegan options, the nephew is choosing the meat, but that's only happening because the author is offering non-vegan food in the first place.\n\nThen there's the age of the nephew. At 10, he's a child, and his parents are responsible for his nutrition. Even if he's old enough to make some decisions, dietary choices, especially those based on ethical or health reasons, are usually made by parents for minors. The sister's stance is that eating animal products goes against her beliefs, so the author's actions might be conflicting with that.\n\nThe author's reasoning is that they respect the sister's beliefs but also think the nephew should have autonomy. However, in most legal and ethical frameworks, parents have the right to make health-related decisions for their children. The author isn't the parent, so they might be overstepping by allowing the child to eat meat against the parents' wishes. The sister might see this as a betrayal of her parenting choices.\n\nAlso, the sister might not be aware that her child is eating meat, which could cause her distress if she found out. The author's husband thinks they should be honest, which makes sense because deception could damage trust. The author's argument is that the nephew is making his own choices, but the environment they're creating by providing non-vegan options is influencing those choices. \n\nAnother angle is the potential health aspect. While the sister is vegan, the author's actions might expose the child to meat, which could have health implications if the sister's dietary choices are health-based. But the sister is the one making those decisions, so the author's role is to comply unless there's a medical reason to override, which isn't mentioned here.\n\nSo, weighing these factors, the author is not acting in accordance with the parents' wishes. Even if the author respects the sister's beliefs, providing non-vegan food to a child under someone else's care without the parent's consent could be seen as interfering in their parenting. Therefore, the author might be in the wrong by not respecting the sister's decisions and allowing the child to eat non-vegan food against her wishes.\n"
