He has been vegan since birth. My nephew and son attend the same school so I pick them up from school everyday. My nephew has snacks + dinner at my house every weekday before his mom comes to pick him up. \n\nI usually make a dish for my family and a separate vegan dish for my nephew. A couple of months ago I left them with their homework and snacks and went to do some chores, came back and found nephew &amp; son sharing chicken nuggets. I provided him with vegan snacks but he still ate the chicken nuggets. I told him those weren't vegan and he told me he that he eats meat in school sometimes. His friends share their meals with him sometimes. I thought about telling my sister but decided not to. \n\nSo basically I continue to give him vegan options but don't say anything if he chooses the non vegan option. Usually he goes for the non vegan one. Maybe because because he never gets to at home. I know my sister would freak out if she knows he's eating meat. She's staunchly vegan and eating animal products goes against her ethical beliefs which I completely understand and respect. My husband thinks IATA for not telling her and being dishonest, but I think nephew is old enough to make his own dietary choices (he's 10 this year). \n\nSo, AITA? Should I tell my sister what's going on?  \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for feeding their vegan nephew meat. The situation is that the sister is strict about being vegan, and the author, while making vegan options, sometimes lets the nephew eat non-vegan food when he chooses.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The sister is raising her son vegan, which is her ethical choice. The author, who is the aunt, is in a position where she's in charge of the kid for a few hours each day. The nephew is 10, so maybe old enough to make some choices, but still a child. The sister is staunchly vegan, so the author's actions could conflict with the sister's values.\n\nThe key points are: the author provides vegan options but allows the nephew to eat the non-vegan food if he chooses. The nephew knows they're not vegan but eats them anyway. The husband thinks the author is in the wrong for not telling the sister, while the author believes the nephew should have autonomy.\n\nLegally, the author isn't a guardian, so maybe not responsible for enforcing the sister's dietary choices. Ethically, though, it's about respecting the parents' wishes. The sister might see the author's actions as undermining her parenting. On the other hand, the nephew is making his own choices, and the author is providing both options. But since the sister is strict, the author might be in a conflict between respecting the parents' wishes and the child's autonomy.\n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong. If the sister expects the author to strictly adhere to vegan meals, then the author is going against that. However, if the nephew is choosing, maybe the author isn't forcing him. But the sister might still be upset if she finds out. The author's husband thinks she's in the wrong because they're being dishonest. But the author isn't lying; she's just not informing the sister about the nephew's choices.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? It's a bit of a grey area. On one hand, she's providing options and letting the child choose. On the other, she's not informing the parent, which could be seen as a lack of transparency. The sister might feel that the author is not respecting her parenting decisions. However, the nephew is old enough to make some choices, and the author isn't pressuring him to eat non-vegan. But the sister's values are important here. The author's actions might be seen as compromising the sister's beliefs, which could be considered wrong in terms of respecting parental choices. Alternatively, if the author isn't forcing the child, maybe it's not her fault.\n"
