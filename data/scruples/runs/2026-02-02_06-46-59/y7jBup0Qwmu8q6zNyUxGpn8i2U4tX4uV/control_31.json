He has been vegan since birth. My nephew and son attend the same school so I pick them up from school everyday. My nephew has snacks + dinner at my house every weekday before his mom comes to pick him up. \n\nI usually make a dish for my family and a separate vegan dish for my nephew. A couple of months ago I left them with their homework and snacks and went to do some chores, came back and found nephew &amp; son sharing chicken nuggets. I provided him with vegan snacks but he still ate the chicken nuggets. I told him those weren't vegan and he told me he that he eats meat in school sometimes. His friends share their meals with him sometimes. I thought about telling my sister but decided not to. \n\nSo basically I continue to give him vegan options but don't say anything if he chooses the non vegan option. Usually he goes for the non vegan one. Maybe because because he never gets to at home. I know my sister would freak out if she knows he's eating meat. She's staunchly vegan and eating animal products goes against her ethical beliefs which I completely understand and respect. My husband thinks IATA for not telling her and being dishonest, but I think nephew is old enough to make his own dietary choices (he's 10 this year). \n\nSo, AITA? Should I tell my sister what's going on?  \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The person is asking if they're in the wrong for feeding their vegan nephew meat. The sister is raising her son vegan since birth, and the author provides vegan meals but sometimes the nephew eats the non-vegan food. The author's husband thinks they're being dishonest by not telling the sister, but the author believes the nephew is old enough to choose. \n\nFirst, the sister's stance is clear: she's strict about veganism and would be upset. The author is in a middle ground\u2014respecting the sister's wishes by offering vegan options but allowing the nephew to choose otherwise. The nephew is 10, so maybe he's developing his own preferences, but he's still a child. \n\nLegally, the parents are the ones responsible for the child's diet. The author isn't the parent, so maybe they're not obligated to enforce the vegan diet. However, the sister might see this as undermining her parenting. The author's decision not to inform the sister could be seen as hiding something, especially since the sister might feel betrayed if she finds out. \n\nOn the other hand, the nephew is making his own choices, and the author is providing options. The author is not forcing the meat, just not stopping him. The key point is whether the author is being dishonest. Since the author isn't lying but is omitting information, it's a gray area. \n\nConsidering the sister's strong ethical stance, the author's actions might conflict with her values. But the nephew's autonomy is also a factor. The answer hinges on whether respecting the sister's wishes is more important than the child's autonomy. Since the author isn't a parent, maybe they're not in the wrong for not enforcing the vegan diet. However, the act of not informing the sister might still be seen as a breach of trust. \n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? It's a tricky balance. But since they're not the parent and the child is making choices, maybe B (not in the wrong) is the answer. However, if the sister expects strict adherence to veganism, then the author might be in the wrong for not informing. But the nephew's autonomy and the author's role as a caregiver without being the parent suggest B.\n"
