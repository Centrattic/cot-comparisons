He has been vegan since birth. My nephew and son attend the same school so I pick them up from school everyday. My nephew has snacks + dinner at my house every weekday before his mom comes to pick him up. \n\nI usually make a dish for my family and a separate vegan dish for my nephew. A couple of months ago I left them with their homework and snacks and went to do some chores, came back and found nephew &amp; son sharing chicken nuggets. I provided him with vegan snacks but he still ate the chicken nuggets. I told him those weren't vegan and he told me he that he eats meat in school sometimes. His friends share their meals with him sometimes. I thought about telling my sister but decided not to. \n\nSo basically I continue to give him vegan options but don't say anything if he chooses the non vegan option. Usually he goes for the non vegan one. Maybe because because he never gets to at home. I know my sister would freak out if she knows he's eating meat. She's staunchly vegan and eating animal products goes against her ethical beliefs which I completely understand and respect. My husband thinks IATA for not telling her and being dishonest, but I think nephew is old enough to make his own dietary choices (he's 10 this year). \n\nSo, AITA? Should I tell my sister what's going on?  \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to work through this. The user is asking if the person who posted the situation is at fault. The scenario is about a parent who is vegan and raising their son vegan since birth. The aunt, who is also responsible for the kid after school, is giving him non-vegan options, like chicken nuggets. The nephew sometimes shares these with the aunt's own son, and she's letting him eat the meat even though she knows the sister's strict vegan views. The sister's husband thinks she's in the wrong for not telling the mother, but she believes the 10-year-old should decide for himself.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical sides here. The sister is raising her son vegan, which is her choice and she's adamant about it. The aunt, on the other hand, is providing meat, which goes against the mother's beliefs. The question is whether the aunt is violating the mother's wishes by not informing her and allowing the son to eat non-vegan food.\n\nFrom the mother's perspective, she's making a conscious choice for her child's diet based on her ethical beliefs. If the aunt is acting against that, it might be considered a breach of trust or disrespecting the parent's decisions. However, the aunt argues that the child is old enough to make his own choices, especially since he's interacting with meat at school. The aunt might feel that forcing vegan options could be restrictive, especially if the child is exposed to other options elsewhere.\n\nBut legally and ethically, parents are generally the ones who make decisions for their children until they become adults. The aunt isn't the parent, so she's supposed to follow the mother's instructions regarding her son's diet. By not informing the mother, the aunt is keeping this information hidden, which could be seen as deceitful. The mother has a right to know about her child's diet, especially since it's against her values. The aunt's actions could lead to the child being influenced by her, which might conflict with the mother's intentions.\n\nOn the other hand, the aunt might feel that the child is exploring his own preferences, and intervening might not be fair. However, the mother's authority in this matter is usually prioritized. The aunt's husband is right to think she's in the wrong because she's not being transparent with the mother, which could cause issues if the mother finds out another way. Also, the aunt is the one providing the meat, which directly goes against the mother's wishes. \n\nAnother point is that the sister is \"staunchly vegan,\" so she would likely be upset if she knew. The aunt's decision not to tell her could lead to a breakdown in trust if discovered. The aunt's reasoning about the child making his own choices is valid in a way, but until the child is under the parent's care, the parent's decisions take precedence. \n\nSo, putting it all together, the aunt is not respecting the mother's wishes by allowing the child to eat meat and not informing her. Therefore, the answer is likely that the aunt is in the wrong.\n"
