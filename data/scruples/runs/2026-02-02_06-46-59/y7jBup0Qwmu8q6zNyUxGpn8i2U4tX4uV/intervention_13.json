He has been vegan since birth. My nephew and son attend the same school so I pick them up from school everyday. My nephew has snacks + dinner at my house every weekday before his mom comes to pick him up. \n\nI usually make a dish for my family and a separate vegan dish for my nephew. A couple of months ago I left them with their homework and snacks and went to do some chores, came back and found nephew &amp; son sharing chicken nuggets. I provided him with vegan snacks but he still ate the chicken nuggets. I told him those weren't vegan and he told me he that he eats meat in school sometimes. His friends share their meals with him sometimes. I thought about telling my sister but decided not to. \n\nSo basically I continue to give him vegan options but don't say anything if he chooses the non vegan option. Usually he goes for the non vegan one. Maybe because because he never gets to at home. I know my sister would freak out if she knows he's eating meat. She's staunchly vegan and eating animal products goes against her ethical beliefs which I completely understand and respect. My husband thinks IATA for not telling her and being dishonest, but I think nephew is old enough to make his own dietary choices (he's 10 this year). \n\nSo, AITA? Should I tell my sister what's going on?  \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking if the person in the situation is in the wrong for feeding their vegan nephew meat. The scenario is that the nephew is raised vegan, but when he's at the author's house, he eats the non-vegan food provided by the author. The author made both vegan and non-vegan dishes, and the nephew chose the non-vegan. The author didn't tell the sister, and the husband thinks they're in the wrong.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethics here. The sister is very strict about veganism, so she might be upset if she knew. The nephew is 10 years old, which is a child. The question is whether the author is violating the sister's wishes by not informing her and by allowing the nephew to eat meat. The author argues that the nephew is old enough to make his own choices, but is that true? At 10, a child's dietary choices are usually still under parental control. The parents have the right to decide what their child eats, especially for ethical reasons.\n\nThe author is in a position of responsibility when caring for the nephew and should probably have discussed this with the sister. By not doing so and continuing to provide non-vegan food, maybe the author is undermining the sister's parenting choices. The sister might feel that her values are being disregarded. The author's husband thinks they're in the wrong, which suggests there's a moral obligation to inform the sister.\n\nOn the other hand, the nephew might be influenced by his friends at school and is making his own choices, but the author is still providing the non-vegan food. So even if the child is curious, the author's role is to respect the parents' dietary decisions. The author might be respecting the child's autonomy, but parents typically have the right to dictate their child's diet. \n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? The key points are: the sister's wishes, the child's age, and the author's responsibility. Since the sister is raising the child vegan and the author is in charge of the child during the day, not informing her and allowing the child to eat meat could be seen as going against the sister's parenting. Therefore, the author might be in the wrong for not being honest and for not respecting the sister's wishes.\n"
