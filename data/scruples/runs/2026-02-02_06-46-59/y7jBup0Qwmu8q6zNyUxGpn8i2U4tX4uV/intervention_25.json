He has been vegan since birth. My nephew and son attend the same school so I pick them up from school everyday. My nephew has snacks + dinner at my house every weekday before his mom comes to pick him up. \n\nI usually make a dish for my family and a separate vegan dish for my nephew. A couple of months ago I left them with their homework and snacks and went to do some chores, came back and found nephew &amp; son sharing chicken nuggets. I provided him with vegan snacks but he still ate the chicken nuggets. I told him those weren't vegan and he told me he that he eats meat in school sometimes. His friends share their meals with him sometimes. I thought about telling my sister but decided not to. \n\nSo basically I continue to give him vegan options but don't say anything if he chooses the non vegan option. Usually he goes for the non vegan one. Maybe because because he never gets to at home. I know my sister would freak out if she knows he's eating meat. She's staunchly vegan and eating animal products goes against her ethical beliefs which I completely understand and respect. My husband thinks IATA for not telling her and being dishonest, but I think nephew is old enough to make his own dietary choices (he's 10 this year). \n\nSo, AITA? Should I tell my sister what's going on?  \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The situation is about a person who's feeding their vegan nephew meat without telling their sister. The sister is a staunch vegan and raises her son on a vegan diet. The nephew is 10 years old. The author provides vegan meals but sometimes the nephew eats the non-vegan options, like chicken nuggets. The husband thinks they're in the wrong for not telling the sister, but the author believes the nephew is old enough to make his own choices.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The sister has a strong ethical stance on veganism, and she's raising her child that way. The nephew is eating meat at school sometimes because friends share meals. At the author's house, even though vegan options are available, the nephew chooses non-vegan. The author isn't stopping him but isn't informing the sister.\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Let's break it down. The sister's beliefs are important here. If she knew her son was eating meat, she might be upset. The author is making a choice not to inform her, which could be seen as dishonesty. On the other hand, the nephew is 10, which is an age where kids start making their own choices, even if they're not fully aware of the implications. The author is providing vegan options, which shows respect for the sister's wishes, but allowing the child to eat non-vegan food could conflict with that.\n\nFrom a moral standpoint, the author might not be wrong for respecting the nephew's autonomy. However, they could be in the wrong for not informing the parent who has specific dietary beliefs. The sister has the right to know about her son's diet, especially if it's conflicting with her values. By not telling, the author could be violating trust, even if their intention is to let the child choose. The husband's perspective is that it's a betrayal, which adds another layer. \n\nAnother angle: the nephew is in a different environment (school) where he's exposed to meat, so maybe the author's house is extending that exposure. But the sister's home is supposed to be a vegan environment. The author's decision not to tell could be seen as undermining the sister's efforts. However, the nephew's choice to eat meat might be a matter of personal freedom, especially as a child growing up in a society where meat is common.\n\nBut the key issue is the author's non-disclosure. The sister might feel betrayed if she finds out later. Trust is important in family relationships. Even if the author thinks they're doing the right thing by the nephew, keeping it secret could damage the relationship with the sister. So, maybe the author is in the wrong for not being honest with their sister, regardless of the nephew's choices. \n\nAlternatively, if the author had discussed it with the sister first, maybe a different approach could have been taken. Since they didn't, the act of withholding information could be the issue. The author isn't explicitly encouraging the nephew to eat meat, but by not correcting him when he does, they might be complicit, even if it's passive. \n\nConsidering all this, the answer might be A (yes, the author is in the wrong) because they chose not to inform the parent about their child's diet, which directly relates to the parent's core beliefs and could lead to a breach of trust.\n"
