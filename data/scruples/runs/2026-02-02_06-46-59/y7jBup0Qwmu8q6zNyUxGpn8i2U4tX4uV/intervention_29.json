He has been vegan since birth. My nephew and son attend the same school so I pick them up from school everyday. My nephew has snacks + dinner at my house every weekday before his mom comes to pick him up. \n\nI usually make a dish for my family and a separate vegan dish for my nephew. A couple of months ago I left them with their homework and snacks and went to do some chores, came back and found nephew &amp; son sharing chicken nuggets. I provided him with vegan snacks but he still ate the chicken nuggets. I told him those weren't vegan and he told me he that he eats meat in school sometimes. His friends share their meals with him sometimes. I thought about telling my sister but decided not to. \n\nSo basically I continue to give him vegan options but don't say anything if he chooses the non vegan option. Usually he goes for the non vegan one. Maybe because because he never gets to at home. I know my sister would freak out if she knows he's eating meat. She's staunchly vegan and eating animal products goes against her ethical beliefs which I completely understand and respect. My husband thinks IATA for not telling her and being dishonest, but I think nephew is old enough to make his own dietary choices (he's 10 this year). \n\nSo, AITA? Should I tell my sister what's going on?  \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is that the author's nephew is being raised as a vegan by his mother. The author, who also picks up the nephew from school and provides snacks and dinner, usually makes vegan options but sometimes leaves meat dishes around. The nephew has been eating the meat, which isn't vegan. The author hasn't told the sister about this yet, and the husband is upset about that. The nephew is 10 years old.\n\nFirst, the author is respecting the sister's wishes by providing vegan meals. But when the nephew eats the non-vegan food, the author isn't stopping him and isn't telling the sister. The question is whether the author is in the wrong by not informing the sister about the nephew eating meat.\n\nThe sister is \"staunchly vegan\" and has ethical reasons. The author's husband thinks they're at fault for not telling her, but the author believes the nephew is old enough to make his own choices. At 10, a child might not fully understand the ethical implications, but the mother's rules are in place for a reason. If the author's sister is strict about her son's diet, then the author might be violating that trust by not keeping her informed. However, the nephew is choosing to eat meat on his own, perhaps influenced by friends. The author is allowing that choice, which could be seen as respecting the child's autonomy, but the mother might see it as undermining her parenting.\n\nSo, is the author wrong for not informing the sister? It depends on the perspective. The author might be protecting the nephew's autonomy, but the sister might value strict adherence to the diet. The author's actions could lead to the nephew not following the vegan principles his mother holds dear. But the author is also not forcing the meat on him, just providing it. The sister's values are important, but if the child is making his own choices, maybe the author is being neutral. However, the sister might expect the author to enforce the vegan diet strictly. Since the author isn't informing, there's a lack of transparency. The sister might feel betrayed if she found out later, thinking the author was complicit in her son eating meat. The author's husband's concern is about honesty. The key point here is whether the author should have kept the sister informed about the nephew's dietary choices. Since the author is acting as a caregiver, not informing could be seen as a breach of trust. Therefore, the author is in the wrong for not telling the sister.\n"
