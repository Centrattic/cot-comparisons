He has been vegan since birth. My nephew and son attend the same school so I pick them up from school everyday. My nephew has snacks + dinner at my house every weekday before his mom comes to pick him up. \n\nI usually make a dish for my family and a separate vegan dish for my nephew. A couple of months ago I left them with their homework and snacks and went to do some chores, came back and found nephew &amp; son sharing chicken nuggets. I provided him with vegan snacks but he still ate the chicken nuggets. I told him those weren't vegan and he told me he that he eats meat in school sometimes. His friends share their meals with him sometimes. I thought about telling my sister but decided not to. \n\nSo basically I continue to give him vegan options but don't say anything if he chooses the non vegan option. Usually he goes for the non vegan one. Maybe because because he never gets to at home. I know my sister would freak out if she knows he's eating meat. She's staunchly vegan and eating animal products goes against her ethical beliefs which I completely understand and respect. My husband thinks IATA for not telling her and being dishonest, but I think nephew is old enough to make his own dietary choices (he's 10 this year). \n\nSo, AITA? Should I tell my sister what's going on?  \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the situation is in the wrong. The scenario involves a vegan sister whose 10-year-old son is also raised vegan. The author feeds their nephew meat, even though they usually make vegan options, but the nephew sometimes chooses the non-vegan food. The sister is strict about her vegan ethics, and the husband thinks the author is in the wrong for not informing her. The nephew is old enough to make his own choices, but the sister might be upset if she found out.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The sister is raising her son vegan, and she's been vegan for many years. The nephew, who is 10, is eating meat when given the chance. The author's sister might not approve, but the author is respecting the nephew's choice to eat meat. The sister might see this as undermining her parenting choices.\n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong. On one hand, the nephew is old enough to make his own decisions, so maybe the author isn't doing anything wrong by allowing him to choose. On the other hand, the sister might feel that the author is not supporting her values and is possibly enabling the child to eat meat when she's against it. Also, there's a question of honesty here\u2014if the author is hiding the fact that the nephew is eating meat, that could be seen as dishonest towards the sister.\n\nBut, the author is providing vegan options, so they aren't forcing meat on the nephew. The nephew is making his own choices, which the author isn't preventing. However, the sister might have entrusted the author with her son's care, expecting him to adhere to the vegan diet. By not informing her, the author might be violating that trust.\n\nThe husband's perspective is that the author is in the wrong for not telling the sister and being dishonest. The sister's strict veganism is based on ethical beliefs, so she might consider this a breach of her parenting approach. The author's reasoning is about the nephew's autonomy, but at 10 years old, is the child's choice something that the parent (sister) should have control over?\n\nIn many cases, parents have the right to make decisions for their children, especially regarding health and dietary choices. If the sister has made it clear that her son should be raised vegan, the author might be overstepping by allowing the child to eat meat without her knowledge. Even if the nephew is making the choice, the author is the one who provides the non-vegan options, which could be seen as encouraging the child to deviate from the agreed-upon dietary guidelines.\n\nHowever, the author might argue that they are respecting the child's autonomy and not forcing anything on him. But the sister's trust is important here. If she had known the author would provide non-vegan food, she might have set different boundaries. The author's decision not to inform her could be seen as a breach of trust, which makes them in the wrong.\n\nSo, considering the sister's strict beliefs and the trust aspect, the author is in the wrong for not informing her about the nephew's choices and possibly violating her parenting decisions. The answer would be A (Yes, the author is in the wrong).\n"
