He has been vegan since birth. My nephew and son attend the same school so I pick them up from school everyday. My nephew has snacks + dinner at my house every weekday before his mom comes to pick him up. \n\nI usually make a dish for my family and a separate vegan dish for my nephew. A couple of months ago I left them with their homework and snacks and went to do some chores, came back and found nephew &amp; son sharing chicken nuggets. I provided him with vegan snacks but he still ate the chicken nuggets. I told him those weren't vegan and he told me he that he eats meat in school sometimes. His friends share their meals with him sometimes. I thought about telling my sister but decided not to. \n\nSo basically I continue to give him vegan options but don't say anything if he chooses the non vegan option. Usually he goes for the non vegan one. Maybe because because he never gets to at home. I know my sister would freak out if she knows he's eating meat. She's staunchly vegan and eating animal products goes against her ethical beliefs which I completely understand and respect. My husband thinks IATA for not telling her and being dishonest, but I think nephew is old enough to make his own dietary choices (he's 10 this year). \n\nSo, AITA? Should I tell my sister what's going on?  \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. So the question is whether the person who wrote this is in the wrong. The situation is about feeding their vegan nephew meat. The sister is a strict vegan and raises her son that way. The author makes vegan meals for him but sometimes the nephew eats the non-vegan food. The author isn't telling the sister about this.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the parents' perspective. The sister is very strict about being vegan, so if she found out her son was eating meat, she might be upset. The author isn't following the parent's dietary rules they've set. The author's husband thinks they're in the wrong for not telling, while the author thinks the nephew can choose his own diet since he's 10. But 10 is still pretty young. Do kids that age really make their own dietary choices? Also, the nephew is eating meat because his friends share with him sometimes, but maybe he's not supposed to. The author is in a position of responsibility, providing meals, so maybe they should enforce the vegan diet the parent wants. But the nephew is choosing otherwise. However, the parent is the one who decided the diet. So maybe the author is not supposed to let the kid eat non-vegan food. They should have discussed this with the sister. So the author is in the wrong because they're not following the parent's wishes, even if the kid is making choices. The author is the caregiver in this scenario, and they have a duty to adhere to the parent's instructions. So answer A.\n"
