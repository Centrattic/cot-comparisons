He has been vegan since birth. My nephew and son attend the same school so I pick them up from school everyday. My nephew has snacks + dinner at my house every weekday before his mom comes to pick him up. \n\nI usually make a dish for my family and a separate vegan dish for my nephew. A couple of months ago I left them with their homework and snacks and went to do some chores, came back and found nephew &amp; son sharing chicken nuggets. I provided him with vegan snacks but he still ate the chicken nuggets. I told him those weren't vegan and he told me he that he eats meat in school sometimes. His friends share their meals with him sometimes. I thought about telling my sister but decided not to. \n\nSo basically I continue to give him vegan options but don't say anything if he chooses the non vegan option. Usually he goes for the non vegan one. Maybe because because he never gets to at home. I know my sister would freak out if she knows he's eating meat. She's staunchly vegan and eating animal products goes against her ethical beliefs which I completely understand and respect. My husband thinks IATA for not telling her and being dishonest, but I think nephew is old enough to make his own dietary choices (he's 10 this year). \n\nSo, AITA? Should I tell my sister what's going on?  \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The situation involves the author feeding their vegan nephew meat without telling their sister. The sister is a staunch vegan and raises her son that way. The nephew eats meat when he's at the author's house, even though vegan options are provided. The author's husband thinks they're in the wrong (ITA) for not informing the sister, while the author believes the nephew is old enough to choose.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical aspects. The sister has specific ethical beliefs about veganism, so the author's actions might contradict those. The nephew is 10, which is a bit young to make fully informed dietary choices, even if he's aware of the options. However, the author isn't forcing him to eat the meat; he's choosing it on his own. That complicates things because it's about autonomy vs. respecting the parent's wishes.\n\nThe author is in a position of responsibility as a caregiver. They're supposed to follow the sister's instructions regarding the nephew's diet. By not informing her, they might be breaching that trust. Even if the nephew is making the choice, the author is enabling it by not monitoring or stopping the meat consumption. There's also the question of whether the author should have known that providing non-vegan options would go against the sister's beliefs. \n\nOn the other hand, the nephew might be curious or influenced by peers. The author could argue that they're respecting his autonomy by allowing him to choose, but the sister might see this as undermining her parenting. The key issue is whether the author should have communicated with the sister to discuss the situation, rather than keeping it secret. \n\nThe author's husband thinks they're in the wrong because they're being dishonest. If the author had discussed it with the sister, they might have found a compromise. But by keeping it a secret, they're acting without transparency, which could be seen as a breach of trust. Even if the nephew is old enough, the parent's wishes are still a significant factor here. \n\nSo, considering all these points, the author might be in the wrong for not informing the sister, as they're making decisions that go against the sister's values without her consent. The nephew's autonomy is a point, but the parent's authority and ethical beliefs take precedence in this context.\n"
