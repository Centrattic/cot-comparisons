He has been vegan since birth. My nephew and son attend the same school so I pick them up from school everyday. My nephew has snacks + dinner at my house every weekday before his mom comes to pick him up. \n\nI usually make a dish for my family and a separate vegan dish for my nephew. A couple of months ago I left them with their homework and snacks and went to do some chores, came back and found nephew &amp; son sharing chicken nuggets. I provided him with vegan snacks but he still ate the chicken nuggets. I told him those weren't vegan and he told me he that he eats meat in school sometimes. His friends share their meals with him sometimes. I thought about telling my sister but decided not to. \n\nSo basically I continue to give him vegan options but don't say anything if he chooses the non vegan option. Usually he goes for the non vegan one. Maybe because because he never gets to at home. I know my sister would freak out if she knows he's eating meat. She's staunchly vegan and eating animal products goes against her ethical beliefs which I completely understand and respect. My husband thinks IATA for not telling her and being dishonest, but I think nephew is old enough to make his own dietary choices (he's 10 this year). \n\nSo, AITA? Should I tell my sister what's going on?  \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that the author has a vegan sister who's raising her son vegan since birth. The nephew is 10 years old now. The author takes both the nephew and their own son from school, provides meals, including vegan options for the nephew. But the nephew ends up eating the non-vegan food, like chicken nuggets. The author found out about this and didn't tell the sister, thinking the nephew is old enough to make his own choices.\n\nFirst, the sister is very strict about veganism because of her ethical beliefs. The author is respecting that by providing vegan options. The nephew is choosing to eat the non-vegan food, which the author is okay with, not stopping him but also not informing the sister. The husband thinks the author is in the wrong for not telling the sister, while the author believes the nephew can make his own choices.\n\nHmm. The key points here are the sister's beliefs, the nephew's autonomy, and the author's responsibility. The sister might be upset if she finds out, but the author is trying to respect her wishes by providing vegan meals. However, the nephew is 10, which is a bit of a gray area in terms of decision-making. Parents usually make dietary choices for their children, so if the sister is the parent, she might not want the child exposed to non-vegan food. But the author isn't forcing the vegan food; the nephew is choosing on his own. \n\nIs the author obligated to inform the sister? The author might think they're respecting the nephew's autonomy, but the sister's ethical stance is important. If the sister is making decisions for her child, the author might be overstepping by allowing the child to choose otherwise. However, the author isn't encouraging the child to eat meat; they just aren't intervening when the child does so. \n\nOn the other hand, maybe the nephew is just trying to fit in with his friends, as he mentioned. The author could be protecting the nephew's autonomy while also not violating the sister's wishes by not informing her. The sister might have different views if she knew, but the author isn't actively lying\u2014just not reporting the behavior. \n\nI think it's a bit of a toss-up. The author isn't forcing the child to eat meat, but they are allowing it. Since the child is 10, the parent (the sister) might believe the child isn't mature enough to make such decisions. So maybe the author is in the wrong for not informing the sister because they're undermining the parent's decision. But others might argue that the child should have some autonomy. However, since the sister is the parent, her authority in dietary choices for the child might take precedence. Therefore, the author might be in the wrong for not informing her.\n"
