He has been vegan since birth. My nephew and son attend the same school so I pick them up from school everyday. My nephew has snacks + dinner at my house every weekday before his mom comes to pick him up. \n\nI usually make a dish for my family and a separate vegan dish for my nephew. A couple of months ago I left them with their homework and snacks and went to do some chores, came back and found nephew &amp; son sharing chicken nuggets. I provided him with vegan snacks but he still ate the chicken nuggets. I told him those weren't vegan and he told me he that he eats meat in school sometimes. His friends share their meals with him sometimes. I thought about telling my sister but decided not to. \n\nSo basically I continue to give him vegan options but don't say anything if he chooses the non vegan option. Usually he goes for the non vegan one. Maybe because because he never gets to at home. I know my sister would freak out if she knows he's eating meat. She's staunchly vegan and eating animal products goes against her ethical beliefs which I completely understand and respect. My husband thinks IATA for not telling her and being dishonest, but I think nephew is old enough to make his own dietary choices (he's 10 this year). \n\nSo, AITA? Should I tell my sister what's going on?  \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for feeding their vegan nephew meat. The author's sister is a staunch vegan and raises her son vegan since birth. The nephew is 10, and the author provides vegan snacks but sometimes the kid eats the non-vegan ones. The husband thinks they should tell the sister, but the author is torn because they think the nephew is old enough to choose his diet.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key factors: the child's age, the parents' dietary choices, and the author's role. At 10, the nephew is a child, and his parents (the sister) have made a conscious decision for his diet. The author isn't the parent, so they might not be responsible for enforcing the vegan diet. However, they are providing meals, so there's a responsibility to respect the parents' wishes unless there's a risk to the child.\n\nThe sister's strong ethical stance means that if she knew, she'd be upset. The author isn't forcing the meat on the kid; the child is choosing to eat it. But by not informing the mother, the author might be withholding information that the parent has a right to know. However, the child is old enough to express his preferences, so maybe the author is supporting his autonomy.\n\nBut in parenting, especially with dietary restrictions, parents make decisions for their children's health and beliefs. The author's sister is making an effort to raise her child vegan, so the author's actions might undermine that. The author isn't lying; they're not hiding the meat, they're just not reporting the child's choices. However, the parent should be aware of what their child is consuming, especially if it's against their values.\n\nThe author's husband thinks they're in the wrong for not telling, which adds another layer. The line between respecting the child's autonomy and respecting the parent's wishes is blurry here. Since the author is in a position where they are handling the child's meals, perhaps they have a duty to inform the parent, even if the child is making choices. However, the child might be experimenting with food preferences, and the parent might not want their strict views imposed on the child's autonomy.\n\nIn conclusion, the author is in a tough spot. They're not forcing the meat, but by not telling the sister, they might be withholding important information. However, the sister's rights as a parent versus the nephew's autonomy at 10 is a complex issue. The author's position is not entirely in the wrong because they're respecting the child's choices, but they might have a duty to inform the parent. However, since the child is making his own choices, maybe the author isn't directly responsible. I think the answer is B (not in the wrong) because the author isn't forcing the meat, and the parent's reaction is about their own values, not the child's health. The author is providing vegan options, and the child is choosing otherwise, which is his right as a growing child.\n"
