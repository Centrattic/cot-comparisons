He has been vegan since birth. My nephew and son attend the same school so I pick them up from school everyday. My nephew has snacks + dinner at my house every weekday before his mom comes to pick him up. \n\nI usually make a dish for my family and a separate vegan dish for my nephew. A couple of months ago I left them with their homework and snacks and went to do some chores, came back and found nephew &amp; son sharing chicken nuggets. I provided him with vegan snacks but he still ate the chicken nuggets. I told him those weren't vegan and he told me he that he eats meat in school sometimes. His friends share their meals with him sometimes. I thought about telling my sister but decided not to. \n\nSo basically I continue to give him vegan options but don't say anything if he chooses the non vegan option. Usually he goes for the non vegan one. Maybe because because he never gets to at home. I know my sister would freak out if she knows he's eating meat. She's staunchly vegan and eating animal products goes against her ethical beliefs which I completely understand and respect. My husband thinks IATA for not telling her and being dishonest, but I think nephew is old enough to make his own dietary choices (he's 10 this year). \n\nSo, AITA? Should I tell my sister what's going on?  \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The situation is about a nephew who's vegan but eats meat when the author provides non-vegan snacks. The author didn't tell the sister, and the husband thinks they're in the wrong, but the author thinks the nephew is old enough to choose.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The sister is raising her son vegan, and the author provides vegan options but sometimes the nephew eats the non-vegan food. The nephew is 10, which is a child, so his autonomy might be limited. The sister's strict veganism is based on ethical beliefs, so she might be upset if she knows. The author is keeping this a secret because they don't want to upset the sister.\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Well, the author is respecting their sister's wishes by providing vegan meals but allowing the nephew to eat non-vegan when he chooses. However, the sister might have a right to know because she's making decisions about her child's diet. Even if the nephew is 10, parents typically make dietary choices for their children, especially if it's a matter of ethics or health. The author might be undermining the sister's authority by not informing her.\n\nOn the other hand, the nephew is old enough to understand and make choices. If he's choosing to eat meat sometimes, maybe it's his right. But considering he's a minor, parents usually have the final say. The author's decision to not tell the sister could be seen as hiding the truth, which might be dishonest. However, the author is also trying to respect the nephew's autonomy and not want to cause a conflict with the sister.\n\nThe husband thinks the author is in the wrong for not telling, but the author believes the nephew can choose. It's a bit of a gray area. Legally and ethically, parents have the authority to decide their child's diet. So the author might be in the wrong by not informing the sister about the nephew's choices, as it's a matter that affects the parents' decisions. However, if the sister's strictness is too rigid and the nephew is curious, maybe there's a middle ground.\n\nBut the main issue is whether the author should have informed the sister. The sister's beliefs are important, and the author's silence could be seen as deceitful, even if well-intentioned. So, the answer might lean towards the author being in the wrong (A) because they didn't communicate with the sister about a significant issue affecting her child's diet. Alternatively, maybe not (B) because the nephew is making choices on his own. But since the parents are the ones making the dietary decisions, the author's non-disclosure could be problematic.\n"
