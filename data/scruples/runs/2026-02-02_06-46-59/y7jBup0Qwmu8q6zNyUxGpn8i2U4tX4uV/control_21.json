He has been vegan since birth. My nephew and son attend the same school so I pick them up from school everyday. My nephew has snacks + dinner at my house every weekday before his mom comes to pick him up. \n\nI usually make a dish for my family and a separate vegan dish for my nephew. A couple of months ago I left them with their homework and snacks and went to do some chores, came back and found nephew &amp; son sharing chicken nuggets. I provided him with vegan snacks but he still ate the chicken nuggets. I told him those weren't vegan and he told me he that he eats meat in school sometimes. His friends share their meals with him sometimes. I thought about telling my sister but decided not to. \n\nSo basically I continue to give him vegan options but don't say anything if he chooses the non vegan option. Usually he goes for the non vegan one. Maybe because because he never gets to at home. I know my sister would freak out if she knows he's eating meat. She's staunchly vegan and eating animal products goes against her ethical beliefs which I completely understand and respect. My husband thinks IATA for not telling her and being dishonest, but I think nephew is old enough to make his own dietary choices (he's 10 this year). \n\nSo, AITA? Should I tell my sister what's going on?  \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for feeding their vegan nephew meat. The situation involves the nephew being raised vegan, but when he's at the author's house, he sometimes eats the non-vegan food provided.\n\nFirst, the sister is raising her son on a vegan diet, which is a personal choice based on ethical beliefs. The author, however, allows the nephew to eat meat when he's at their house. The main conflict is between the parents' strict veganism and the author's approach of giving the child options. \n\nThe nephew is 10 years old, so the author argues he's old enough to make his own choices. But the sister might see this as undermining her parenting. The author isn't forcing the vegan food on the child, but they aren't preventing him from eating the non-vegan food either. \n\nFrom a legal standpoint, the child's parents are responsible for their dietary choices, so the author isn't breaking any laws. Ethically, it's a bit more complex. The sister might feel the author is encouraging the child to eat against her values. However, the author is providing vegan options, which shows they're respecting the sister's wishes, but also allowing the child some autonomy. \n\nThe husband's perspective is that the author is being dishonest by not informing the sister. But the author might believe the child should have some freedom in his choices, especially since he's at their house. The key here is whether the author's actions are in the best interest of the child and whether they respect the parents' wishes. \n\nSince the author is providing vegan options and not forcing the child to eat meat, they might be seen as facilitating the child's exploration of his own dietary choices. However, the sister's stance is strict, so the author's actions could be seen as conflicting with the parents' values. But since the author isn't intentionally violating the sister's instructions, and the child is making his own choices, the author's position might be justified. \n\nIn conclusion, while there's a conflict of values, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong because they're respecting the sister's dietary preferences by providing vegan options and allowing the child to choose. The decision to not inform the sister could be seen as a boundary issue, but the author's actions aren't malicious. So the answer would be B, not in the wrong.\n"
