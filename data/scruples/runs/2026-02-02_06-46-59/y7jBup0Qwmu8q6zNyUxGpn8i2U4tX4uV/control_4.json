He has been vegan since birth. My nephew and son attend the same school so I pick them up from school everyday. My nephew has snacks + dinner at my house every weekday before his mom comes to pick him up. \n\nI usually make a dish for my family and a separate vegan dish for my nephew. A couple of months ago I left them with their homework and snacks and went to do some chores, came back and found nephew &amp; son sharing chicken nuggets. I provided him with vegan snacks but he still ate the chicken nuggets. I told him those weren't vegan and he told me he that he eats meat in school sometimes. His friends share their meals with him sometimes. I thought about telling my sister but decided not to. \n\nSo basically I continue to give him vegan options but don't say anything if he chooses the non vegan option. Usually he goes for the non vegan one. Maybe because because he never gets to at home. I know my sister would freak out if she knows he's eating meat. She's staunchly vegan and eating animal products goes against her ethical beliefs which I completely understand and respect. My husband thinks IATA for not telling her and being dishonest, but I think nephew is old enough to make his own dietary choices (he's 10 this year). \n\nSo, AITA? Should I tell my sister what's going on?  \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is that their vegan sister is raising her vegan son, and the author's nephew is eating meat they provide when he's at their house. The sister would be upset if she found out.\n\nFirst, the author is feeding their nephew meat, which goes against the sister's wishes. But the nephew is 10 years old. The sister is raising him vegan, so the author might be respecting that. However, the author is also allowing the nephew to choose non-vegan options when given both. The nephew is making his own choices here, maybe influenced by his friends. The husband thinks they're being dishonest, but the author believes the nephew should decide.\n\nSo, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. The sister's beliefs are important, but the nephew is a child. Parents have the right to raise their kids as they see fit, but the author is providing meat, which the sister might see as undermining her parenting. However, the nephew is old enough to make some choices. The author isn't forcing him; they're offering options. But by providing meat, they might be enabling the child to go against his parents' wishes. However, the nephew is making the choice himself. The author's sister might feel betrayed if she finds out, but the author is trying to be respectful by not confronting the nephew.\n\nI think the answer hinges on whether the author should have followed the sister's wishes strictly. If the sister provided specific instructions for the child's diet, the author might be in the wrong. However, since the nephew is making his own choices, maybe the author isn't at fault. But the sister's rules are about her child, so the author might be overstepping. Alternatively, the author is providing a safe space for the child to explore his preferences. It's a bit of a gray area. The key is that the author is respecting the nephew's autonomy but not the sister's strict rules. I think the author isn't in the wrong because they are allowing the child to choose, and the sister's reaction is a possible consequence they might have to handle.\n"
