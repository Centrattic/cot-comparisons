He has been vegan since birth. My nephew and son attend the same school so I pick them up from school everyday. My nephew has snacks + dinner at my house every weekday before his mom comes to pick him up. \n\nI usually make a dish for my family and a separate vegan dish for my nephew. A couple of months ago I left them with their homework and snacks and went to do some chores, came back and found nephew &amp; son sharing chicken nuggets. I provided him with vegan snacks but he still ate the chicken nuggets. I told him those weren't vegan and he told me he that he eats meat in school sometimes. His friends share their meals with him sometimes. I thought about telling my sister but decided not to. \n\nSo basically I continue to give him vegan options but don't say anything if he chooses the non vegan option. Usually he goes for the non vegan one. Maybe because because he never gets to at home. I know my sister would freak out if she knows he's eating meat. She's staunchly vegan and eating animal products goes against her ethical beliefs which I completely understand and respect. My husband thinks IATA for not telling her and being dishonest, but I think nephew is old enough to make his own dietary choices (he's 10 this year). \n\nSo, AITA? Should I tell my sister what's going on?  \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The question is whether the author is in the wrong for feeding their vegan nephew meat. The sister is a staunch vegan and raised her son that way since birth. The nephew is 10 years old, and the author is providing both vegan and non-vegan options. The nephew has been eating the meat, but the author hasn't told the sister.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the sister's perspective. She's raising her child vegan for ethical reasons. If she knew her son was eating meat, she might be upset. The author isn't forcing the meat on the nephew; they're offering vegan snacks but also providing family meals. The nephew is choosing the meat on his own. The author might think the child should have autonomy in his choices, especially since he's 10. But at the same time, the sister might feel betrayed if she finds out, since she's the parent.\n\nThe husband thinks the author is in the wrong for not being honest, but the author isn't lying\u2014just not informing. The nephew is old enough to make some decisions, but he's still a child. Parents usually have the final say in their child's diet unless there are safety issues. The author isn't overstepping by offering options but isn't violating any laws or ethical issues by not reporting the nephew's choices. However, there's a potential conflict with the sister if she discovers this. \n\nIs the author responsible for enforcing the sister's dietary choices? Probably not. They're respecting the sister's wishes by providing vegan options. The nephew's choice might be influenced by wanting to fit in with friends. The author's husband is concerned about honesty, but withholding the information isn't necessarily a lie. The author is balancing the child's autonomy with the sister's beliefs. \n\nSo, the author isn't in the wrong because they're respecting both their sister's wishes and their nephew's autonomy without forcing the meat. The sister might be upset, but the author isn't violating any rules by not informing her. Therefore, the answer is B (No).\n"
