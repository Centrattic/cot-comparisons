He has been vegan since birth. My nephew and son attend the same school so I pick them up from school everyday. My nephew has snacks + dinner at my house every weekday before his mom comes to pick him up. \n\nI usually make a dish for my family and a separate vegan dish for my nephew. A couple of months ago I left them with their homework and snacks and went to do some chores, came back and found nephew &amp; son sharing chicken nuggets. I provided him with vegan snacks but he still ate the chicken nuggets. I told him those weren't vegan and he told me he that he eats meat in school sometimes. His friends share their meals with him sometimes. I thought about telling my sister but decided not to. \n\nSo basically I continue to give him vegan options but don't say anything if he chooses the non vegan option. Usually he goes for the non vegan one. Maybe because because he never gets to at home. I know my sister would freak out if she knows he's eating meat. She's staunchly vegan and eating animal products goes against her ethical beliefs which I completely understand and respect. My husband thinks IATA for not telling her and being dishonest, but I think nephew is old enough to make his own dietary choices (he's 10 this year). \n\nSo, AITA? Should I tell my sister what's going on?  \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The situation is about a parent who is vegan and raises their son vegan since birth. The aunt, who's the one asking, gives vegan options to her nephew but allows him to eat non-vegan food when he takes it. The sister (the aunt's sister) is very strict about her veganism and would be upset if she knew.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the perspectives here. The aunt is respecting her nephew's choices by not forcing him to stick strictly to vegan food, even though her sister might not agree. On the other hand, the sister might see this as undermining her parenting and values. The nephew is 10, which is a kid who might be influenced by peers and his environment. \n\nThe aunt is in a middle ground, providing vegan options but not policing his choices. She's also aware that her sister would be upset. The husband thinks she's in the wrong for not informing the sister, maybe because he sees it as a breach of trust or not respecting the sister's wishes. However, the aunt argues that the nephew is old enough to make his own decisions. \n\nFrom a moral standpoint, is the aunt wrong? Well, the sister is the one raising the child, so the aunt might be respecting the child's autonomy. But maybe the sister expects the aunt to maintain the vegan diet strictly. However, the aunt isn't forcing the vegan food on the child; she's providing the options and allowing choice. Since the child is in a different environment (school) where he's exposed to meat, the aunt isn't necessarily violating any rules. \n\nThe key points here are consent and the child's autonomy versus the parent's wishes. The aunt isn't lying; she's giving options and letting the kid choose. The sister might be upset, but the aunt isn't forcing the non-vegan food. Therefore, the aunt isn't in the wrong. The answer is B.\n"
