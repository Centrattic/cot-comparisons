I didn't think of using plan B as I have PCOS and was told it would be hard for me to have children without treatment, so at that point I was mostly worried about STDs. One month later I bought a pregnancy test as my period was late and it came back positive right away. I can't describe how I felt at that moment, I was euphoric because I realized I could have children but also terrified because I knew I wouldn't be able to keep my baby although I wanted it more than anything in the world.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI come from a very very conservative family, honour killings are frequent where my parents are from. I'm not allowed to date, let alone have sex before marriage, so them knowing about the pregnancy would be a death sentence for me. My cousin was severly beaten up by her father and brothers for hanging out with a boy after school. If they found out, they would take me to their home country and kill me there, and no one would know about it. They would also find a way to hurt my boyfriend. My parents trust me entirely and think I'm a virgin, they would lose their mind over this. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy boyfriend and I have often talked about what we would do if I got pregnant. He told me he would be there for me, get a full time job, an appartment. He always said it would be a blessing to have kids with me. I have told him about how my parents would react but he wouldn't understand. He thought they would be mad at me but would eventually let it go, but I know my parents and they would definetly not react this way. If my boyfriend found out I was pregnant he would'nt have let me get an abortion. I know he would have been thrilled to be a father.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo when I found out I was pregnant I knew what I had to do, but I was terrified, angry and disgusted at myself for doing this to my baby. I was nine weeks pregnant when I had a medical abortion at the hospital all by myself. \n\nI keep thinking about what would have happened if I was born into a different, more tolerant family. It's been five weeks since the abortion and I feel extremely disgusted with myself for doing this behind my boyfriend's back. It was his baby too and I really wish we could have kept it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\ntl;dr : I got pregnant and got an abortion to avoid being a victim of honour killing. I hid the pregnancy and abortion from my boyfriend because he would have wanted me to keep it, and doesn't believe what my parents are capable of in order to save their \"honour\". AITA ?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that she had an abortion without telling her boyfriend. The key points here are her reasons for doing so. She mentions her conservative family background where honor killings are common, and she's afraid that if they found out about the pregnancy, she and her boyfriend could be killed. She also says her boyfriend would have wanted to keep the baby, but she knew he didn't fully understand the danger from her family. She felt she had to act to protect herself.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal and ethical aspects. In many places, having an abortion is a legal right, especially in early pregnancy. The decision to have an abortion is often a personal one, influenced by various factors. However, the ethical part here is about whether she was wrong to not inform her boyfriend. \n\nHer boyfriend believed he would support her if she were pregnant, but she felt he wouldn't understand the severity of her family's reaction. She hid the pregnancy and the abortion. On one hand, she made a choice to protect herself from a very real and dangerous situation. On the other hand, her boyfriend had a right to know about the pregnancy and the decision to terminate it. \n\nBut the context is important. She was in a life-threatening situation where her family's reaction could lead to her death and her boyfriend's. So, she made a choice to protect herself under extreme circumstances. While withholding information from a partner is generally considered dishonest, the stakes here are exceptionally high. \n\nIn many discussions about such cases, the woman's autonomy and safety are prioritized, especially when there's a threat of violence. The question is whether the wrongness lies in the act of having an abortion or in not informing the partner. Since she had a valid medical reason and the abortion was legal, the focus shifts to the secrecy. However, given the potential for harm from her family, her decision to keep it secret might be seen as necessary for survival. \n\nThere's also the emotional aspect: she feels guilty for not telling her boyfriend and for the abortion itself. But guilt doesn't necessarily equate to being in the wrong. The decision was made under extreme pressure and fear. \n\nConsidering all this, the answer likely leans towards her not being in the wrong (B), as her actions were driven by self-preservation in a dangerous situation. However, there's a nuance where withholding information from a partner can be seen as a betrayal, but the context here is extreme. The higher priority is her safety and life.\n"
