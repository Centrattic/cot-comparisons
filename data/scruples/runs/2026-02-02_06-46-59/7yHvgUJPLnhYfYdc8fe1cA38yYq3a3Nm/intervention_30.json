I didn't think of using plan B as I have PCOS and was told it would be hard for me to have children without treatment, so at that point I was mostly worried about STDs. One month later I bought a pregnancy test as my period was late and it came back positive right away. I can't describe how I felt at that moment, I was euphoric because I realized I could have children but also terrified because I knew I wouldn't be able to keep my baby although I wanted it more than anything in the world.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI come from a very very conservative family, honour killings are frequent where my parents are from. I'm not allowed to date, let alone have sex before marriage, so them knowing about the pregnancy would be a death sentence for me. My cousin was severly beaten up by her father and brothers for hanging out with a boy after school. If they found out, they would take me to their home country and kill me there, and no one would know about it. They would also find a way to hurt my boyfriend. My parents trust me entirely and think I'm a virgin, they would lose their mind over this. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy boyfriend and I have often talked about what we would do if I got pregnant. He told me he would be there for me, get a full time job, an appartment. He always said it would be a blessing to have kids with me. I have told him about how my parents would react but he wouldn't understand. He thought they would be mad at me but would eventually let it go, but I know my parents and they would definetly not react this way. If my boyfriend found out I was pregnant he would'nt have let me get an abortion. I know he would have been thrilled to be a father.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo when I found out I was pregnant I knew what I had to do, but I was terrified, angry and disgusted at myself for doing this to my baby. I was nine weeks pregnant when I had a medical abortion at the hospital all by myself. \n\nI keep thinking about what would have happened if I was born into a different, more tolerant family. It's been five weeks since the abortion and I feel extremely disgusted with myself for doing this behind my boyfriend's back. It was his baby too and I really wish we could have kept it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\ntl;dr : I got pregnant and got an abortion to avoid being a victim of honour killing. I hid the pregnancy and abortion from my boyfriend because he would have wanted me to keep it, and doesn't believe what my parents are capable of in order to save their \"honour\". AITA ?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author of the \"Am I the Asshole\" post is in the wrong for having an abortion without telling her boyfriend. \n\nFirst, the situation: The couple had sex with a broken condom, leading to a pregnancy. The author came from a conservative family where honor killings are common. She feared that if her parents found out, they might kill her and her boyfriend. She and her boyfriend had discussed being open about a potential pregnancy, but he didn't take her concerns seriously. She decided to have a medical abortion secretly because she believed he would have wanted to keep the baby and she felt it was necessary for her safety.\n\nNow, the user thinks the author is in the wrong, but the question is to determine if that's the case. \n\nI need to consider a few angles. Legally, in many places, abortion is a personal choice, especially in early stages. However, the boyfriend's right to know about the pregnancy and the decision to terminate is also a factor. Ethically, the debate is around autonomy vs. shared decision-making. The author made the choice to protect herself and her partner from family violence. But some might argue that she should have discussed it with him, even if he didn't agree. \n\nHowever, the key point here is her safety. If she had told her boyfriend, he might have insisted on keeping the baby, which would have put both of them in danger. The author's decision was based on a real threat to her life and her partner's. Her parents' extreme actions and the cultural context of honor killings add significant pressure. \n\nIn terms of moral judgment, the question is whether she's in the wrong. The AITA format often looks at fairness, honesty, and consideration. She did lie to her boyfriend, but her reasoning is that he wouldn't have let her go through with the abortion, and it would have endangered them both. Her actions were driven by fear of death and the desire to avoid violence. \n\nOn the other hand, the boyfriend had the right to be informed about such a major life decision. The author might have felt she had no choice due to the imminent danger. But some might say that withholding such information, even with good intentions, is wrong because it denies the partner his right to be involved.\n\nBut considering the severity of the potential consequences\u2014life-threatening violence from her family\u2014it's a matter of survival. In many ethical frameworks, self-preservation is a primary concern. The author's decision to protect herself and her partner from harm could be seen as justifiable, especially if communication would have jeopardized their safety. \n\nThe boyfriend's lack of understanding about the family's reaction might mean he didn't take the threat seriously. The author, knowing her parents, felt the risk was too high. So, while she might have kept it a secret, the underlying reason is to prevent a dangerous outcome. \n\nIn conclusion, the author's actions were driven by a fear of violence and death. While she made a difficult choice without her partner's input, the necessity to protect both herself and him from her family's reaction likely makes her decision understandable and perhaps even necessary. So, the answer would be B (not in the wrong) because her decision was based on survival and preventing harm, even though the method of keeping it secret is ethically complex.\n"
