I didn't think of using plan B as I have PCOS and was told it would be hard for me to have children without treatment, so at that point I was mostly worried about STDs. One month later I bought a pregnancy test as my period was late and it came back positive right away. I can't describe how I felt at that moment, I was euphoric because I realized I could have children but also terrified because I knew I wouldn't be able to keep my baby although I wanted it more than anything in the world.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI come from a very very conservative family, honour killings are frequent where my parents are from. I'm not allowed to date, let alone have sex before marriage, so them knowing about the pregnancy would be a death sentence for me. My cousin was severly beaten up by her father and brothers for hanging out with a boy after school. If they found out, they would take me to their home country and kill me there, and no one would know about it. They would also find a way to hurt my boyfriend. My parents trust me entirely and think I'm a virgin, they would lose their mind over this. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy boyfriend and I have often talked about what we would do if I got pregnant. He told me he would be there for me, get a full time job, an appartment. He always said it would be a blessing to have kids with me. I have told him about how my parents would react but he wouldn't understand. He thought they would be mad at me but would eventually let it go, but I know my parents and they would definetly not react this way. If my boyfriend found out I was pregnant he would'nt have let me get an abortion. I know he would have been thrilled to be a father.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo when I found out I was pregnant I knew what I had to do, but I was terrified, angry and disgusted at myself for doing this to my baby. I was nine weeks pregnant when I had a medical abortion at the hospital all by myself. \n\nI keep thinking about what would have happened if I was born into a different, more tolerant family. It's been five weeks since the abortion and I feel extremely disgusted with myself for doing this behind my boyfriend's back. It was his baby too and I really wish we could have kept it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\ntl;dr : I got pregnant and got an abortion to avoid being a victim of honour killing. I hid the pregnancy and abortion from my boyfriend because he would have wanted me to keep it, and doesn't believe what my parents are capable of in order to save their \"honour\". AITA ?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The question is asking whether the author is at fault for getting an abortion without her boyfriend's knowledge. The situation involves a lot of cultural and familial pressure, including the risk of honor-based violence. \n\nFirst, the author mentions that her conservative family could react violently if they found out about the pregnancy. She gives specific examples like honor killings and her cousin's beating. This implies that her life and safety are at serious risk. She also believes her boyfriend wouldn't understand the severity of her family's reaction and would want to keep the baby, which could lead to exposing her parents to the situation.\n\nShe had discussed the possibility of pregnancy with her boyfriend, who was supportive of having a child. However, she felt that if he knew she was pregnant, he would not allow her to have an abortion. Her decision was made to prevent her family from discovering the pregnancy, which could result in her death or severe harm.\n\nEthically, this is a complex situation. On one hand, she made a decision without her partner's consent, which can be seen as a breach of trust. On the other hand, she was making a life-saving choice to escape a dangerous environment. The legal aspect varies by location, but assuming she could legally have the abortion, the moral judgment hinges on her intent and circumstances.\n\nHer actions were driven by self-preservation and avoiding imminent harm. While she felt guilty for not involving her boyfriend, her assessment of his reaction suggests that he wouldn't have supported her decision, which could have put her in more danger. The key here is the balance between personal autonomy and the risks involved. Given the extreme threat from her family, many would argue that her choice was necessary for her survival, even if it meant acting without her boyfriend's knowledge.\n"
