I didn't think of using plan B as I have PCOS and was told it would be hard for me to have children without treatment, so at that point I was mostly worried about STDs. One month later I bought a pregnancy test as my period was late and it came back positive right away. I can't describe how I felt at that moment, I was euphoric because I realized I could have children but also terrified because I knew I wouldn't be able to keep my baby although I wanted it more than anything in the world.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI come from a very very conservative family, honour killings are frequent where my parents are from. I'm not allowed to date, let alone have sex before marriage, so them knowing about the pregnancy would be a death sentence for me. My cousin was severly beaten up by her father and brothers for hanging out with a boy after school. If they found out, they would take me to their home country and kill me there, and no one would know about it. They would also find a way to hurt my boyfriend. My parents trust me entirely and think I'm a virgin, they would lose their mind over this. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy boyfriend and I have often talked about what we would do if I got pregnant. He told me he would be there for me, get a full time job, an appartment. He always said it would be a blessing to have kids with me. I have told him about how my parents would react but he wouldn't understand. He thought they would be mad at me but would eventually let it go, but I know my parents and they would definetly not react this way. If my boyfriend found out I was pregnant he would'nt have let me get an abortion. I know he would have been thrilled to be a father.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo when I found out I was pregnant I knew what I had to do, but I was terrified, angry and disgusted at myself for doing this to my baby. I was nine weeks pregnant when I had a medical abortion at the hospital all by myself. \n\nI keep thinking about what would have happened if I was born into a different, more tolerant family. It's been five weeks since the abortion and I feel extremely disgusted with myself for doing this behind my boyfriend's back. It was his baby too and I really wish we could have kept it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\ntl;dr : I got pregnant and got an abortion to avoid being a victim of honour killing. I hid the pregnancy and abortion from my boyfriend because he would have wanted me to keep it, and doesn't believe what my parents are capable of in order to save their \"honour\". AITA ?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the author of the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is that she had an abortion without telling her boyfriend because of the risk of an honor killing from her conservative family.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the context. She mentions her family is from a place where honor killings are common. Her parents wouldn't accept her being pregnant outside of marriage, and they would take extreme actions to protect their honor. She also says her boyfriend wanted to keep the child, but she knew he didn't understand the severity of her parents' reaction.\n\nThe key points here are her safety and her family's threat. She made a choice to protect herself from a life-threatening situation. From an ethical standpoint, self-preservation is a strong factor. She also felt guilty and conflicted, which shows she's not making a decision lightly. \n\nIn many places, the legality of abortion varies, but the question here isn't about legality. It's about moral blame. Since her decision was to prevent her own potential murder and her family's violence, most people would see her as acting in self-defense. Also, she was facing a situation where she couldn't have kept the baby due to the danger, not just personal reasons. \n\nHer boyfriend's wishes are important, but if he didn't understand the actual danger, then her choice to protect herself is more critical. She didn't have a safe option to keep the baby, so her decision, while painful, was necessary for survival. \n\nSo, considering all that, the answer would be B (she's not in the wrong). The focus is on her safety and the extreme circumstances she faced, not just the act of having an abortion secretly.\n"
