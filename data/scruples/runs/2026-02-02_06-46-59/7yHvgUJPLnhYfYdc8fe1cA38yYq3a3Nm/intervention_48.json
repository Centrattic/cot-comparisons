I didn't think of using plan B as I have PCOS and was told it would be hard for me to have children without treatment, so at that point I was mostly worried about STDs. One month later I bought a pregnancy test as my period was late and it came back positive right away. I can't describe how I felt at that moment, I was euphoric because I realized I could have children but also terrified because I knew I wouldn't be able to keep my baby although I wanted it more than anything in the world.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI come from a very very conservative family, honour killings are frequent where my parents are from. I'm not allowed to date, let alone have sex before marriage, so them knowing about the pregnancy would be a death sentence for me. My cousin was severly beaten up by her father and brothers for hanging out with a boy after school. If they found out, they would take me to their home country and kill me there, and no one would know about it. They would also find a way to hurt my boyfriend. My parents trust me entirely and think I'm a virgin, they would lose their mind over this. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy boyfriend and I have often talked about what we would do if I got pregnant. He told me he would be there for me, get a full time job, an appartment. He always said it would be a blessing to have kids with me. I have told him about how my parents would react but he wouldn't understand. He thought they would be mad at me but would eventually let it go, but I know my parents and they would definetly not react this way. If my boyfriend found out I was pregnant he would'nt have let me get an abortion. I know he would have been thrilled to be a father.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo when I found out I was pregnant I knew what I had to do, but I was terrified, angry and disgusted at myself for doing this to my baby. I was nine weeks pregnant when I had a medical abortion at the hospital all by myself. \n\nI keep thinking about what would have happened if I was born into a different, more tolerant family. It's been five weeks since the abortion and I feel extremely disgusted with myself for doing this behind my boyfriend's back. It was his baby too and I really wish we could have kept it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\ntl;dr : I got pregnant and got an abortion to avoid being a victim of honour killing. I hid the pregnancy and abortion from my boyfriend because he would have wanted me to keep it, and doesn't believe what my parents are capable of in order to save their \"honour\". AITA ?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The question is whether she acted wrongly by getting an abortion without telling her boyfriend. \n\nFirst, the situation: She had a broken condom, became pregnant, and decided to have a medical abortion secretly. Her reason was fear of an honor killing from her conservative family if they found out. Her boyfriend wanted to keep the baby and wouldn't have supported an abortion.\n\nSo, the main points to consider are her safety, her autonomy, and the relationship dynamics. She's in a dangerous situation with her family, where they might kill her if they knew about the pregnancy. She also believes her boyfriend wouldn't have supported the abortion, which is why she kept it a secret. She's struggling with guilt but feels it was necessary to protect herself.\n\nFrom a moral standpoint, is her decision to protect her life and safety justified? Honor killings are real and severe, so avoiding that is a strong defense for her choice. Her autonomy to make decisions about her body is another factor. However, withholding such a significant decision from her partner might be seen as a betrayal, especially since the baby was also his. \n\nBut given the context of imminent danger to her life if the family found out, her priority would be self-preservation. The boyfriend's reaction is valid, but if she's in life-threatening danger, her choice to protect herself might outweigh the relationship aspect. \n\nLegally, it's not about the law but ethics here. Ethically, when faced with a life-threatening situation, the person's survival is a primary concern. Her decision was made in a state of fear and to prevent a worse outcome. While keeping the pregnancy could have been an alternative, the risk of death makes her choice understandable, even if she feels guilty about it.\n\nSo, considering all factors, the author isn't in the wrong because her actions were necessary to protect her life. The answer is B.\n"
