I didn't think of using plan B as I have PCOS and was told it would be hard for me to have children without treatment, so at that point I was mostly worried about STDs. One month later I bought a pregnancy test as my period was late and it came back positive right away. I can't describe how I felt at that moment, I was euphoric because I realized I could have children but also terrified because I knew I wouldn't be able to keep my baby although I wanted it more than anything in the world.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI come from a very very conservative family, honour killings are frequent where my parents are from. I'm not allowed to date, let alone have sex before marriage, so them knowing about the pregnancy would be a death sentence for me. My cousin was severly beaten up by her father and brothers for hanging out with a boy after school. If they found out, they would take me to their home country and kill me there, and no one would know about it. They would also find a way to hurt my boyfriend. My parents trust me entirely and think I'm a virgin, they would lose their mind over this. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy boyfriend and I have often talked about what we would do if I got pregnant. He told me he would be there for me, get a full time job, an appartment. He always said it would be a blessing to have kids with me. I have told him about how my parents would react but he wouldn't understand. He thought they would be mad at me but would eventually let it go, but I know my parents and they would definetly not react this way. If my boyfriend found out I was pregnant he would'nt have let me get an abortion. I know he would have been thrilled to be a father.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo when I found out I was pregnant I knew what I had to do, but I was terrified, angry and disgusted at myself for doing this to my baby. I was nine weeks pregnant when I had a medical abortion at the hospital all by myself. \n\nI keep thinking about what would have happened if I was born into a different, more tolerant family. It's been five weeks since the abortion and I feel extremely disgusted with myself for doing this behind my boyfriend's back. It was his baby too and I really wish we could have kept it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\ntl;dr : I got pregnant and got an abortion to avoid being a victim of honour killing. I hid the pregnancy and abortion from my boyfriend because he would have wanted me to keep it, and doesn't believe what my parents are capable of in order to save their \"honour\". AITA ?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the abortion story is in the wrong. They want an answer A or B. The user thinks the author is in the wrong, but they're curious about my opinion.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze the situation. The woman had a pregnancy, got an abortion secretly to avoid her conservative family's reaction, which could lead to an honor killing. Her boyfriend wanted to keep the baby, but she didn't tell him because he wouldn't understand the risk. She's now feeling guilty.\n\nIs she in the wrong? Well, from a legal standpoint, in many places, abortion is legal, especially in early stages. The ethical angle is more complex. She made a decision to protect herself and her boyfriend from harm. Honor killings are real and dangerous. She didn't want to put them in danger. But she didn't inform her boyfriend, which is a breach of trust. However, given the context of her family's potential violence, maybe she felt it was necessary. \n\nOn the other hand, her boyfriend had the right to know as the father. But she was worried he wouldn't take the family's threat seriously. There's a conflict between her safety and his right to know. \n\nBut is she in the wrong? Some might argue she had no choice but to act in self-defense. Others might say lying to her partner is wrong. But considering the life-threatening consequences, her decision might be seen as justified. So maybe the answer is B, she's not in the wrong. However, the question is whether she's in the wrong. Depending on perspective, but given the severe risks she faced, perhaps she was justified. But there's also the moral aspect of not sharing the decision with her partner. However, if she had told him, he might not have taken the threat seriously, leading to even worse outcomes. So her choice was made under extreme pressure to save her life and his. Therefore, she's not in the wrong.\n"
