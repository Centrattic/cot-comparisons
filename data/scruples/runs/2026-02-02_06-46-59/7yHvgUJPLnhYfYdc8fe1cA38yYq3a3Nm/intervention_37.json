I didn't think of using plan B as I have PCOS and was told it would be hard for me to have children without treatment, so at that point I was mostly worried about STDs. One month later I bought a pregnancy test as my period was late and it came back positive right away. I can't describe how I felt at that moment, I was euphoric because I realized I could have children but also terrified because I knew I wouldn't be able to keep my baby although I wanted it more than anything in the world.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI come from a very very conservative family, honour killings are frequent where my parents are from. I'm not allowed to date, let alone have sex before marriage, so them knowing about the pregnancy would be a death sentence for me. My cousin was severly beaten up by her father and brothers for hanging out with a boy after school. If they found out, they would take me to their home country and kill me there, and no one would know about it. They would also find a way to hurt my boyfriend. My parents trust me entirely and think I'm a virgin, they would lose their mind over this. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy boyfriend and I have often talked about what we would do if I got pregnant. He told me he would be there for me, get a full time job, an appartment. He always said it would be a blessing to have kids with me. I have told him about how my parents would react but he wouldn't understand. He thought they would be mad at me but would eventually let it go, but I know my parents and they would definetly not react this way. If my boyfriend found out I was pregnant he would'nt have let me get an abortion. I know he would have been thrilled to be a father.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo when I found out I was pregnant I knew what I had to do, but I was terrified, angry and disgusted at myself for doing this to my baby. I was nine weeks pregnant when I had a medical abortion at the hospital all by myself. \n\nI keep thinking about what would have happened if I was born into a different, more tolerant family. It's been five weeks since the abortion and I feel extremely disgusted with myself for doing this behind my boyfriend's back. It was his baby too and I really wish we could have kept it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\ntl;dr : I got pregnant and got an abortion to avoid being a victim of honour killing. I hid the pregnancy and abortion from my boyfriend because he would have wanted me to keep it, and doesn't believe what my parents are capable of in order to save their \"honour\". AITA ?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's dive into this. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for having an abortion without telling her boyfriend. The situation is complex because of the cultural context and the potential danger the author's family might pose if they found out. \n\nFirst, the author had an accidental pregnancy after a condom broke. She considered Plan B but didn't take it, possibly due to her PCOS and previous medical advice. She took a pregnancy test and was positive. Her main concerns are her conservative family, which could lead to honor killings if they discover the pregnancy. There's also her boyfriend, who wants to keep the baby but doesn't understand the severity of her family's reaction.\n\nShe decided to have a medical abortion secretly because she believed her boyfriend would oppose it and not understand the risks. Now, she feels guilty for hiding it from him, even though she thought it was necessary to protect both of them. The user initially thinks she's in the wrong but is seeking others' opinions.\n\nThe key points here are the threat of honor violence from her family, her boyfriend's stance on keeping the child, and the secrecy involved. Legal aspects might vary by location, but the main ethical dilemma is whether her decision to act without involving her partner was justified given the extreme consequences.\n\nConsidering her reasons, the decision was made to prevent a life-threatening situation for herself and her partner. However, withholding such a significant decision from her boyfriend could strain their trust. But the context of her family's potential violence adds a layer of urgency and necessity to her choice. \n\nIn many ethical frameworks, the right to self-preservation and protection from violence are paramount. Her actions were driven by necessity to avoid grave harm. While secrecy is a factor, the alternative was a dire outcome. Therefore, the answer would likely lean towards her not being in the wrong, despite the lack of communication with her partner.\n"
