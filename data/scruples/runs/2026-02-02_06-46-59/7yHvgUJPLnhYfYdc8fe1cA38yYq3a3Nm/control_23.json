I didn't think of using plan B as I have PCOS and was told it would be hard for me to have children without treatment, so at that point I was mostly worried about STDs. One month later I bought a pregnancy test as my period was late and it came back positive right away. I can't describe how I felt at that moment, I was euphoric because I realized I could have children but also terrified because I knew I wouldn't be able to keep my baby although I wanted it more than anything in the world.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI come from a very very conservative family, honour killings are frequent where my parents are from. I'm not allowed to date, let alone have sex before marriage, so them knowing about the pregnancy would be a death sentence for me. My cousin was severly beaten up by her father and brothers for hanging out with a boy after school. If they found out, they would take me to their home country and kill me there, and no one would know about it. They would also find a way to hurt my boyfriend. My parents trust me entirely and think I'm a virgin, they would lose their mind over this. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy boyfriend and I have often talked about what we would do if I got pregnant. He told me he would be there for me, get a full time job, an appartment. He always said it would be a blessing to have kids with me. I have told him about how my parents would react but he wouldn't understand. He thought they would be mad at me but would eventually let it go, but I know my parents and they would definetly not react this way. If my boyfriend found out I was pregnant he would'nt have let me get an abortion. I know he would have been thrilled to be a father.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo when I found out I was pregnant I knew what I had to do, but I was terrified, angry and disgusted at myself for doing this to my baby. I was nine weeks pregnant when I had a medical abortion at the hospital all by myself. \n\nI keep thinking about what would have happened if I was born into a different, more tolerant family. It's been five weeks since the abortion and I feel extremely disgusted with myself for doing this behind my boyfriend's back. It was his baby too and I really wish we could have kept it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\ntl;dr : I got pregnant and got an abortion to avoid being a victim of honour killing. I hid the pregnancy and abortion from my boyfriend because he would have wanted me to keep it, and doesn't believe what my parents are capable of in order to save their \"honour\". AITA ?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for having an abortion without telling her boyfriend. The key points here are the cultural context, the safety of the author and her boyfriend, and the boyfriend's expectations.\n\nFirst, the author comes from a very conservative family where honor killings are common. She mentions that her parents would kill her and her boyfriend if they found out about the pregnancy. Her cousin was beaten for a less severe infraction, so the threat is real. This is a matter of her life and her boyfriend's. If she had told her boyfriend, he might have wanted to keep the baby, which would put them both in danger. She had to make a choice between her child and her survival.\n\nThe boyfriend believed they could handle the pregnancy and that the parents would eventually accept it. But the author knows her family's reaction would be fatal. She acted to protect herself and her partner from a life-threatening situation. While she feels guilty, the decision was made under immense pressure and fear. \n\nLegally and ethically, in many places, a person has the right to make decisions about their own body, especially in life-threatening situations. The boyfriend's right to know is important, but the author's right to self-preservation might take precedence here. The question is whether she was wrong in withholding the information. Given the potential consequences, her choice to prioritize her safety and her boyfriend's might be seen as necessary, even if it meant not sharing the decision. \n\nSo, considering the life-threatening circumstances and the cultural context, the author is not in the wrong. Answer B.\n"
