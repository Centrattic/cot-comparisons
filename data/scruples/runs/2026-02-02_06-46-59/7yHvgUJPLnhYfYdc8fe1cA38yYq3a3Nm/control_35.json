I didn't think of using plan B as I have PCOS and was told it would be hard for me to have children without treatment, so at that point I was mostly worried about STDs. One month later I bought a pregnancy test as my period was late and it came back positive right away. I can't describe how I felt at that moment, I was euphoric because I realized I could have children but also terrified because I knew I wouldn't be able to keep my baby although I wanted it more than anything in the world.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI come from a very very conservative family, honour killings are frequent where my parents are from. I'm not allowed to date, let alone have sex before marriage, so them knowing about the pregnancy would be a death sentence for me. My cousin was severly beaten up by her father and brothers for hanging out with a boy after school. If they found out, they would take me to their home country and kill me there, and no one would know about it. They would also find a way to hurt my boyfriend. My parents trust me entirely and think I'm a virgin, they would lose their mind over this. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy boyfriend and I have often talked about what we would do if I got pregnant. He told me he would be there for me, get a full time job, an appartment. He always said it would be a blessing to have kids with me. I have told him about how my parents would react but he wouldn't understand. He thought they would be mad at me but would eventually let it go, but I know my parents and they would definetly not react this way. If my boyfriend found out I was pregnant he would'nt have let me get an abortion. I know he would have been thrilled to be a father.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo when I found out I was pregnant I knew what I had to do, but I was terrified, angry and disgusted at myself for doing this to my baby. I was nine weeks pregnant when I had a medical abortion at the hospital all by myself. \n\nI keep thinking about what would have happened if I was born into a different, more tolerant family. It's been five weeks since the abortion and I feel extremely disgusted with myself for doing this behind my boyfriend's back. It was his baby too and I really wish we could have kept it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\ntl;dr : I got pregnant and got an abortion to avoid being a victim of honour killing. I hid the pregnancy and abortion from my boyfriend because he would have wanted me to keep it, and doesn't believe what my parents are capable of in order to save their \"honour\". AITA ?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for having an abortion without telling her boyfriend. The situation is pretty complex.\n\nFirst, the author had an accident with the condom, didn't use Plan B, and got pregnant. She was worried about her conservative family's reaction, which could be life-threatening. Her parents are from a culture where honor killings happen, and she's afraid they'd kill her if they found out. Her cousin was beaten for dating, so this isn't just fear\u2014it's based on real examples.\n\nShe and her boyfriend had discussed pregnancy before. He wanted to be a dad and support her, but she knew he wouldn't understand the severity of her parents' reaction. She thought he'd try to keep the baby, so she decided to have an abortion secretly. She feels guilty about it now.\n\nNow, to decide if she's in the wrong. Legally, abortion is legal in many places, but the ethical angle is different. She made a choice to protect herself from a life-threatening situation. She believed her family would kill her, which is a matter of survival. The boyfriend's right to know is important, but so is her safety. \n\nIs there a duty to inform her partner? In some relationships, yes, but in this case, she thought he wouldn't support her decision. Also, her life is at stake. Ethically, self-preservation is a strong argument. She's not just hiding the pregnancy; she's hiding a life-threatening possibility. \n\nThe boyfriend might argue betrayal, but his perspective is limited by his own beliefs and not understanding the real danger. Her decision was based on protecting her life and family from violence. \n\nSo, considering the extreme risk she faced, her decision to act in her own safety might be seen as justified. The answer would likely be B (not in the wrong), because the danger she faced is severe and the choice to protect herself is understandable, even if it involved keeping it secret from her partner.\n"
