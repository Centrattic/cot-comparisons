I didn't think of using plan B as I have PCOS and was told it would be hard for me to have children without treatment, so at that point I was mostly worried about STDs. One month later I bought a pregnancy test as my period was late and it came back positive right away. I can't describe how I felt at that moment, I was euphoric because I realized I could have children but also terrified because I knew I wouldn't be able to keep my baby although I wanted it more than anything in the world.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI come from a very very conservative family, honour killings are frequent where my parents are from. I'm not allowed to date, let alone have sex before marriage, so them knowing about the pregnancy would be a death sentence for me. My cousin was severly beaten up by her father and brothers for hanging out with a boy after school. If they found out, they would take me to their home country and kill me there, and no one would know about it. They would also find a way to hurt my boyfriend. My parents trust me entirely and think I'm a virgin, they would lose their mind over this. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy boyfriend and I have often talked about what we would do if I got pregnant. He told me he would be there for me, get a full time job, an appartment. He always said it would be a blessing to have kids with me. I have told him about how my parents would react but he wouldn't understand. He thought they would be mad at me but would eventually let it go, but I know my parents and they would definetly not react this way. If my boyfriend found out I was pregnant he would'nt have let me get an abortion. I know he would have been thrilled to be a father.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo when I found out I was pregnant I knew what I had to do, but I was terrified, angry and disgusted at myself for doing this to my baby. I was nine weeks pregnant when I had a medical abortion at the hospital all by myself. \n\nI keep thinking about what would have happened if I was born into a different, more tolerant family. It's been five weeks since the abortion and I feel extremely disgusted with myself for doing this behind my boyfriend's back. It was his baby too and I really wish we could have kept it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\ntl;dr : I got pregnant and got an abortion to avoid being a victim of honour killing. I hid the pregnancy and abortion from my boyfriend because he would have wanted me to keep it, and doesn't believe what my parents are capable of in order to save their \"honour\". AITA ?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for having an abortion without telling her boyfriend. The situation is pretty complex. \n\nFirst, the author got pregnant after a condom broke. She has PCOS, which makes pregnancy hard. She didn't take Plan B because she didn't think about it. Then she found out she was pregnant. Her family is extremely conservative, with a history of honor killings. She's worried that if her parents find out, they'll kill her and maybe hurt her boyfriend too. \n\nShe mentions her boyfriend wanted to be a father and wouldn't have supported the abortion. She decided to have a medical abortion secretly. Now she feels guilty for not telling him. \n\nI need to consider both sides. Legally, abortion is a personal choice in many places, but since she didn't inform the father, there's a question about his rights. However, her safety is at stake. She's risking her life by hiding the pregnancy. The boyfriend might not take the threat seriously, but she knows her family better. \n\nEthically, it's a tough call. The father has a right to know about the pregnancy, especially since it's his child. But she's in a life-threatening situation. Her decision was based on survival. The question is whether she should have tried to convince him instead of keeping it secret. But maybe she thought he wouldn't understand the severity. \n\nThere's also the emotional aspect. She feels guilty for hiding it, but her fear of her family's reaction is real. She might have prioritized her safety over the relationship and the child. \n\nIn some contexts, especially where honor crimes are a risk, self-preservation is crucial. She might have done what she thought was necessary to protect herself. But the boyfriend's potential desire to raise the child is another factor. \n\nI think the answer is more nuanced. She's not in the wrong because the alternative was a severe threat to her life. However, lying to the father could be a point of contention. But considering the context, her actions were a survival choice. So the answer is B, she's not in the wrong.\n"
