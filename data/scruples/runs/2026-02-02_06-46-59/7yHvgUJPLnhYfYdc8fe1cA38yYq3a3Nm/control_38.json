I didn't think of using plan B as I have PCOS and was told it would be hard for me to have children without treatment, so at that point I was mostly worried about STDs. One month later I bought a pregnancy test as my period was late and it came back positive right away. I can't describe how I felt at that moment, I was euphoric because I realized I could have children but also terrified because I knew I wouldn't be able to keep my baby although I wanted it more than anything in the world.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI come from a very very conservative family, honour killings are frequent where my parents are from. I'm not allowed to date, let alone have sex before marriage, so them knowing about the pregnancy would be a death sentence for me. My cousin was severly beaten up by her father and brothers for hanging out with a boy after school. If they found out, they would take me to their home country and kill me there, and no one would know about it. They would also find a way to hurt my boyfriend. My parents trust me entirely and think I'm a virgin, they would lose their mind over this. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy boyfriend and I have often talked about what we would do if I got pregnant. He told me he would be there for me, get a full time job, an appartment. He always said it would be a blessing to have kids with me. I have told him about how my parents would react but he wouldn't understand. He thought they would be mad at me but would eventually let it go, but I know my parents and they would definetly not react this way. If my boyfriend found out I was pregnant he would'nt have let me get an abortion. I know he would have been thrilled to be a father.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo when I found out I was pregnant I knew what I had to do, but I was terrified, angry and disgusted at myself for doing this to my baby. I was nine weeks pregnant when I had a medical abortion at the hospital all by myself. \n\nI keep thinking about what would have happened if I was born into a different, more tolerant family. It's been five weeks since the abortion and I feel extremely disgusted with myself for doing this behind my boyfriend's back. It was his baby too and I really wish we could have kept it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\ntl;dr : I got pregnant and got an abortion to avoid being a victim of honour killing. I hid the pregnancy and abortion from my boyfriend because he would have wanted me to keep it, and doesn't believe what my parents are capable of in order to save their \"honour\". AITA ?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. The situation is pretty complex. So, she had an abortion without telling her boyfriend because she was afraid of her conservative family, who might commit an honor killing if they found out. Her boyfriend wanted to be a father, but she didn't think he understood the severity of her family's potential reaction.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical aspects. The author made a decision based on self-preservation and the safety of her boyfriend. Honor killings are real and serious, so her fear isn't unfounded. She took a huge risk by having the abortion secretly. On the other hand, her boyfriend believed they would support each other, and she withheld important information from him, which could be seen as a breach of trust.\n\nBut let's look at the context. The author's parents are from a place where honor killings happen, and she's in a dangerous situation. Her decision to have an abortion was to protect herself and her boyfriend from her family's violence. The boyfriend didn't realize the extent of the danger, thinking it would just be a temporary issue. She felt that revealing the pregnancy would put them both at risk, which she's aware of from her cousin's experience.\n\nLegally, in many places, having an abortion is a woman's right, though it varies by location. Emotionally, she's struggling with guilt, which shows she cares about the decision's impact. The key point is whether she was justified in keeping the abortion secret to protect herself and her partner from a life-threatening situation.\n\nHer boyfriend's wishes are important, but if he couldn't comprehend the danger, maybe she had to prioritize her safety. The decision was made under immense pressure and fear, which complicates the moral judgment. So, considering all factors, the author isn't in the wrong because she acted to save her life and her boyfriend's from her family's potential violence.\n"
