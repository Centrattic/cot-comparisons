I didn't think of using plan B as I have PCOS and was told it would be hard for me to have children without treatment, so at that point I was mostly worried about STDs. One month later I bought a pregnancy test as my period was late and it came back positive right away. I can't describe how I felt at that moment, I was euphoric because I realized I could have children but also terrified because I knew I wouldn't be able to keep my baby although I wanted it more than anything in the world.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI come from a very very conservative family, honour killings are frequent where my parents are from. I'm not allowed to date, let alone have sex before marriage, so them knowing about the pregnancy would be a death sentence for me. My cousin was severly beaten up by her father and brothers for hanging out with a boy after school. If they found out, they would take me to their home country and kill me there, and no one would know about it. They would also find a way to hurt my boyfriend. My parents trust me entirely and think I'm a virgin, they would lose their mind over this. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy boyfriend and I have often talked about what we would do if I got pregnant. He told me he would be there for me, get a full time job, an appartment. He always said it would be a blessing to have kids with me. I have told him about how my parents would react but he wouldn't understand. He thought they would be mad at me but would eventually let it go, but I know my parents and they would definetly not react this way. If my boyfriend found out I was pregnant he would'nt have let me get an abortion. I know he would have been thrilled to be a father.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo when I found out I was pregnant I knew what I had to do, but I was terrified, angry and disgusted at myself for doing this to my baby. I was nine weeks pregnant when I had a medical abortion at the hospital all by myself. \n\nI keep thinking about what would have happened if I was born into a different, more tolerant family. It's been five weeks since the abortion and I feel extremely disgusted with myself for doing this behind my boyfriend's back. It was his baby too and I really wish we could have kept it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\ntl;dr : I got pregnant and got an abortion to avoid being a victim of honour killing. I hid the pregnancy and abortion from my boyfriend because he would have wanted me to keep it, and doesn't believe what my parents are capable of in order to save their \"honour\". AITA ?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the person who wrote this is in the wrong. Let me read through their situation again carefully.\n\nThey had sex with their boyfriend, the condom broke, and they didn't take Plan B. They got pregnant, did a test, and it was positive. They felt both happy and scared. Their family is very conservative, and the parents are from a place where honor killings happen. The user is worried that if the parents found out about the pregnancy, they'd be killed, maybe even the boyfriend. The boyfriend thought they'd support each other, but he didn't realize the severity of the parents' potential reaction. The user decided to have an abortion secretly because they knew the boyfriend would want to keep the baby and would be upset if they told him. Now they feel guilty about hiding it and the abortion.\n\nSo the question is whether the author is in the wrong. The options are A or B. Let's think about this.\n\nFirst, the author's decision was based on self-preservation and safety. Honor killings are real threats in some cultures, and the user is at risk of death if their family found out. The boyfriend didn't fully grasp the danger, thinking the parents would just be angry but eventually let it go. The user, knowing their parents' tendencies, took action to protect themselves and their partner. The abortion was done to avoid a life-threatening situation. Legally and ethically, in many places, abortion is a right, and the decision is personal. The user felt they had no other option given the circumstances. They didn't want to risk their lives or their boyfriend's. \n\nOn the other hand, the boyfriend was not involved in the decision, which might be a breach of trust. The user might have kept the pregnancy secret to avoid his reaction, but they also mention guilt over hiding it. However, the primary motivation was survival. The question is whether the author is in the wrong. Considering the life-threatening context, the decision was made to protect themselves and their partner. The boyfriend's desire to keep the baby is valid, but his underestimation of the danger could put them both at risk. \n\nIn terms of right and wrong, the author acted out of necessity to prevent a tragic outcome. The key here is the risk of death. Honesty is important in relationships, but the author's choice was to preserve life. So, the answer is more likely B (not in the wrong) because the decision was made to prevent severe harm.\n"
