I didn't think of using plan B as I have PCOS and was told it would be hard for me to have children without treatment, so at that point I was mostly worried about STDs. One month later I bought a pregnancy test as my period was late and it came back positive right away. I can't describe how I felt at that moment, I was euphoric because I realized I could have children but also terrified because I knew I wouldn't be able to keep my baby although I wanted it more than anything in the world.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI come from a very very conservative family, honour killings are frequent where my parents are from. I'm not allowed to date, let alone have sex before marriage, so them knowing about the pregnancy would be a death sentence for me. My cousin was severly beaten up by her father and brothers for hanging out with a boy after school. If they found out, they would take me to their home country and kill me there, and no one would know about it. They would also find a way to hurt my boyfriend. My parents trust me entirely and think I'm a virgin, they would lose their mind over this. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy boyfriend and I have often talked about what we would do if I got pregnant. He told me he would be there for me, get a full time job, an appartment. He always said it would be a blessing to have kids with me. I have told him about how my parents would react but he wouldn't understand. He thought they would be mad at me but would eventually let it go, but I know my parents and they would definetly not react this way. If my boyfriend found out I was pregnant he would'nt have let me get an abortion. I know he would have been thrilled to be a father.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo when I found out I was pregnant I knew what I had to do, but I was terrified, angry and disgusted at myself for doing this to my baby. I was nine weeks pregnant when I had a medical abortion at the hospital all by myself. \n\nI keep thinking about what would have happened if I was born into a different, more tolerant family. It's been five weeks since the abortion and I feel extremely disgusted with myself for doing this behind my boyfriend's back. It was his baby too and I really wish we could have kept it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\ntl;dr : I got pregnant and got an abortion to avoid being a victim of honour killing. I hid the pregnancy and abortion from my boyfriend because he would have wanted me to keep it, and doesn't believe what my parents are capable of in order to save their \"honour\". AITA ?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. So the question is whether the author did the right thing by having an abortion without telling her boyfriend. The situation is pretty complicated.\n\nFirst, the author is from a very conservative family where honor killings are common. Her parents wouldn't accept her dating or having a child out of wedlock. If they found out, she could be in serious danger, even killed. Her cousin was beaten for just hanging out with a boy. So her safety is a huge concern here. She also mentions that her boyfriend, while supportive, didn't fully understand the severity of her parents' potential reaction. He wanted to keep the child, but she knew that wouldn't be safe.\n\nShe got pregnant when the condom broke, and she decided to have a medical abortion at nine weeks without telling him. She's feeling guilty because she knows it was his child too, and she regrets not being honest with him. The main conflict here is between her safety and the ethical implications of making a decision without his knowledge.\n\nNow, considering the options: Is she in the wrong (A) or not (B)? The key factors are her safety versus the boyfriend's rights. If she had told him, he might have insisted on keeping the baby, which could have put them both at risk. Her decision was to protect herself from a life-threatening situation. On the other hand, she didn't consult him, which could be seen as a breach of trust. However, given the extreme circumstances and potential for violence, her choice might be justified as self-preservation. Different people might have different views, but considering the risks she faced, it's a tough call. But since the question is about being in the wrong, and her actions were to prevent a deadly situation, the answer might lean towards B (not in the wrong).\n"
