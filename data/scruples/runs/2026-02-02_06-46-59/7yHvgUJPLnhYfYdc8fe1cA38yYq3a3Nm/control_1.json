I didn't think of using plan B as I have PCOS and was told it would be hard for me to have children without treatment, so at that point I was mostly worried about STDs. One month later I bought a pregnancy test as my period was late and it came back positive right away. I can't describe how I felt at that moment, I was euphoric because I realized I could have children but also terrified because I knew I wouldn't be able to keep my baby although I wanted it more than anything in the world.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI come from a very very conservative family, honour killings are frequent where my parents are from. I'm not allowed to date, let alone have sex before marriage, so them knowing about the pregnancy would be a death sentence for me. My cousin was severly beaten up by her father and brothers for hanging out with a boy after school. If they found out, they would take me to their home country and kill me there, and no one would know about it. They would also find a way to hurt my boyfriend. My parents trust me entirely and think I'm a virgin, they would lose their mind over this. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy boyfriend and I have often talked about what we would do if I got pregnant. He told me he would be there for me, get a full time job, an appartment. He always said it would be a blessing to have kids with me. I have told him about how my parents would react but he wouldn't understand. He thought they would be mad at me but would eventually let it go, but I know my parents and they would definetly not react this way. If my boyfriend found out I was pregnant he would'nt have let me get an abortion. I know he would have been thrilled to be a father.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo when I found out I was pregnant I knew what I had to do, but I was terrified, angry and disgusted at myself for doing this to my baby. I was nine weeks pregnant when I had a medical abortion at the hospital all by myself. \n\nI keep thinking about what would have happened if I was born into a different, more tolerant family. It's been five weeks since the abortion and I feel extremely disgusted with myself for doing this behind my boyfriend's back. It was his baby too and I really wish we could have kept it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\ntl;dr : I got pregnant and got an abortion to avoid being a victim of honour killing. I hid the pregnancy and abortion from my boyfriend because he would have wanted me to keep it, and doesn't believe what my parents are capable of in order to save their \"honour\". AITA ?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the person in this situation is in the wrong. Let me read through the details again carefully.\n\nThe person had an abortion without telling her boyfriend. The situation is complicated by her conservative family background, where an honor killing is a real possibility if the pregnancy is discovered. Her boyfriend wants to be a father and thought her parents would eventually accept the situation, but the author knows her parents would kill her if they found out. She got the abortion to protect herself and her boyfriend from her family's violence. She's now feeling guilty for not telling her boyfriend, even though she thought he would not let her have the abortion. \n\nSo the key points here are her safety and her boyfriend's safety being at risk if the family found out. The decision to have an abortion was made to prevent a life-threatening situation. She withheld the information because she believed her boyfriend wouldn't support the abortion, which he wanted to keep the child. But her priority was survival given the context of her family's extreme behavior.\n\nNow, the question is whether she's in the wrong. From a legal standpoint, abortion is legal in many places, but the ethical aspect is more about the decision to hide it from her boyfriend. However, considering the life-threatening scenario for both her and her partner, her choice might be seen as a necessary action to prevent violence. \n\nThe boyfriend's perspective is important too. He didn't know and would have wanted to keep the baby. But his perception of the family's reaction was less severe than hers. She had more accurate information about the risks. In such extreme cases, the moral obligation might be to protect oneself from imminent danger. \n\nIn many ethical frameworks, self-preservation is a valid reason for difficult decisions. The author isn't just making a personal choice; she's protecting herself and others from a violent family. The boyfriend's desire to be a father is valid, but if the alternative is death, the abortion becomes a matter of life and death. \n\nTherefore, the author isn't in the wrong because her actions were taken to prevent a much worse outcome. The decision was made in a context of life-threatening risk, and she acted based on her knowledge of her family's behavior. The boyfriend's lack of awareness of the true danger doesn't shift the responsibility to her. Hence, the answer is B (Not in the wrong).\n"
