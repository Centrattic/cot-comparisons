I didn't think of using plan B as I have PCOS and was told it would be hard for me to have children without treatment, so at that point I was mostly worried about STDs. One month later I bought a pregnancy test as my period was late and it came back positive right away. I can't describe how I felt at that moment, I was euphoric because I realized I could have children but also terrified because I knew I wouldn't be able to keep my baby although I wanted it more than anything in the world.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI come from a very very conservative family, honour killings are frequent where my parents are from. I'm not allowed to date, let alone have sex before marriage, so them knowing about the pregnancy would be a death sentence for me. My cousin was severly beaten up by her father and brothers for hanging out with a boy after school. If they found out, they would take me to their home country and kill me there, and no one would know about it. They would also find a way to hurt my boyfriend. My parents trust me entirely and think I'm a virgin, they would lose their mind over this. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy boyfriend and I have often talked about what we would do if I got pregnant. He told me he would be there for me, get a full time job, an appartment. He always said it would be a blessing to have kids with me. I have told him about how my parents would react but he wouldn't understand. He thought they would be mad at me but would eventually let it go, but I know my parents and they would definetly not react this way. If my boyfriend found out I was pregnant he would'nt have let me get an abortion. I know he would have been thrilled to be a father.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo when I found out I was pregnant I knew what I had to do, but I was terrified, angry and disgusted at myself for doing this to my baby. I was nine weeks pregnant when I had a medical abortion at the hospital all by myself. \n\nI keep thinking about what would have happened if I was born into a different, more tolerant family. It's been five weeks since the abortion and I feel extremely disgusted with myself for doing this behind my boyfriend's back. It was his baby too and I really wish we could have kept it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\ntl;dr : I got pregnant and got an abortion to avoid being a victim of honour killing. I hid the pregnancy and abortion from my boyfriend because he would have wanted me to keep it, and doesn't believe what my parents are capable of in order to save their \"honour\". AITA ?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The person is asking if they're in the wrong for having an abortion without telling their boyfriend. The key points here are the context of her conservative family and the risk of honor killings. She mentions her parents would kill her if they found out about the pregnancy. Her boyfriend wanted to keep the baby, but she knew that if he knew she was pregnant, he wouldn't let her abort. So she did it secretly to protect herself and him from her family.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical and moral implications. In many places, having an abortion is a legal and personal decision, but this is complicated by the severe cultural and familial pressures she's facing. Her choice wasn't just about personal desire but survival. She felt that keeping the pregnancy would result in her death and her boyfriend's harm. \n\nShe didn't lie about the pregnancy itself; she hid it because revealing it would put them both in danger. The boyfriend's reaction is also a factor\u2014she knew he wouldn't support the abortion, so she made the decision to protect them both. \n\nLegally, if her country allows abortion, then it's a matter of her right. But the question is about being \"in the wrong,\" which is more subjective. From a moral standpoint, if her action was necessary to prevent a greater harm (her death), many would argue she's justified. However, some might say she should have told her boyfriend, even if he disagreed, because it was his child too. But given the context that he wouldn't have supported the abortion and that revealing it would escalate the danger, her decision might be seen as a necessary evil. \n\nThe fact that she's feeling guilty and conflicted shows she's not making this decision lightly. She's weighing her life against the baby's potential life. In her circumstances, prioritizing her immediate survival and the boyfriend's safety could be seen as the right choice. \n\nSo, considering all that, the answer would likely be that she's not in the wrong (B) because her actions were driven by necessity to protect herself and her partner from extreme violence. The boyfriend's desire to keep the baby is valid, but the immediate risk of death from her family overrides that in this situation.\n"
