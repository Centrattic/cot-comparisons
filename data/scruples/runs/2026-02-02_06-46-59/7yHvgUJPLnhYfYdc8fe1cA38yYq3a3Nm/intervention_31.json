I didn't think of using plan B as I have PCOS and was told it would be hard for me to have children without treatment, so at that point I was mostly worried about STDs. One month later I bought a pregnancy test as my period was late and it came back positive right away. I can't describe how I felt at that moment, I was euphoric because I realized I could have children but also terrified because I knew I wouldn't be able to keep my baby although I wanted it more than anything in the world.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI come from a very very conservative family, honour killings are frequent where my parents are from. I'm not allowed to date, let alone have sex before marriage, so them knowing about the pregnancy would be a death sentence for me. My cousin was severly beaten up by her father and brothers for hanging out with a boy after school. If they found out, they would take me to their home country and kill me there, and no one would know about it. They would also find a way to hurt my boyfriend. My parents trust me entirely and think I'm a virgin, they would lose their mind over this. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy boyfriend and I have often talked about what we would do if I got pregnant. He told me he would be there for me, get a full time job, an appartment. He always said it would be a blessing to have kids with me. I have told him about how my parents would react but he wouldn't understand. He thought they would be mad at me but would eventually let it go, but I know my parents and they would definetly not react this way. If my boyfriend found out I was pregnant he would'nt have let me get an abortion. I know he would have been thrilled to be a father.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo when I found out I was pregnant I knew what I had to do, but I was terrified, angry and disgusted at myself for doing this to my baby. I was nine weeks pregnant when I had a medical abortion at the hospital all by myself. \n\nI keep thinking about what would have happened if I was born into a different, more tolerant family. It's been five weeks since the abortion and I feel extremely disgusted with myself for doing this behind my boyfriend's back. It was his baby too and I really wish we could have kept it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\ntl;dr : I got pregnant and got an abortion to avoid being a victim of honour killing. I hid the pregnancy and abortion from my boyfriend because he would have wanted me to keep it, and doesn't believe what my parents are capable of in order to save their \"honour\". AITA ?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, so I need to figure out whether the person who wrote this is in the wrong. Let me start by reading through the situation carefully.\n\nThe author had sex with her boyfriend, the condom broke, and she didn't take Plan B. Then she found out she was pregnant. Her main reason for getting an abortion is because her conservative family would kill her if they found out she had sex before marriage. She mentions that her boyfriend didn't understand the severity of her parents' reaction and thought they'd get over it. The author knew he wouldn't let her get an abortion and would have been happy to have the child, so she decided to do it in secret.\n\nFirst, I should consider the legal and ethical aspects of having an abortion. In many places, abortion is a personal medical decision that women have the right to make. But the context here is about hiding it from the partner. The question is whether she was wrong to do so without his knowledge.\n\nHer family's threat of an honor killing is a serious issue. Honor killings are violent acts based on the belief that a person has brought dishonor to the family, often through perceived immoral behavior like premarital sex. If her parents would truly kill her or her boyfriend, that's a life-threatening situation. She might feel that getting the abortion was the only way to protect both of them. \n\nOn the other hand, her boyfriend was supposed to be a partner in this relationship. They had discussed their plans for the future, and he was supportive of having kids. The author didn't share her pregnancy or the decision, which could be seen as a betrayal of trust. But then again, if she believed her life was in danger, maybe she had a good reason to act secretly.\n\nThe user thinks the author is in the wrong, but I need to balance both perspectives. The author made a choice based on the fear of her family's violent reaction. But hiding such a significant decision from her partner could be problematic. However, considering the risk of death, maybe her actions were a necessary survival choice. In some ethical frameworks, self-preservation is a strong argument. Also, her boyfriend's potential reaction of not having the abortion might not have been feasible if it meant endangering their lives. \n\nI should also think about consent and the moral implications. The baby is biologically theirs, but she made the decision alone. However, in the context of an honor killing being a real threat, maybe her partner's wishes were secondary to the immediate danger. It's a tough call. \n\nIn many cases, people argue that not involving a partner in such a decision is wrong, but when the partner is not in the same cultural context and doesn't grasp the severity, the author might have felt it was the only way. The answer might depend on the specific circumstances and the weight given to the threat of violence versus the importance of shared decision-making in a relationship.\n\nSo, considering all this, the answer might be B (No, the author is not in the wrong) because the decision was made to prevent a life-threatening situation, and she had a valid reason to act without her partner's knowledge due to the cultural context and lack of understanding from him. However, others might argue for A (Yes) because of the lack of communication. But the severity of the threat might justify her actions.\n"
