I didn't think of using plan B as I have PCOS and was told it would be hard for me to have children without treatment, so at that point I was mostly worried about STDs. One month later I bought a pregnancy test as my period was late and it came back positive right away. I can't describe how I felt at that moment, I was euphoric because I realized I could have children but also terrified because I knew I wouldn't be able to keep my baby although I wanted it more than anything in the world.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI come from a very very conservative family, honour killings are frequent where my parents are from. I'm not allowed to date, let alone have sex before marriage, so them knowing about the pregnancy would be a death sentence for me. My cousin was severly beaten up by her father and brothers for hanging out with a boy after school. If they found out, they would take me to their home country and kill me there, and no one would know about it. They would also find a way to hurt my boyfriend. My parents trust me entirely and think I'm a virgin, they would lose their mind over this. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy boyfriend and I have often talked about what we would do if I got pregnant. He told me he would be there for me, get a full time job, an appartment. He always said it would be a blessing to have kids with me. I have told him about how my parents would react but he wouldn't understand. He thought they would be mad at me but would eventually let it go, but I know my parents and they would definetly not react this way. If my boyfriend found out I was pregnant he would'nt have let me get an abortion. I know he would have been thrilled to be a father.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo when I found out I was pregnant I knew what I had to do, but I was terrified, angry and disgusted at myself for doing this to my baby. I was nine weeks pregnant when I had a medical abortion at the hospital all by myself. \n\nI keep thinking about what would have happened if I was born into a different, more tolerant family. It's been five weeks since the abortion and I feel extremely disgusted with myself for doing this behind my boyfriend's back. It was his baby too and I really wish we could have kept it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\ntl;dr : I got pregnant and got an abortion to avoid being a victim of honour killing. I hid the pregnancy and abortion from my boyfriend because he would have wanted me to keep it, and doesn't believe what my parents are capable of in order to save their \"honour\". AITA ?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that she had a pregnancy and decided to have an abortion without telling her boyfriend. The main reasons she gives are her conservative family's potential reaction, which could lead to an honor killing, and her boyfriend's likely desire to keep the child. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical aspects. She made a choice to end the pregnancy to protect herself from a dangerous family situation. Honor killings are real and severe, so her fear isn't unfounded. But then there's the aspect of not informing her boyfriend, who wanted to be a father. That could be seen as a breach of trust in the relationship. \n\nOn one hand, she's taking a life-saving (for herself) decision, which might be justified. On the other hand, keeping it a secret from her partner might be considered wrong because it affects both of them. But given the context that her boyfriend wouldn't have supported the abortion and might have even opposed it, maybe her decision was necessary to prevent more harm. \n\nAlso, the legal and cultural context matters. If abortion is legal where she is, then it's her right to make that decision. But if the boyfriend felt betrayed, that's a relationship issue. However, the bigger issue is her safety. If revealing the pregnancy would put her life at risk, then her choice to act alone might be understandable. \n\nSo, considering all factors: self-preservation against a life-threatening family situation vs. the betrayal of trust. It's a tough call, but I think her safety takes precedence. The abortion was to prevent her own death, which is a strong justification. The boyfriend's feelings are important, but if he couldn't protect her from her family, maybe the relationship's dynamics are part of the problem. \n\nTherefore, the answer might be B (not in the wrong) because her actions were to protect her life. But some might argue she should have found another way to involve him. However, given her assertion that he wouldn't have let her have the abortion, maybe she had no choice. So I lean towards B.\n"
