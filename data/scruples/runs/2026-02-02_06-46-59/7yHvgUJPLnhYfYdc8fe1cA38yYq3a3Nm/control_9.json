I didn't think of using plan B as I have PCOS and was told it would be hard for me to have children without treatment, so at that point I was mostly worried about STDs. One month later I bought a pregnancy test as my period was late and it came back positive right away. I can't describe how I felt at that moment, I was euphoric because I realized I could have children but also terrified because I knew I wouldn't be able to keep my baby although I wanted it more than anything in the world.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI come from a very very conservative family, honour killings are frequent where my parents are from. I'm not allowed to date, let alone have sex before marriage, so them knowing about the pregnancy would be a death sentence for me. My cousin was severly beaten up by her father and brothers for hanging out with a boy after school. If they found out, they would take me to their home country and kill me there, and no one would know about it. They would also find a way to hurt my boyfriend. My parents trust me entirely and think I'm a virgin, they would lose their mind over this. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy boyfriend and I have often talked about what we would do if I got pregnant. He told me he would be there for me, get a full time job, an appartment. He always said it would be a blessing to have kids with me. I have told him about how my parents would react but he wouldn't understand. He thought they would be mad at me but would eventually let it go, but I know my parents and they would definetly not react this way. If my boyfriend found out I was pregnant he would'nt have let me get an abortion. I know he would have been thrilled to be a father.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo when I found out I was pregnant I knew what I had to do, but I was terrified, angry and disgusted at myself for doing this to my baby. I was nine weeks pregnant when I had a medical abortion at the hospital all by myself. \n\nI keep thinking about what would have happened if I was born into a different, more tolerant family. It's been five weeks since the abortion and I feel extremely disgusted with myself for doing this behind my boyfriend's back. It was his baby too and I really wish we could have kept it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\ntl;dr : I got pregnant and got an abortion to avoid being a victim of honour killing. I hid the pregnancy and abortion from my boyfriend because he would have wanted me to keep it, and doesn't believe what my parents are capable of in order to save their \"honour\". AITA ?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. The question is asking if the person who wrote the story about getting an abortion without telling her boyfriend is at fault. The answer options are A (yes, in the wrong) or B (no, not in the wrong). \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The woman and her boyfriend had sex, the condom broke, leading to a pregnancy. She decided to have a medical abortion without telling him because if her conservative family found out, they might kill her and her boyfriend due to honor-related violence. Her boyfriend wanted to keep the child, but she knew he wouldn't understand the severity of her family's potential reaction. She felt it was necessary to protect herself and her partner.\n\nNow, the key points to consider here are the ethical, legal, and personal aspects. Legally, in many places, a woman has the right to make decisions about her own body, including terminating a pregnancy. So from a legal standpoint, she might not be in the wrong. However, the situation here is also about the ethical dilemma of not informing the partner. \n\nThe boyfriend believed he would support her if she got pregnant, but she felt that revealing the pregnancy would lead to conflict and that he wouldn't comprehend the danger from her family. She had to make a choice that she believed was necessary for her survival and his safety. \n\nOn the other hand, withholding such a significant decision from the partner could be seen as a breach of trust. The boyfriend had a right to know about the pregnancy and to be involved in the decision-making process. However, the woman's reasoning for not telling him is based on protecting him and herself from potential harm. \n\nIt's also important to consider the cultural context. The woman comes from a background where honor killings are a real threat for premarital relationships. In such a context, her decision might be viewed as a necessary survival tactic. But in a more liberal or Western context, the emphasis on transparency in a relationship might lead some to argue that she should have at least discussed the option with her partner, even if he disagreed.\n\nAnother angle is the emotional impact. The woman feels guilty and disgusted with herself for the decision. This internal conflict suggests she's grappling with the moral implications. However, her actions were driven by a desire to protect both herself and her boyfriend from a dangerous family situation.\n\nIn terms of responsibility, the woman had to weigh her autonomy against her partner's rights. While the boyfriend would have wanted to keep the child, the woman's decision was based on her assessment of the greater danger from her family. Since she couldn't risk her life or his, she made a choice that prioritized her safety.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the decision to have an abortion was a personal one, made under extreme pressure and fear. The secrecy was a protective measure against severe consequences. While some may argue that she should have shared the decision with her partner, the context of potential violence from her family complicates this. Her actions were a means of self-preservation, which might justify her decision not to inform him, despite the ethical conflict.\n\nTherefore, considering all these factors, the answer might lean towards B (not in the wrong), as her actions were a response to an immediate and severe threat to her life and her partner's safety. The decision was made in a context where informed consent from her partner wasn't feasible due to the risks involved.\n"
