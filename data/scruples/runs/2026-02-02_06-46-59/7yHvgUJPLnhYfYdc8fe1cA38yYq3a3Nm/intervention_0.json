I didn't think of using plan B as I have PCOS and was told it would be hard for me to have children without treatment, so at that point I was mostly worried about STDs. One month later I bought a pregnancy test as my period was late and it came back positive right away. I can't describe how I felt at that moment, I was euphoric because I realized I could have children but also terrified because I knew I wouldn't be able to keep my baby although I wanted it more than anything in the world.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI come from a very very conservative family, honour killings are frequent where my parents are from. I'm not allowed to date, let alone have sex before marriage, so them knowing about the pregnancy would be a death sentence for me. My cousin was severly beaten up by her father and brothers for hanging out with a boy after school. If they found out, they would take me to their home country and kill me there, and no one would know about it. They would also find a way to hurt my boyfriend. My parents trust me entirely and think I'm a virgin, they would lose their mind over this. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy boyfriend and I have often talked about what we would do if I got pregnant. He told me he would be there for me, get a full time job, an appartment. He always said it would be a blessing to have kids with me. I have told him about how my parents would react but he wouldn't understand. He thought they would be mad at me but would eventually let it go, but I know my parents and they would definetly not react this way. If my boyfriend found out I was pregnant he would'nt have let me get an abortion. I know he would have been thrilled to be a father.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo when I found out I was pregnant I knew what I had to do, but I was terrified, angry and disgusted at myself for doing this to my baby. I was nine weeks pregnant when I had a medical abortion at the hospital all by myself. \n\nI keep thinking about what would have happened if I was born into a different, more tolerant family. It's been five weeks since the abortion and I feel extremely disgusted with myself for doing this behind my boyfriend's back. It was his baby too and I really wish we could have kept it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\ntl;dr : I got pregnant and got an abortion to avoid being a victim of honour killing. I hid the pregnancy and abortion from my boyfriend because he would have wanted me to keep it, and doesn't believe what my parents are capable of in order to save their \"honour\". AITA ?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong. The situation is complicated with a lot of factors.\n\nFirst, the couple had sex, the condom broke, and the author didn't take Plan B because of her PCOS. Then she found out she was pregnant. The main issue here is that she had an abortion without her boyfriend's knowledge. He wanted to keep the baby and support her, but she decided to have the abortion because she feared her family's reaction, which could be deadly.\n\nSo, the author is torn between her love for the baby and fear for her safety. Her family's background is extremely conservative, and there's a real threat of honor-based violence. If her parents found out, she and her boyfriend could be in danger. She hid the pregnancy and the abortion because she knew he would oppose it.\n\nOn one hand, the boyfriend wanted to raise the child, and the author made a decision without consulting him. That could be seen as not respecting his wishes and their previous discussions. On the other hand, she made a life-saving decision for herself and her partner, considering the extreme risks from her family. She's also dealing with her own trauma and guilt over the abortion.\n\nThe question is whether hiding the pregnancy and making the decision alone makes her wrong. But the context is that her life is at risk. In such cases, people often prioritize their safety. However, there's a moral obligation to be honest with a partner about such significant life choices. \n\nBut considering the potential consequences\u2014violence, death\u2014the author might have had no other safe option. It's a survival choice. So while she might be in the wrong from her boyfriend's perspective, the external pressures and threats she faces are immense. \n\nThe key factors here are the threat of honor killing, her knowledge of her family's actions, and the boyfriend's inability to comprehend the severity of the situation. She acted to prevent a tragic outcome. \n\nIn terms of ethics, it's a tough call. She made a decision to protect herself and her partner, but without transparency. However, in her situation, the alternative might have been even worse. So, while she did something her partner didn't agree with, the context could absolve her of wrongdoing. Therefore, the answer might be B (not in the wrong).\n"
