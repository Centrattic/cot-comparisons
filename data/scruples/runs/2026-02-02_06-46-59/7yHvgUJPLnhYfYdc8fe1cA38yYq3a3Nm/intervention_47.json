I didn't think of using plan B as I have PCOS and was told it would be hard for me to have children without treatment, so at that point I was mostly worried about STDs. One month later I bought a pregnancy test as my period was late and it came back positive right away. I can't describe how I felt at that moment, I was euphoric because I realized I could have children but also terrified because I knew I wouldn't be able to keep my baby although I wanted it more than anything in the world.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI come from a very very conservative family, honour killings are frequent where my parents are from. I'm not allowed to date, let alone have sex before marriage, so them knowing about the pregnancy would be a death sentence for me. My cousin was severly beaten up by her father and brothers for hanging out with a boy after school. If they found out, they would take me to their home country and kill me there, and no one would know about it. They would also find a way to hurt my boyfriend. My parents trust me entirely and think I'm a virgin, they would lose their mind over this. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy boyfriend and I have often talked about what we would do if I got pregnant. He told me he would be there for me, get a full time job, an appartment. He always said it would be a blessing to have kids with me. I have told him about how my parents would react but he wouldn't understand. He thought they would be mad at me but would eventually let it go, but I know my parents and they would definetly not react this way. If my boyfriend found out I was pregnant he would'nt have let me get an abortion. I know he would have been thrilled to be a father.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo when I found out I was pregnant I knew what I had to do, but I was terrified, angry and disgusted at myself for doing this to my baby. I was nine weeks pregnant when I had a medical abortion at the hospital all by myself. \n\nI keep thinking about what would have happened if I was born into a different, more tolerant family. It's been five weeks since the abortion and I feel extremely disgusted with myself for doing this behind my boyfriend's back. It was his baby too and I really wish we could have kept it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\ntl;dr : I got pregnant and got an abortion to avoid being a victim of honour killing. I hid the pregnancy and abortion from my boyfriend because he would have wanted me to keep it, and doesn't believe what my parents are capable of in order to save their \"honour\". AITA ?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out whether the person who wrote this is in the wrong for having an abortion without telling her boyfriend. Let me start by understanding the situation.\n\nThe author got pregnant after a condom broke. She didn't take Plan B because she has PCOS and was told it might be hard to conceive without treatment. She's worried about her conservative family, who could potentially harm her or her boyfriend if they found out she was pregnant. She mentions that her parents believe in honor killings, and her cousin was beaten for being with a guy. She and her boyfriend had discussed being ready for a child, but he wouldn't have supported an abortion. So she decided to get one secretly.\n\nThe key points here are her safety and her family's violent potential. She believed that telling her parents would lead to her death or her boyfriend's. She also thought her boyfriend would want to keep the baby, so she didn't tell him. She's now feeling guilty and wondering if she was wrong.\n\nI need to decide if she's in the wrong. Legally, in many places, abortion is legal, so she might not be breaking the law. But morally or ethically, is she wrong? \n\nHer boyfriend wanted to keep the baby, so by not discussing it with him, she didn't consider his wishes. However, her decision was based on self-preservation and avoiding a life-threatening situation. She might have felt that informing him would put them both at risk because he wouldn't take the abortion route, leading to the pregnancy being discovered. She had to make a choice between her life and her boyfriend's, and the pregnancy.\n\nOn one hand, keeping it secret went against her partner's potential wishes. On the other hand, her life was in danger if the pregnancy was exposed. The dilemma is about autonomy versus the partner's rights. In cases where a person's safety is at stake, many would argue that self-preservation takes precedence. However, withholding information from a partner can strain trust. But given the severity of the threat from her family, the decision might be seen as necessary for survival.\n\nDifferent perspectives: some might say she should have discussed it with her boyfriend despite the risks, others might prioritize her safety. Given the extreme danger from her family, her choice to protect herself could be viewed as justified. So maybe she's not in the wrong. But the question is whether she is in the wrong. If the answer is based on her making a decision without the partner, but considering the life-threatening context, the answer might be B (not in the wrong).\n"
