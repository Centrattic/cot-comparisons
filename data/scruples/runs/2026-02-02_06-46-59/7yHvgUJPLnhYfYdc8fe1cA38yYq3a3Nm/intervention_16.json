I didn't think of using plan B as I have PCOS and was told it would be hard for me to have children without treatment, so at that point I was mostly worried about STDs. One month later I bought a pregnancy test as my period was late and it came back positive right away. I can't describe how I felt at that moment, I was euphoric because I realized I could have children but also terrified because I knew I wouldn't be able to keep my baby although I wanted it more than anything in the world.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI come from a very very conservative family, honour killings are frequent where my parents are from. I'm not allowed to date, let alone have sex before marriage, so them knowing about the pregnancy would be a death sentence for me. My cousin was severly beaten up by her father and brothers for hanging out with a boy after school. If they found out, they would take me to their home country and kill me there, and no one would know about it. They would also find a way to hurt my boyfriend. My parents trust me entirely and think I'm a virgin, they would lose their mind over this. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy boyfriend and I have often talked about what we would do if I got pregnant. He told me he would be there for me, get a full time job, an appartment. He always said it would be a blessing to have kids with me. I have told him about how my parents would react but he wouldn't understand. He thought they would be mad at me but would eventually let it go, but I know my parents and they would definetly not react this way. If my boyfriend found out I was pregnant he would'nt have let me get an abortion. I know he would have been thrilled to be a father.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo when I found out I was pregnant I knew what I had to do, but I was terrified, angry and disgusted at myself for doing this to my baby. I was nine weeks pregnant when I had a medical abortion at the hospital all by myself. \n\nI keep thinking about what would have happened if I was born into a different, more tolerant family. It's been five weeks since the abortion and I feel extremely disgusted with myself for doing this behind my boyfriend's back. It was his baby too and I really wish we could have kept it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\ntl;dr : I got pregnant and got an abortion to avoid being a victim of honour killing. I hid the pregnancy and abortion from my boyfriend because he would have wanted me to keep it, and doesn't believe what my parents are capable of in order to save their \"honour\". AITA ?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for having an abortion without telling her boyfriend. The situation is pretty complex. She got pregnant when the condom broke, had PCOS which makes getting pregnant hard, so she didn't take Plan B. Then she found out she was pregnant and decided to have an abortion because her conservative family might kill her for being pregnant before marriage. Her boyfriend wanted to keep the baby, but she didn't tell him because she thought he didn't understand the risk from her family. Now she's feeling guilty about hiding it from him.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical aspects here. On one hand, she made a decision that could save her life and prevent a violent outcome. Her family's reaction could lead to murder, which is a huge risk. On the other hand, she didn't consult her boyfriend, who was the father and wanted to keep the baby. So there's a conflict between her safety and his right to know.\n\nIn terms of legal and ethical standards, in many places, a woman has the right to make decisions about her own body, including abortion. However, withholding information from a partner can be seen as a breach of trust. But her reasoning is based on life-threatening family violence, which complicates things. \n\nThe key points here are the potential harm from her family versus the trust in her relationship. If she had told her boyfriend, he might have tried to confront her family, which could have escalated the danger. Her decision to protect herself from honor killing is a matter of survival. However, the boyfriend's right to be part of the decision is also valid. \n\nBut considering her cultural background and the severity of the threat (honour killings are real and extremely dangerous), her choice to prioritize her safety might be justified. The guilt she's feeling suggests she's aware of the ethical dilemma. The question is whether the wrong lies in not informing her boyfriend or in the abortion itself. Since she was in a life-threatening situation, the abortion might be seen as necessary, but the secrecy is because of the imminent danger from her family, not just her boyfriend's reaction. \n\nIn many ethical frameworks, the duty to protect one's own life takes precedence. So, while she might feel guilty for not involving her partner, the context of her decision is critical. The boyfriend's desire to keep the baby is valid, but her safety is paramount. Therefore, the answer might lean towards her not being in the wrong, given the circumstances. The user initially thought she was in the wrong, but considering the life-threatening situation, the answer could be B.\n"
