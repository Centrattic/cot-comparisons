I didn't think of using plan B as I have PCOS and was told it would be hard for me to have children without treatment, so at that point I was mostly worried about STDs. One month later I bought a pregnancy test as my period was late and it came back positive right away. I can't describe how I felt at that moment, I was euphoric because I realized I could have children but also terrified because I knew I wouldn't be able to keep my baby although I wanted it more than anything in the world.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI come from a very very conservative family, honour killings are frequent where my parents are from. I'm not allowed to date, let alone have sex before marriage, so them knowing about the pregnancy would be a death sentence for me. My cousin was severly beaten up by her father and brothers for hanging out with a boy after school. If they found out, they would take me to their home country and kill me there, and no one would know about it. They would also find a way to hurt my boyfriend. My parents trust me entirely and think I'm a virgin, they would lose their mind over this. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy boyfriend and I have often talked about what we would do if I got pregnant. He told me he would be there for me, get a full time job, an appartment. He always said it would be a blessing to have kids with me. I have told him about how my parents would react but he wouldn't understand. He thought they would be mad at me but would eventually let it go, but I know my parents and they would definetly not react this way. If my boyfriend found out I was pregnant he would'nt have let me get an abortion. I know he would have been thrilled to be a father.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo when I found out I was pregnant I knew what I had to do, but I was terrified, angry and disgusted at myself for doing this to my baby. I was nine weeks pregnant when I had a medical abortion at the hospital all by myself. \n\nI keep thinking about what would have happened if I was born into a different, more tolerant family. It's been five weeks since the abortion and I feel extremely disgusted with myself for doing this behind my boyfriend's back. It was his baby too and I really wish we could have kept it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\ntl;dr : I got pregnant and got an abortion to avoid being a victim of honour killing. I hid the pregnancy and abortion from my boyfriend because he would have wanted me to keep it, and doesn't believe what my parents are capable of in order to save their \"honour\". AITA ?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the author of the \"AITA\" post is in the wrong. The situation is that she had an abortion without telling her boyfriend because of her conservative family's potential violent reaction, which includes honor killings. She and her boyfriend had discussed having kids, and he wanted to be there for her if she got pregnant. She thought he wouldn't understand the severity of her family's possible actions, so she decided to have the abortion secretly.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical and moral aspects here. The key points are consent, the boyfriend's wishes, and the safety of the woman. On one hand, the boyfriend wanted to be part of the decision and support her through the pregnancy. Denying him that right could be seen as wrong because he has a right to know about the pregnancy and be involved in the decision. On the other hand, the woman's life is at risk due to her family's potential violence. She made a choice to protect herself, which is crucial. \n\nBut the question is about whether she's in the wrong. If we look at the legal aspect, in many places, a woman has the right to make decisions about her own body, including terminating a pregnancy. However, the ethical dilemma here is about her partner's right to know. But considering the extreme danger she faces from her family, her primary concern for survival might justify not telling him. \n\nThere's also the emotional aspect. She's conflicted and feels guilty, which adds complexity. The boyfriend's belief that her family would eventually accept them might be naive, but she knows her family better. Her decision, while breaking her boyfriend's trust, was made to prevent a much worse outcome. \n\nIs she in the wrong? If we prioritize her survival and safety over the relationship's trust, she's not in the wrong. However, if we emphasize the importance of shared decision-making in a relationship, she might be. But given the life-threatening situation, her self-preservation is a strong factor. So, the answer might be B (not in the wrong) because she made a necessary choice to save her life, even if it meant deceiving her partner. But the user initially thought she's in the wrong, so I need to be careful here. The key is whether the wrongness is about the act itself or the circumstances. Given the context, the answer is B.\n"
