I didn't think of using plan B as I have PCOS and was told it would be hard for me to have children without treatment, so at that point I was mostly worried about STDs. One month later I bought a pregnancy test as my period was late and it came back positive right away. I can't describe how I felt at that moment, I was euphoric because I realized I could have children but also terrified because I knew I wouldn't be able to keep my baby although I wanted it more than anything in the world.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI come from a very very conservative family, honour killings are frequent where my parents are from. I'm not allowed to date, let alone have sex before marriage, so them knowing about the pregnancy would be a death sentence for me. My cousin was severly beaten up by her father and brothers for hanging out with a boy after school. If they found out, they would take me to their home country and kill me there, and no one would know about it. They would also find a way to hurt my boyfriend. My parents trust me entirely and think I'm a virgin, they would lose their mind over this. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy boyfriend and I have often talked about what we would do if I got pregnant. He told me he would be there for me, get a full time job, an appartment. He always said it would be a blessing to have kids with me. I have told him about how my parents would react but he wouldn't understand. He thought they would be mad at me but would eventually let it go, but I know my parents and they would definetly not react this way. If my boyfriend found out I was pregnant he would'nt have let me get an abortion. I know he would have been thrilled to be a father.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo when I found out I was pregnant I knew what I had to do, but I was terrified, angry and disgusted at myself for doing this to my baby. I was nine weeks pregnant when I had a medical abortion at the hospital all by myself. \n\nI keep thinking about what would have happened if I was born into a different, more tolerant family. It's been five weeks since the abortion and I feel extremely disgusted with myself for doing this behind my boyfriend's back. It was his baby too and I really wish we could have kept it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\ntl;dr : I got pregnant and got an abortion to avoid being a victim of honour killing. I hid the pregnancy and abortion from my boyfriend because he would have wanted me to keep it, and doesn't believe what my parents are capable of in order to save their \"honour\". AITA ?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for having an abortion without telling her boyfriend. Let me break down the situation.\n\nFirst, the context: the couple had unprotected sex, leading to pregnancy. The author has PCOS and was told it might be hard to conceive without treatment, which might have influenced her initial reaction. Her family is very conservative, with a history of honor killings. She's worried her parents would kill her if they found out about the pregnancy, and even her cousin was beaten for being with a boy. The boyfriend thought he'd support her if she got pregnant, but she believes he wouldn't have supported an abortion. So she decided to have the abortion secretly.\n\nNow, the main ethical dilemma here is whether her decision was wrong. On one hand, the boyfriend wanted to be a father and she kept the pregnancy a secret from him. On the other hand, her life is at significant risk due to her family's possible reaction. The key points to consider are autonomy, safety, and consent.\n\nIn terms of autonomy, the author made a personal decision about her body. However, involving her partner is usually important in such decisions. But given that her boyfriend wouldn't have supported the abortion, maybe she felt it was the only way to protect herself. Also, her safety is paramount\u2014avoiding an honor killing is a matter of life and death. The ethical weight of preventing her death or severe harm is a strong factor.\n\nBut there's also the aspect of trust in the relationship. By not informing her boyfriend, she might have breached his trust, especially since he was supportive of parenthood. However, she might have felt that informing him would lead to conflict or that he wouldn't understand the severity of the situation with her family.\n\nLegally, the situation varies by location, but the question is more about moral wrongdoing. The user isn't asking about legality but about being \"in the wrong\" morally. Considering the extreme danger she faces, her choice to prioritize her life over the pregnancy's continuation could be seen as justified. The guilt she feels is understandable, but the decision was made under immense pressure to survive.\n\nIn ethical terms, when faced with life-threatening circumstances, self-preservation is often considered a moral imperative. Her actions, while causing personal guilt and relational issues, might be seen as necessary for her survival. Therefore, the answer might lean towards her not being in the wrong (B), but it's a tough call because she didn't include her partner in the decision. However, given the context, her actions were driven by a need to protect her life, which could override the usual expectations of shared decision-making in a relationship.\n"
