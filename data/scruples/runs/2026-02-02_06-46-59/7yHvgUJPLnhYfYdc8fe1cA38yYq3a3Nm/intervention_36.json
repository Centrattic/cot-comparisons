I didn't think of using plan B as I have PCOS and was told it would be hard for me to have children without treatment, so at that point I was mostly worried about STDs. One month later I bought a pregnancy test as my period was late and it came back positive right away. I can't describe how I felt at that moment, I was euphoric because I realized I could have children but also terrified because I knew I wouldn't be able to keep my baby although I wanted it more than anything in the world.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI come from a very very conservative family, honour killings are frequent where my parents are from. I'm not allowed to date, let alone have sex before marriage, so them knowing about the pregnancy would be a death sentence for me. My cousin was severly beaten up by her father and brothers for hanging out with a boy after school. If they found out, they would take me to their home country and kill me there, and no one would know about it. They would also find a way to hurt my boyfriend. My parents trust me entirely and think I'm a virgin, they would lose their mind over this. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy boyfriend and I have often talked about what we would do if I got pregnant. He told me he would be there for me, get a full time job, an appartment. He always said it would be a blessing to have kids with me. I have told him about how my parents would react but he wouldn't understand. He thought they would be mad at me but would eventually let it go, but I know my parents and they would definetly not react this way. If my boyfriend found out I was pregnant he would'nt have let me get an abortion. I know he would have been thrilled to be a father.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo when I found out I was pregnant I knew what I had to do, but I was terrified, angry and disgusted at myself for doing this to my baby. I was nine weeks pregnant when I had a medical abortion at the hospital all by myself. \n\nI keep thinking about what would have happened if I was born into a different, more tolerant family. It's been five weeks since the abortion and I feel extremely disgusted with myself for doing this behind my boyfriend's back. It was his baby too and I really wish we could have kept it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\ntl;dr : I got pregnant and got an abortion to avoid being a victim of honour killing. I hid the pregnancy and abortion from my boyfriend because he would have wanted me to keep it, and doesn't believe what my parents are capable of in order to save their \"honour\". AITA ?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking whether the author of the story is in the wrong. The situation involves an abortion done secretly from the boyfriend. Let me break down the key points.\n\nFirst, the author had a condom break, didn't use Plan B, got pregnant. She had to decide whether to tell her boyfriend or not. She explains her conservative family's background, the threat of honor killings if they found out. She also mentions that her boyfriend would have wanted to keep the baby despite her warnings. She had the abortion alone and now feels guilty.\n\nSo, the main question is whether she was wrong for hiding the abortion. The user initially thinks she is in the wrong, but maybe there's more nuance. Let's consider both sides.\n\nOn one hand, she made a major decision affecting both her and her boyfriend without his knowledge. That could be seen as a betrayal. He might have wanted to support her, and she didn't give him the choice. In a relationship, big decisions usually require communication and mutual agreement. Her secrecy could be a problem here.\n\nOn the other hand, her reasons are extreme. She's at risk of her life and her boyfriend's if her family found out. She believes he wouldn't understand the severity of the situation. She mentions her cousin's experience, which shows the real danger. She might have thought that involving him would lead to her safety and the family's discovery. She also mentions feeling disgusted with herself, indicating inner conflict.\n\nNow, considering the boyfriend's potential reaction: he wanted to be a father and support her. Without knowing, he might have taken steps to protect her or help her make a decision. But she thought he wouldn't take the risks seriously, so she acted alone. That's a tough spot. It's a life-or-death situation for her, so her decision might be seen as self-preservation.\n\nIn terms of moral judgment, there's no clear right or wrong. But the question is about whether she's in the wrong. If we take into account the life-threatening context, her actions might be justified. However, in a relationship, withholding such a significant decision could be seen as a betrayal, regardless of the reasons.\n\nBut the alternative is her facing honor killing, which is a death penalty. Her choice to abort was to save her life. So, in that context, her action is a survival mechanism. The boyfriend's reaction is important, but if he's in a position where he can't protect her from her family, maybe she had no other choice.\n\nAnother angle: the law. In many places, abortion is legal, but if the boyfriend was unaware, maybe he could have been part of the decision. However, in her country's context, the legal system might not protect her. She's in a foreign country, perhaps, since she's with a boyfriend but her family is elsewhere. The legality of her actions isn't mentioned, but the main issue is moral.\n\nSo, the key factors are the threat to her life, the boyfriend's differing perspective, and the secrecy. Her decision was to prevent immediate danger. If she had told him, maybe they could have found another solution, but she believed he wouldn't take the risk seriously. Therefore, her action was based on fear for her life.\n\nIn a typical scenario without the life-threatening aspect, hiding an abortion would be a betrayal. But when her life is at stake, the moral calculus changes. So, the answer might depend on whether one prioritizes the relationship's trust over the immediate danger.\n\nGiven all that, I think the author is not in the wrong (B) because her decision was made to protect herself from a life-threatening situation. The boyfriend's wishes are important, but her survival takes precedence. However, the decision to keep it secret is complex, but under the circumstances, it might be necessary.\n"
