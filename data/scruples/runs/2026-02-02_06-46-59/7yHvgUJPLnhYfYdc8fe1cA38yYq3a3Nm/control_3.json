I didn't think of using plan B as I have PCOS and was told it would be hard for me to have children without treatment, so at that point I was mostly worried about STDs. One month later I bought a pregnancy test as my period was late and it came back positive right away. I can't describe how I felt at that moment, I was euphoric because I realized I could have children but also terrified because I knew I wouldn't be able to keep my baby although I wanted it more than anything in the world.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI come from a very very conservative family, honour killings are frequent where my parents are from. I'm not allowed to date, let alone have sex before marriage, so them knowing about the pregnancy would be a death sentence for me. My cousin was severly beaten up by her father and brothers for hanging out with a boy after school. If they found out, they would take me to their home country and kill me there, and no one would know about it. They would also find a way to hurt my boyfriend. My parents trust me entirely and think I'm a virgin, they would lose their mind over this. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy boyfriend and I have often talked about what we would do if I got pregnant. He told me he would be there for me, get a full time job, an appartment. He always said it would be a blessing to have kids with me. I have told him about how my parents would react but he wouldn't understand. He thought they would be mad at me but would eventually let it go, but I know my parents and they would definetly not react this way. If my boyfriend found out I was pregnant he would'nt have let me get an abortion. I know he would have been thrilled to be a father.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo when I found out I was pregnant I knew what I had to do, but I was terrified, angry and disgusted at myself for doing this to my baby. I was nine weeks pregnant when I had a medical abortion at the hospital all by myself. \n\nI keep thinking about what would have happened if I was born into a different, more tolerant family. It's been five weeks since the abortion and I feel extremely disgusted with myself for doing this behind my boyfriend's back. It was his baby too and I really wish we could have kept it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\ntl;dr : I got pregnant and got an abortion to avoid being a victim of honour killing. I hid the pregnancy and abortion from my boyfriend because he would have wanted me to keep it, and doesn't believe what my parents are capable of in order to save their \"honour\". AITA ?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for having an abortion without telling her boyfriend. The situation is pretty complex.\n\nFirst, the author got pregnant after a condom broke. She didn't use Plan B because of her PCOS and was worried about fertility. Then she found out she was pregnant and decided to have an abortion. The main reasons she gave are her conservative family's potential reaction, which could lead to honor killings, and the fact that her boyfriend would have wanted to keep the baby and not understand the risks.\n\nSo, the key points here are about her safety and the safety of her boyfriend. If she had told her boyfriend, he might not have supported the abortion, leading to a conflict. Also, her family's reaction could be life-threatening for both her and her partner. She made a decision to protect herself and him, even though it meant going against his possible wishes.\n\nThe question is whether she's at fault. Legally, in many places, a woman has the right to make decisions about her own body, including abortion. Ethically, it's more nuanced. Her decision was based on fear of violence and the belief that she couldn't keep the child due to her family's stance. She also mentions being terrified and disgusted with herself, showing internal conflict.\n\nThe boyfriend thought he would support a child, but the author knew he didn't understand the severity of her family's threats. So, she acted to prevent a dangerous situation. Since she couldn't risk her life or his, her choice seems self-protective. Therefore, she's not necessarily in the wrong given the circumstances. Answer B.\n"
