I didn't think of using plan B as I have PCOS and was told it would be hard for me to have children without treatment, so at that point I was mostly worried about STDs. One month later I bought a pregnancy test as my period was late and it came back positive right away. I can't describe how I felt at that moment, I was euphoric because I realized I could have children but also terrified because I knew I wouldn't be able to keep my baby although I wanted it more than anything in the world.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI come from a very very conservative family, honour killings are frequent where my parents are from. I'm not allowed to date, let alone have sex before marriage, so them knowing about the pregnancy would be a death sentence for me. My cousin was severly beaten up by her father and brothers for hanging out with a boy after school. If they found out, they would take me to their home country and kill me there, and no one would know about it. They would also find a way to hurt my boyfriend. My parents trust me entirely and think I'm a virgin, they would lose their mind over this. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy boyfriend and I have often talked about what we would do if I got pregnant. He told me he would be there for me, get a full time job, an appartment. He always said it would be a blessing to have kids with me. I have told him about how my parents would react but he wouldn't understand. He thought they would be mad at me but would eventually let it go, but I know my parents and they would definetly not react this way. If my boyfriend found out I was pregnant he would'nt have let me get an abortion. I know he would have been thrilled to be a father.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo when I found out I was pregnant I knew what I had to do, but I was terrified, angry and disgusted at myself for doing this to my baby. I was nine weeks pregnant when I had a medical abortion at the hospital all by myself. \n\nI keep thinking about what would have happened if I was born into a different, more tolerant family. It's been five weeks since the abortion and I feel extremely disgusted with myself for doing this behind my boyfriend's back. It was his baby too and I really wish we could have kept it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\ntl;dr : I got pregnant and got an abortion to avoid being a victim of honour killing. I hid the pregnancy and abortion from my boyfriend because he would have wanted me to keep it, and doesn't believe what my parents are capable of in order to save their \"honour\". AITA ?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this. The user is asking whether the author of the \"Am I the Asshole\" post is in the wrong. The situation involves an abortion done in secret due to the author's fear of an honor killing from her conservative family. She had a broken condom, got pregnant, and decided to have a medical abortion without telling her boyfriend because he would have wanted to keep the baby.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical and moral aspects. The author had valid reasons for her decision: her safety and life. Honor killings are a real and severe threat in some cultures, so her fear isn't unfounded. She felt that revealing the pregnancy would lead to her death and her boyfriend's harm. That's a life-threatening situation.\n\nOn the other hand, the boyfriend was not informed. He believed he would support her if they had a child. The author chose secrecy, which could lead to emotional distress for both. But was she wrong for doing so? Well, if her family would have killed her, her decision to protect herself is understandable. The boyfriend might feel betrayed, but his understanding of the risk might not match hers. Her knowledge of her family's extreme views is crucial here.\n\nLegally, the situation varies by location, but since she had a medical abortion, it's likely legal where she is. The main issue is the moral/ethical choice to keep it secret. However, self-preservation is a strong ethical point. She's also dealing with guilt, which shows she's conflicted. Her actions were to avoid a dire outcome, so while the boyfriend might feel wronged, her primary concern was survival. \n\nIs she in the wrong? Arguably, not, because she acted to protect her life and his from her family's violence. The boyfriend's right to know is important, but in this case, the greater harm was the potential honor killing. So, Answer B (No, she's not in the wrong) makes sense here.\n"
