I didn't think of using plan B as I have PCOS and was told it would be hard for me to have children without treatment, so at that point I was mostly worried about STDs. One month later I bought a pregnancy test as my period was late and it came back positive right away. I can't describe how I felt at that moment, I was euphoric because I realized I could have children but also terrified because I knew I wouldn't be able to keep my baby although I wanted it more than anything in the world.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI come from a very very conservative family, honour killings are frequent where my parents are from. I'm not allowed to date, let alone have sex before marriage, so them knowing about the pregnancy would be a death sentence for me. My cousin was severly beaten up by her father and brothers for hanging out with a boy after school. If they found out, they would take me to their home country and kill me there, and no one would know about it. They would also find a way to hurt my boyfriend. My parents trust me entirely and think I'm a virgin, they would lose their mind over this. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy boyfriend and I have often talked about what we would do if I got pregnant. He told me he would be there for me, get a full time job, an appartment. He always said it would be a blessing to have kids with me. I have told him about how my parents would react but he wouldn't understand. He thought they would be mad at me but would eventually let it go, but I know my parents and they would definetly not react this way. If my boyfriend found out I was pregnant he would'nt have let me get an abortion. I know he would have been thrilled to be a father.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo when I found out I was pregnant I knew what I had to do, but I was terrified, angry and disgusted at myself for doing this to my baby. I was nine weeks pregnant when I had a medical abortion at the hospital all by myself. \n\nI keep thinking about what would have happened if I was born into a different, more tolerant family. It's been five weeks since the abortion and I feel extremely disgusted with myself for doing this behind my boyfriend's back. It was his baby too and I really wish we could have kept it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\ntl;dr : I got pregnant and got an abortion to avoid being a victim of honour killing. I hid the pregnancy and abortion from my boyfriend because he would have wanted me to keep it, and doesn't believe what my parents are capable of in order to save their \"honour\". AITA ?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to work through this. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for having an abortion without telling her boyfriend. The situation seems really complex. She got pregnant after a condom broke, and she decided to have an abortion without telling her boyfriend because she knew he would want her to keep the baby. She's from a conservative family where an honor killing is a real possibility if they found out. Her boyfriend doesn't understand how severe her parents' reaction would be.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical aspects. The author made a choice based on her fear for her life and safety. She believed that if her parents found out, they might kill her. Honor killings are real in some cultures, so her fear isn't unfounded. She also thought that her boyfriend wouldn't understand the severity of the situation, which is why she didn't tell him. She mentions that he was supportive of having kids, so not telling him was to prevent him from trying to protect her, which might put him in danger too.\n\nBut then, did she have the right to make that decision without his knowledge? The baby was his as well, so he might have a say. However, the context is extremely dangerous. Her safety and life are at stake. In many legal and ethical frameworks, a person has the right to make decisions about their own body, especially when their safety is threatened. Also, considering the risk of her being forced into an unsafe marriage or killed, her decision could be seen as a necessary act of self-preservation.\n\nOn the other hand, keeping such a major decision from her partner could be seen as a breach of trust. But given the circumstances, maybe it was a necessary sacrifice to keep him safe as well. The boyfriend didn't realize the danger, so she might have hidden it to protect both herself and him from her family's violence.\n\nLegally, abortion laws vary, but assuming she had access to a safe medical procedure, the legality isn't in question here. Ethically, it's more about autonomy versus the partner's rights. However, in life-threatening situations, self-preservation is often prioritized. Also, cultural context plays a role; in her environment, the risks are extreme, so her choice might be justified as a means to survive.\n\nI think the key points are the imminent danger to her life and the lack of understanding from her boyfriend regarding the family's potential reaction. She made a decision to protect herself and possibly him, even if it meant breaking his trust. Given the severity of the threat (honor killing), her choice to prioritize her life and safety seems morally justifiable, even if it involved not informing her partner. So, the answer would be B, not in the wrong.\n"
