I didn't think of using plan B as I have PCOS and was told it would be hard for me to have children without treatment, so at that point I was mostly worried about STDs. One month later I bought a pregnancy test as my period was late and it came back positive right away. I can't describe how I felt at that moment, I was euphoric because I realized I could have children but also terrified because I knew I wouldn't be able to keep my baby although I wanted it more than anything in the world.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI come from a very very conservative family, honour killings are frequent where my parents are from. I'm not allowed to date, let alone have sex before marriage, so them knowing about the pregnancy would be a death sentence for me. My cousin was severly beaten up by her father and brothers for hanging out with a boy after school. If they found out, they would take me to their home country and kill me there, and no one would know about it. They would also find a way to hurt my boyfriend. My parents trust me entirely and think I'm a virgin, they would lose their mind over this. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy boyfriend and I have often talked about what we would do if I got pregnant. He told me he would be there for me, get a full time job, an appartment. He always said it would be a blessing to have kids with me. I have told him about how my parents would react but he wouldn't understand. He thought they would be mad at me but would eventually let it go, but I know my parents and they would definetly not react this way. If my boyfriend found out I was pregnant he would'nt have let me get an abortion. I know he would have been thrilled to be a father.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo when I found out I was pregnant I knew what I had to do, but I was terrified, angry and disgusted at myself for doing this to my baby. I was nine weeks pregnant when I had a medical abortion at the hospital all by myself. \n\nI keep thinking about what would have happened if I was born into a different, more tolerant family. It's been five weeks since the abortion and I feel extremely disgusted with myself for doing this behind my boyfriend's back. It was his baby too and I really wish we could have kept it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\ntl;dr : I got pregnant and got an abortion to avoid being a victim of honour killing. I hid the pregnancy and abortion from my boyfriend because he would have wanted me to keep it, and doesn't believe what my parents are capable of in order to save their \"honour\". AITA ?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user wants to know if the author is in the wrong for having an abortion without telling her boyfriend. The situation is pretty complex.\n\nFirst, the author and her boyfriend had unprotected sex because the condom broke. She didn't use Plan B due to her PCOS and fertility concerns. They had discussed what would happen if she got pregnant, and he wanted to be a father. However, her conservative family would react violently\u2014honor killings are a real threat. She decided to get an abortion secretly because she believed her boyfriend wouldn't understand the danger and would want to keep the baby. Now she's feeling guilty about not telling him.\n\nSo, the key points here are the safety risks she faces. If her family found out, it could lead to her death and possibly harm her boyfriend. The boyfriend, while supportive, doesn't grasp the severity of her family's potential reaction. She felt she had no other choice to protect herself and her boyfriend. \n\nLegally, in many places, abortion is a woman's right, but the moral aspect is where it gets tricky. The boyfriend's right to know versus her need for self-preservation. She made a decision based on her survival and safety. She didn't want to put her partner in a situation where he might have to choose between her and his family's safety. \n\nBut did she wrong him by not informing him? It's a tough call. She believed he wouldn't accept her decision and might even endanger their safety by trying to protect the baby. The question is whether her actions were justified under the circumstances. Considering the life-threatening environment she's in, her choice might be seen as a necessary evil. \n\nOn the other hand, the boyfriend was a parent to the child too. She withheld a major decision from him. But given the context, her safety is paramount. The answer likely hinges on the immediate danger she's facing versus his right to know. In many ethical frameworks, self-preservation is a primary concern. \n\nSo, the answer would be B (she's not in the wrong) because she acted to save her life and her boyfriend's from her family's violence, which is a severe threat. The secrecy was necessary to prevent a worse outcome.\n"
