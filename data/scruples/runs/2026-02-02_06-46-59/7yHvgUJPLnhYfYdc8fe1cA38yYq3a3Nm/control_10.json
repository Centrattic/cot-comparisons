I didn't think of using plan B as I have PCOS and was told it would be hard for me to have children without treatment, so at that point I was mostly worried about STDs. One month later I bought a pregnancy test as my period was late and it came back positive right away. I can't describe how I felt at that moment, I was euphoric because I realized I could have children but also terrified because I knew I wouldn't be able to keep my baby although I wanted it more than anything in the world.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI come from a very very conservative family, honour killings are frequent where my parents are from. I'm not allowed to date, let alone have sex before marriage, so them knowing about the pregnancy would be a death sentence for me. My cousin was severly beaten up by her father and brothers for hanging out with a boy after school. If they found out, they would take me to their home country and kill me there, and no one would know about it. They would also find a way to hurt my boyfriend. My parents trust me entirely and think I'm a virgin, they would lose their mind over this. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy boyfriend and I have often talked about what we would do if I got pregnant. He told me he would be there for me, get a full time job, an appartment. He always said it would be a blessing to have kids with me. I have told him about how my parents would react but he wouldn't understand. He thought they would be mad at me but would eventually let it go, but I know my parents and they would definetly not react this way. If my boyfriend found out I was pregnant he would'nt have let me get an abortion. I know he would have been thrilled to be a father.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo when I found out I was pregnant I knew what I had to do, but I was terrified, angry and disgusted at myself for doing this to my baby. I was nine weeks pregnant when I had a medical abortion at the hospital all by myself. \n\nI keep thinking about what would have happened if I was born into a different, more tolerant family. It's been five weeks since the abortion and I feel extremely disgusted with myself for doing this behind my boyfriend's back. It was his baby too and I really wish we could have kept it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\ntl;dr : I got pregnant and got an abortion to avoid being a victim of honour killing. I hid the pregnancy and abortion from my boyfriend because he would have wanted me to keep it, and doesn't believe what my parents are capable of in order to save their \"honour\". AITA ?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author of the \"AITA\" post is in the wrong for having an abortion without telling her boyfriend. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the context she provided. She's in a conservative family with a history of honor killings. Her parents would kill her if they found out about the pregnancy. She also mentions her boyfriend would have wanted to keep the baby and support her, but she knew he wouldn't understand the risks from her family. She got an abortion to protect herself and possibly her boyfriend from her family's violence.\n\nLegal aspect: In many places, abortion is legal, especially in early stages. Since she was nine weeks pregnant, and the procedure was medical, it's likely legal where she is. So legally, she's not breaking any laws.\n\nEthically, the question is more complex. She made a decision without her partner's knowledge. The boyfriend had expressed wanting to be a father, so she went against his wishes. However, she believed her life was at risk. The key here is survival vs. parental rights. In life-threatening situations, self-preservation is usually prioritized. Her family's threat of honor killing is a serious, life-threatening issue.\n\nCultural context: Honor killings are real and severe. Her decision might be seen as necessary for survival. In such cases, the ethical dilemma is between following a partner's wishes and preventing murder.\n\nEmotionally, she's struggling with guilt, which shows she's aware of the moral conflict. She had to choose between her life and her partner's expectations. The boyfriend's lack of understanding of her family's severity might mean he couldn't have made that calculation.\n\nSo, considering all factors: Her decision was made under extreme fear for her life. She took action to prevent a death sentence. While she withheld information from her partner, her actions were self-preserving in a life-threatening context. Therefore, she's not in the wrong.\n"
