I didn't think of using plan B as I have PCOS and was told it would be hard for me to have children without treatment, so at that point I was mostly worried about STDs. One month later I bought a pregnancy test as my period was late and it came back positive right away. I can't describe how I felt at that moment, I was euphoric because I realized I could have children but also terrified because I knew I wouldn't be able to keep my baby although I wanted it more than anything in the world.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI come from a very very conservative family, honour killings are frequent where my parents are from. I'm not allowed to date, let alone have sex before marriage, so them knowing about the pregnancy would be a death sentence for me. My cousin was severly beaten up by her father and brothers for hanging out with a boy after school. If they found out, they would take me to their home country and kill me there, and no one would know about it. They would also find a way to hurt my boyfriend. My parents trust me entirely and think I'm a virgin, they would lose their mind over this. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy boyfriend and I have often talked about what we would do if I got pregnant. He told me he would be there for me, get a full time job, an appartment. He always said it would be a blessing to have kids with me. I have told him about how my parents would react but he wouldn't understand. He thought they would be mad at me but would eventually let it go, but I know my parents and they would definetly not react this way. If my boyfriend found out I was pregnant he would'nt have let me get an abortion. I know he would have been thrilled to be a father.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo when I found out I was pregnant I knew what I had to do, but I was terrified, angry and disgusted at myself for doing this to my baby. I was nine weeks pregnant when I had a medical abortion at the hospital all by myself. \n\nI keep thinking about what would have happened if I was born into a different, more tolerant family. It's been five weeks since the abortion and I feel extremely disgusted with myself for doing this behind my boyfriend's back. It was his baby too and I really wish we could have kept it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\ntl;dr : I got pregnant and got an abortion to avoid being a victim of honour killing. I hid the pregnancy and abortion from my boyfriend because he would have wanted me to keep it, and doesn't believe what my parents are capable of in order to save their \"honour\". AITA ?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong for having an abortion without telling her boyfriend. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The woman had an accidental pregnancy after a broken condom. She had PCOS, which made her worry about fertility, but she didn't take Plan B. Then she found out she was pregnant. Her family is very conservative, from a place where honor killings happen. She's afraid her family would kill her and her boyfriend if they found out about the pregnancy. Her boyfriend wanted to keep the baby, but she knew he wouldn't understand the danger. So she had an abortion secretly.\n\nNow, the question is whether she's in the wrong. The user initially thinks she is, but wants others' opinions. \n\nI need to consider different perspectives. Legally, abortion laws vary by country. If she's in a place where abortion is legal, she might not be in the wrong. But if it's illegal, maybe she's breaking the law. However, the story mentions she had a medical abortion at the hospital, so it's possible it's legal where she is.\n\nEthically, the situation is complex. She made a choice to protect herself and her boyfriend from life-threatening family violence. Her boyfriend wanted to keep the child, but he didn't understand the severity of the family's reaction. She felt it was necessary to act to save their lives. On the other hand, she didn't inform her partner, which might affect their trust and relationship. However, her decision was based on fear of death, which is a strong motivator.\n\nReligiously or culturally, her family's background might view abortion as wrong. But the alternative is her being killed, which is a more immediate threat. The question is whether her survival justifies the decision to have an abortion. Many would argue that self-preservation is crucial here.\n\nEmotionally, she's struggling with guilt and wishes she could have kept the baby. That shows internal conflict, but it's also a sign of the difficult choice she made.\n\nIn terms of betrayal, she didn't lie to him about the pregnancy itself but chose not to tell him. However, since she had the abortion without his knowledge, that could be seen as a breach of trust. But in her mind, telling him might have put both of them in danger if he had insisted on keeping the baby and her family found out.\n\nSo, considering all factors: the immediate danger of family violence, the legality of the procedure, the boyfriend's lack of understanding, and her own safety, it's possible that she's not in the wrong. Her decision was made in a life-threatening context, and she acted to protect herself and her partner. The secrecy was to prevent a greater harm. Therefore, the answer might be B (Not in the wrong).\n"
