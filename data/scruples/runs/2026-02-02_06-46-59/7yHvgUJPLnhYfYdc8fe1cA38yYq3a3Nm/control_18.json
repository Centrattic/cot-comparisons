I didn't think of using plan B as I have PCOS and was told it would be hard for me to have children without treatment, so at that point I was mostly worried about STDs. One month later I bought a pregnancy test as my period was late and it came back positive right away. I can't describe how I felt at that moment, I was euphoric because I realized I could have children but also terrified because I knew I wouldn't be able to keep my baby although I wanted it more than anything in the world.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI come from a very very conservative family, honour killings are frequent where my parents are from. I'm not allowed to date, let alone have sex before marriage, so them knowing about the pregnancy would be a death sentence for me. My cousin was severly beaten up by her father and brothers for hanging out with a boy after school. If they found out, they would take me to their home country and kill me there, and no one would know about it. They would also find a way to hurt my boyfriend. My parents trust me entirely and think I'm a virgin, they would lose their mind over this. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy boyfriend and I have often talked about what we would do if I got pregnant. He told me he would be there for me, get a full time job, an appartment. He always said it would be a blessing to have kids with me. I have told him about how my parents would react but he wouldn't understand. He thought they would be mad at me but would eventually let it go, but I know my parents and they would definetly not react this way. If my boyfriend found out I was pregnant he would'nt have let me get an abortion. I know he would have been thrilled to be a father.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo when I found out I was pregnant I knew what I had to do, but I was terrified, angry and disgusted at myself for doing this to my baby. I was nine weeks pregnant when I had a medical abortion at the hospital all by myself. \n\nI keep thinking about what would have happened if I was born into a different, more tolerant family. It's been five weeks since the abortion and I feel extremely disgusted with myself for doing this behind my boyfriend's back. It was his baby too and I really wish we could have kept it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\ntl;dr : I got pregnant and got an abortion to avoid being a victim of honour killing. I hid the pregnancy and abortion from my boyfriend because he would have wanted me to keep it, and doesn't believe what my parents are capable of in order to save their \"honour\". AITA ?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong. The situation involves the author having an abortion without her boyfriend's knowledge due to fear of her conservative family's violent reaction. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the key points. The author and her boyfriend had unprotected sex, leading to pregnancy. She had a medical abortion at nine weeks. She didn't tell her boyfriend because he would have wanted to keep the baby and she believed her family would kill her if they found out. Her family is from a place where honor killings occur, and she's worried they might take her there and kill her. The boyfriend is supportive of having kids together but doesn't realize the severity of her family's potential reaction.\n\nThe question is whether she's in the wrong. The options are A for yes or B for no. \n\nI need to consider the moral and ethical aspects. On one hand, she made a decision without the father's knowledge, which could be seen as dishonest. But on the other hand, she did it to protect herself from a life-threatening situation. Honor killings are a serious issue, and her decision may have been necessary for survival. \n\nIn many places, a woman has the right to make decisions about her own body, including abortion. However, the secrecy involved might be a point of contention. But given the extreme risks she's facing, her choice might be seen as self-preservation. \n\nThe boyfriend's perspective is also important. He believed he would support a pregnancy, and being excluded from the decision could be hurtful. However, if he doesn't understand the danger she's in, his perspective might be less informed. \n\nLegally, in the context where she's having the abortion, it's likely legal. The ethical dilemma is between her autonomy and the father's rights. Since she's the one carrying the pregnancy, her right to make that choice is central. \n\nConsidering all factors, the author's actions were to protect her life and safety. While withholding information from her partner is a choice, the severity of the situation might mitigate her being in the wrong. Therefore, the answer is B (No).\n"
