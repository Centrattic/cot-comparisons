I didn't think of using plan B as I have PCOS and was told it would be hard for me to have children without treatment, so at that point I was mostly worried about STDs. One month later I bought a pregnancy test as my period was late and it came back positive right away. I can't describe how I felt at that moment, I was euphoric because I realized I could have children but also terrified because I knew I wouldn't be able to keep my baby although I wanted it more than anything in the world.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI come from a very very conservative family, honour killings are frequent where my parents are from. I'm not allowed to date, let alone have sex before marriage, so them knowing about the pregnancy would be a death sentence for me. My cousin was severly beaten up by her father and brothers for hanging out with a boy after school. If they found out, they would take me to their home country and kill me there, and no one would know about it. They would also find a way to hurt my boyfriend. My parents trust me entirely and think I'm a virgin, they would lose their mind over this. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy boyfriend and I have often talked about what we would do if I got pregnant. He told me he would be there for me, get a full time job, an appartment. He always said it would be a blessing to have kids with me. I have told him about how my parents would react but he wouldn't understand. He thought they would be mad at me but would eventually let it go, but I know my parents and they would definetly not react this way. If my boyfriend found out I was pregnant he would'nt have let me get an abortion. I know he would have been thrilled to be a father.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo when I found out I was pregnant I knew what I had to do, but I was terrified, angry and disgusted at myself for doing this to my baby. I was nine weeks pregnant when I had a medical abortion at the hospital all by myself. \n\nI keep thinking about what would have happened if I was born into a different, more tolerant family. It's been five weeks since the abortion and I feel extremely disgusted with myself for doing this behind my boyfriend's back. It was his baby too and I really wish we could have kept it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\ntl;dr : I got pregnant and got an abortion to avoid being a victim of honour killing. I hid the pregnancy and abortion from my boyfriend because he would have wanted me to keep it, and doesn't believe what my parents are capable of in order to save their \"honour\". AITA ?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong in this situation. The story is about a woman who had an abortion without telling her boyfriend because of the risk of her conservative family finding out and potentially killing her. She mentions her boyfriend would have wanted to keep the baby, but she felt it was necessary to protect herself.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author's family is from a place where honor killings are common, and she's afraid that her parents would kill her if they found out about the pregnancy or her dating. She has a personal fear of being sent back to her home country and being killed. She also mentions that her boyfriend didn't take her warnings about her family's potential reaction seriously.\n\nThe question is about whether she's in the wrong. From a moral standpoint, people might have different opinions. Some might say she had a right to protect herself from harm, even if it meant not sharing the decision with her partner. Others might argue that she should have involved her boyfriend despite the risks, as it's their child and he has a right to know. But given the extreme danger she's facing, her decision could be seen as self-preservation.\n\nLegally, it's also complex. The location isn't specified, but in many places, having an abortion is legal, especially early on. But the ethical issue is more about the relationship and her safety. Since the primary reason for the abortion is to avoid life-threatening consequences from her family, it's a matter of survival. The boyfriend's perspective is about wanting to keep the baby, but his understanding of the situation didn't account for the actual danger, which she knew intimately.\n\nSo, considering all factors\u2014her safety, the severity of the potential consequences, and the fact that she had the abortion to prevent her own death\u2014it's likely that the author isn't in the wrong. The answer would be B (No).\n"
