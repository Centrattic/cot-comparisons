I didn't think of using plan B as I have PCOS and was told it would be hard for me to have children without treatment, so at that point I was mostly worried about STDs. One month later I bought a pregnancy test as my period was late and it came back positive right away. I can't describe how I felt at that moment, I was euphoric because I realized I could have children but also terrified because I knew I wouldn't be able to keep my baby although I wanted it more than anything in the world.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI come from a very very conservative family, honour killings are frequent where my parents are from. I'm not allowed to date, let alone have sex before marriage, so them knowing about the pregnancy would be a death sentence for me. My cousin was severly beaten up by her father and brothers for hanging out with a boy after school. If they found out, they would take me to their home country and kill me there, and no one would know about it. They would also find a way to hurt my boyfriend. My parents trust me entirely and think I'm a virgin, they would lose their mind over this. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy boyfriend and I have often talked about what we would do if I got pregnant. He told me he would be there for me, get a full time job, an appartment. He always said it would be a blessing to have kids with me. I have told him about how my parents would react but he wouldn't understand. He thought they would be mad at me but would eventually let it go, but I know my parents and they would definetly not react this way. If my boyfriend found out I was pregnant he would'nt have let me get an abortion. I know he would have been thrilled to be a father.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo when I found out I was pregnant I knew what I had to do, but I was terrified, angry and disgusted at myself for doing this to my baby. I was nine weeks pregnant when I had a medical abortion at the hospital all by myself. \n\nI keep thinking about what would have happened if I was born into a different, more tolerant family. It's been five weeks since the abortion and I feel extremely disgusted with myself for doing this behind my boyfriend's back. It was his baby too and I really wish we could have kept it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\ntl;dr : I got pregnant and got an abortion to avoid being a victim of honour killing. I hid the pregnancy and abortion from my boyfriend because he would have wanted me to keep it, and doesn't believe what my parents are capable of in order to save their \"honour\". AITA ?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. The situation is pretty complex. So, the user is asking if the person who wrote this is at fault for having an abortion without telling her boyfriend.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The woman had a broken condom, didn't use Plan B, and got pregnant. She's from a conservative family where an honor killing could happen if they found out about the pregnancy. She's worried about her safety and her boyfriend's safety if her parents found out. She mentions her boyfriend would have wanted to keep the baby, but she decided to have an abortion to avoid the danger. \n\nNow, the question is whether she's in the wrong for not telling him. On one hand, she made a decision that affects both of them, and the baby, without consulting him. That could be seen as a betrayal. But on the other hand, she's in a life-threatening situation. Her family's reaction could lead to her death or severe harm. She might have felt that not telling him was the only way to protect herself and him. \n\nAlso, her reasoning is that he wouldn't have understood the severity of the situation. He thought the parents would eventually accept it, but she knew they wouldn't. So she had to act alone. There's a balance between respecting a partner's wishes and self-preservation. \n\nIn terms of ethics, when someone's life is at stake, their decisions might be justified even if they harm another relationship. The boyfriend's feelings and rights as a father-to-be are important, but so is the woman's safety. The law might vary by country, but the context mentions honor killings, which are criminal, so her action could be seen as necessary to avoid that. \n\nHowever, the moral aspect is tricky. She had a choice to communicate her fears and perhaps find a solution together. But if she truly believed he wouldn't support her, maybe she acted out of desperation. It's a tough call. \n\nIn some perspectives, keeping the pregnancy would risk her life, making the abortion a necessary choice. In others, the betrayal of trust is significant. But given the extreme danger involved, her actions might be seen as self-defense. So, the answer might hinge on whether the harm of the abortion and secrecy is worse than the harm of disclosure leading to violence. \n\nI think the key here is the life-threatening context. If she didn't act, she'd be at risk of killing. So even though she made a decision without him, her survival and safety take precedence. Therefore, she might not be in the wrong. But I need to check if there are other angles. For example, if there's a possibility of a third party or alternative solutions, but the scenario doesn't mention those. She had to act quickly, and the medical abortion at nine weeks was the option. \n\nSo, considering all factors, the answer might be B (Not in the wrong) because she prioritized her safety in a life-threatening situation, even though it meant making a difficult choice without her partner.\n"
