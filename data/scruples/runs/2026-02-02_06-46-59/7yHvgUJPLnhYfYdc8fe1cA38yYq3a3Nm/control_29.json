I didn't think of using plan B as I have PCOS and was told it would be hard for me to have children without treatment, so at that point I was mostly worried about STDs. One month later I bought a pregnancy test as my period was late and it came back positive right away. I can't describe how I felt at that moment, I was euphoric because I realized I could have children but also terrified because I knew I wouldn't be able to keep my baby although I wanted it more than anything in the world.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI come from a very very conservative family, honour killings are frequent where my parents are from. I'm not allowed to date, let alone have sex before marriage, so them knowing about the pregnancy would be a death sentence for me. My cousin was severly beaten up by her father and brothers for hanging out with a boy after school. If they found out, they would take me to their home country and kill me there, and no one would know about it. They would also find a way to hurt my boyfriend. My parents trust me entirely and think I'm a virgin, they would lose their mind over this. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy boyfriend and I have often talked about what we would do if I got pregnant. He told me he would be there for me, get a full time job, an appartment. He always said it would be a blessing to have kids with me. I have told him about how my parents would react but he wouldn't understand. He thought they would be mad at me but would eventually let it go, but I know my parents and they would definetly not react this way. If my boyfriend found out I was pregnant he would'nt have let me get an abortion. I know he would have been thrilled to be a father.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo when I found out I was pregnant I knew what I had to do, but I was terrified, angry and disgusted at myself for doing this to my baby. I was nine weeks pregnant when I had a medical abortion at the hospital all by myself. \n\nI keep thinking about what would have happened if I was born into a different, more tolerant family. It's been five weeks since the abortion and I feel extremely disgusted with myself for doing this behind my boyfriend's back. It was his baby too and I really wish we could have kept it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\ntl;dr : I got pregnant and got an abortion to avoid being a victim of honour killing. I hid the pregnancy and abortion from my boyfriend because he would have wanted me to keep it, and doesn't believe what my parents are capable of in order to save their \"honour\". AITA ?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the \"AITA\" (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong for having an abortion without telling her boyfriend. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The woman had an accidental pregnancy, and her family is extremely conservative with a history of honor killings. She believes her parents would kill her if they found out about the pregnancy. Her boyfriend, on the other hand, wanted to keep the child and wasn't aware of the severity of her family's potential reaction. She decided to have an abortion secretly because she felt it was the only way to protect herself and her boyfriend from her family's violence.\n\nNow, considering the ethical and moral aspects. Legally, abortion is a complex issue depending on the country, but since she had it in a hospital, it's presumably legal where she is. The key points here are consent, autonomy, and safety. The woman made a decision based on her assessment of the risks to her life and her boyfriend's. She mentions feeling disgusted with herself, indicating internal conflict, but her reasoning is rooted in survival.\n\nMorally, is she in the wrong? Well, she didn't inform her boyfriend, which could be seen as a breach of trust. However, her decision was made under extreme duress to prevent a life-threatening situation. The boyfriend's desire to keep the child is valid, but the woman's right to make decisions about her own body, especially in life-threatening circumstances, is a significant factor. Additionally, the cultural context of honor killings adds a layer of urgency and fear that her boyfriend might not fully grasp.\n\nIn many ethical frameworks, the preservation of life (her life) is prioritized over the potential life of the fetus when there's a direct threat. The woman acted to protect herself from immediate harm, which is generally considered a justifiable action. The secrecy was a result of her belief that her boyfriend wouldn't support her decision and might even endanger them both if he insisted on keeping the child.\n\nHowever, some might argue that she should have found another way to involve her boyfriend, but given her assessment of his understanding of the situation, it's possible she felt there was no safe way to do so without increasing the risk. The question of whether she's in the wrong hinges on balancing autonomy, safety, and trust. Since her actions were to prevent imminent harm, many would side with her not being in the wrong. Therefore, the answer is B.\n"
