I didn't think of using plan B as I have PCOS and was told it would be hard for me to have children without treatment, so at that point I was mostly worried about STDs. One month later I bought a pregnancy test as my period was late and it came back positive right away. I can't describe how I felt at that moment, I was euphoric because I realized I could have children but also terrified because I knew I wouldn't be able to keep my baby although I wanted it more than anything in the world.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI come from a very very conservative family, honour killings are frequent where my parents are from. I'm not allowed to date, let alone have sex before marriage, so them knowing about the pregnancy would be a death sentence for me. My cousin was severly beaten up by her father and brothers for hanging out with a boy after school. If they found out, they would take me to their home country and kill me there, and no one would know about it. They would also find a way to hurt my boyfriend. My parents trust me entirely and think I'm a virgin, they would lose their mind over this. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy boyfriend and I have often talked about what we would do if I got pregnant. He told me he would be there for me, get a full time job, an appartment. He always said it would be a blessing to have kids with me. I have told him about how my parents would react but he wouldn't understand. He thought they would be mad at me but would eventually let it go, but I know my parents and they would definetly not react this way. If my boyfriend found out I was pregnant he would'nt have let me get an abortion. I know he would have been thrilled to be a father.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo when I found out I was pregnant I knew what I had to do, but I was terrified, angry and disgusted at myself for doing this to my baby. I was nine weeks pregnant when I had a medical abortion at the hospital all by myself. \n\nI keep thinking about what would have happened if I was born into a different, more tolerant family. It's been five weeks since the abortion and I feel extremely disgusted with myself for doing this behind my boyfriend's back. It was his baby too and I really wish we could have kept it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\ntl;dr : I got pregnant and got an abortion to avoid being a victim of honour killing. I hid the pregnancy and abortion from my boyfriend because he would have wanted me to keep it, and doesn't believe what my parents are capable of in order to save their \"honour\". AITA ?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for getting an abortion without telling her boyfriend. The situation is pretty complex.\n\nFirst, the context: she's from a conservative family where honor killings are a real fear. She had a pregnancy that she couldn't risk revealing because of the danger to herself and her boyfriend. She mentions that her boyfriend wanted to keep the child, but she knew he didn't understand the severity of her family's reaction. She felt she had no choice but to act alone to save her life and his.\n\nSo, the main points here are the threat to her safety, the pressure from her family, and the conflict with her boyfriend's wishes. Legally, in many places, a woman has the right to decide about her own body. Ethically, it's about her autonomy and self-preservation. She also mentions the emotional turmoil she feels, which adds to the complexity.\n\nOn the other hand, she didn't share the decision with her partner, which could be seen as a breach of trust. But considering the life-threatening consequences if he had known, maybe her priority was to protect both of them. The boyfriend's desire to have the child is valid, but his understanding of the risks was limited. She had to make a choice based on her knowledge of her family's potential actions.\n\nIn terms of responsibility, she's in a life-threatening situation. The decision to abort was likely a matter of survival. The boyfriend's reaction could have been different if he'd known the full extent of the danger. She might have felt that involving him would put both of them at risk. \n\nConsidering all this, the answer leans towards her not being in the wrong because her actions were to protect herself and her partner from lethal consequences. The decision was made under extreme pressure and fear, not out of selfishness. The boyfriend's wishes, while important, might have been secondary to the immediate danger posed by her family.\n"
