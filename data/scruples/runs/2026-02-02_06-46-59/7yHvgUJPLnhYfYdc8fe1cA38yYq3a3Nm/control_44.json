I didn't think of using plan B as I have PCOS and was told it would be hard for me to have children without treatment, so at that point I was mostly worried about STDs. One month later I bought a pregnancy test as my period was late and it came back positive right away. I can't describe how I felt at that moment, I was euphoric because I realized I could have children but also terrified because I knew I wouldn't be able to keep my baby although I wanted it more than anything in the world.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI come from a very very conservative family, honour killings are frequent where my parents are from. I'm not allowed to date, let alone have sex before marriage, so them knowing about the pregnancy would be a death sentence for me. My cousin was severly beaten up by her father and brothers for hanging out with a boy after school. If they found out, they would take me to their home country and kill me there, and no one would know about it. They would also find a way to hurt my boyfriend. My parents trust me entirely and think I'm a virgin, they would lose their mind over this. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy boyfriend and I have often talked about what we would do if I got pregnant. He told me he would be there for me, get a full time job, an appartment. He always said it would be a blessing to have kids with me. I have told him about how my parents would react but he wouldn't understand. He thought they would be mad at me but would eventually let it go, but I know my parents and they would definetly not react this way. If my boyfriend found out I was pregnant he would'nt have let me get an abortion. I know he would have been thrilled to be a father.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo when I found out I was pregnant I knew what I had to do, but I was terrified, angry and disgusted at myself for doing this to my baby. I was nine weeks pregnant when I had a medical abortion at the hospital all by myself. \n\nI keep thinking about what would have happened if I was born into a different, more tolerant family. It's been five weeks since the abortion and I feel extremely disgusted with myself for doing this behind my boyfriend's back. It was his baby too and I really wish we could have kept it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\ntl;dr : I got pregnant and got an abortion to avoid being a victim of honour killing. I hid the pregnancy and abortion from my boyfriend because he would have wanted me to keep it, and doesn't believe what my parents are capable of in order to save their \"honour\". AITA ?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the situation is in the wrong. The scenario involves a woman getting an abortion without her boyfriend's knowledge due to her fear of an honor killing from her conservative family. She mentions that her boyfriend would have wanted to keep the child and support her, but she hid the pregnancy and abortion because she believed her parents would harm her and her boyfriend if they found out.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical and moral aspects here. The woman made a decision based on her life-threatening circumstances. Honor killings are real and severe, so her fear isn't unfounded. She also mentions her medical condition (PCOS) which affected her fertility, adding another layer of urgency. However, she didn't disclose the pregnancy or the abortion to her partner, which he might consider a breach of trust, especially since he wanted to be involved and support her.\n\nLegally, in many places, a woman has the right to make decisions about her own body, including abortion. But the moral question is more complex. The boyfriend's perspective is that he would have supported her and wanted to be a father, so her decision to hide it might be seen as disregarding his rights as a co-parent. However, her safety and life are at stake, which complicates things.\n\nCultural context is crucial here. The woman comes from a family where such a situation could lead to violence. Her choice to protect herself and her partner from potential harm by keeping it secret is a matter of survival. On the other hand, withholding such significant information from her partner can strain the relationship and cause emotional distress.\n\nI should also consider the psychological impact on the woman. She feels disgusted with herself, indicating internal conflict. The decision to have an abortion was likely extremely difficult, and the lack of support from her boyfriend (had he known) might have added to her stress.\n\nIn terms of responsibility, is she the one at fault? If her actions were necessary to prevent greater harm, then the answer leans towards her not being in the wrong. But if the relationship's trust is broken, that's another angle. However, given the life-threatening nature of her family's potential reaction, her decision prioritizes her survival, which is a fundamental right.\n\nSo, weighing these factors, the answer would be that she's not in the wrong. The answer is B.\n"
