I didn't think of using plan B as I have PCOS and was told it would be hard for me to have children without treatment, so at that point I was mostly worried about STDs. One month later I bought a pregnancy test as my period was late and it came back positive right away. I can't describe how I felt at that moment, I was euphoric because I realized I could have children but also terrified because I knew I wouldn't be able to keep my baby although I wanted it more than anything in the world.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI come from a very very conservative family, honour killings are frequent where my parents are from. I'm not allowed to date, let alone have sex before marriage, so them knowing about the pregnancy would be a death sentence for me. My cousin was severly beaten up by her father and brothers for hanging out with a boy after school. If they found out, they would take me to their home country and kill me there, and no one would know about it. They would also find a way to hurt my boyfriend. My parents trust me entirely and think I'm a virgin, they would lose their mind over this. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy boyfriend and I have often talked about what we would do if I got pregnant. He told me he would be there for me, get a full time job, an appartment. He always said it would be a blessing to have kids with me. I have told him about how my parents would react but he wouldn't understand. He thought they would be mad at me but would eventually let it go, but I know my parents and they would definetly not react this way. If my boyfriend found out I was pregnant he would'nt have let me get an abortion. I know he would have been thrilled to be a father.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo when I found out I was pregnant I knew what I had to do, but I was terrified, angry and disgusted at myself for doing this to my baby. I was nine weeks pregnant when I had a medical abortion at the hospital all by myself. \n\nI keep thinking about what would have happened if I was born into a different, more tolerant family. It's been five weeks since the abortion and I feel extremely disgusted with myself for doing this behind my boyfriend's back. It was his baby too and I really wish we could have kept it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\ntl;dr : I got pregnant and got an abortion to avoid being a victim of honour killing. I hid the pregnancy and abortion from my boyfriend because he would have wanted me to keep it, and doesn't believe what my parents are capable of in order to save their \"honour\". AITA ?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to work through this. The user is asking whether the author of the story is in the wrong for having an abortion without telling her boyfriend. The situation is pretty complex with a lot of factors involved.\n\nFirst, the author had an accidental pregnancy due to a broken condom. She mentions she has PCOS and was told it might be hard to conceive without treatment. She initially didn't take Plan B because she was worried about STDs. Then she found out she was pregnant and decided to have an abortion. The main reasons given are the risk of an honor killing from her conservative family and the belief that her boyfriend would want to keep the baby despite the dangers.\n\nThe user thinks the author is in the wrong but wants others' opinions. I need to consider both sides. On one hand, the boyfriend was not informed, so he didn't get a say in the decision. That could be seen as a betrayal since it's their child together. There's also the ethical aspect of making a life-altering decision without the other parent's input.\n\nOn the other hand, the author faced a life-threatening situation with her family. If she had told her boyfriend, he might have wanted to keep the baby, which could lead to her being forced into a situation where her life is at risk. She also mentions her parents would take her to their home country and kill her. The decision was made to protect her life and her family's violent reaction. In some legal systems, abortion is a personal choice, but here it's more about survival.\n\nCultural context matters too. Honor killings are real and severe in certain regions. The author's decision might be seen as a necessary action to prevent her own death. However, in many places, the law might not support this reasoning, and there's a lack of legal justification for hiding such a decision from a partner.\n\nThere's also the emotional aspect. The author feels guilty for not involving her boyfriend and for the abortion itself. She wishes they could have kept the baby but felt she had no choice. The boyfriend's trust might be broken as he was kept in the dark about a major decision affecting both of them.\n\nI need to weigh these factors. Is the author in the wrong for not being honest with her partner? Or is it understandable given the extreme circumstances? In some perspectives, self-preservation is justified, especially to avoid violence. However, the ethical obligation to a partner in a relationship might require transparency, even in dangerous situations. There's also the question of whether there were other options, like seeking help from authorities or others to ensure both her and the baby's safety.\n\nBut considering the severity of the threat from her family, and that there's no indication she had support systems to rely on, her actions might be seen as a desperate measure to save her life. The boyfriend's lack of understanding of the family's potential reaction complicates things. The author might have believed that her knowledge of her family's behavior made her the best judge of the risk.\n\nIn conclusion, while the author made a decision without her partner's consent, the circumstances are extreme and could be seen as justifying her actions. However, ethically, it's a tough spot. Legally, depending on the country, abortion might be permissible, but the secrecy adds another layer. The answer hinges on whether the life-saving reasons outweigh the betrayal of trust. Given the high stakes, many might argue the author was not in the wrong.\n"
