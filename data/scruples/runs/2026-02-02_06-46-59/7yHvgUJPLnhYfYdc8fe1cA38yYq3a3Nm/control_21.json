I didn't think of using plan B as I have PCOS and was told it would be hard for me to have children without treatment, so at that point I was mostly worried about STDs. One month later I bought a pregnancy test as my period was late and it came back positive right away. I can't describe how I felt at that moment, I was euphoric because I realized I could have children but also terrified because I knew I wouldn't be able to keep my baby although I wanted it more than anything in the world.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI come from a very very conservative family, honour killings are frequent where my parents are from. I'm not allowed to date, let alone have sex before marriage, so them knowing about the pregnancy would be a death sentence for me. My cousin was severly beaten up by her father and brothers for hanging out with a boy after school. If they found out, they would take me to their home country and kill me there, and no one would know about it. They would also find a way to hurt my boyfriend. My parents trust me entirely and think I'm a virgin, they would lose their mind over this. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy boyfriend and I have often talked about what we would do if I got pregnant. He told me he would be there for me, get a full time job, an appartment. He always said it would be a blessing to have kids with me. I have told him about how my parents would react but he wouldn't understand. He thought they would be mad at me but would eventually let it go, but I know my parents and they would definetly not react this way. If my boyfriend found out I was pregnant he would'nt have let me get an abortion. I know he would have been thrilled to be a father.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo when I found out I was pregnant I knew what I had to do, but I was terrified, angry and disgusted at myself for doing this to my baby. I was nine weeks pregnant when I had a medical abortion at the hospital all by myself. \n\nI keep thinking about what would have happened if I was born into a different, more tolerant family. It's been five weeks since the abortion and I feel extremely disgusted with myself for doing this behind my boyfriend's back. It was his baby too and I really wish we could have kept it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\ntl;dr : I got pregnant and got an abortion to avoid being a victim of honour killing. I hid the pregnancy and abortion from my boyfriend because he would have wanted me to keep it, and doesn't believe what my parents are capable of in order to save their \"honour\". AITA ?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for having an abortion without telling her boyfriend. The situation is a bit complex. First, there's the broken condom leading to pregnancy. The author has PCOS and was worried about STDs initially. Then, when she found out she was pregnant, she was conflicted but decided to have a medical abortion at nine weeks.\n\nThe key points here are the cultural context and the boyfriend's potential reaction. The author comes from a conservative family where honor killings are a real fear. She mentions her cousin was beaten for dating a boy, so she's terrified her parents would kill her if they found out about the pregnancy. They also might hurt her boyfriend. The boyfriend, on the other hand, believed they would handle it together, get a job, an apartment, and be happy. She knows he wouldn't have let her get an abortion and would have wanted the child.\n\nSo the dilemma is whether keeping the secret and proceeding with the abortion was the right choice given the extreme risks involved. From a moral standpoint, some might argue that the boyfriend had a right to know and make a decision together. However, considering the life-threatening danger from her family, prioritizing her safety and the boyfriend's safety might be seen as necessary. The author wasn't in a position to make the decision with him because of the risk of him wanting to keep the baby, which could lead to their deaths.\n\nLegally, abortion is a personal decision, but the ethical angle here is more about the circumstances. The author's choice was made to prevent violence and save lives, which is a heavy burden. The question is about being \"in the wrong,\" which often relates to moral judgment. If the boyfriend felt betrayed, that's a valid emotion, but the author's actions were to protect herself and her partner from fatal consequences. In such extreme cases, many would argue that self-preservation and protecting others from harm outweigh the obligation to disclose the pregnancy and abortion, especially given the boyfriend's inability to fully grasp the severity of the family's potential reaction. So, the answer might be B (No), but I need to make sure I'm not missing any other angles. The boyfriend's desire to keep the child versus the author's need to stay alive. The answer hinges on the danger of non-disclosure versus the danger of the situation if disclosed. Since the author correctly assessed her family's capability for violence, her decision seems justified. Therefore, she's not in the wrong.\n"
