I didn't think of using plan B as I have PCOS and was told it would be hard for me to have children without treatment, so at that point I was mostly worried about STDs. One month later I bought a pregnancy test as my period was late and it came back positive right away. I can't describe how I felt at that moment, I was euphoric because I realized I could have children but also terrified because I knew I wouldn't be able to keep my baby although I wanted it more than anything in the world.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI come from a very very conservative family, honour killings are frequent where my parents are from. I'm not allowed to date, let alone have sex before marriage, so them knowing about the pregnancy would be a death sentence for me. My cousin was severly beaten up by her father and brothers for hanging out with a boy after school. If they found out, they would take me to their home country and kill me there, and no one would know about it. They would also find a way to hurt my boyfriend. My parents trust me entirely and think I'm a virgin, they would lose their mind over this. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy boyfriend and I have often talked about what we would do if I got pregnant. He told me he would be there for me, get a full time job, an appartment. He always said it would be a blessing to have kids with me. I have told him about how my parents would react but he wouldn't understand. He thought they would be mad at me but would eventually let it go, but I know my parents and they would definetly not react this way. If my boyfriend found out I was pregnant he would'nt have let me get an abortion. I know he would have been thrilled to be a father.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo when I found out I was pregnant I knew what I had to do, but I was terrified, angry and disgusted at myself for doing this to my baby. I was nine weeks pregnant when I had a medical abortion at the hospital all by myself. \n\nI keep thinking about what would have happened if I was born into a different, more tolerant family. It's been five weeks since the abortion and I feel extremely disgusted with myself for doing this behind my boyfriend's back. It was his baby too and I really wish we could have kept it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\ntl;dr : I got pregnant and got an abortion to avoid being a victim of honour killing. I hid the pregnancy and abortion from my boyfriend because he would have wanted me to keep it, and doesn't believe what my parents are capable of in order to save their \"honour\". AITA ?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about getting an abortion without her boyfriend's knowledge. The main points are: she's from a conservative family where an honor killing is a real possibility if they found out she was pregnant. The boyfriend wanted to keep the baby, but she believed that if he knew she was pregnant, he wouldn't let her get an abortion. She did the abortion in secret because she felt it was the only way to protect herself and her boyfriend from her family's violent reaction.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the moral and ethical angles. On one hand, she made a decision that affected both her and her boyfriend, without consulting him. That could be seen as a breach of trust. On the other hand, she was in a life-threatening situation where her safety and her boyfriend's safety were at risk. The context of an honor-based family and the cultural background are crucial here. If her parents would actually kill her and her boyfriend, then her decision might be seen as self-preservation.\n\nAlso, the emotional aspect is important. She was terrified and felt disgusted with herself, which shows the internal conflict she had. The boyfriend wanted to be a father, so she took away that choice from him. However, she believed that revealing the pregnancy would lead to catastrophic consequences. \n\nLegally, in many places, a woman has the right to make her own reproductive decisions, even without a partner's consent. But ethically, it's more complex. She had to weigh her safety against her partner's expectations. Since her life and his were at risk, the decision might be justified from a self-defense perspective. \n\nThe question is whether she's in the wrong. If we consider the context of her family's potential violence, hiding the pregnancy could be a necessary action to prevent harm. However, keeping such a major decision secret could be seen as dishonest. But in a situation where honesty could lead to death, the priority is survival. \n\nSo, balancing these factors, it's a tough call. But considering the extreme danger she was in, many might argue that her decision was necessary for her survival, making her not in the wrong. Therefore, the answer might be B (No).\n"
