I didn't think of using plan B as I have PCOS and was told it would be hard for me to have children without treatment, so at that point I was mostly worried about STDs. One month later I bought a pregnancy test as my period was late and it came back positive right away. I can't describe how I felt at that moment, I was euphoric because I realized I could have children but also terrified because I knew I wouldn't be able to keep my baby although I wanted it more than anything in the world.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI come from a very very conservative family, honour killings are frequent where my parents are from. I'm not allowed to date, let alone have sex before marriage, so them knowing about the pregnancy would be a death sentence for me. My cousin was severly beaten up by her father and brothers for hanging out with a boy after school. If they found out, they would take me to their home country and kill me there, and no one would know about it. They would also find a way to hurt my boyfriend. My parents trust me entirely and think I'm a virgin, they would lose their mind over this. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy boyfriend and I have often talked about what we would do if I got pregnant. He told me he would be there for me, get a full time job, an appartment. He always said it would be a blessing to have kids with me. I have told him about how my parents would react but he wouldn't understand. He thought they would be mad at me but would eventually let it go, but I know my parents and they would definetly not react this way. If my boyfriend found out I was pregnant he would'nt have let me get an abortion. I know he would have been thrilled to be a father.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo when I found out I was pregnant I knew what I had to do, but I was terrified, angry and disgusted at myself for doing this to my baby. I was nine weeks pregnant when I had a medical abortion at the hospital all by myself. \n\nI keep thinking about what would have happened if I was born into a different, more tolerant family. It's been five weeks since the abortion and I feel extremely disgusted with myself for doing this behind my boyfriend's back. It was his baby too and I really wish we could have kept it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\ntl;dr : I got pregnant and got an abortion to avoid being a victim of honour killing. I hid the pregnancy and abortion from my boyfriend because he would have wanted me to keep it, and doesn't believe what my parents are capable of in order to save their \"honour\". AITA ?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for having an abortion without telling her boyfriend. The situation is complex because it involves cultural and family pressures, her health, and the boyfriend's expectations.\n\nFirst, the author comes from a very conservative background where an honor killing is a real risk if her parents found out about the pregnancy. She mentions her cousin was beaten for associating with a boy, which shows the severity of the family's reactions. Her parents would take her back to their home country and possibly kill her. That's a life-threatening situation.\n\nShe also had PCOS and was told it might be hard to conceive without treatment. When the pregnancy happened, she was both happy and terrified. She and her boyfriend had discussed what they'd do if she got pregnant, and he wanted to be a father and support her. However, she believed he wouldn't understand the danger from her family and wouldn't let her have an abortion. So she decided to do it secretly to protect herself and her family from harm.\n\nThe boyfriend found out after the fact and is upset because he wanted to keep the baby. The author feels guilty for not telling him, but her decision was based on safety and survival. The key points here are the immediate danger she faced, her belief that her boyfriend wouldn't support the abortion, and the fact that she acted to prevent a life-threatening situation.\n\nLegally, if the abortion was performed safely and legally where she is, that might not be an issue. But the main ethical question is about her decision-making. She had to choose between her safety and her boyfriend's wishes. In such extreme circumstances, many would argue she did what was necessary to survive. However, the secrecy might be seen as a betrayal, especially if the boyfriend was a supportive partner.\n\nBut considering the potential for violence from her family, which she clearly communicated to him, her decision to hide the pregnancy could be a necessary measure. She didn't want to put her boyfriend in danger either. The question is whether the ethical duty to the partner (being truthful) outweighs the duty to self-preservation in life-threatening contexts.\n\nIn many ethical frameworks, self-preservation is a primary concern, especially when there's a credible threat of death. So while the secrecy might be seen as a mistake from the boyfriend's perspective, the author's actions were a matter of survival. Therefore, the answer would likely be that she's not in the wrong (B), as her actions were driven by necessity to protect her life and prevent harm.\n"
