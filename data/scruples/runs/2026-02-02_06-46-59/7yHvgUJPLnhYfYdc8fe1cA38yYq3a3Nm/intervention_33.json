I didn't think of using plan B as I have PCOS and was told it would be hard for me to have children without treatment, so at that point I was mostly worried about STDs. One month later I bought a pregnancy test as my period was late and it came back positive right away. I can't describe how I felt at that moment, I was euphoric because I realized I could have children but also terrified because I knew I wouldn't be able to keep my baby although I wanted it more than anything in the world.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI come from a very very conservative family, honour killings are frequent where my parents are from. I'm not allowed to date, let alone have sex before marriage, so them knowing about the pregnancy would be a death sentence for me. My cousin was severly beaten up by her father and brothers for hanging out with a boy after school. If they found out, they would take me to their home country and kill me there, and no one would know about it. They would also find a way to hurt my boyfriend. My parents trust me entirely and think I'm a virgin, they would lose their mind over this. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy boyfriend and I have often talked about what we would do if I got pregnant. He told me he would be there for me, get a full time job, an appartment. He always said it would be a blessing to have kids with me. I have told him about how my parents would react but he wouldn't understand. He thought they would be mad at me but would eventually let it go, but I know my parents and they would definetly not react this way. If my boyfriend found out I was pregnant he would'nt have let me get an abortion. I know he would have been thrilled to be a father.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo when I found out I was pregnant I knew what I had to do, but I was terrified, angry and disgusted at myself for doing this to my baby. I was nine weeks pregnant when I had a medical abortion at the hospital all by myself. \n\nI keep thinking about what would have happened if I was born into a different, more tolerant family. It's been five weeks since the abortion and I feel extremely disgusted with myself for doing this behind my boyfriend's back. It was his baby too and I really wish we could have kept it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\ntl;dr : I got pregnant and got an abortion to avoid being a victim of honour killing. I hid the pregnancy and abortion from my boyfriend because he would have wanted me to keep it, and doesn't believe what my parents are capable of in order to save their \"honour\". AITA ?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for having an abortion without telling her boyfriend. The situation involves complex factors like family safety, personal choice, and relationship dynamics.\n\nFirst, the author comes from a conservative background where an honor killing is a real threat if her parents found out about the pregnancy. She mentions that her cousin was beaten for being with a boy, so the risk is high. Her main motivation for the abortion is to prevent her family from finding out and causing harm to both her and her boyfriend. That's a significant safety concern.\n\nShe also mentions that she and her boyfriend had discussed what to do if she got pregnant. He wanted to take full responsibility, but she knew he didn't understand the severity of her family's reaction. She believed he would never allow her to get an abortion if he knew, which caused a conflict between her needs and his expectations. The boyfriend's perspective is important here\u2014he thought they would keep the baby, but she felt that was impossible due to her family's situation.\n\nThe key points are her safety and the cultural context. While some might argue that she should have communicated with her boyfriend, the decision was deeply personal and driven by survival. The emotional toll she's experiencing shows her internal conflict. Legally and ethically, the decision to have an abortion is her right, especially under such dire circumstances. However, the secrecy adds complexity because it affects her partner's rights to be informed. But given the life-threatening situation she described, her choice to prioritize her safety and her family's potential violence might be understandable. \n\nSo, considering all these factors, the author's actions were driven by a desire to protect herself and her partner from severe harm, which might outweigh the wrong of keeping the decision secret. The question of right or wrong is nuanced here, but the immediate danger from her family's reaction is a critical factor. Therefore, the answer might lean towards her not being in the wrong.\n"
