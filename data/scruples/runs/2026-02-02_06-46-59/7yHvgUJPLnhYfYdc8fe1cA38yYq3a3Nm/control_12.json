I didn't think of using plan B as I have PCOS and was told it would be hard for me to have children without treatment, so at that point I was mostly worried about STDs. One month later I bought a pregnancy test as my period was late and it came back positive right away. I can't describe how I felt at that moment, I was euphoric because I realized I could have children but also terrified because I knew I wouldn't be able to keep my baby although I wanted it more than anything in the world.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI come from a very very conservative family, honour killings are frequent where my parents are from. I'm not allowed to date, let alone have sex before marriage, so them knowing about the pregnancy would be a death sentence for me. My cousin was severly beaten up by her father and brothers for hanging out with a boy after school. If they found out, they would take me to their home country and kill me there, and no one would know about it. They would also find a way to hurt my boyfriend. My parents trust me entirely and think I'm a virgin, they would lose their mind over this. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy boyfriend and I have often talked about what we would do if I got pregnant. He told me he would be there for me, get a full time job, an appartment. He always said it would be a blessing to have kids with me. I have told him about how my parents would react but he wouldn't understand. He thought they would be mad at me but would eventually let it go, but I know my parents and they would definetly not react this way. If my boyfriend found out I was pregnant he would'nt have let me get an abortion. I know he would have been thrilled to be a father.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo when I found out I was pregnant I knew what I had to do, but I was terrified, angry and disgusted at myself for doing this to my baby. I was nine weeks pregnant when I had a medical abortion at the hospital all by myself. \n\nI keep thinking about what would have happened if I was born into a different, more tolerant family. It's been five weeks since the abortion and I feel extremely disgusted with myself for doing this behind my boyfriend's back. It was his baby too and I really wish we could have kept it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\ntl;dr : I got pregnant and got an abortion to avoid being a victim of honour killing. I hid the pregnancy and abortion from my boyfriend because he would have wanted me to keep it, and doesn't believe what my parents are capable of in order to save their \"honour\". AITA ?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for having an abortion without telling her boyfriend. The situation is complex because of the cultural context and the risks involved.\n\nFirst, the woman had an unintended pregnancy. She didn't use Plan B because of her medical condition (PCOS) and was worried more about STDs. She found out she was pregnant and was conflicted but decided to have an abortion. The key reason here is the fear of an honor killing by her conservative family, which she explains is very real\u2014her cousin was beaten, and she might be killed or sent to her home country, leading to her death. Her parents are completely unaware of her dating and would react extremely if they found out.\n\nHer boyfriend wanted to keep the baby and support her, but she knew he wouldn't understand the severity of her parents' reaction. She felt that involving him would lead to him trying to keep the baby, which would put both of them in danger. She had the abortion alone to prevent that.\n\nThe question is about whether she's in the wrong. Legally, it's about the right to make reproductive choices. The woman is the one carrying the pregnancy and making the decision, which is a personal and medical choice. However, she didn't inform her boyfriend, which could be seen as a breach of trust. But considering the context of her potential death or severe harm if he found out, her decision was to protect both herself and her partner.\n\nMoral perspectives vary. Some might argue that she should have shared the decision with her partner, but given the life-threatening consequences, her choice to act alone could be viewed as necessary self-preservation. The boyfriend's desire to keep the baby doesn't override the immediate danger posed by her family. The situation is a matter of life and death versus the emotional betrayal of keeping it secret.\n\nIn many ethical frameworks, the principle of autonomy is important, especially when a person's life is at risk. The woman's decision, though painful and made in secrecy, was to protect her life. Therefore, while the secrecy might cause guilt or conflict later, in the context of her circumstances, she is not in the wrong.\n"
