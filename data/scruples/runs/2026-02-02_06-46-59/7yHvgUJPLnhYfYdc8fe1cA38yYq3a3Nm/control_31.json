I didn't think of using plan B as I have PCOS and was told it would be hard for me to have children without treatment, so at that point I was mostly worried about STDs. One month later I bought a pregnancy test as my period was late and it came back positive right away. I can't describe how I felt at that moment, I was euphoric because I realized I could have children but also terrified because I knew I wouldn't be able to keep my baby although I wanted it more than anything in the world.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI come from a very very conservative family, honour killings are frequent where my parents are from. I'm not allowed to date, let alone have sex before marriage, so them knowing about the pregnancy would be a death sentence for me. My cousin was severly beaten up by her father and brothers for hanging out with a boy after school. If they found out, they would take me to their home country and kill me there, and no one would know about it. They would also find a way to hurt my boyfriend. My parents trust me entirely and think I'm a virgin, they would lose their mind over this. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy boyfriend and I have often talked about what we would do if I got pregnant. He told me he would be there for me, get a full time job, an appartment. He always said it would be a blessing to have kids with me. I have told him about how my parents would react but he wouldn't understand. He thought they would be mad at me but would eventually let it go, but I know my parents and they would definetly not react this way. If my boyfriend found out I was pregnant he would'nt have let me get an abortion. I know he would have been thrilled to be a father.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo when I found out I was pregnant I knew what I had to do, but I was terrified, angry and disgusted at myself for doing this to my baby. I was nine weeks pregnant when I had a medical abortion at the hospital all by myself. \n\nI keep thinking about what would have happened if I was born into a different, more tolerant family. It's been five weeks since the abortion and I feel extremely disgusted with myself for doing this behind my boyfriend's back. It was his baby too and I really wish we could have kept it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\ntl;dr : I got pregnant and got an abortion to avoid being a victim of honour killing. I hid the pregnancy and abortion from my boyfriend because he would have wanted me to keep it, and doesn't believe what my parents are capable of in order to save their \"honour\". AITA ?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let me try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is pretty complex. She had an abortion without telling her boyfriend because of her conservative family's potential violent reaction, which includes honor killings. Her boyfriend wanted to keep the baby, but she thought he didn't understand the danger. She also has PCOS, making pregnancy difficult, so she might not have another chance.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. She's in a life-threatening situation where her family might kill her if they found out about the pregnancy. Honor killings are real and severe in some cultures, so her fear isn't baseless. She's protecting herself by keeping the pregnancy secret. \n\nBut ethically, she made a decision that affects both her and her boyfriend. He wanted to be a father and support her, so she didn't include him in the decision. That's a big deal. However, her reasoning was that he wouldn't understand the risk. Is that a valid reason to exclude him?\n\nOn one hand, she's risking her life to avoid her family's violence. On the other, she's withholding information from her partner, which could damage trust. But given the circumstances, her primary concern was survival. Maybe that justifies her actions. \n\nAlso, the medical abortion at nine weeks was legal? The question doesn't specify location, but if it's legal where she is, then she's within her rights. But even if it's legal, the ethical part is about the secrecy. \n\nHer boyfriend might feel betrayed, but she believed that telling him would lead to conflict and possibly expose her family. It's a tragic choice between two bad options. \n\nSo, considering all factors\u2014her safety versus her partner's right to know\u2014it's a tough call. But since her life is in danger, her decision might be seen as self-preservation. Therefore, she might not be in the wrong. Answer B.\n"
