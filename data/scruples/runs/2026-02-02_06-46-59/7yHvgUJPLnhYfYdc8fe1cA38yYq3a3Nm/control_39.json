I didn't think of using plan B as I have PCOS and was told it would be hard for me to have children without treatment, so at that point I was mostly worried about STDs. One month later I bought a pregnancy test as my period was late and it came back positive right away. I can't describe how I felt at that moment, I was euphoric because I realized I could have children but also terrified because I knew I wouldn't be able to keep my baby although I wanted it more than anything in the world.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI come from a very very conservative family, honour killings are frequent where my parents are from. I'm not allowed to date, let alone have sex before marriage, so them knowing about the pregnancy would be a death sentence for me. My cousin was severly beaten up by her father and brothers for hanging out with a boy after school. If they found out, they would take me to their home country and kill me there, and no one would know about it. They would also find a way to hurt my boyfriend. My parents trust me entirely and think I'm a virgin, they would lose their mind over this. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy boyfriend and I have often talked about what we would do if I got pregnant. He told me he would be there for me, get a full time job, an appartment. He always said it would be a blessing to have kids with me. I have told him about how my parents would react but he wouldn't understand. He thought they would be mad at me but would eventually let it go, but I know my parents and they would definetly not react this way. If my boyfriend found out I was pregnant he would'nt have let me get an abortion. I know he would have been thrilled to be a father.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo when I found out I was pregnant I knew what I had to do, but I was terrified, angry and disgusted at myself for doing this to my baby. I was nine weeks pregnant when I had a medical abortion at the hospital all by myself. \n\nI keep thinking about what would have happened if I was born into a different, more tolerant family. It's been five weeks since the abortion and I feel extremely disgusted with myself for doing this behind my boyfriend's back. It was his baby too and I really wish we could have kept it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\ntl;dr : I got pregnant and got an abortion to avoid being a victim of honour killing. I hid the pregnancy and abortion from my boyfriend because he would have wanted me to keep it, and doesn't believe what my parents are capable of in order to save their \"honour\". AITA ?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The question is whether the person who wrote this is in the wrong for having an abortion without her boyfriend's knowledge. The situation is pretty complex.\n\nFirst, she had an accidental pregnancy due to a broken condom. She had PCOS, which makes getting pregnant harder, so she was both overjoyed and scared. But her family is very conservative, from a place where honor killings happen. If her parents found out, she could be killed, and her boyfriend as well. She's been told her cousin was beaten for dating someone. Her parents think she's a virgin, so they'd be furious. She and her boyfriend had discussed what they'd do if she got pregnant\u2014he wanted to be a dad, but didn't think her parents would be that bad. She knew if he found out, he wouldn't let her get an abortion. So she did it secretly.\n\nNow, the user is asking if she's in the wrong. The answer options are A (yes) or B (no). \n\nI need to consider the context. Legally, in the US (assuming the setting is there), abortion is legal up to certain points. She was nine weeks along, so that's within the legal window. But the moral aspect is more complicated. She did it to save her life, as her family's reaction could be lethal. Her boyfriend would have wanted to keep the baby, so she went against his wishes. However, the situation is life-threatening for her if she went public. \n\nFrom a human rights perspective, her decision might be seen as self-preservation. She's risking her life by not telling her boyfriend because he might not take her seriously about the family's reaction. The boyfriend's desire to be a parent is valid, but her safety is paramount. \n\nBut some might argue she should have told him, even if he didn't believe her. However, given her past experiences (cousin's beating), she has reason to distrust her boyfriend's understanding. She might not have felt she could rely on him to prioritize her safety over his desire to be a father. \n\nSo, considering all factors, her decision was made in a desperate situation to protect herself from immediate danger. The boyfriend's right to know is there, but her right to life and safety is more critical. Therefore, she's not in the wrong.\n"
