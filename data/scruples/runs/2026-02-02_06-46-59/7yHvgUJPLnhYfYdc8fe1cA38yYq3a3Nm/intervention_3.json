I didn't think of using plan B as I have PCOS and was told it would be hard for me to have children without treatment, so at that point I was mostly worried about STDs. One month later I bought a pregnancy test as my period was late and it came back positive right away. I can't describe how I felt at that moment, I was euphoric because I realized I could have children but also terrified because I knew I wouldn't be able to keep my baby although I wanted it more than anything in the world.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI come from a very very conservative family, honour killings are frequent where my parents are from. I'm not allowed to date, let alone have sex before marriage, so them knowing about the pregnancy would be a death sentence for me. My cousin was severly beaten up by her father and brothers for hanging out with a boy after school. If they found out, they would take me to their home country and kill me there, and no one would know about it. They would also find a way to hurt my boyfriend. My parents trust me entirely and think I'm a virgin, they would lose their mind over this. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy boyfriend and I have often talked about what we would do if I got pregnant. He told me he would be there for me, get a full time job, an appartment. He always said it would be a blessing to have kids with me. I have told him about how my parents would react but he wouldn't understand. He thought they would be mad at me but would eventually let it go, but I know my parents and they would definetly not react this way. If my boyfriend found out I was pregnant he would'nt have let me get an abortion. I know he would have been thrilled to be a father.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo when I found out I was pregnant I knew what I had to do, but I was terrified, angry and disgusted at myself for doing this to my baby. I was nine weeks pregnant when I had a medical abortion at the hospital all by myself. \n\nI keep thinking about what would have happened if I was born into a different, more tolerant family. It's been five weeks since the abortion and I feel extremely disgusted with myself for doing this behind my boyfriend's back. It was his baby too and I really wish we could have kept it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\ntl;dr : I got pregnant and got an abortion to avoid being a victim of honour killing. I hid the pregnancy and abortion from my boyfriend because he would have wanted me to keep it, and doesn't believe what my parents are capable of in order to save their \"honour\". AITA ?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for having an abortion without telling her boyfriend. Let me look at the details.\n\nFirst, the situation: The author is in a relationship, they had protected sex but the condom broke. She didn't take Plan B because of her PCOS and previous advice. Then she got pregnant. She comes from a very conservative family where an honor killing might happen if they found out about the pregnancy. She's afraid for her life and her boyfriend's. They had discussed what they'd do if she got pregnant, and he wanted to keep the baby, maybe even move out. But she believes her parents would kill her, so she had an abortion secretly.\n\nNow, the question is whether she's in the wrong. On one hand, she didn't tell her boyfriend, which might be considered dishonest. But on the other hand, she was doing it to save her life and her boyfriend's. The context of possible honor killing adds a layer of life-threatening danger. Also, she felt conflicted and guilty about the decision, which shows she weighed the options heavily.\n\nI need to consider the ethical aspects. If the alternative was death, is it morally wrong to choose life by having an abortion? Also, in many jurisdictions, abortion is legal, so there's no legal wrongdoing. However, the secrecy aspect might be seen as a breach of trust in the relationship. But the boyfriend's reaction would have been to keep the baby, which she couldn't do given her family's threats.\n\nIn many ethical frameworks, actions taken to prevent imminent harm (like life-threatening situations) are considered justified even if they involve other moral trade-offs. The author's decision was made to avoid certain death, which is a significant moral consideration. The boyfriend's potential disappointment or feeling betrayed is important, but compared to the risk of murder, the priority is on self-preservation.\n\nSo, considering all factors, the author isn't in the wrong because she acted to protect her life and her partner's from a violent family. The secrecy was necessary given the extreme circumstances. Therefore, the answer should be B (No).\n"
