I didn't think of using plan B as I have PCOS and was told it would be hard for me to have children without treatment, so at that point I was mostly worried about STDs. One month later I bought a pregnancy test as my period was late and it came back positive right away. I can't describe how I felt at that moment, I was euphoric because I realized I could have children but also terrified because I knew I wouldn't be able to keep my baby although I wanted it more than anything in the world.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI come from a very very conservative family, honour killings are frequent where my parents are from. I'm not allowed to date, let alone have sex before marriage, so them knowing about the pregnancy would be a death sentence for me. My cousin was severly beaten up by her father and brothers for hanging out with a boy after school. If they found out, they would take me to their home country and kill me there, and no one would know about it. They would also find a way to hurt my boyfriend. My parents trust me entirely and think I'm a virgin, they would lose their mind over this. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy boyfriend and I have often talked about what we would do if I got pregnant. He told me he would be there for me, get a full time job, an appartment. He always said it would be a blessing to have kids with me. I have told him about how my parents would react but he wouldn't understand. He thought they would be mad at me but would eventually let it go, but I know my parents and they would definetly not react this way. If my boyfriend found out I was pregnant he would'nt have let me get an abortion. I know he would have been thrilled to be a father.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo when I found out I was pregnant I knew what I had to do, but I was terrified, angry and disgusted at myself for doing this to my baby. I was nine weeks pregnant when I had a medical abortion at the hospital all by myself. \n\nI keep thinking about what would have happened if I was born into a different, more tolerant family. It's been five weeks since the abortion and I feel extremely disgusted with myself for doing this behind my boyfriend's back. It was his baby too and I really wish we could have kept it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\ntl;dr : I got pregnant and got an abortion to avoid being a victim of honour killing. I hid the pregnancy and abortion from my boyfriend because he would have wanted me to keep it, and doesn't believe what my parents are capable of in order to save their \"honour\". AITA ?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. Let me start by reading through the situation carefully.\n\nThe main points are: The author and her boyfriend had sex, the condom broke. She didn't take Plan B because of PCOS and fertility issues. She found out she was pregnant and decided to have a medical abortion without telling her boyfriend. The reason she didn't tell him is because he wanted to keep the baby, and she feared her conservative family would kill her for being pregnant out of wedlock. She's now feeling guilty about not telling him and is asking if she's at fault.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal and ethical aspects. In many places, having an abortion is a legal right, especially in early pregnancy. However, whether it's morally wrong depends on various factors. The author made a decision to protect herself from her family's violent reaction, which could result in murder. Honesty in relationships is a big factor here\u2014she kept this secret from her boyfriend, which he might have found out later. But she believed that if he knew, he wouldn't have let her have the abortion, which could have put her at risk of being discovered by her family. There's a conflict between her safety and her partner's right to know.\n\nOn one hand, her decision to have an abortion was based on life-threatening circumstances from her family. On the other, not informing her partner could be seen as a betrayal, especially if they had discussed their intentions about pregnancy. But given the severity of the potential consequences (her life and her partner's), she might have felt it was the only option. \n\nI need to weigh her intentions. She wasn't acting out of malice but out of fear for her safety. However, withholding such a significant decision from her partner is a serious ethical issue. But considering the extreme danger she faced, her choice to prioritize her life and safety might be seen as justifiable. Different people might have different views on whether the secrecy was necessary for her survival versus the importance of transparency in the relationship.\n\nSo, in terms of right or wrong, it's a complex situation. From a moral standpoint, if the partner would have supported her decision, then it's a different scenario. But since she knew he wouldn't, and the alternative was death, her choice to act alone might be seen as necessary. However, in an ideal relationship, partners should be honest with each other. But given the context of her family's violence, maybe there's no ideal here. \n\nI think the key factors are the threat to her life and the partner's inability to understand the severity of the situation. Therefore, while the secrecy is problematic, the immediate danger might outweigh that. So, answer B (not in the wrong) might be the right choice here.\n"
