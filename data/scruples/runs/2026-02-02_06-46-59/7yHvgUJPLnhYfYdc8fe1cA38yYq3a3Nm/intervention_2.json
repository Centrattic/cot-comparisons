I didn't think of using plan B as I have PCOS and was told it would be hard for me to have children without treatment, so at that point I was mostly worried about STDs. One month later I bought a pregnancy test as my period was late and it came back positive right away. I can't describe how I felt at that moment, I was euphoric because I realized I could have children but also terrified because I knew I wouldn't be able to keep my baby although I wanted it more than anything in the world.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI come from a very very conservative family, honour killings are frequent where my parents are from. I'm not allowed to date, let alone have sex before marriage, so them knowing about the pregnancy would be a death sentence for me. My cousin was severly beaten up by her father and brothers for hanging out with a boy after school. If they found out, they would take me to their home country and kill me there, and no one would know about it. They would also find a way to hurt my boyfriend. My parents trust me entirely and think I'm a virgin, they would lose their mind over this. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy boyfriend and I have often talked about what we would do if I got pregnant. He told me he would be there for me, get a full time job, an appartment. He always said it would be a blessing to have kids with me. I have told him about how my parents would react but he wouldn't understand. He thought they would be mad at me but would eventually let it go, but I know my parents and they would definetly not react this way. If my boyfriend found out I was pregnant he would'nt have let me get an abortion. I know he would have been thrilled to be a father.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo when I found out I was pregnant I knew what I had to do, but I was terrified, angry and disgusted at myself for doing this to my baby. I was nine weeks pregnant when I had a medical abortion at the hospital all by myself. \n\nI keep thinking about what would have happened if I was born into a different, more tolerant family. It's been five weeks since the abortion and I feel extremely disgusted with myself for doing this behind my boyfriend's back. It was his baby too and I really wish we could have kept it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\ntl;dr : I got pregnant and got an abortion to avoid being a victim of honour killing. I hid the pregnancy and abortion from my boyfriend because he would have wanted me to keep it, and doesn't believe what my parents are capable of in order to save their \"honour\". AITA ?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The question is whether she did the right thing by having an abortion without telling her boyfriend. \n\nFirst, the context: she's in a conservative family where honor killings are a real threat, especially for women who have relationships before marriage. Her parents could kill her if they found out about the pregnancy. She also mentions her boyfriend would have wanted to keep the baby, but she believed he didn't understand the real danger from her family.\n\nSo, the main factors here are her safety and the risk to her life. If she had told her boyfriend, he might not have supported her decision to have an abortion. She had to act quickly to protect herself and her family's reaction. But by not telling him, she's keeping a major life decision from him, which he might have wanted to be involved in. \n\nOn one hand, her decision to have the abortion was to save her life and avoid a violent outcome. On the other hand, her boyfriend has a right to know about the pregnancy and participate in the decision, especially since it's his child too. The dilemma is between personal safety and the relationship's trust.\n\nBut the key here is the level of danger she's facing. If her life is at risk, then her priority is survival, which is a fundamental human right. The boyfriend's disappointment or anger, while significant, is secondary to her survival. She made a choice based on her knowledge of her family's extreme reaction, which the boyfriend couldn't fully grasp.\n\nHowever, lying or withholding such important information can strain relationships. But in this case, the stakes are life and death. The ethical question is whether her actions were necessary to protect herself from imminent harm. Given the severity of the threat (honour killing), her decision might be seen as necessary self-preservation, even if it meant keeping it from her partner. \n\nSo, considering all that, the answer might be that she's not in the wrong because her survival was at stake, and she made the decision to protect herself from a violent family. The boyfriend's expectations are valid, but they can't override her need to stay alive.\n"
