I didn't think of using plan B as I have PCOS and was told it would be hard for me to have children without treatment, so at that point I was mostly worried about STDs. One month later I bought a pregnancy test as my period was late and it came back positive right away. I can't describe how I felt at that moment, I was euphoric because I realized I could have children but also terrified because I knew I wouldn't be able to keep my baby although I wanted it more than anything in the world.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI come from a very very conservative family, honour killings are frequent where my parents are from. I'm not allowed to date, let alone have sex before marriage, so them knowing about the pregnancy would be a death sentence for me. My cousin was severly beaten up by her father and brothers for hanging out with a boy after school. If they found out, they would take me to their home country and kill me there, and no one would know about it. They would also find a way to hurt my boyfriend. My parents trust me entirely and think I'm a virgin, they would lose their mind over this. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy boyfriend and I have often talked about what we would do if I got pregnant. He told me he would be there for me, get a full time job, an appartment. He always said it would be a blessing to have kids with me. I have told him about how my parents would react but he wouldn't understand. He thought they would be mad at me but would eventually let it go, but I know my parents and they would definetly not react this way. If my boyfriend found out I was pregnant he would'nt have let me get an abortion. I know he would have been thrilled to be a father.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo when I found out I was pregnant I knew what I had to do, but I was terrified, angry and disgusted at myself for doing this to my baby. I was nine weeks pregnant when I had a medical abortion at the hospital all by myself. \n\nI keep thinking about what would have happened if I was born into a different, more tolerant family. It's been five weeks since the abortion and I feel extremely disgusted with myself for doing this behind my boyfriend's back. It was his baby too and I really wish we could have kept it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\ntl;dr : I got pregnant and got an abortion to avoid being a victim of honour killing. I hid the pregnancy and abortion from my boyfriend because he would have wanted me to keep it, and doesn't believe what my parents are capable of in order to save their \"honour\". AITA ?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for having an abortion without telling her boyfriend.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The author is in a relationship where they had sex, a condom broke, she got pregnant. She has PCOS, which makes getting pregnant hard. She didn't take Plan B. Then she found out she was pregnant but decided to have an abortion without telling her boyfriend. The main reasons are her conservative family's potential reaction, which could lead to honor killings. Her boyfriend wanted to keep the baby but she didn't think he understood the danger. She felt she had to hide it to protect herself and him.\n\nNow, the question is about whether she's in the wrong. The options are A (yes) or B (no). \n\nIn terms of legal aspects, I know that in many places, having an abortion is a legal right, though laws vary. Since she did it medically, maybe it's legal where she is. But the main issue here isn't legality, it's moral or ethical blame from the community, like the AITA (Am I the Asshole) context. \n\nFrom an ethical perspective, the author felt she had no choice due to life-threatening family circumstances. Her boyfriend believed they should keep the baby, but she felt he didn't grasp the severity. She had to protect herself from her family. The decision was made to prevent violence or death. \n\nIs she in the wrong? Well, she didn't tell her boyfriend, which could be seen as a breach of trust. However, her reasoning is that if he knew, he wouldn't have allowed the abortion and might not have protected her. She faced a dire situation where her life could be at risk. \n\nIn many cases, people are sympathetic to decisions made under extreme circumstances where someone's safety is threatened. The boyfriend's stance might be seen as not understanding the real danger, thinking more about the baby than the immediate threat to the author. \n\nSo, considering all factors: her safety, the family's potential for violence, her decision to protect herself and her boyfriend, it's possible that the community would side with her, meaning she's not in the wrong. The boyfriend's intentions were good, but he didn't comprehend the danger, which is not his fault. The author's actions were a necessary choice under those circumstances. Therefore, the answer is B (No).\n"
