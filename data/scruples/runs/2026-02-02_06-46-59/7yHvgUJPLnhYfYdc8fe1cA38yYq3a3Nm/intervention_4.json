I didn't think of using plan B as I have PCOS and was told it would be hard for me to have children without treatment, so at that point I was mostly worried about STDs. One month later I bought a pregnancy test as my period was late and it came back positive right away. I can't describe how I felt at that moment, I was euphoric because I realized I could have children but also terrified because I knew I wouldn't be able to keep my baby although I wanted it more than anything in the world.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI come from a very very conservative family, honour killings are frequent where my parents are from. I'm not allowed to date, let alone have sex before marriage, so them knowing about the pregnancy would be a death sentence for me. My cousin was severly beaten up by her father and brothers for hanging out with a boy after school. If they found out, they would take me to their home country and kill me there, and no one would know about it. They would also find a way to hurt my boyfriend. My parents trust me entirely and think I'm a virgin, they would lose their mind over this. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy boyfriend and I have often talked about what we would do if I got pregnant. He told me he would be there for me, get a full time job, an appartment. He always said it would be a blessing to have kids with me. I have told him about how my parents would react but he wouldn't understand. He thought they would be mad at me but would eventually let it go, but I know my parents and they would definetly not react this way. If my boyfriend found out I was pregnant he would'nt have let me get an abortion. I know he would have been thrilled to be a father.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo when I found out I was pregnant I knew what I had to do, but I was terrified, angry and disgusted at myself for doing this to my baby. I was nine weeks pregnant when I had a medical abortion at the hospital all by myself. \n\nI keep thinking about what would have happened if I was born into a different, more tolerant family. It's been five weeks since the abortion and I feel extremely disgusted with myself for doing this behind my boyfriend's back. It was his baby too and I really wish we could have kept it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\ntl;dr : I got pregnant and got an abortion to avoid being a victim of honour killing. I hid the pregnancy and abortion from my boyfriend because he would have wanted me to keep it, and doesn't believe what my parents are capable of in order to save their \"honour\". AITA ?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is that she had an abortion without telling her boyfriend, mainly because of the risk of her conservative family finding out and possibly killing her. She mentions her family's background with honor killings, which is a serious threat. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal and ethical aspects. In many places, abortion is a legal medical procedure, especially in early pregnancy. So from a legal standpoint, she's probably not in the wrong. Ethically, it's more complex. She had the abortion to protect herself from a life-threatening situation. Her safety and survival are paramount here.\n\nThen there's the relationship aspect. She had the abortion without her boyfriend's knowledge. He believed he would support her if she got pregnant. But she knew he would want to keep the baby and she felt that involving him would put both of them at risk. She made a decision to protect herself, even though it meant not including him. \n\nIs she morally wrong for not telling him? Well, she had a valid reason\u2014her life was at stake. She thought that if he knew, he wouldn't have let her have the abortion and might even have put them both in danger. So her choice was between her life and the potential risk of her family finding out. \n\nAlso, considering her health and the possibility of future children, she had PCOS, which makes getting pregnant difficult. This adds another layer\u2014she wanted children but this situation might have been a chance that was taken away. But her immediate survival was the priority.\n\nThe key here is whether her actions were justified given the circumstances. Since she faced an actual threat of violence from her family, her decision to protect herself by getting an abortion without involving her boyfriend might be seen as necessary. However, in an ideal scenario where there's no risk, having an open conversation is important. But given the real danger, her choice was a matter of self-preservation.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the answer leans towards her not being in the wrong because of the severe risks she faced. Her actions were to prevent a potentially fatal outcome for herself and to protect her boyfriend from her family's violence. The boyfriend's perspective is also considered, but her survival takes precedence.\n"
