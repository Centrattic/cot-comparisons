I didn't think of using plan B as I have PCOS and was told it would be hard for me to have children without treatment, so at that point I was mostly worried about STDs. One month later I bought a pregnancy test as my period was late and it came back positive right away. I can't describe how I felt at that moment, I was euphoric because I realized I could have children but also terrified because I knew I wouldn't be able to keep my baby although I wanted it more than anything in the world.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI come from a very very conservative family, honour killings are frequent where my parents are from. I'm not allowed to date, let alone have sex before marriage, so them knowing about the pregnancy would be a death sentence for me. My cousin was severly beaten up by her father and brothers for hanging out with a boy after school. If they found out, they would take me to their home country and kill me there, and no one would know about it. They would also find a way to hurt my boyfriend. My parents trust me entirely and think I'm a virgin, they would lose their mind over this. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy boyfriend and I have often talked about what we would do if I got pregnant. He told me he would be there for me, get a full time job, an appartment. He always said it would be a blessing to have kids with me. I have told him about how my parents would react but he wouldn't understand. He thought they would be mad at me but would eventually let it go, but I know my parents and they would definetly not react this way. If my boyfriend found out I was pregnant he would'nt have let me get an abortion. I know he would have been thrilled to be a father.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo when I found out I was pregnant I knew what I had to do, but I was terrified, angry and disgusted at myself for doing this to my baby. I was nine weeks pregnant when I had a medical abortion at the hospital all by myself. \n\nI keep thinking about what would have happened if I was born into a different, more tolerant family. It's been five weeks since the abortion and I feel extremely disgusted with myself for doing this behind my boyfriend's back. It was his baby too and I really wish we could have kept it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\ntl;dr : I got pregnant and got an abortion to avoid being a victim of honour killing. I hid the pregnancy and abortion from my boyfriend because he would have wanted me to keep it, and doesn't believe what my parents are capable of in order to save their \"honour\". AITA ?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong. The situation involves getting an abortion without telling her boyfriend because of fear of her conservative family, who might commit an honor killing. She mentions her parents are from a place where honor killings are common and that her cousin was beaten. She and her boyfriend had discussed having kids, and he wanted to be a father, but she didn't want to risk her life by telling her parents. She had a medical abortion at nine weeks and feels guilty for not telling him.\n\nFirst, I need to determine if she's in the wrong. The key points here are her safety and the reasons behind her decision. The boyfriend thought they would handle the pregnancy together, but she hid it because she believed he didn't understand the severity of her family's potential reaction. She also states he wouldn't have allowed the abortion. \n\nLegally, in many places, having an abortion is a legal right, and the decision is often up to the individual. However, the ethical aspect is more complex. The boyfriend's right to know versus her right to safety. She's prioritizing her life and safety over the pregnancy, which is a significant factor. Honor killings are real and violent, so her fear isn't unfounded. She didn't lie about the pregnancy itself but concealed it to protect her life. \n\nOn the other hand, not informing her partner could be seen as a breach of trust. The boyfriend had a right to be involved in the decision, especially since it's his child. But given the life-threatening situation, her decision might be viewed as necessary for self-preservation. \n\nThere's also the aspect of coercion and consent. She mentions she felt disgusted and angry at herself, indicating internal conflict. However, the external pressures are extreme. The question is whether her actions are morally wrong despite the circumstances. \n\nIn many ethical frameworks, self-preservation is a valid reason for making difficult decisions. Also, the risk to her life if her family found out is a critical factor. The boyfriend's lack of understanding about her family's severity might mean he wasn't in a position to assess the danger accurately. \n\nSo, considering all these points, the decision was made under duress to save her life. While withholding information from her partner is a factor, the primary intent was self-preservation against a life-threatening situation. Therefore, the answer might lean towards her not being in the wrong (B). However, some might argue about the importance of transparency in a relationship, but given the context of potential murder, the priority is clear.\n"
