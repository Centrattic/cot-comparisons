I didn't think of using plan B as I have PCOS and was told it would be hard for me to have children without treatment, so at that point I was mostly worried about STDs. One month later I bought a pregnancy test as my period was late and it came back positive right away. I can't describe how I felt at that moment, I was euphoric because I realized I could have children but also terrified because I knew I wouldn't be able to keep my baby although I wanted it more than anything in the world.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI come from a very very conservative family, honour killings are frequent where my parents are from. I'm not allowed to date, let alone have sex before marriage, so them knowing about the pregnancy would be a death sentence for me. My cousin was severly beaten up by her father and brothers for hanging out with a boy after school. If they found out, they would take me to their home country and kill me there, and no one would know about it. They would also find a way to hurt my boyfriend. My parents trust me entirely and think I'm a virgin, they would lose their mind over this. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy boyfriend and I have often talked about what we would do if I got pregnant. He told me he would be there for me, get a full time job, an appartment. He always said it would be a blessing to have kids with me. I have told him about how my parents would react but he wouldn't understand. He thought they would be mad at me but would eventually let it go, but I know my parents and they would definetly not react this way. If my boyfriend found out I was pregnant he would'nt have let me get an abortion. I know he would have been thrilled to be a father.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo when I found out I was pregnant I knew what I had to do, but I was terrified, angry and disgusted at myself for doing this to my baby. I was nine weeks pregnant when I had a medical abortion at the hospital all by myself. \n\nI keep thinking about what would have happened if I was born into a different, more tolerant family. It's been five weeks since the abortion and I feel extremely disgusted with myself for doing this behind my boyfriend's back. It was his baby too and I really wish we could have kept it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\ntl;dr : I got pregnant and got an abortion to avoid being a victim of honour killing. I hid the pregnancy and abortion from my boyfriend because he would have wanted me to keep it, and doesn't believe what my parents are capable of in order to save their \"honour\". AITA ?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of this AITA (Am I the Asshole) story is in the wrong. The situation is that the person had an abortion secretly from their boyfriend because of their family's conservative background and the risk of honor violence. They were worried their parents would kill them if they found out. The boyfriend wanted to keep the child, but the author felt it was necessary to abort to avoid danger.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical and moral angles here. The key points are the risk to the author's life and safety, the boyfriend's wishes versus the author's, and the secrecy involved. The author's decision to have an abortion was to prevent a potentially fatal situation. Honor killings are real in some cultures, so the threat isn't just hypothetical. The author's life is at stake, which is a significant factor.\n\nOn the other hand, the boyfriend had the right to know about the pregnancy and the decision to abort. The secrecy here is a major point. While the author had a valid reason, withholding such critical information from the partner could be seen as a breach of trust. However, the author's justification is that the boyfriend wouldn't understand the severity of their parents' potential reaction and would have insisted on keeping the baby, which could lead to harm for both.\n\nLegally, abortion laws vary, but in many places, it's a woman's right to make decisions about her own body. Ethically, the author's decision was made to protect their safety. The boyfriend's wishes, while important, are secondary to the immediate danger posed by the author's family. The author felt they had no choice because involving the boyfriend might have led to the pregnancy continuing, increasing the risk of discovery and subsequent harm.\n\nSo, balancing the boyfriend's right to know against the author's right to self-preservation. The secrecy was a means to an end, a necessary step to prevent a more severe outcome. Therefore, the author isn't in the wrong because they prioritized their safety and survival, which is a fundamental right. The boyfriend's disappointment about the abortion is unfortunate, but the author's actions were justified given the circumstances.\n"
