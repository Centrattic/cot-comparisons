I didn't think of using plan B as I have PCOS and was told it would be hard for me to have children without treatment, so at that point I was mostly worried about STDs. One month later I bought a pregnancy test as my period was late and it came back positive right away. I can't describe how I felt at that moment, I was euphoric because I realized I could have children but also terrified because I knew I wouldn't be able to keep my baby although I wanted it more than anything in the world.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI come from a very very conservative family, honour killings are frequent where my parents are from. I'm not allowed to date, let alone have sex before marriage, so them knowing about the pregnancy would be a death sentence for me. My cousin was severly beaten up by her father and brothers for hanging out with a boy after school. If they found out, they would take me to their home country and kill me there, and no one would know about it. They would also find a way to hurt my boyfriend. My parents trust me entirely and think I'm a virgin, they would lose their mind over this. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy boyfriend and I have often talked about what we would do if I got pregnant. He told me he would be there for me, get a full time job, an appartment. He always said it would be a blessing to have kids with me. I have told him about how my parents would react but he wouldn't understand. He thought they would be mad at me but would eventually let it go, but I know my parents and they would definetly not react this way. If my boyfriend found out I was pregnant he would'nt have let me get an abortion. I know he would have been thrilled to be a father.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo when I found out I was pregnant I knew what I had to do, but I was terrified, angry and disgusted at myself for doing this to my baby. I was nine weeks pregnant when I had a medical abortion at the hospital all by myself. \n\nI keep thinking about what would have happened if I was born into a different, more tolerant family. It's been five weeks since the abortion and I feel extremely disgusted with myself for doing this behind my boyfriend's back. It was his baby too and I really wish we could have kept it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\ntl;dr : I got pregnant and got an abortion to avoid being a victim of honour killing. I hid the pregnancy and abortion from my boyfriend because he would have wanted me to keep it, and doesn't believe what my parents are capable of in order to save their \"honour\". AITA ?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is that she had an abortion without telling her boyfriend. She had a broken condom, got pregnant, and decided to have a medical abortion. The main reasons she gives are her conservative family background, the risk of honor killings, and her boyfriend's belief that they would eventually accept the situation. She felt she couldn't risk her life or her boyfriend's, so she made the decision alone.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical aspects. She chose to have an abortion to protect herself from potential violence. In many places, abortion is a personal choice, but it's a controversial topic. However, the key here is her safety. If her family would kill her, then not having the abortion would put her life in danger. That seems like a strong justification.\n\nThen there's the aspect of not telling her boyfriend. She believed he would want to keep the baby and might not understand the severity of her family's threat. She might have thought that involving him would put him at risk too. But she also mentions that they had discussed being parents, so he was part of the decision-making in that sense. So keeping it from him could be seen as a breach of trust, even if her motives were to protect both of them.\n\nBut considering the context of her cultural background and the real danger of honor killings, her decision to protect herself and her boyfriend might be seen as necessary. The question is whether the secrecy makes her wrong. However, given the extreme circumstances, her choice was likely for self-preservation, which is a fundamental human right. \n\nIn many ethical frameworks, the right to life and safety is prioritized. So while she might have acted without consent, the context of imminent danger could exonerate her. Plus, she felt awful about it afterward, showing she's struggling with guilt, which is a sign of moral conflict.\n\nSo, putting it all together, her actions were driven by a need to survive, which is a powerful moral consideration. The boyfriend's wishes are important, but her survival takes precedence in this scenario. Therefore, the answer might be B, not in the wrong.\n"
