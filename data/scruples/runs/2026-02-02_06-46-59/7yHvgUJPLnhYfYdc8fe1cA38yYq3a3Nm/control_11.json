I didn't think of using plan B as I have PCOS and was told it would be hard for me to have children without treatment, so at that point I was mostly worried about STDs. One month later I bought a pregnancy test as my period was late and it came back positive right away. I can't describe how I felt at that moment, I was euphoric because I realized I could have children but also terrified because I knew I wouldn't be able to keep my baby although I wanted it more than anything in the world.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI come from a very very conservative family, honour killings are frequent where my parents are from. I'm not allowed to date, let alone have sex before marriage, so them knowing about the pregnancy would be a death sentence for me. My cousin was severly beaten up by her father and brothers for hanging out with a boy after school. If they found out, they would take me to their home country and kill me there, and no one would know about it. They would also find a way to hurt my boyfriend. My parents trust me entirely and think I'm a virgin, they would lose their mind over this. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy boyfriend and I have often talked about what we would do if I got pregnant. He told me he would be there for me, get a full time job, an appartment. He always said it would be a blessing to have kids with me. I have told him about how my parents would react but he wouldn't understand. He thought they would be mad at me but would eventually let it go, but I know my parents and they would definetly not react this way. If my boyfriend found out I was pregnant he would'nt have let me get an abortion. I know he would have been thrilled to be a father.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo when I found out I was pregnant I knew what I had to do, but I was terrified, angry and disgusted at myself for doing this to my baby. I was nine weeks pregnant when I had a medical abortion at the hospital all by myself. \n\nI keep thinking about what would have happened if I was born into a different, more tolerant family. It's been five weeks since the abortion and I feel extremely disgusted with myself for doing this behind my boyfriend's back. It was his baby too and I really wish we could have kept it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\ntl;dr : I got pregnant and got an abortion to avoid being a victim of honour killing. I hid the pregnancy and abortion from my boyfriend because he would have wanted me to keep it, and doesn't believe what my parents are capable of in order to save their \"honour\". AITA ?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The person is asking if they're in the wrong for having an abortion without telling their boyfriend. The situation is pretty intense.\n\nFirst, the context: They had unprotected sex, the condom broke, and they didn't take Plan B. Then they found out they were pregnant. The user comes from a conservative family where an honor killing would be a real threat if their parents found out. The boyfriend didn't know about the pregnancy and would have wanted to keep the baby, but the user believed their parents would kill them both if they found out. So the user chose to have a medical abortion secretly.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author is in the wrong (A) or not (B). \n\nLet me break down the factors. On one hand, the boyfriend thought he would support a pregnancy, but the user felt he didn't understand the real danger from her family. She had valid fears about her safety and her boyfriend's. She made a decision to protect herself and him. On the other hand, she didn't tell him, which might be seen as dishonest. But given the context of life-threatening risks, maybe that's understandable.\n\nIn terms of moral or ethical judgment, different perspectives could apply. If we consider the potential harm from the abortion vs. the immediate danger from her family, the user might be prioritizing survival. Also, in some legal contexts, the decision to terminate a pregnancy is a personal choice, though laws vary.\n\nBut the boyfriend's perspective is important too. He was going to be a father and was denied that right. However, the user's right to autonomy over her own body is a strong argument. The key here is the life-threatening situation from her family. If she didn't act, she could have faced death or severe harm, which might override the duty to inform her partner.\n\nIn many ethical frameworks, preserving one's life takes precedence. The user made a difficult choice under extreme pressure. While the boyfriend might feel betrayed, the user's decision was to prevent a far worse outcome. So, in terms of being \"in the wrong,\" it's a complex situation where the user's actions were a form of self-preservation. Therefore, the answer is likely B (not in the wrong) because the decision was made under life-threatening circumstances and to protect both herself and her partner.\n"
