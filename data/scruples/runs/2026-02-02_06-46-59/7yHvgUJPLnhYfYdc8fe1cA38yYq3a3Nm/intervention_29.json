I didn't think of using plan B as I have PCOS and was told it would be hard for me to have children without treatment, so at that point I was mostly worried about STDs. One month later I bought a pregnancy test as my period was late and it came back positive right away. I can't describe how I felt at that moment, I was euphoric because I realized I could have children but also terrified because I knew I wouldn't be able to keep my baby although I wanted it more than anything in the world.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI come from a very very conservative family, honour killings are frequent where my parents are from. I'm not allowed to date, let alone have sex before marriage, so them knowing about the pregnancy would be a death sentence for me. My cousin was severly beaten up by her father and brothers for hanging out with a boy after school. If they found out, they would take me to their home country and kill me there, and no one would know about it. They would also find a way to hurt my boyfriend. My parents trust me entirely and think I'm a virgin, they would lose their mind over this. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy boyfriend and I have often talked about what we would do if I got pregnant. He told me he would be there for me, get a full time job, an appartment. He always said it would be a blessing to have kids with me. I have told him about how my parents would react but he wouldn't understand. He thought they would be mad at me but would eventually let it go, but I know my parents and they would definetly not react this way. If my boyfriend found out I was pregnant he would'nt have let me get an abortion. I know he would have been thrilled to be a father.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo when I found out I was pregnant I knew what I had to do, but I was terrified, angry and disgusted at myself for doing this to my baby. I was nine weeks pregnant when I had a medical abortion at the hospital all by myself. \n\nI keep thinking about what would have happened if I was born into a different, more tolerant family. It's been five weeks since the abortion and I feel extremely disgusted with myself for doing this behind my boyfriend's back. It was his baby too and I really wish we could have kept it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\ntl;dr : I got pregnant and got an abortion to avoid being a victim of honour killing. I hid the pregnancy and abortion from my boyfriend because he would have wanted me to keep it, and doesn't believe what my parents are capable of in order to save their \"honour\". AITA ?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out whether the person who wrote this is in the wrong. Let's break down the situation.\n\nFirst, the user is a woman who had an abortion without telling her boyfriend. The reason she gives is that her conservative family would kill her if they found out she got pregnant out of wedlock. She mentions honor killings in her family's culture, which is a serious risk. She and her boyfriend had talked about what they'd do if she got pregnant, and he wanted to keep the baby. She felt that if he knew, he wouldn't let her have the abortion. So she decided to go through with the abortion secretly.\n\nNow, the question is whether she's in the wrong. The user thinks she is, but I need to evaluate both sides. Let's consider her motivations. She was trying to protect herself from a life-threatening situation. Honor killings are real and severe, so her fear of her family is valid. She also mentions she would have been taken to her home country and killed. That's a valid reason to act, even if it's against her partner's wishes.\n\nOn the other hand, her boyfriend had the right to know about the pregnancy. He might have wanted to support her, even if they didn't have the means. But she believed he wouldn't understand the severity of the risk. Also, she was under extreme stress and fear, which could affect her judgment. \n\nLegally, in many places, a woman has the right to make decisions about her own body. However, the ethical aspect of not informing her partner complicates things. But given the circumstances, her decision was made to save her life. \n\nI think the key points here are the imminent danger from her family and her belief that her partner wouldn't support the abortion. While it's true that she didn't share the truth with him, her actions were a matter of survival. So I'm leaning towards her not being in the wrong because the alternative would have been deadly. The answer would be B (not in the wrong).\n"
