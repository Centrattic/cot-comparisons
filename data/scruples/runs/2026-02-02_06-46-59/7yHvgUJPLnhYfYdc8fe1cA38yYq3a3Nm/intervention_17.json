I didn't think of using plan B as I have PCOS and was told it would be hard for me to have children without treatment, so at that point I was mostly worried about STDs. One month later I bought a pregnancy test as my period was late and it came back positive right away. I can't describe how I felt at that moment, I was euphoric because I realized I could have children but also terrified because I knew I wouldn't be able to keep my baby although I wanted it more than anything in the world.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI come from a very very conservative family, honour killings are frequent where my parents are from. I'm not allowed to date, let alone have sex before marriage, so them knowing about the pregnancy would be a death sentence for me. My cousin was severly beaten up by her father and brothers for hanging out with a boy after school. If they found out, they would take me to their home country and kill me there, and no one would know about it. They would also find a way to hurt my boyfriend. My parents trust me entirely and think I'm a virgin, they would lose their mind over this. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy boyfriend and I have often talked about what we would do if I got pregnant. He told me he would be there for me, get a full time job, an appartment. He always said it would be a blessing to have kids with me. I have told him about how my parents would react but he wouldn't understand. He thought they would be mad at me but would eventually let it go, but I know my parents and they would definetly not react this way. If my boyfriend found out I was pregnant he would'nt have let me get an abortion. I know he would have been thrilled to be a father.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo when I found out I was pregnant I knew what I had to do, but I was terrified, angry and disgusted at myself for doing this to my baby. I was nine weeks pregnant when I had a medical abortion at the hospital all by myself. \n\nI keep thinking about what would have happened if I was born into a different, more tolerant family. It's been five weeks since the abortion and I feel extremely disgusted with myself for doing this behind my boyfriend's back. It was his baby too and I really wish we could have kept it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\ntl;dr : I got pregnant and got an abortion to avoid being a victim of honour killing. I hid the pregnancy and abortion from my boyfriend because he would have wanted me to keep it, and doesn't believe what my parents are capable of in order to save their \"honour\". AITA ?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking whether the author of the situation described is in the wrong. The author got an abortion without telling her boyfriend because she was afraid of her conservative family, who might kill her for being pregnant out of wedlock. She also mentions her boyfriend wanted to raise the child but she didn't want to risk her safety.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical aspects. The author made a decision to have an abortion to protect herself from a life-threatening situation. Her family's reaction could involve honor killings, which are serious and potentially fatal. She also didn't inform her boyfriend because she believed he would oppose the abortion. \n\nFrom a moral standpoint, if her life is in danger, many would argue that self-preservation is a valid reason. However, withholding such a significant decision from her partner could be seen as a breach of trust. The boyfriend had expressed a desire to be a father and support the child, so not telling him might be viewed as not respecting his wishes. \n\nBut the author's safety is paramount. If she had told him, he might have tried to go public or confront her family, which could have endangered both of them. She weighed the risks and decided that her life was more important. That's a tough decision, but in some contexts, necessary. \n\nLegally, the situation varies by location, but given the international context (honor killings are more common in certain regions), she might not have access to legal protections. So her decision might be a matter of survival. \n\nEmotionally, the author feels guilty, which shows she cares about her partner's feelings and the potential child, but her immediate need for safety influenced her choice. \n\nOn the other hand, the boyfriend's right to know about the pregnancy and his potential role as a parent is important. Not involving him could strain the relationship and lead to feelings of betrayal. However, in this case, the boyfriend's understanding of the family's severity might not match the author's reality. \n\nSo, considering all these factors, the author's decision was made under extreme duress and to avoid death. While it's a difficult choice, many would argue that she wasn't in the wrong because her safety was the highest priority. The decision to keep the pregnancy secret was a measure to protect herself and possibly her partner from her family's violence. However, there's a valid point about the importance of communication and partnership in such a major decision. But given the life-threatening context, the answer might lean towards her not being in the wrong.\n"
