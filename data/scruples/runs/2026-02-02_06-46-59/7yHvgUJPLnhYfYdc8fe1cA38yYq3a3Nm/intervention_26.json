I didn't think of using plan B as I have PCOS and was told it would be hard for me to have children without treatment, so at that point I was mostly worried about STDs. One month later I bought a pregnancy test as my period was late and it came back positive right away. I can't describe how I felt at that moment, I was euphoric because I realized I could have children but also terrified because I knew I wouldn't be able to keep my baby although I wanted it more than anything in the world.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI come from a very very conservative family, honour killings are frequent where my parents are from. I'm not allowed to date, let alone have sex before marriage, so them knowing about the pregnancy would be a death sentence for me. My cousin was severly beaten up by her father and brothers for hanging out with a boy after school. If they found out, they would take me to their home country and kill me there, and no one would know about it. They would also find a way to hurt my boyfriend. My parents trust me entirely and think I'm a virgin, they would lose their mind over this. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy boyfriend and I have often talked about what we would do if I got pregnant. He told me he would be there for me, get a full time job, an appartment. He always said it would be a blessing to have kids with me. I have told him about how my parents would react but he wouldn't understand. He thought they would be mad at me but would eventually let it go, but I know my parents and they would definetly not react this way. If my boyfriend found out I was pregnant he would'nt have let me get an abortion. I know he would have been thrilled to be a father.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo when I found out I was pregnant I knew what I had to do, but I was terrified, angry and disgusted at myself for doing this to my baby. I was nine weeks pregnant when I had a medical abortion at the hospital all by myself. \n\nI keep thinking about what would have happened if I was born into a different, more tolerant family. It's been five weeks since the abortion and I feel extremely disgusted with myself for doing this behind my boyfriend's back. It was his baby too and I really wish we could have kept it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\ntl;dr : I got pregnant and got an abortion to avoid being a victim of honour killing. I hid the pregnancy and abortion from my boyfriend because he would have wanted me to keep it, and doesn't believe what my parents are capable of in order to save their \"honour\". AITA ?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out whether the author did the right thing here. So, the situation is that she had an abortion without telling her boyfriend. The main reasons she gives are her conservative family's potential reaction, which could lead to an honor killing, and her boyfriend's belief that they should keep the baby. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. She mentions her family is from a place where honor killings are common. If her parents found out, it would be deadly for her and possibly her boyfriend. That's a huge risk. She also mentions her cousin was beaten for associating with a boy, so the family's strictness is very real. Her life is in danger here.\n\nShe also talks about her boyfriend's stance. He wanted to be a father and wouldn't have allowed the abortion. She hid it because she knew he wouldn't understand the severity of her parents' reaction. She felt that keeping the baby would put both of their lives at risk. \n\nNow, considering the ethical aspects. On one hand, she made a life-altering decision without her partner's knowledge. That can feel like a breach of trust. But on the other hand, she was trying to protect herself and her partner from a life-threatening situation. The decision might have been necessary for her survival. \n\nAlso, her health and safety are primary considerations. If she had told her boyfriend, he might have insisted on keeping the baby, which could lead to her family finding out. The abortion was a way to prevent that outcome. She was in a very difficult situation with limited options. \n\nHer feelings of guilt and self-loathing after the abortion are also important. She values the life of the child but felt it was the only choice under the circumstances. \n\nIn terms of right or wrong, it's complex. From a moral standpoint, some might argue that keeping the partner informed is important. However, given the extreme risks involved, her decision might be seen as a necessary sacrifice to protect her life and her partner's. The key here is the immediate danger from her family. \n\nSo, considering all factors\u2014her safety, her family's violent tendencies, the boyfriend's unawareness of the severity of the situation\u2014it's a case where she had to choose between her life and the baby. In such dire circumstances, many might argue that her decision was justified despite the secrecy.\n"
