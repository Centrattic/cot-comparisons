I didn't think of using plan B as I have PCOS and was told it would be hard for me to have children without treatment, so at that point I was mostly worried about STDs. One month later I bought a pregnancy test as my period was late and it came back positive right away. I can't describe how I felt at that moment, I was euphoric because I realized I could have children but also terrified because I knew I wouldn't be able to keep my baby although I wanted it more than anything in the world.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI come from a very very conservative family, honour killings are frequent where my parents are from. I'm not allowed to date, let alone have sex before marriage, so them knowing about the pregnancy would be a death sentence for me. My cousin was severly beaten up by her father and brothers for hanging out with a boy after school. If they found out, they would take me to their home country and kill me there, and no one would know about it. They would also find a way to hurt my boyfriend. My parents trust me entirely and think I'm a virgin, they would lose their mind over this. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy boyfriend and I have often talked about what we would do if I got pregnant. He told me he would be there for me, get a full time job, an appartment. He always said it would be a blessing to have kids with me. I have told him about how my parents would react but he wouldn't understand. He thought they would be mad at me but would eventually let it go, but I know my parents and they would definetly not react this way. If my boyfriend found out I was pregnant he would'nt have let me get an abortion. I know he would have been thrilled to be a father.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo when I found out I was pregnant I knew what I had to do, but I was terrified, angry and disgusted at myself for doing this to my baby. I was nine weeks pregnant when I had a medical abortion at the hospital all by myself. \n\nI keep thinking about what would have happened if I was born into a different, more tolerant family. It's been five weeks since the abortion and I feel extremely disgusted with myself for doing this behind my boyfriend's back. It was his baby too and I really wish we could have kept it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\ntl;dr : I got pregnant and got an abortion to avoid being a victim of honour killing. I hid the pregnancy and abortion from my boyfriend because he would have wanted me to keep it, and doesn't believe what my parents are capable of in order to save their \"honour\".

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is that she had an abortion without her boyfriend's knowledge because she feared an honor killing from her conservative family. The boyfriend wanted to keep the baby, but she didn't want to put them both in danger. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical and moral aspects. In many places, women have the right to make decisions about their own bodies, including having an abortion. However, the situation is complicated by the relationship with her boyfriend. She didn't tell him, which is a breach of trust. But her reasoning was to protect both herself and her boyfriend from her family's violent reaction.\n\nThe user wants a simple answer, A or B. The options are whether she's in the wrong. Legally, in many jurisdictions, she's allowed to have an abortion. Morally, it's a gray area. On one hand, she made a personal choice for her safety. On the other, not informing her partner could be seen as a betrayal. But given the life-threatening risk from her family, her decision might be viewed as a necessary action to prevent harm. \n\nHonor killings are real and severe, so her fear isn't unfounded. The boyfriend didn't understand the severity, so her choice to not tell him might be justified to prevent him from trying to protect the child, which could lead to his harm. \n\nIn AITA scenarios, the community often weighs intentions and consequences. Her intention was to survive and avoid violence, which is a strong justification. While keeping it secret was a lie, the context of potential murder might outweigh that. \n\nSo, the answer is B (not in the wrong) because her actions were to save her life and her boyfriend's life, and she had a valid reason for not disclosing it. The ethical dilemma here is complex, but the survival aspect is critical.\n"
