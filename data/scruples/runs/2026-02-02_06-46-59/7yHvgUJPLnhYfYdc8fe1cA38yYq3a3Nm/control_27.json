I didn't think of using plan B as I have PCOS and was told it would be hard for me to have children without treatment, so at that point I was mostly worried about STDs. One month later I bought a pregnancy test as my period was late and it came back positive right away. I can't describe how I felt at that moment, I was euphoric because I realized I could have children but also terrified because I knew I wouldn't be able to keep my baby although I wanted it more than anything in the world.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI come from a very very conservative family, honour killings are frequent where my parents are from. I'm not allowed to date, let alone have sex before marriage, so them knowing about the pregnancy would be a death sentence for me. My cousin was severly beaten up by her father and brothers for hanging out with a boy after school. If they found out, they would take me to their home country and kill me there, and no one would know about it. They would also find a way to hurt my boyfriend. My parents trust me entirely and think I'm a virgin, they would lose their mind over this. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy boyfriend and I have often talked about what we would do if I got pregnant. He told me he would be there for me, get a full time job, an appartment. He always said it would be a blessing to have kids with me. I have told him about how my parents would react but he wouldn't understand. He thought they would be mad at me but would eventually let it go, but I know my parents and they would definetly not react this way. If my boyfriend found out I was pregnant he would'nt have let me get an abortion. I know he would have been thrilled to be a father.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo when I found out I was pregnant I knew what I had to do, but I was terrified, angry and disgusted at myself for doing this to my baby. I was nine weeks pregnant when I had a medical abortion at the hospital all by myself. \n\nI keep thinking about what would have happened if I was born into a different, more tolerant family. It's been five weeks since the abortion and I feel extremely disgusted with myself for doing this behind my boyfriend's back. It was his baby too and I really wish we could have kept it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\ntl;dr : I got pregnant and got an abortion to avoid being a victim of honour killing. I hid the pregnancy and abortion from my boyfriend because he would have wanted me to keep it, and doesn't believe what my parents are capable of in order to save their \"honour\". AITA ?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about an abortion done secretly by the author to avoid an honor killing by her conservative family. Let me break down the key points.\n\nFirst, the author had an accidental pregnancy after a condom broke. She didn't use Plan B because of her medical condition, PCOS. She's worried about her conservative family, where honor killings happen. She mentions her cousin's experience, so she's really scared. Her boyfriend wanted to keep the baby, but she knew her parents would kill her if they found out. She decided to have a medical abortion without telling him because she believed he wouldn't understand the severity of the situation.\n\nSo the main issue is whether she was wrong to keep the abortion a secret from her boyfriend. On one hand, she made a decision based on her own safety and the severe consequences from her family. On the other hand, her boyfriend had a right to know about the pregnancy and the choice she made, especially since it's his child too. \n\nBut considering the context of her family's potential for violence, her decision might be seen as a necessary act to protect herself. However, withholding such important information from her partner could be seen as a breach of trust. But if she had told him, maybe he would have tried to confront her family, leading to danger for both. She believes he wouldn't have allowed the abortion, so she made the choice to save herself. \n\nThe question is about whether she's at fault. In terms of moral responsibility, it's complex. She had a right to make decisions about her own body, especially under life-threatening circumstances. However, the secrecy aspect complicates things. But given the severity of the threat from her family, her choice might be justified as self-preservation. The boyfriend's reaction could have been different, but she acted based on her knowledge of her parents' actions. \n\nIn many legal and ethical frameworks, a woman has the right to choose an abortion, even if it's done without her partner's knowledge, especially in cases where her life is at risk. So in this case, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong because her decision was made to protect herself from a much worse outcome. The boyfriend might feel betrayed, but her actions were driven by fear for her life. Therefore, the answer is probably B (she's not in the wrong).\n"
