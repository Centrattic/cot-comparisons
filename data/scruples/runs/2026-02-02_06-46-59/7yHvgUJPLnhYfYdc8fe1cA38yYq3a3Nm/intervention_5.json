I didn't think of using plan B as I have PCOS and was told it would be hard for me to have children without treatment, so at that point I was mostly worried about STDs. One month later I bought a pregnancy test as my period was late and it came back positive right away. I can't describe how I felt at that moment, I was euphoric because I realized I could have children but also terrified because I knew I wouldn't be able to keep my baby although I wanted it more than anything in the world.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI come from a very very conservative family, honour killings are frequent where my parents are from. I'm not allowed to date, let alone have sex before marriage, so them knowing about the pregnancy would be a death sentence for me. My cousin was severly beaten up by her father and brothers for hanging out with a boy after school. If they found out, they would take me to their home country and kill me there, and no one would know about it. They would also find a way to hurt my boyfriend. My parents trust me entirely and think I'm a virgin, they would lose their mind over this. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy boyfriend and I have often talked about what we would do if I got pregnant. He told me he would be there for me, get a full time job, an appartment. He always said it would be a blessing to have kids with me. I have told him about how my parents would react but he wouldn't understand. He thought they would be mad at me but would eventually let it go, but I know my parents and they would definetly not react this way. If my boyfriend found out I was pregnant he would'nt have let me get an abortion. I know he would have been thrilled to be a father.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo when I found out I was pregnant I knew what I had to do, but I was terrified, angry and disgusted at myself for doing this to my baby. I was nine weeks pregnant when I had a medical abortion at the hospital all by myself. \n\nI keep thinking about what would have happened if I was born into a different, more tolerant family. It's been five weeks since the abortion and I feel extremely disgusted with myself for doing this behind my boyfriend's back. It was his baby too and I really wish we could have kept it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\ntl;dr : I got pregnant and got an abortion to avoid being a victim of honour killing. I hid the pregnancy and abortion from my boyfriend because he would have wanted me to keep it, and doesn't believe what my parents are capable of in order to save their \"honour\". AITA ?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the person who got an abortion without telling her boyfriend is in the wrong. The situation is pretty complex. \n\nFirst, the woman got pregnant after a condom broke. She didn't take plan B because of her PCOS. She did a pregnancy test, which was positive. She was excited but scared because her conservative family might kill her for being pregnant before marriage, even possibly leading to an honor killing. Her boyfriend thought they would handle it together, but she didn't think he understood the severity of her family's reaction. She decided to have an abortion secretly because she believed her boyfriend would have wanted to keep the baby and wouldn't let her have the abortion. Now she's feeling guilty and is wondering if she was wrong to do it without his knowledge.\n\nSo, the key factors here are her safety and life. Honor killings are a real threat, so her decision might be a matter of self-preservation. However, the boyfriend was part of the situation, so not telling him could be seen as a betrayal. But considering the potential consequences of her family finding out, her choice to protect herself might be justified. \n\nOn the other hand, the boyfriend had the right to know, as it's his child too. But if revealing the pregnancy to him would lead him to oppose the abortion, then she might be forced into a situation where neither option is safe. The dilemma here is between immediate safety and honesty in the relationship.\n\nEthically, if her life is in danger, her priority is self-preservation, which could make her actions understandable. But from a relationship standpoint, keeping such a major decision from her partner could be seen as wrong. However, given the context of her family's threats, the decision might be necessary for survival. \n\nSo, balancing these factors, the answer might be B (Not in the wrong) because her safety is at stake, and the potential harm from her family is severe. The boyfriend's reaction is a valid concern, but her life takes precedence.\n"
