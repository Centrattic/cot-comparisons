I didn't think of using plan B as I have PCOS and was told it would be hard for me to have children without treatment, so at that point I was mostly worried about STDs. One month later I bought a pregnancy test as my period was late and it came back positive right away. I can't describe how I felt at that moment, I was euphoric because I realized I could have children but also terrified because I knew I wouldn't be able to keep my baby although I wanted it more than anything in the world.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI come from a very very conservative family, honour killings are frequent where my parents are from. I'm not allowed to date, let alone have sex before marriage, so them knowing about the pregnancy would be a death sentence for me. My cousin was severly beaten up by her father and brothers for hanging out with a boy after school. If they found out, they would take me to their home country and kill me there, and no one would know about it. They would also find a way to hurt my boyfriend. My parents trust me entirely and think I'm a virgin, they would lose their mind over this. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy boyfriend and I have often talked about what we would do if I got pregnant. He told me he would be there for me, get a full time job, an appartment. He always said it would be a blessing to have kids with me. I have told him about how my parents would react but he wouldn't understand. He thought they would be mad at me but would eventually let it go, but I know my parents and they would definetly not react this way. If my boyfriend found out I was pregnant he would'nt have let me get an abortion. I know he would have been thrilled to be a father.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo when I found out I was pregnant I knew what I had to do, but I was terrified, angry and disgusted at myself for doing this to my baby. I was nine weeks pregnant when I had a medical abortion at the hospital all by myself. \n\nI keep thinking about what would have happened if I was born into a different, more tolerant family. It's been five weeks since the abortion and I feel extremely disgusted with myself for doing this behind my boyfriend's back. It was his baby too and I really wish we could have kept it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\ntl;dr : I got pregnant and got an abortion to avoid being a victim of honour killing. I hid the pregnancy and abortion from my boyfriend because he would have wanted me to keep it, and doesn't believe what my parents are capable of in order to save their \"honour\". AITA ?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for having an abortion without telling her boyfriend. The situation is pretty intense. She had an accident with a broken condom, got pregnant, and decided to have a medical abortion at nine weeks. The main reasons she did it secretly are her conservative family's potential violent reaction, including honor killings, and her belief that her boyfriend wouldn't have supported an abortion.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical and moral aspects here. The author felt that her life was in danger if her family found out. Honor violence is a real and serious issue in some cultures. She's risking her safety and possibly her life if she doesn't hide the pregnancy. On the other hand, her boyfriend was supportive and wanted to be part of the child's life. She chose not to tell him, which could be seen as betraying his trust.\n\nFrom a legal standpoint, in many places, a woman has the right to make decisions about her own body, including terminating a pregnancy. However, the legal status of abortion varies by location, which isn't specified here. But since the question is about whether she's in the wrong morally, not legally, that's different.\n\nThe emotional aspect is significant. The author is struggling with guilt and feeling disgusted with herself for not informing her partner. She also feels regret about the abortion. Her boyfriend was willing to take responsibility, which adds complexity. But she believed her life was at stake if he knew, since he wouldn't support the abortion and might reveal her to her family, putting both of them in danger.\n\nThere's also the matter of autonomy. She made the decision to protect her life and safety, which is a fundamental right. However, withholding such a significant decision from her partner could be seen as a breach of trust. But given the context of potential fatal consequences for both her and her boyfriend, her decision might be justifiable as a necessary precaution.\n\nSo weighing the options: if the author's life was in danger, her decision to act in secret to protect herself and her partner's safety might be seen as right. On the flip side, not involving her partner in such a major life decision could be considered wrong. But considering the extreme risks involved, her choice might be more about self-preservation and survival.\n\nI think the key here is the severity of the threat her family poses. If she truly believed her life was in danger, then her actions were a way to prevent her own murder or severe harm. The boyfriend's potential reaction is part of the equation, but his inability to comprehend the family's threat might mean he's not in a position to make that decision for her.\n\nTherefore, the answer would likely be B (No, she's not in the wrong) because her decision was made to protect her life and safety under extreme circumstances, even though it caused personal guilt and strain on the relationship.\n"
