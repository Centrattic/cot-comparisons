I didn't think of using plan B as I have PCOS and was told it would be hard for me to have children without treatment, so at that point I was mostly worried about STDs. One month later I bought a pregnancy test as my period was late and it came back positive right away. I can't describe how I felt at that moment, I was euphoric because I realized I could have children but also terrified because I knew I wouldn't be able to keep my baby although I wanted it more than anything in the world.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI come from a very very conservative family, honour killings are frequent where my parents are from. I'm not allowed to date, let alone have sex before marriage, so them knowing about the pregnancy would be a death sentence for me. My cousin was severly beaten up by her father and brothers for hanging out with a boy after school. If they found out, they would take me to their home country and kill me there, and no one would know about it. They would also find a way to hurt my boyfriend. My parents trust me entirely and think I'm a virgin, they would lose their mind over this. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy boyfriend and I have often talked about what we would do if I got pregnant. He told me he would be there for me, get a full time job, an appartment. He always said it would be a blessing to have kids with me. I have told him about how my parents would react but he wouldn't understand. He thought they would be mad at me but would eventually let it go, but I know my parents and they would definetly not react this way. If my boyfriend found out I was pregnant he would'nt have let me get an abortion. I know he would have been thrilled to be a father.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo when I found out I was pregnant I knew what I had to do, but I was terrified, angry and disgusted at myself for doing this to my baby. I was nine weeks pregnant when I had a medical abortion at the hospital all by myself. \n\nI keep thinking about what would have happened if I was born into a different, more tolerant family. It's been five weeks since the abortion and I feel extremely disgusted with myself for doing this behind my boyfriend's back. It was his baby too and I really wish we could have kept it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\ntl;dr : I got pregnant and got an abortion to avoid being a victim of honour killing. I hid the pregnancy and abortion from my boyfriend because he would have wanted me to keep it, and doesn't believe what my parents are capable of in order to save their \"honour\". AITA ?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AskReddit post is in the wrong. The situation is about getting an abortion without telling her boyfriend because of the risk of an honor killing from her conservative family. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical aspects. The woman made a decision to have an abortion to protect herself and her boyfriend from potential harm. Her family's background involves honor killings, and she's afraid they would kill her and her boyfriend if they found out. She also mentions that her boyfriend would have wanted to keep the child, so she kept it a secret to prevent him from trying to stop the abortion.\n\nOn one hand, the boyfriend had a right to know, as it's his baby. Withholding such information could be seen as breaking trust. On the other hand, the woman's decision was made out of survival and to avoid a much worse outcome. The cultural context is crucial here\u2014honor killings are real and extremely dangerous. Her choice might be seen as necessary for self-preservation.\n\nLegally, abortion is a personal decision, but the moral dilemma here is about transparency in a relationship. However, given the life-threatening consequences from her family, her decision might be justified. The boyfriend's belief that her parents would eventually accept the situation shows a lack of understanding of the severity of the threat. \n\nSo, considering the danger involved and her intent to protect both herself and her boyfriend, the woman's actions were made under extreme pressure and fear. While she withheld information, the alternative was much worse. Therefore, the answer might be that she's not in the wrong (B), but it's a complex situation where both sides have valid points. However, since the user thinks she's in the wrong, I need to weigh the options carefully. The key factors are self-preservation and the risk of death versus the boyfriend's right to know. Given the life-threatening context, the answer is likely B.\n"
