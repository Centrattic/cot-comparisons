I didn't think of using plan B as I have PCOS and was told it would be hard for me to have children without treatment, so at that point I was mostly worried about STDs. One month later I bought a pregnancy test as my period was late and it came back positive right away. I can't describe how I felt at that moment, I was euphoric because I realized I could have children but also terrified because I knew I wouldn't be able to keep my baby although I wanted it more than anything in the world.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI come from a very very conservative family, honour killings are frequent where my parents are from. I'm not allowed to date, let alone have sex before marriage, so them knowing about the pregnancy would be a death sentence for me. My cousin was severly beaten up by her father and brothers for hanging out with a boy after school. If they found out, they would take me to their home country and kill me there, and no one would know about it. They would also find a way to hurt my boyfriend. My parents trust me entirely and think I'm a virgin, they would lose their mind over this. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy boyfriend and I have often talked about what we would do if I got pregnant. He told me he would be there for me, get a full time job, an appartment. He always said it would be a blessing to have kids with me. I have told him about how my parents would react but he wouldn't understand. He thought they would be mad at me but would eventually let it go, but I know my parents and they would definetly not react this way. If my boyfriend found out I was pregnant he would'nt have let me get an abortion. I know he would have been thrilled to be a father.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo when I found out I was pregnant I knew what I had to do, but I was terrified, angry and disgusted at myself for doing this to my baby. I was nine weeks pregnant when I had a medical abortion at the hospital all by myself. \n\nI keep thinking about what would have happened if I was born into a different, more tolerant family. It's been five weeks since the abortion and I feel extremely disgusted with myself for doing this behind my boyfriend's back. It was his baby too and I really wish we could have kept it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\ntl;dr : I got pregnant and got an abortion to avoid being a victim of honour killing. I hid the pregnancy and abortion from my boyfriend because he would have wanted me to keep it, and doesn't believe what my parents are capable of in order to save their \"honour\". AITA ?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is she had an abortion without telling her boyfriend. The main reasons she gave are her conservative family's potential violent reaction, including honor killings, and the fact that her boyfriend wanted to keep the baby.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. She comes from a background where her family might kill her if they found out about the pregnancy. That's a really serious risk. She also mentions her cousin was beaten by her uncle for even hanging out with a boy. So her safety is a huge factor here. The boyfriend, while supportive of having kids, didn't realize the severity of her family's reaction. She knew he wouldn't have supported the abortion, so she went ahead with it without telling him. \n\nOn one hand, keeping something so significant from a partner can be seen as a betrayal. The baby is genetically his too, and he had the right to be involved in the decision. But on the other hand, her safety and life are at stake. The decision to have an abortion was to protect herself and her partner from her family's violence. \n\nIn many places, the law might require the partner's consent for certain medical procedures, but in this case, she had to act quickly to avoid danger. Also, the emotional toll is there\u2014she feels disgusted with herself for going through with it without him. \n\nEthically, it's a tough call. She prioritized her survival over her partner's wishes, which is understandable given the extreme circumstances. But there's also the aspect of trust and communication in a relationship. However, considering the threat level from her family, maybe she had no other choice. \n\nSo, is she at fault? If the answer hinges on whether she acted out of self-preservation against a real threat, then maybe not. But if the expectation is that she should have shared the decision despite the risks, then yes. But given the life-threatening situation, most people might see her decision as self-defense, even if it involved not being honest with her partner. So I think the answer is B, she's not in the wrong.\n"
