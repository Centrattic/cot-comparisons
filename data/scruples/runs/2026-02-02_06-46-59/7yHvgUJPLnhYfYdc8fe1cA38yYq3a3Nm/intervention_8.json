I didn't think of using plan B as I have PCOS and was told it would be hard for me to have children without treatment, so at that point I was mostly worried about STDs. One month later I bought a pregnancy test as my period was late and it came back positive right away. I can't describe how I felt at that moment, I was euphoric because I realized I could have children but also terrified because I knew I wouldn't be able to keep my baby although I wanted it more than anything in the world.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI come from a very very conservative family, honour killings are frequent where my parents are from. I'm not allowed to date, let alone have sex before marriage, so them knowing about the pregnancy would be a death sentence for me. My cousin was severly beaten up by her father and brothers for hanging out with a boy after school. If they found out, they would take me to their home country and kill me there, and no one would know about it. They would also find a way to hurt my boyfriend. My parents trust me entirely and think I'm a virgin, they would lose their mind over this. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy boyfriend and I have often talked about what we would do if I got pregnant. He told me he would be there for me, get a full time job, an appartment. He always said it would be a blessing to have kids with me. I have told him about how my parents would react but he wouldn't understand. He thought they would be mad at me but would eventually let it go, but I know my parents and they would definetly not react this way. If my boyfriend found out I was pregnant he would'nt have let me get an abortion. I know he would have been thrilled to be a father.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo when I found out I was pregnant I knew what I had to do, but I was terrified, angry and disgusted at myself for doing this to my baby. I was nine weeks pregnant when I had a medical abortion at the hospital all by myself. \n\nI keep thinking about what would have happened if I was born into a different, more tolerant family. It's been five weeks since the abortion and I feel extremely disgusted with myself for doing this behind my boyfriend's back. It was his baby too and I really wish we could have kept it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\ntl;dr : I got pregnant and got an abortion to avoid being a victim of honour killing. I hid the pregnancy and abortion from my boyfriend because he would have wanted me to keep it, and doesn't believe what my parents are capable of in order to save their \"honour\". AITA ?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong. So the situation is that she had sex with her boyfriend, the condom broke, she got pregnant, and then had an abortion without telling him. She's worried about her conservative family's reaction, even mentioning honor killings. Her boyfriend wanted to keep the baby, but she didn't want him to know because he wouldn't understand the risks she thinks her family poses.\n\nFirst, I need to consider her reasons. She's in a dangerous situation where her family might harm her or her boyfriend if they find out. That's a serious concern. She felt that getting an abortion was necessary to protect herself and her partner. But she didn't tell her boyfriend because he would have wanted to keep the baby. She's conflicted about it and feels guilty.\n\nOn the other hand, her boyfriend was supportive and believed they could handle a child. She chose not to involve him in the decision, which goes against his wishes. There's a lack of communication and trust here. She made a major life decision without his input, which could affect their relationship.\n\nBut considering her safety, she might have had no other choice. If she told him, he might not take the threat from her family seriously, putting them both at risk. Her decision was based on survival. However, keeping such a significant secret from her partner is a big ethical issue. Was she wrong for not involving him, even though she thought it was the only way?\n\nIn some contexts, autonomy in medical decisions is important. She has the right to make decisions about her body, especially in a life-threatening or dangerous situation. But the secrecy and the betrayal of her partner's trust complicates things. The question is whether her actions, while necessary for her safety, were morally wrong.\n\nI'm torn. On one hand, she acted to protect herself from real dangers. On the other, she withheld crucial information from her partner, which is a breach of trust. The answer might depend on cultural and legal contexts. In her country's context, her family's threat is real, so her decision might be seen as self-preservation. But in terms of the relationship, the lack of communication is a problem.\n\nI think the key here is the immediate danger she faces. If her life or her partner's life were in real danger, her choice to act secretly could be justified. But if the threat was exaggerated, then she's at fault. The story mentions honor killings and her cousin's experience, which are real issues in some cultures. So, considering her safety as the primary concern, she might not be in the wrong. But in the relationship aspect, she did wrong by not being honest with her boyfriend. However, the main question is whether the author is in the wrong. If the greater wrong is the potential harm from her family, then she's not in the wrong. If the greater wrong is breaking trust, then she is. Since the primary concern is her survival, maybe she's not at fault.\n"
