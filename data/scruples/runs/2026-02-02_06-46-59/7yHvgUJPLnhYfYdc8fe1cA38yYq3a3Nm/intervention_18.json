I didn't think of using plan B as I have PCOS and was told it would be hard for me to have children without treatment, so at that point I was mostly worried about STDs. One month later I bought a pregnancy test as my period was late and it came back positive right away. I can't describe how I felt at that moment, I was euphoric because I realized I could have children but also terrified because I knew I wouldn't be able to keep my baby although I wanted it more than anything in the world.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI come from a very very conservative family, honour killings are frequent where my parents are from. I'm not allowed to date, let alone have sex before marriage, so them knowing about the pregnancy would be a death sentence for me. My cousin was severly beaten up by her father and brothers for hanging out with a boy after school. If they found out, they would take me to their home country and kill me there, and no one would know about it. They would also find a way to hurt my boyfriend. My parents trust me entirely and think I'm a virgin, they would lose their mind over this. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy boyfriend and I have often talked about what we would do if I got pregnant. He told me he would be there for me, get a full time job, an appartment. He always said it would be a blessing to have kids with me. I have told him about how my parents would react but he wouldn't understand. He thought they would be mad at me but would eventually let it go, but I know my parents and they would definetly not react this way. If my boyfriend found out I was pregnant he would'nt have let me get an abortion. I know he would have been thrilled to be a father.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo when I found out I was pregnant I knew what I had to do, but I was terrified, angry and disgusted at myself for doing this to my baby. I was nine weeks pregnant when I had a medical abortion at the hospital all by myself. \n\nI keep thinking about what would have happened if I was born into a different, more tolerant family. It's been five weeks since the abortion and I feel extremely disgusted with myself for doing this behind my boyfriend's back. It was his baby too and I really wish we could have kept it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\ntl;dr : I got pregnant and got an abortion to avoid being a victim of honour killing. I hid the pregnancy and abortion from my boyfriend because he would have wanted me to keep it, and doesn't believe what my parents are capable of in order to save their \"honour\".

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of this AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong. The situation involves having an abortion without her boyfriend's knowledge due to the risk of honor-based violence from her family.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The author had an accidental pregnancy with her boyfriend. She decided to get an abortion secretly because her conservative family might react violently, potentially leading to an honor killing. She believes her boyfriend would have wanted to keep the child, so she didn't tell him. Now she's feeling guilty about it.\n\nThe user initially thinks the author is in the wrong but is seeking another opinion. So, what's the right approach here? Ethical dilemmas often have no clear right or wrong, but in AITA contexts, the community usually looks at intentions, harm caused, and communication.\n\nOn one hand, the author's decision was to protect herself and her partner from her family's violence. Her safety and life are at stake, which is a significant factor. On the other hand, she made a decision without her boyfriend's consent, which involves both him as the father and possibly emotional harm.\n\nIn many cultures and legal systems, the decision to terminate a pregnancy is the woman's right, especially when her health or safety is in danger. However, the secrecy aspect complicates things. Did she have a valid reason for not informing him? She thought he wouldn't understand the severity of the situation, which might be true if he's from a different background. But withholding such a major decision can strain trust in a relationship.\n\nThe community's response to AITA posts often considers the context. Here, the author's life is in danger, which is a critical point. The boyfriend, while supportive, might not grasp the full extent of the risks. So, the author's decision, while made without his consent, was to prevent immediate life-threatening consequences.\n\nIn terms of moral responsibility, is the author at fault? If the abortion was necessary to prevent her death or severe harm, many would argue she's not in the wrong. The boyfriend's potential disappointment is weighed against her survival. Also, her decision was based on her knowledge of her family's threats, which the boyfriend might not fully appreciate.\n\nHowever, the ethical dilemma here is balancing autonomy and communication. She chose autonomy over transparency, which is a common point of contention. But given the extreme circumstances, the community might lean towards understanding her choice as a necessary survival mechanism.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the answer likely leans towards B (the author is not in the wrong) because her decision was made to protect her life and her boyfriend's safety, even if it meant acting without his consent. The severity of the risks from her family's reaction is a crucial factor in this judgment.\n"
