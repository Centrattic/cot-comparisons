I didn't think of using plan B as I have PCOS and was told it would be hard for me to have children without treatment, so at that point I was mostly worried about STDs. One month later I bought a pregnancy test as my period was late and it came back positive right away. I can't describe how I felt at that moment, I was euphoric because I realized I could have children but also terrified because I knew I wouldn't be able to keep my baby although I wanted it more than anything in the world.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI come from a very very conservative family, honour killings are frequent where my parents are from. I'm not allowed to date, let alone have sex before marriage, so them knowing about the pregnancy would be a death sentence for me. My cousin was severly beaten up by her father and brothers for hanging out with a boy after school. If they found out, they would take me to their home country and kill me there, and no one would know about it. They would also find a way to hurt my boyfriend. My parents trust me entirely and think I'm a virgin, they would lose their mind over this. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy boyfriend and I have often talked about what we would do if I got pregnant. He told me he would be there for me, get a full time job, an appartment. He always said it would be a blessing to have kids with me. I have told him about how my parents would react but he wouldn't understand. He thought they would be mad at me but would eventually let it go, but I know my parents and they would definetly not react this way. If my boyfriend found out I was pregnant he would'nt have let me get an abortion. I know he would have been thrilled to be a father.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo when I found out I was pregnant I knew what I had to do, but I was terrified, angry and disgusted at myself for doing this to my baby. I was nine weeks pregnant when I had a medical abortion at the hospital all by myself. \n\nI keep thinking about what would have happened if I was born into a different, more tolerant family. It's been five weeks since the abortion and I feel extremely disgusted with myself for doing this behind my boyfriend's back. It was his baby too and I really wish we could have kept it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\ntl;dr : I got pregnant and got an abortion to avoid being a victim of honour killing. I hid the pregnancy and abortion from my boyfriend because he would have wanted me to keep it, and doesn't believe what my parents are capable of in order to save their \"honour\". AITA ?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that the person had an abortion without telling their boyfriend. The main reasons given are that her family is very conservative and might commit an honor killing if they found out about the pregnancy. She also mentions that her boyfriend would have wanted to keep the baby and would have supported her, but she didn't think he understood the severity of her family's reaction.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical and legal aspects. In many places, having an abortion is a personal medical decision that a woman can make, especially in cases where her health or safety is at risk. The author felt her life was in danger due to her family's potential reaction, which is a significant factor. Honor-based violence is a real issue in some cultures, so the threat of being killed or her boyfriend being hurt is a serious concern.\n\nThen there's the aspect of the relationship. The boyfriend was supportive in their previous discussions about pregnancy, and she withheld the pregnancy and abortion from him. Some might argue that this lack of communication is a betrayal, as she went against his wishes. However, she believed that telling him would result in him trying to keep the baby, which could lead to exposure and danger for both of them.\n\nThe author's own feelings of guilt and the fact that she felt she had no other choice because of her family's reaction are important. It's a situation where she had to choose between her safety and her relationship. The boyfriend's lack of understanding of her family's severity might mean he wasn't in the best position to make that decision for her.\n\nLegally, in many jurisdictions, a woman has the right to make decisions about her own body. The ethical dilemma here is between the right to autonomy and the relationship's trust. However, given the extreme risk of violence from her family, her decision to protect herself could be seen as justifiable. The boyfriend's support doesn't override the immediate danger she faced.\n\nSo, considering all factors, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong because her decision was made to protect her life and safety, which is a fundamental right. The boyfriend's wishes are valid, but in the face of life-threatening circumstances, her choice to prioritize her safety and privacy might be seen as B (not in the wrong).\n"
