I didn't think of using plan B as I have PCOS and was told it would be hard for me to have children without treatment, so at that point I was mostly worried about STDs. One month later I bought a pregnancy test as my period was late and it came back positive right away. I can't describe how I felt at that moment, I was euphoric because I realized I could have children but also terrified because I knew I wouldn't be able to keep my baby although I wanted it more than anything in the world.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI come from a very very conservative family, honour killings are frequent where my parents are from. I'm not allowed to date, let alone have sex before marriage, so them knowing about the pregnancy would be a death sentence for me. My cousin was severly beaten up by her father and brothers for hanging out with a boy after school. If they found out, they would take me to their home country and kill me there, and no one would know about it. They would also find a way to hurt my boyfriend. My parents trust me entirely and think I'm a virgin, they would lose their mind over this. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy boyfriend and I have often talked about what we would do if I got pregnant. He told me he would be there for me, get a full time job, an appartment. He always said it would be a blessing to have kids with me. I have told him about how my parents would react but he wouldn't understand. He thought they would be mad at me but would eventually let it go, but I know my parents and they would definetly not react this way. If my boyfriend found out I was pregnant he would'nt have let me get an abortion. I know he would have been thrilled to be a father.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo when I found out I was pregnant I knew what I had to do, but I was terrified, angry and disgusted at myself for doing this to my baby. I was nine weeks pregnant when I had a medical abortion at the hospital all by myself. \n\nI keep thinking about what would have happened if I was born into a different, more tolerant family. It's been five weeks since the abortion and I feel extremely disgusted with myself for doing this behind my boyfriend's back. It was his baby too and I really wish we could have kept it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\ntl;dr : I got pregnant and got an abortion to avoid being a victim of honour killing. I hid the pregnancy and abortion from my boyfriend because he would have wanted me to keep it, and doesn't believe what my parents are capable of in order to save their \"honour\". AITA ?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for having an abortion without telling her boyfriend. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The woman had a condom break, didn't use Plan B because of her PCOS history. She got pregnant, was excited but scared because her conservative family could kill her for being pregnant out of wedlock. She mentioned honor killings in her family's country. She and her boyfriend had discussed having kids, but she knew he'd want to keep the baby. She had an abortion secretly because she felt it was necessary to protect her life.\n\nSo, the main points are: safety from her family, the boyfriend's wishes vs her safety, and the emotional conflict.\n\nThe question is about whether she's in the wrong. Legally, abortion is a sensitive issue, but the user is asking about moral or ethical standpoint. In the US, abortion is legal in many cases, but the ethics can vary. However, her situation is more about survival. She's in a life-threatening situation if her family found out. The boyfriend didn't know because he wouldn't understand the severity of her family's reaction. She had to make a choice to protect herself. \n\nHer actions were to prevent her own death and her boyfriend's potential harm. Her boyfriend wanted the baby, but she had to prioritize her safety. The key here is that the decision was made under threat of life. Ethically, many would argue that self-preservation is a valid reason. Also, she didn't want to put her boyfriend at risk. \n\nBut some might say she should have told him. However, given the information she has about her family, maybe she had good reason to act alone. The boyfriend didn't believe the severity, so she couldn't rely on him. \n\nSo, considering all that, the answer would be B (not in the wrong) because her action was to save her life, which is a strong moral justification.\n"
