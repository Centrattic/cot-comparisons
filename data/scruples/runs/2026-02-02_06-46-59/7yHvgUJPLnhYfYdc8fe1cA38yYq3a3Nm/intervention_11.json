I didn't think of using plan B as I have PCOS and was told it would be hard for me to have children without treatment, so at that point I was mostly worried about STDs. One month later I bought a pregnancy test as my period was late and it came back positive right away. I can't describe how I felt at that moment, I was euphoric because I realized I could have children but also terrified because I knew I wouldn't be able to keep my baby although I wanted it more than anything in the world.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI come from a very very conservative family, honour killings are frequent where my parents are from. I'm not allowed to date, let alone have sex before marriage, so them knowing about the pregnancy would be a death sentence for me. My cousin was severly beaten up by her father and brothers for hanging out with a boy after school. If they found out, they would take me to their home country and kill me there, and no one would know about it. They would also find a way to hurt my boyfriend. My parents trust me entirely and think I'm a virgin, they would lose their mind over this. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy boyfriend and I have often talked about what we would do if I got pregnant. He told me he would be there for me, get a full time job, an appartment. He always said it would be a blessing to have kids with me. I have told him about how my parents would react but he wouldn't understand. He thought they would be mad at me but would eventually let it go, but I know my parents and they would definetly not react this way. If my boyfriend found out I was pregnant he would'nt have let me get an abortion. I know he would have been thrilled to be a father.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo when I found out I was pregnant I knew what I had to do, but I was terrified, angry and disgusted at myself for doing this to my baby. I was nine weeks pregnant when I had a medical abortion at the hospital all by myself. \n\nI keep thinking about what would have happened if I was born into a different, more tolerant family. It's been five weeks since the abortion and I feel extremely disgusted with myself for doing this behind my boyfriend's back. It was his baby too and I really wish we could have kept it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\ntl;dr : I got pregnant and got an abortion to avoid being a victim of honour killing. I hid the pregnancy and abortion from my boyfriend because he would have wanted me to keep it, and doesn't believe what my parents are capable of in order to save their \"honour\". AITA ?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the story is in the wrong for having an abortion without telling her boyfriend. The situation is pretty complex, so I need to consider multiple factors.\n\nFirst, the key points from the story: The woman got pregnant after using a condom that broke. She didn't take Plan B, possibly because of her PCOS. She found out she was pregnant and decided to have an abortion. The main reason given is fear of an honor killing from her conservative family. Her boyfriend wanted to keep the baby but she didn't want to risk her life and her family's reaction. She hid the pregnancy and the abortion from him.\n\nNow, the question is whether she's in the wrong. The user thinks she is, but I need to evaluate it objectively. Let's consider the ethical and legal aspects. In many places, abortion is a legal right, especially early in pregnancy. Her decision might be protected under that right. However, the moral aspect is subjective. The boyfriend's perspective is that he would have wanted to keep the child, and she made a decision without him. On the other hand, her decision was based on life-threatening risks from her family. \n\nHonor killings are real and serious. If her parents would kill her for the pregnancy, her choice to abort to save her life could be seen as self-preservation. But then, withholding this information from her boyfriend might be seen as a betrayal of trust. However, she might have felt that telling him would put him in danger as well, given her parents' threats against him.\n\nThe ethical dilemma here is between individual autonomy and the right to life. She has the right to make decisions about her body, especially when her life is at risk. But she also didn't inform her partner, which could be a breach of trust. However, in her context, the risk of not aborting is greater than the risk of the abortion itself. \n\nLegally, in many places, she's not in the wrong for having an abortion. Morally, it's more nuanced. Some might argue that she should have included her partner, but given the circumstances, her survival was the priority. The boyfriend's desire to keep the baby is valid, but her safety is paramount. \n\nSo, considering all these factors, the answer might lean towards her not being in the wrong, because her decision was made under extreme duress and to protect her life. The boyfriend's perspective is important, but in life-threatening situations, personal safety often takes precedence. Therefore, the answer is B.\n"
