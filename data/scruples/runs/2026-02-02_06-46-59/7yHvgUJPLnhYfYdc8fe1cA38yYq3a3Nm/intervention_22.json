I didn't think of using plan B as I have PCOS and was told it would be hard for me to have children without treatment, so at that point I was mostly worried about STDs. One month later I bought a pregnancy test as my period was late and it came back positive right away. I can't describe how I felt at that moment, I was euphoric because I realized I could have children but also terrified because I knew I wouldn't be able to keep my baby although I wanted it more than anything in the world.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI come from a very very conservative family, honour killings are frequent where my parents are from. I'm not allowed to date, let alone have sex before marriage, so them knowing about the pregnancy would be a death sentence for me. My cousin was severly beaten up by her father and brothers for hanging out with a boy after school. If they found out, they would take me to their home country and kill me there, and no one would know about it. They would also find a way to hurt my boyfriend. My parents trust me entirely and think I'm a virgin, they would lose their mind over this. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy boyfriend and I have often talked about what we would do if I got pregnant. He told me he would be there for me, get a full time job, an appartment. He always said it would be a blessing to have kids with me. I have told him about how my parents would react but he wouldn't understand. He thought they would be mad at me but would eventually let it go, but I know my parents and they would definetly not react this way. If my boyfriend found out I was pregnant he would'nt have let me get an abortion. I know he would have been thrilled to be a father.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo when I found out I was pregnant I knew what I had to do, but I was terrified, angry and disgusted at myself for doing this to my baby. I was nine weeks pregnant when I had a medical abortion at the hospital all by myself. \n\nI keep thinking about what would have happened if I was born into a different, more tolerant family. It's been five weeks since the abortion and I feel extremely disgusted with myself for doing this behind my boyfriend's back. It was his baby too and I really wish we could have kept it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\ntl;dr : I got pregnant and got an abortion to avoid being a victim of honour killing. I hid the pregnancy and abortion from my boyfriend because he would have wanted me to keep it, and doesn't believe what my parents are capable of in order to save their \"honour\". AITA ?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the \"AITA\" story is in the wrong. The situation involves an abortion done secretly by the author because of her conservative family's potential violent reaction, including honor killings. The boyfriend wanted to keep the child, but the author believed he didn't understand the severity of her family's possible response.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author's safety and life are at risk. Honor killings are a real and severe issue, and the author faces potential death if her parents find out. This is a matter of life or death. She had to make a decision to protect herself and possibly her boyfriend, whom her family might also target.\n\nThe author mentions that she and her boyfriend had discussed what they would do if she got pregnant. He was supportive of having a child, but she felt he underestimated her family's reaction. She decided to get an abortion without telling him, believing he would not allow the procedure. Her primary motivation was self-preservation and preventing harm from her family.\n\nNow, considering ethical perspectives. From a deontological standpoint, lying and not informing the boyfriend could be seen as wrong because it violates trust. However, from a utilitarian perspective, the action might be justified if it prevents greater harm (her death or severe injury). The author's decision prioritizes her survival and safety, which are fundamental rights in most ethical frameworks.\n\nThe law varies by location. In some places, abortion is legal, so her action might be legally permissible. However, the secrecy is due to her family's possible reaction, not legal issues. The boyfriend's reaction is also a factor; he might have wanted to proceed differently, but his understanding of the danger might not match hers.\n\nThe question of being \"in the wrong\" is complex. In terms of moral responsibility, the author made a difficult choice under extreme pressure. The boyfriend's support and the potential consequences from her family create conflicting loyalties. The author's decision was based on a realistic assessment of the risks her family poses, which she knows better than anyone.\n\nSo, balancing the ethical considerations: the author acted out of necessity to protect her life and her partner's safety. While it's a tough decision that involved deception, the alternative was far more dire. Therefore, the answer would be \"B\" (not in the wrong), as her actions were driven by the need to survive in a dangerous situation.\n"
