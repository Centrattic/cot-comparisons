I didn't think of using plan B as I have PCOS and was told it would be hard for me to have children without treatment, so at that point I was mostly worried about STDs. One month later I bought a pregnancy test as my period was late and it came back positive right away. I can't describe how I felt at that moment, I was euphoric because I realized I could have children but also terrified because I knew I wouldn't be able to keep my baby although I wanted it more than anything in the world.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI come from a very very conservative family, honour killings are frequent where my parents are from. I'm not allowed to date, let alone have sex before marriage, so them knowing about the pregnancy would be a death sentence for me. My cousin was severly beaten up by her father and brothers for hanging out with a boy after school. If they found out, they would take me to their home country and kill me there, and no one would know about it. They would also find a way to hurt my boyfriend. My parents trust me entirely and think I'm a virgin, they would lose their mind over this. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy boyfriend and I have often talked about what we would do if I got pregnant. He told me he would be there for me, get a full time job, an appartment. He always said it would be a blessing to have kids with me. I have told him about how my parents would react but he wouldn't understand. He thought they would be mad at me but would eventually let it go, but I know my parents and they would definetly not react this way. If my boyfriend found out I was pregnant he would'nt have let me get an abortion. I know he would have been thrilled to be a father.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo when I found out I was pregnant I knew what I had to do, but I was terrified, angry and disgusted at myself for doing this to my baby. I was nine weeks pregnant when I had a medical abortion at the hospital all by myself. \n\nI keep thinking about what would have happened if I was born into a different, more tolerant family. It's been five weeks since the abortion and I feel extremely disgusted with myself for doing this behind my boyfriend's back. It was his baby too and I really wish we could have kept it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\ntl;dr : I got pregnant and got an abortion to avoid being a victim of honour killing. I hid the pregnancy and abortion from my boyfriend because he would have wanted me to keep it, and doesn't believe what my parents are capable of in order to save their \"honour\". AITA ?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that she had an abortion without telling her boyfriend, mainly because of her family's conservative background and the risk of an honor killing. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the reasons she had the abortion. She mentions that her family is extremely conservative, with a history of honor killings. If they found out she was pregnant out of wedlock, she and her boyfriend could be in grave danger. Her cousin was beaten by her family for just hanging out with a boy. So her fear isn't baseless. She also says her parents would take her back to their home country and kill her if they found out. That's a serious risk.\n\nThen there's the part about her boyfriend. They had discussed what they would do if she got pregnant, and he wanted to keep the baby. She didn't tell him because she knew he wouldn't support the abortion. She believes he underestimates how dangerous her family's reaction would be. She felt she had to act alone to protect both herself and her boyfriend.\n\nNow, the question is whether she's in the wrong. From a moral standpoint, some might argue that she wronged her boyfriend by not telling him, as it was his child too. But others might see that her decision was made to prevent a much worse outcome\u2014her death or her boyfriend's. The decision to have an abortion was likely made under extreme stress and fear. She also felt disgusted with herself afterward, showing internal conflict.\n\nLegally, depending on the country, abortion might be legal or not. The scenario doesn't specify, but since she was able to get a medical abortion, it's possible it's legal where she is. However, the main issue here is ethical and moral, not legal.\n\nConsidering the context, her actions were to save her life and her partner's. She believed she had no other choice given the extreme risks. While withholding information from her boyfriend could be seen as a breach of trust, the alternative\u2014telling him and risking her family's violence\u2014might be worse. Her boyfriend might not have understood the severity of the situation, which complicates things further.\n\nIn many ethical frameworks, the principle of self-preservation and avoiding harm is significant. She acted to prevent imminent harm to herself and her partner. However, the fact that she didn't involve her boyfriend could be a point against her, but given her reasons, it's understandable. The key here is the context of her life-threatening situation and the family's potential reaction.\n\nSo, balancing these factors, it's a complex situation where the author made a difficult decision under extreme pressure to protect herself and her partner. Therefore, the answer is likely B (not in the wrong).\n"
