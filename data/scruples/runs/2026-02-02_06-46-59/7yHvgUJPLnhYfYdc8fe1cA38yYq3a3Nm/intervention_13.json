I didn't think of using plan B as I have PCOS and was told it would be hard for me to have children without treatment, so at that point I was mostly worried about STDs. One month later I bought a pregnancy test as my period was late and it came back positive right away. I can't describe how I felt at that moment, I was euphoric because I realized I could have children but also terrified because I knew I wouldn't be able to keep my baby although I wanted it more than anything in the world.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI come from a very very conservative family, honour killings are frequent where my parents are from. I'm not allowed to date, let alone have sex before marriage, so them knowing about the pregnancy would be a death sentence for me. My cousin was severly beaten up by her father and brothers for hanging out with a boy after school. If they found out, they would take me to their home country and kill me there, and no one would know about it. They would also find a way to hurt my boyfriend. My parents trust me entirely and think I'm a virgin, they would lose their mind over this. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy boyfriend and I have often talked about what we would do if I got pregnant. He told me he would be there for me, get a full time job, an appartment. He always said it would be a blessing to have kids with me. I have told him about how my parents would react but he wouldn't understand. He thought they would be mad at me but would eventually let it go, but I know my parents and they would definetly not react this way. If my boyfriend found out I was pregnant he would'nt have let me get an abortion. I know he would have been thrilled to be a father.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo when I found out I was pregnant I knew what I had to do, but I was terrified, angry and disgusted at myself for doing this to my baby. I was nine weeks pregnant when I had a medical abortion at the hospital all by myself. \n\nI keep thinking about what would have happened if I was born into a different, more tolerant family. It's been five weeks since the abortion and I feel extremely disgusted with myself for doing this behind my boyfriend's back. It was his baby too and I really wish we could have kept it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\ntl;dr : I got pregnant and got an abortion to avoid being a victim of honour killing. I hid the pregnancy and abortion from my boyfriend because he would have wanted me to keep it, and doesn't believe what my parents are capable of in order to save their \"honour\". AITA ?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is pretty complex. So, the user had an abortion without her boyfriend's knowledge because of the family situation. Her parents are from a very conservative background where honor killings are common. She's worried that if they found out she's pregnant and had an abortion, they'd kill her and maybe her boyfriend. She and the boyfriend had talked about having kids, and he was all for it. But she didn't want him to know because he wouldn't understand the danger from her family. She felt she had to make the decision alone to protect herself and her boyfriend.\n\nFirst, the user is asking if the author is at fault. The options are A (yes, in the wrong) or B (no). I need to consider both sides. On one hand, the boyfriend had a right to know about the pregnancy and the decision to abort. It's his child too, so he has a right to be involved. Also, making such a big decision without discussing it with a partner might be seen as a breach of trust. But on the other hand, the author is facing a life-threatening situation. Her family's reaction could lead to her death or serious harm. She might have felt that hiding the pregnancy was necessary for her survival. She also mentions that she was terrified and disgusted with herself, showing she feels conflicted about her decision.\n\nThe key points here are the cultural context and the safety of the author and her boyfriend. The boyfriend's perspective is important, but if the author truly believed that telling him would put them both in danger, her priority was survival. In such extreme circumstances, some might argue that the author's decision was necessary for self-preservation. However, others might say that the boyfriend had a right to be informed and involved in the decision-making process, especially regarding their child. The ethical dilemma here is about balancing individual safety against relational trust and shared decision-making.\n\nIn many ethical frameworks, the right to life and autonomy is paramount. If the author's life was in danger, her decision to protect herself could be seen as justified. However, in a relationship, transparency is usually expected, especially regarding significant decisions like an abortion. The fact that she was considering the well-being of both herself and her partner might mitigate some of the blame, but the secrecy could still be seen as a problem.\n\nI think the answer might depend on cultural and personal values. In a context where the risk of honor-based violence is real and severe, the author's decision to act alone could be viewed as a necessary action to prevent harm. However, in terms of relationship ethics, withholding such information might be considered wrong. The user's initial thought is that the author is in the wrong, but after considering the circumstances, maybe the answer isn't straightforward. The user is asking for an opinion, so I need to weigh these factors.\n"
