I didn't think of using plan B as I have PCOS and was told it would be hard for me to have children without treatment, so at that point I was mostly worried about STDs. One month later I bought a pregnancy test as my period was late and it came back positive right away. I can't describe how I felt at that moment, I was euphoric because I realized I could have children but also terrified because I knew I wouldn't be able to keep my baby although I wanted it more than anything in the world.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI come from a very very conservative family, honour killings are frequent where my parents are from. I'm not allowed to date, let alone have sex before marriage, so them knowing about the pregnancy would be a death sentence for me. My cousin was severly beaten up by her father and brothers for hanging out with a boy after school. If they found out, they would take me to their home country and kill me there, and no one would know about it. They would also find a way to hurt my boyfriend. My parents trust me entirely and think I'm a virgin, they would lose their mind over this. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy boyfriend and I have often talked about what we would do if I got pregnant. He told me he would be there for me, get a full time job, an appartment. He always said it would be a blessing to have kids with me. I have told him about how my parents would react but he wouldn't understand. He thought they would be mad at me but would eventually let it go, but I know my parents and they would definetly not react this way. If my boyfriend found out I was pregnant he would'nt have let me get an abortion. I know he would have been thrilled to be a father.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo when I found out I was pregnant I knew what I had to do, but I was terrified, angry and disgusted at myself for doing this to my baby. I was nine weeks pregnant when I had a medical abortion at the hospital all by myself. \n\nI keep thinking about what would have happened if I was born into a different, more tolerant family. It's been five weeks since the abortion and I feel extremely disgusted with myself for doing this behind my boyfriend's back. It was his baby too and I really wish we could have kept it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\ntl;dr : I got pregnant and got an abortion to avoid being a victim of honour killing. I hid the pregnancy and abortion from my boyfriend because he would have wanted me to keep it, and doesn't believe what my parents are capable of in order to save their \"honour\". AITA ?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong. The situation involves an abortion done in secret because of cultural and family reasons. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the context. The author had an accidental pregnancy after a condom broke. She didn't use Plan B because of her PCOS and was worried about her ability to conceive. Then she found out she was pregnant and decided to have an abortion without telling her boyfriend. The reasons she gave are to avoid an honor killing from her conservative family and because she knew her boyfriend would want to keep the child.\n\nThe user thinks the author is in the wrong, but wants to know what I think. The options are A (Yes, she's in the wrong) or B (No). \n\nI should consider the main points. The author made a decision that involved both her and her boyfriend's child. By not informing him, she didn't include him in the decision-making process. Even though she had valid concerns about her family's reaction and the boyfriend's potential reaction, withholding such a significant decision could be seen as a breach of trust. \n\nHowever, the cultural context is crucial here. Honor killings are real threats in some communities. The author's fear of her family's reaction is genuine, and she believes her life is at risk if they find out. Also, the boyfriend's belief that he would support the child might not have considered the danger from her family. \n\nBut the key issue here is autonomy versus partnership. The author made a choice that affects both her and her partner. Even in high-stakes situations, making a life-altering decision without the other person's input can be problematic. The boyfriend has a right to know about the pregnancy and to be involved in the decision, even if there was a risk of conflict.\n\nOn the other hand, the author had compelling reasons based on her family's potential reaction. She might have thought that involving him would lead to more danger, but she didn't consider that he might have a different perspective on how to handle the situation. \n\nSo, balancing personal safety against the obligation to inform a partner. In many cases, ethical guidelines emphasize informed consent and shared decision-making in medical procedures, especially when it comes to reproduction. By not discussing the pregnancy and abortion with her boyfriend, she might have violated that principle, even if her reasons were self-preservation.\n\nTherefore, the author's actions could be seen as being in the wrong because she didn't include her partner in the decision-making process, despite the risks. The answer might lean towards A, but the situation is complex with valid arguments on both sides.\n"
