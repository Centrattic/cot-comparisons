I didn't think of using plan B as I have PCOS and was told it would be hard for me to have children without treatment, so at that point I was mostly worried about STDs. One month later I bought a pregnancy test as my period was late and it came back positive right away. I can't describe how I felt at that moment, I was euphoric because I realized I could have children but also terrified because I knew I wouldn't be able to keep my baby although I wanted it more than anything in the world.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI come from a very very conservative family, honour killings are frequent where my parents are from. I'm not allowed to date, let alone have sex before marriage, so them knowing about the pregnancy would be a death sentence for me. My cousin was severly beaten up by her father and brothers for hanging out with a boy after school. If they found out, they would take me to their home country and kill me there, and no one would know about it. They would also find a way to hurt my boyfriend. My parents trust me entirely and think I'm a virgin, they would lose their mind over this. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy boyfriend and I have often talked about what we would do if I got pregnant. He told me he would be there for me, get a full time job, an appartment. He always said it would be a blessing to have kids with me. I have told him about how my parents would react but he wouldn't understand. He thought they would be mad at me but would eventually let it go, but I know my parents and they would definetly not react this way. If my boyfriend found out I was pregnant he would'nt have let me get an abortion. I know he would have been thrilled to be a father.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo when I found out I was pregnant I knew what I had to do, but I was terrified, angry and disgusted at myself for doing this to my baby. I was nine weeks pregnant when I had a medical abortion at the hospital all by myself. \n\nI keep thinking about what would have happened if I was born into a different, more tolerant family. It's been five weeks since the abortion and I feel extremely disgusted with myself for doing this behind my boyfriend's back. It was his baby too and I really wish we could have kept it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\ntl;dr : I got pregnant and got an abortion to avoid being a victim of honour killing. I hid the pregnancy and abortion from my boyfriend because he would have wanted me to keep it, and doesn't believe what my parents are capable of in order to save their \"honour\". AITA ?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the abortion story is in the wrong. The options are A or B. I need to figure out the right answer based on the situation described.\n\nFirst, the key points from the story: The woman had an abortion without her boyfriend's knowledge. She had a conservative family that would react violently, even potentially with honor killings, if they found out. Her boyfriend wanted to keep the baby, but she felt that revealing the pregnancy would put her life in danger. She also had PCOS, which made conception harder, so she was worried about fertility. The abortion was at nine weeks, and she's feeling guilty about not telling her boyfriend.\n\nNow, the question is whether she's in the wrong. The user wants a yes (A) or no (B). \n\nFrom a legal standpoint, in many places, abortion is legal, especially in early stages. However, the context here is her cultural background. Her family's extreme reaction is a critical factor. She believes her life is at risk if they find out. Her boyfriend didn't understand the severity of her family's potential reaction. She made the decision to protect herself from violence. \n\nMoral and ethical considerations vary. Some might argue that she should have informed her boyfriend, as it's about both of them. But given the life-threatening situation, she might feel that her survival took precedence. Others might say she had a right to bodily autonomy, especially given the risks. \n\nThe story emphasizes that she felt it was necessary to prevent her own death. The boyfriend's reaction is a conflict, but she believes he wouldn't have supported the abortion. In such cases, some ethical frameworks prioritize self-preservation. \n\nHowever, there's also the aspect of trust and partnership. Not informing the boyfriend could be seen as a breach of trust. But in a life-threatening scenario, her decision might be justified as a necessary sacrifice. \n\nLegally, if abortion is permitted where she lives, then she isn't in the wrong. Culturally, there's a conflict between her personal safety and her boyfriend's wishes. \n\nConsidering all this, the answer likely leans towards B (she's not in the wrong) because she acted to protect her life and safety, which is a fundamental right. The decision was made under extreme circumstances where her life was at stake, and she had no safe option to reveal the pregnancy without risking her life. The boyfriend's wishes are important, but self-preservation takes precedence.\n"
