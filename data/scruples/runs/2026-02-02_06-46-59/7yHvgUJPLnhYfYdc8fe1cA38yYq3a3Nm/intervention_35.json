I didn't think of using plan B as I have PCOS and was told it would be hard for me to have children without treatment, so at that point I was mostly worried about STDs. One month later I bought a pregnancy test as my period was late and it came back positive right away. I can't describe how I felt at that moment, I was euphoric because I realized I could have children but also terrified because I knew I wouldn't be able to keep my baby although I wanted it more than anything in the world.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI come from a very very conservative family, honour killings are frequent where my parents are from. I'm not allowed to date, let alone have sex before marriage, so them knowing about the pregnancy would be a death sentence for me. My cousin was severly beaten up by her father and brothers for hanging out with a boy after school. If they found out, they would take me to their home country and kill me there, and no one would know about it. They would also find a way to hurt my boyfriend. My parents trust me entirely and think I'm a virgin, they would lose their mind over this. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy boyfriend and I have often talked about what we would do if I got pregnant. He told me he would be there for me, get a full time job, an appartment. He always said it would be a blessing to have kids with me. I have told him about how my parents would react but he wouldn't understand. He thought they would be mad at me but would eventually let it go, but I know my parents and they would definetly not react this way. If my boyfriend found out I was pregnant he would'nt have let me get an abortion. I know he would have been thrilled to be a father.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nSo when I found out I was pregnant I knew what I had to do, but I was terrified, angry and disgusted at myself for doing this to my baby. I was nine weeks pregnant when I had a medical abortion at the hospital all by myself. \n\nI keep thinking about what would have happened if I was born into a different, more tolerant family. It's been five weeks since the abortion and I feel extremely disgusted with myself for doing this behind my boyfriend's back. It was his baby too and I really wish we could have kept it.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\ntl;dr : I got pregnant and got an abortion to avoid being a victim of honour killing. I hid the pregnancy and abortion from my boyfriend because he would have wanted me to keep it, and doesn't believe what my parents are capable of in order to save their \"honour\". AITA ?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is about a woman who had an abortion without telling her boyfriend. She got pregnant after a broken condom, and because of her conservative family background, she feared an honor killing if they found out. She and her boyfriend had discussed having kids if she got pregnant, and he wanted to be a father. However, she decided to have the abortion secretly because she thought he wouldn't understand the danger from her family. Now she's feeling guilty about it.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspect. In many places, abortion is legal, so her decision might be legally sound. But the ethical part is more complex. The key points here are her safety and the risk of honor violence. Honor killings are real and severe, so her choice might be a matter of life and death. She's trying to protect herself and her boyfriend from her family's violence. \n\nOn the other hand, her boyfriend had a right to know about the pregnancy and the decision. He was part of the relationship, and involving him could have led to a different outcome, maybe even support from him to face her family together. But the woman felt that her intuition about her family's reaction was correct and that her boyfriend wouldn't take the threat seriously. She might have thought that involving him would put them both in danger. \n\nAnother angle is her personal autonomy. She made a choice about her body, which is a common argument in abortion debates. However, the baby's father's perspective is also valid, so there's a conflict there. But given the context of her life-threatening situation, her priority was survival. \n\nHer guilt suggests she believes she did something wrong, but the circumstances are extreme. The question is whether her actions were wrong given the risks. If the answer hinges on intent and necessity, she was trying to prevent a worse outcome. \n\nSo, considering all factors, the answer might be that she's not in the wrong because she acted to save her life and her boyfriend's life, even though she didn't inform him. The alternative was a very real danger of death. However, some might argue that she should have found a way to communicate the risk to her boyfriend despite his initial disbelief. But given her assessment that he wouldn't understand, maybe her decision was the only way. \n\nI think the answer is B (not in the wrong) because her decision was made under life-threatening circumstances to protect herself and her partner. Her boyfriend's desires were valid, but her survival was the priority, and she acted accordingly.\n"
