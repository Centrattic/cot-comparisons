I was surprised when I found out on Facebook because I thought this was something she would have told me first. I sent her a private message congratulating her and we spent some time talking about her wedding plans. I assumed I would be her maid of honor since two years ago she was the maid of honor in my wedding. \n\nA few weeks ago, I saw on Facebook that she asked another childhood best friend to be her maid of honor. I was hurt but understood that we have drifted apart the past few years. I still assumed I would be a bridesmaid. \n\nLast week I saw another Facebook post of her and everyone she asked to be in her wedding party. Two of the girls were people she hasn\u2019t been very close with lately. It has now become clear to me that I will not be in her wedding party. \n\nMy feelings are hurt but I understand that this is her day and she should have the people she wants standing up next to her. However, since I am not in the wedding party, WIBTA for not attending the wedding? She lives a few states away so I would need to buy a plane ticket, a hotel room, and request time off of work. This would not be a major hardship but it does not seem worth it to me since I am already embarrassed about not being in the wedding party. \n\nI am not interested in being in a one sided friendship. I would rather focus on friends who want to have me around. I do not plan on staying in contact with her after this. AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person (the author) is in the wrong for not wanting to attend their friend's wedding because they weren't asked to be in the wedding party. \n\nFirst, the key points: the author is a 15-year friend who found out about the wedding on Facebook, thought they'd be the maid of honor since they did that for the friend's wedding. The friend chose someone else, and the author is now considering not attending because they're hurt and not in the wedding party.\n\nI need to consider social norms. Usually, attending a friend's wedding is expected, even if you're not in the wedding party. But the author is hurt because they weren't asked, which makes sense. However, not attending might be seen as cutting off the friend entirely, which could be hurtful. The author mentions not wanting to maintain a one-sided friendship, which is valid.\n\nBut is it the author's fault? They were hurt when not chosen, which is understandable. The friend didn't inform them first, which might have contributed to the hurt feelings. The author isn't being unreasonable in feeling this way. They're making a choice based on their feelings, which is their right. \n\nOn the other hand, weddings are important events, and skipping might be seen as a betrayal. However, the author is considering the effort involved (travel, time off) and their emotional state. They also plan to cut off contact afterward, which might be a bigger issue, but the question is about attending the wedding.\n\nThe friend didn't include them in the wedding party, which is the friend's choice, but the author's reaction is about their own feelings. So, from a social standpoint, maybe the author is in the wrong for not attending, but from a personal feelings perspective, they have valid reasons. However, the expectation is usually to attend regardless. So maybe the answer is A (in the wrong), but I need to be careful here.\n\nAlternatively, since the author is hurt and the friend didn't communicate well, the author's decision is understandable. But the act of not attending could be seen as a breach of friendship. The line between personal feelings and social expectations is thin here. \n\nI think the key is whether attending is expected. If the author is not in the wedding party, is it still expected to attend? Yes, because it's their friend's big day. So by not attending, they might be in the wrong. The answer might be A. But the author's reasoning is based on hurt feelings, so maybe B. \n\nHmm, conflicting. The user wants a choice between A and B. Based on social norms, attending is expected unless there's a good reason. The author's reason is personal hurt, which might not be a sufficient reason to skip. So AITA would likely say the author is in the wrong (A), but some might argue B. The answer depends on cultural expectations. In many cases, attending is expected regardless, so the author is in the wrong.\n"
