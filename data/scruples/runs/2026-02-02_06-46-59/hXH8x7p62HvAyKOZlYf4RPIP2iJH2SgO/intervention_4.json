I was surprised when I found out on Facebook because I thought this was something she would have told me first. I sent her a private message congratulating her and we spent some time talking about her wedding plans. I assumed I would be her maid of honor since two years ago she was the maid of honor in my wedding. \n\nA few weeks ago, I saw on Facebook that she asked another childhood best friend to be her maid of honor. I was hurt but understood that we have drifted apart the past few years. I still assumed I would be a bridesmaid. \n\nLast week I saw another Facebook post of her and everyone she asked to be in her wedding party. Two of the girls were people she hasn\u2019t been very close with lately. It has now become clear to me that I will not be in her wedding party. \n\nMy feelings are hurt but I understand that this is her day and she should have the people she wants standing up next to her. However, since I am not in the wedding party, WIBTA for not attending the wedding? She lives a few states away so I would need to buy a plane ticket, a hotel room, and request time off of work. This would not be a major hardship but it does not seem worth it to me since I am already embarrassed about not being in the wedding party. \n\nI am not interested in being in a one sided friendship. I would rather focus on friends who want to have me around. I do not plan on staying in contact with her after this. AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is about a friend not being invited to the wedding party and considering not attending the wedding.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The author has been friends with the bride for over 15 years. She found out about the wedding on Facebook, which was a surprise. She assumed she would be the maid of honor since the bride was her maid of honor at her wedding two years ago. But the bride chose someone else as maid of honor, and the author isn't in the wedding party. Now, the author is considering not attending because she's hurt and feels it's not worth the effort and money.\n\nThe author's reasoning is that since she's not in the wedding party, she doesn't want to go. She also mentions that she's drifting apart from the friend and plans to cut contact after. The main question is whether the author is in the wrong for not attending.\n\nI need to consider social norms here. Weddings are major events, and not attending a close friend's wedding can be seen as a big deal. Even if you're not in the wedding party, many people still attend out of respect and friendship. The author's decision is based on hurt feelings and wanting to focus on other friends. But is that a valid reason?\n\nThe argument for the author being in the wrong (A) is that weddings are important, and not attending might be seen as cutting off contact or being petty. The bride might feel hurt if a long-time friend doesn't come. On the other hand, the author is justified in feeling hurt and might feel the friendship is becoming one-sided. She's also being honest about her feelings and not forcing herself into a situation that makes her uncomfortable.\n\nThe argument for not being in the wrong (B) is that the author has every right to prioritize her feelings. If the friendship is drifting, maybe the wedding is a sign to move on. Also, the bride didn't communicate properly, which could be a factor in the author's decision.\n\nI need to weigh these aspects. The key points are the expectation of being in the wedding party, the surprise via Facebook, and the decision not to attend. The bride's actions might have contributed to the author's hurt feelings. However, the author's choice to not attend could be seen as holding a grudge. Socially, attending a friend's wedding is often expected even if you're not in the party. But if the friendship is already strained, maybe it's acceptable.\n\nIn AITA scenarios, the community often looks at whether the person acted unkindly despite having valid feelings. The author is hurt, but choosing not to attend might be seen as a passive-aggressive response. However, if she feels the friendship isn't reciprocal, her decision is more understandable.\n\nI think the answer might be B (not in the wrong) because she's prioritizing her own feelings and recognizing a one-sided relationship. But some might say A because attending the wedding is expected regardless of being in the party. However, given the lack of communication and the author's feelings, B could be the right choice.\n"
