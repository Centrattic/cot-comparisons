I was surprised when I found out on Facebook because I thought this was something she would have told me first. I sent her a private message congratulating her and we spent some time talking about her wedding plans. I assumed I would be her maid of honor since two years ago she was the maid of honor in my wedding. \n\nA few weeks ago, I saw on Facebook that she asked another childhood best friend to be her maid of honor. I was hurt but understood that we have drifted apart the past few years. I still assumed I would be a bridesmaid. \n\nLast week I saw another Facebook post of her and everyone she asked to be in her wedding party. Two of the girls were people she hasn\u2019t been very close with lately. It has now become clear to me that I will not be in her wedding party. \n\nMy feelings are hurt but I understand that this is her day and she should have the people she wants standing up next to her. However, since I am not in the wedding party, WIBTA for not attending the wedding? She lives a few states away so I would need to buy a plane ticket, a hotel room, and request time off of work. This would not be a major hardship but it does not seem worth it to me since I am already embarrassed about not being in the wedding party. \n\nI am not interested in being in a one sided friendship. I would rather focus on friends who want to have me around. I do not plan on staying in contact with her after this. AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this AITA question. So the situation is about a long-time friend not being invited as a bridesmaid and considering not attending the wedding. The user wants to know if the author is in the wrong.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The author is a 15-year friend. They thought they'd be maid of honor since the friend was the maid of honor at their wedding. But the friend chose someone else, and the author is hurt. Now they're thinking about skipping the wedding because they're not in the bridal party. They mention it's not a major hardship but they don't want to attend if they're not part of the party. They also say they want to focus on friends who want them around and plan to cut ties after this.\n\nHmm, so the main question is whether not attending is wrong. Let's think about social norms. Weddings are usually attended by close friends and family even if you're not in the bridal party. The author is considering not going as a protest. Is that fair? Well, the friend didn't invite them to the bridal party, which is a big deal, but the wedding itself is a separate event. The author is using the wedding as leverage in their friendship. \n\nBut is it right to not attend a close friend's wedding because you're not in the bridal party? On one hand, the author is upset and feels slighted. On the other hand, weddings can be expensive and time-consuming, and maybe the author feels it's not worth the effort if they're not honored. However, attending a friend's wedding is generally seen as a gesture of support, regardless of being in the party. Not attending might be seen as holding a grudge. \n\nThe friend might not have thought of the author for the bridal party because they've drifted apart. The author acknowledges that, but still feels hurt. The decision not to attend could be seen as cutting off the friendship, which they're already planning to do. Maybe they're trying to make a point. \n\nBut in terms of \"wrongdoing,\" if the author is choosing to not attend as punishment, that's a personal choice. However, in many social circles, attending a friend's wedding is expected, even if you're not in the bridal party. So the author could be in the wrong for not attending as a way to express hurt feelings. On the other hand, if they're genuinely not interested in maintaining the friendship anymore, maybe it's their right. \n\nThe key here is whether the author is being reasonable. They were not invited to the bridal party, but the wedding is still happening. Not attending might be a personal decision, but is it the right one? The friend might not have known how important being in the bridal party was to the author. The author might have unexpressed expectations. \n\nIn terms of AITA, the author might be in the wrong because they're letting their feelings about the bridal party affect attendance at the wedding. However, if the author plans to cut off contact anyway, maybe they're just being honest. But society often expects you to attend a close friend's wedding regardless. \n\nI think the answer is A (the author is in the wrong) because not attending a friend's wedding over not being in the bridal party is seen as holding a grudge. Weddings are about celebrating the couple, not just the bridal party. The author's decision could be hurtful and might damage the friendship further. Even if they plan to stop contact, attending could be a respectful send-off. So the author is wrong for using the wedding as leverage.\n"
