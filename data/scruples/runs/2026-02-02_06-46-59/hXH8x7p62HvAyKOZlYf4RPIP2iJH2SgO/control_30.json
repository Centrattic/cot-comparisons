I was surprised when I found out on Facebook because I thought this was something she would have told me first. I sent her a private message congratulating her and we spent some time talking about her wedding plans. I assumed I would be her maid of honor since two years ago she was the maid of honor in my wedding. \n\nA few weeks ago, I saw on Facebook that she asked another childhood best friend to be her maid of honor. I was hurt but understood that we have drifted apart the past few years. I still assumed I would be a bridesmaid. \n\nLast week I saw another Facebook post of her and everyone she asked to be in her wedding party. Two of the girls were people she hasn\u2019t been very close with lately. It has now become clear to me that I will not be in her wedding party. \n\nMy feelings are hurt but I understand that this is her day and she should have the people she wants standing up next to her. However, since I am not in the wedding party, WIBTA for not attending the wedding? She lives a few states away so I would need to buy a plane ticket, a hotel room, and request time off of work. This would not be a major hardship but it does not seem worth it to me since I am already embarrassed about not being in the wedding party. \n\nI am not interested in being in a one sided friendship. I would rather focus on friends who want to have me around. I do not plan on staying in contact with her after this. AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not wanting to attend their friend's wedding after not being invited as a bridesmaid. The author is a 15-year friend, so that's a long-standing relationship. They were surprised they weren't told first, which might indicate some hurt feelings right from the start. Then, when they found out their friend chose someone else as maid of honor, they were hurt but understood the drift. Still expected to be a bridesmaid, but that didn't happen either. Now, the author is considering not attending because they're not part of the wedding party and don't want to spend money or time on it. They also mention wanting to focus on other friends since the friendship feels one-sided now.\n\nFirst, I need to consider traditions and expectations. Typically, close friends are part of the wedding party, but it's the bride's choice. The author did the right thing by not confronting publicly and instead sent a private message. The friend might not have included them due to drifting apart, even if unintentionally. The author's feelings of hurt are valid, but the decision to not attend is about personal boundaries. Attending a wedding can be costly and time-consuming, especially if one isn't part of the wedding party. The author isn't being petty; they're setting boundaries after feeling undervalued. Also, they mentioned not wanting a one-sided friendship, which is a reasonable stance. So, the answer would likely be B (No), the author isn't in the wrong. They have every right to prioritize their feelings and where they invest their time and money.\n"
