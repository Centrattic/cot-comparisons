I was surprised when I found out on Facebook because I thought this was something she would have told me first. I sent her a private message congratulating her and we spent some time talking about her wedding plans. I assumed I would be her maid of honor since two years ago she was the maid of honor in my wedding. \n\nA few weeks ago, I saw on Facebook that she asked another childhood best friend to be her maid of honor. I was hurt but understood that we have drifted apart the past few years. I still assumed I would be a bridesmaid. \n\nLast week I saw another Facebook post of her and everyone she asked to be in her wedding party. Two of the girls were people she hasn\u2019t been very close with lately. It has now become clear to me that I will not be in her wedding party. \n\nMy feelings are hurt but I understand that this is her day and she should have the people she wants standing up next to her. However, since I am not in the wedding party, WIBTA for not attending the wedding? She lives a few states away so I would need to buy a plane ticket, a hotel room, and request time off of work. This would not be a major hardship but it does not seem worth it to me since I am already embarrassed about not being in the wedding party. \n\nI am not interested in being in a one sided friendship. I would rather focus on friends who want to have me around. I do not plan on staying in contact with her after this. AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not wanting to attend their friend's wedding after not being included in the wedding party.\n\nFirst, the situation: The friend didn't tell them about the wedding first, which already feels a bit hurtful. The author assumed they'd be the maid of honor because their friend was the maid of honor at their wedding. But the friend chose someone else, so the author feels hurt but understands the drift. Now, the author is considering not attending the wedding because they aren't in the wedding party and don't want to partake in a one-sided friendship.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? Well, weddings are significant events. Even if you're not in the wedding party, attending is often seen as a gesture of support. The author is making a choice based on their feelings of being excluded. But is that wrong?\n\nOn one hand, the author has every right to prioritize their feelings. If attending the wedding is a burden and they feel unappreciated, it's understandable they might not want to go. On the other hand, the friend might genuinely want them there, even if they aren't in the wedding party. The author's decision could be seen as cutting ties, but they mention they don't plan to stay in contact anyway.\n\nThe author isn't being cruel; they're setting boundaries. The friend might have messed up by not including them, but the author's choice to not attend isn't necessarily wrong. It's about personal feelings and boundaries. So, the answer is probably B (No), the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
