I was surprised when I found out on Facebook because I thought this was something she would have told me first. I sent her a private message congratulating her and we spent some time talking about her wedding plans. I assumed I would be her maid of honor since two years ago she was the maid of honor in my wedding. \n\nA few weeks ago, I saw on Facebook that she asked another childhood best friend to be her maid of honor. I was hurt but understood that we have drifted apart the past few years. I still assumed I would be a bridesmaid. \n\nLast week I saw another Facebook post of her and everyone she asked to be in her wedding party. Two of the girls were people she hasn\u2019t been very close with lately. It has now become clear to me that I will not be in her wedding party. \n\nMy feelings are hurt but I understand that this is her day and she should have the people she wants standing up next to her. However, since I am not in the wedding party, WIBTA for not attending the wedding? She lives a few states away so I would need to buy a plane ticket, a hotel room, and request time off of work. This would not be a major hardship but it does not seem worth it to me since I am already embarrassed about not being in the wedding party. \n\nI am not interested in being in a one sided friendship. I would rather focus on friends who want to have me around. I do not plan on staying in contact with her after this. AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for not attending their friend's wedding because they weren't chosen as a bridesmaid.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The author is a 15-year friend who was surprised when the friend found out via Facebook. They thought they were the maid of honor since the friend was their maid of honor. But now the friend chose someone else, and the author is considering not attending the wedding.\n\nThe key points here are: the author feels hurt and overlooked, as they were expecting a role in the wedding party. The friend's decision to include others might have been due to drifting apart. The author is considering skipping the wedding, which is a significant event, but it's not a major hardship. They also mention they don't want a one-sided friendship anymore.\n\nFriendships can be complex. The author's feelings are valid\u2014being excluded from a big event you expected to participate in is hurtful. However, attending a friend's wedding is a social norm. Even if you're not in the wedding party, showing up is usually expected to support them. The author is making a choice based on hurt feelings, which might be seen as prioritizing their own emotions over the friendship.\n\nBut wait, the author also mentions that they are drifting apart and plan to cut contact afterward. That adds a layer\u2014maybe they feel it's a last stand. However, not attending a wedding is a big step. The question is whether it's right to skip the wedding over not being a bridesmaid.\n\nIn terms of social expectations, people often attend friends' weddings regardless of their role in the party. The author's decision might be seen as petty, but they have a right to their feelings. The answer hinges on whether the author is in the wrong for choosing not to attend. \n\nIf the answer is A (Yes, in the wrong), because weddings are important and attending is a basic courtesy. If B (No), because the author's feelings are valid and the friendship is already strained. \n\nBut the user is asking for whether the author is in the wrong. The AITA (Am I the Asshole) context often looks for social norms. Generally, attending is expected unless there are serious reasons. The author's reasoning might not be sufficient, making them the asshole. So answer A.\n"
