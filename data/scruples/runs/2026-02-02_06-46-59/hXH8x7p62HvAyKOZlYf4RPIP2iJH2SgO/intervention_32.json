I was surprised when I found out on Facebook because I thought this was something she would have told me first. I sent her a private message congratulating her and we spent some time talking about her wedding plans. I assumed I would be her maid of honor since two years ago she was the maid of honor in my wedding. \n\nA few weeks ago, I saw on Facebook that she asked another childhood best friend to be her maid of honor. I was hurt but understood that we have drifted apart the past few years. I still assumed I would be a bridesmaid. \n\nLast week I saw another Facebook post of her and everyone she asked to be in her wedding party. Two of the girls were people she hasn\u2019t been very close with lately. It has now become clear to me that I will not be in her wedding party. \n\nMy feelings are hurt but I understand that this is her day and she should have the people she wants standing up next to her. However, since I am not in the wedding party, WIBTA for not attending the wedding? She lives a few states away so I would need to buy a plane ticket, a hotel room, and request time off of work. This would not be a major hardship but it does not seem worth it to me since I am already embarrassed about not being in the wedding party. \n\nI am not interested in being in a one sided friendship. I would rather focus on friends who want to have me around. I do not plan on staying in contact with her after this. AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is about a friend not being invited to the wedding party and considering skipping the wedding. The user wants to know if the author is at fault.\n\nFirst, I need to look at the details. The author is a 15-year friend who wasn't invited to the wedding party. She found out via Facebook, which she thought was odd since she expected to be told first. Then she assumed she'd be maid of honor since her friend was maid of honor at her wedding. But the friend chose someone else. Then the author realized she's not in the wedding party at all. She's hurt but understands it's the friend's choice. Now she's thinking about not attending because she's not in the wedding party and doesn't want to be in a one-sided friendship anymore.\n\nSo, is she wrong to not attend? Well, attending a wedding is usually a personal choice. The author is hurt and feels slighted. Even though the friend might have the right to choose her wedding party, the author feels like the friend didn't value their friendship enough to include her. The author is considering not attending as a way to distance herself, which could be a valid emotional response. \n\nBut maybe there's an expectation to attend a close friend's wedding regardless. Weddings are important events, and sometimes people go to them even if they're not in the party. However, the author is also considering the cost and effort involved. She might feel that attending without being in the party would be awkward. Also, she mentions not wanting to stay in contact anymore, so maybe she's already distancing herself.\n\nOn the other hand, the friend might have valid reasons for not choosing the author for the wedding party. They mentioned drifting apart. The author is within her rights to choose not to attend if she's not comfortable. But society often expects people to attend friends' weddings unless there's a major reason. However, this is a personal decision, not a moral one. So maybe the author isn't in the wrong because she's honoring her feelings and the situation.\n\nBut some might argue that not attending because you're not in the wedding party is petty. However, the author is also not staying in contact, which suggests the friendship is already strained. So her decision to skip could be a way to end the friendship gracefully. \n\nIn terms of right or wrong, it's a bit subjective. The question is whether she's in the wrong. If she's making a choice based on her hurt feelings and wanting to prioritize other relationships, she's not necessarily wrong. It's a personal choice, and while some might criticize her, it's her life. So maybe the answer is B, not in the wrong.\n"
