I was surprised when I found out on Facebook because I thought this was something she would have told me first. I sent her a private message congratulating her and we spent some time talking about her wedding plans. I assumed I would be her maid of honor since two years ago she was the maid of honor in my wedding. \n\nA few weeks ago, I saw on Facebook that she asked another childhood best friend to be her maid of honor. I was hurt but understood that we have drifted apart the past few years. I still assumed I would be a bridesmaid. \n\nLast week I saw another Facebook post of her and everyone she asked to be in her wedding party. Two of the girls were people she hasn\u2019t been very close with lately. It has now become clear to me that I will not be in her wedding party. \n\nMy feelings are hurt but I understand that this is her day and she should have the people she wants standing up next to her. However, since I am not in the wedding party, WIBTA for not attending the wedding? She lives a few states away so I would need to buy a plane ticket, a hotel room, and request time off of work. This would not be a major hardship but it does not seem worth it to me since I am already embarrassed about not being in the wedding party. \n\nI am not interested in being in a one sided friendship. I would rather focus on friends who want to have me around. I do not plan on staying in contact with her after this. AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the question is in the wrong for not attending their friend's wedding because they weren't asked to be a bridesmaid. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The writer is a 15-year friend of the bride, but the bride didn't tell her about the wedding first. The writer assumed she would be the maid of honor since the bride was the maid of honor at her wedding two years ago. But the bride chose another childhood friend as the maid of honor, and now the writer isn't in the wedding party at all. The writer is hurt and considering not attending the wedding because she's not part of the party and doesn't want to be in a one-sided friendship anymore.\n\nSo, the main question is whether the writer is in the wrong for deciding not to attend. Let's break it down. \n\nWedding attendance usually isn't mandatory unless there's a specific expectation. The bride isn't obligated to include everyone in the wedding party; it's her choice who to invite. The writer was hurt but understood the situation. However, she's now deciding not to attend because she's not part of the wedding party. \n\nFrom a social standpoint, attending a friend's wedding is often seen as important, especially if you're close. But if the friendship has drifted, maybe it's not as necessary. The writer mentions that she's choosing to focus on friends who want her around. That's a common sentiment when friendships become one-sided. \n\nBut is she in the wrong? Well, the decision to attend a wedding is personal. The writer might feel it's not worth the effort if the friendship has changed. However, not attending could be seen as cutting off the friend entirely, especially after 15 years. But the writer says she doesn't plan to stay in contact either. \n\nI think the key points here are: the bride didn't include her in the wedding party, which was hurtful, and the writer is choosing to distance herself. Whether that's right or wrong depends on the circumstances. Since the writer isn't being vindictive and is just making a choice based on her feelings, I'd lean towards her not being in the wrong. The bride made a choice in her wedding party, and the writer is acting on her own feelings about the friendship. \n\nSo, the answer is probably B (No), the writer isn't in the wrong. She's making a personal decision based on her hurt feelings and the state of the friendship.\n"
