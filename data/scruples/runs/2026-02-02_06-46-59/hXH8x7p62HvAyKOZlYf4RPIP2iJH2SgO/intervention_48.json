I was surprised when I found out on Facebook because I thought this was something she would have told me first. I sent her a private message congratulating her and we spent some time talking about her wedding plans. I assumed I would be her maid of honor since two years ago she was the maid of honor in my wedding. \n\nA few weeks ago, I saw on Facebook that she asked another childhood best friend to be her maid of honor. I was hurt but understood that we have drifted apart the past few years. I still assumed I would be a bridesmaid. \n\nLast week I saw another Facebook post of her and everyone she asked to be in her wedding party. Two of the girls were people she hasn\u2019t been very close with lately. It has now become clear to me that I will not be in her wedding party. \n\nMy feelings are hurt but I understand that this is her day and she should have the people she wants standing up next to her. However, since I am not in the wedding party, WIBTA for not attending the wedding? She lives a few states away so I would need to buy a plane ticket, a hotel room, and request time off of work. This would not be a major hardship but it does not seem worth it to me since I am already embarrassed about not being in the wedding party. \n\nI am not interested in being in a one sided friendship. I would rather focus on friends who want to have me around. I do not plan on staying in contact with her after this. AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the situation is in the wrong. The scenario is about a long-time friend who didn't invite the author to her wedding, even though the author thought she might be a bridesmaid. The author is now considering not attending because they feel hurt and don't want to be in a one-sided friendship anymore.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The friend found out about the engagement through Facebook, which upset the author because she expected to be informed first. Then, the author assumed she would be the maid of honor since her friend was in her wedding. But the friend chose another childhood friend for that role. The author still thought she'd be a bridesmaid, but it turned out she wasn't in the wedding party at all. Now the author is thinking of not attending the wedding, which requires some effort (travel, time off) and is questioning if that's wrong.\n\nThe user initially thinks the author is in the wrong but is seeking confirmation. To determine that, I need to consider social norms, friendship dynamics, and expectations. \n\nFrom a social standpoint, attending a friend's wedding is typically considered important, even if you're not in the wedding party. Weddings are major life events, and showing up is a way to support the couple. However, the author feels hurt and embarrassed, and the friend didn't communicate well, which adds to the tension. The author is also considering cutting off contact, which might be a reaction to feeling neglected.\n\nBut is not attending the wedding wrong? If the author is hurt, maybe it's a valid emotional response. However, friendships can have ups and downs, and drifting apart might explain why the friend didn't include her in the wedding party. The author's decision to not attend could be seen as holding a grudge, but maybe it's a way to set boundaries.\n\nFactors to consider: The friend didn't inform the author initially, which is inconsiderate. The author did reach out and they talked, but the friend still didn't include her in the wedding party. The author's feelings are hurt, and she feels the friendship is one-sided. Her decision not to attend might be a consequence of those feelings. \n\nIn terms of responsibility, is the author wrong for not attending? Maybe not if the friendship has already deteriorated. However, if they were once close and the author is cutting off contact entirely, maybe attending the wedding could be a gesture of closure or support. Not attending could be seen as a choice to distance herself, which might be justified if the friendship is no longer mutual. \n\nBut the author is asking if she's in the wrong. The key is whether not attending is a justified response. Some people might argue that attending is customary regardless of being in the wedding party. Others might say that if the friendship has become one-sided, it's reasonable to prioritize self-respect and mental well-being. \n\nThe original user thinks the author is in the wrong, but I need to assess if that's accurate. If the author is choosing not to attend because of feeling slighted, that could be seen as holding a grudge. But if the friendship has already been drifting, maybe it's a way to move on. \n\nIn conclusion, the answer might depend on cultural norms and personal values. However, generally, attending a close friend's wedding is expected, even if you're not in the party. The author's decision might be hurtful to the friend, but if the friendship is already damaged, it's a complex situation. But the question is about being in the wrong. If the author is not in the wedding party, is it wrong to not attend? I think the answer is B (No), because the author is prioritizing her feelings and the existing issues in the friendship. It's not necessarily wrong to choose not to attend if the friendship isn't reciprocal.\n"
