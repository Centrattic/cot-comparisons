I was surprised when I found out on Facebook because I thought this was something she would have told me first. I sent her a private message congratulating her and we spent some time talking about her wedding plans. I assumed I would be her maid of honor since two years ago she was the maid of honor in my wedding. \n\nA few weeks ago, I saw on Facebook that she asked another childhood best friend to be her maid of honor. I was hurt but understood that we have drifted apart the past few years. I still assumed I would be a bridesmaid. \n\nLast week I saw another Facebook post of her and everyone she asked to be in her wedding party. Two of the girls were people she hasn\u2019t been very close with lately. It has now become clear to me that I will not be in her wedding party. \n\nMy feelings are hurt but I understand that this is her day and she should have the people she wants standing up next to her. However, since I am not in the wedding party, WIBTA for not attending the wedding? She lives a few states away so I would need to buy a plane ticket, a hotel room, and request time off of work. This would not be a major hardship but it does not seem worth it to me since I am already embarrassed about not being in the wedding party. \n\nI am not interested in being in a one sided friendship. I would rather focus on friends who want to have me around. I do not plan on staying in contact with her after this. AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about a long-time friend not inviting her to the wedding as a bridesmaid, and she's considering not attending because of that.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the dynamics. The friend in question is getting married, and they've been friends for over 15 years. The author was surprised when she found out about the wedding on Facebook, which might indicate some initial hurt because she expected to be told first. She also thought she'd be the maid of honor since her friend was the maid of honor at her wedding two years ago. But then, the friend chose someone else, and the author now isn't in the wedding party.\n\nThe author is now questioning if she should attend the wedding because she's not in the party. She's hurt and feels it's a one-sided friendship now, planning to cut contact after. The key question is whether she's in the wrong for not attending.\n\nI should consider social norms. Weddings are significant events, and friends usually attend even if they're not in the party. But if there's a falling out or a major hurt feeling, maybe it's understandable. However, not attending a friend's wedding can be seen as a big snub, even if you're not in the party. The author is making it about the hurt from not being invited as a bridesmaid, which is a personal issue.\n\nBut then again, the author might feel that her friendship isn't valued anymore. If they've drifted apart, maybe attending wouldn't help the relationship. The author is choosing to not attend and cut ties, which is her right, but is it wrong?\n\nThe AITA (Am I the Asshole) aspect hinges on whether her decision is justified. If someone isn't in the wedding party, is it expected to attend? Socially, yes, because it's a celebration of the couple. But if the friendship has deteriorated, maybe not. However, not attending might be hurtful to the friend, especially if they were close before. The author's reasoning is that she doesn't want to attend a one-sided friendship, so she's prioritizing her own feelings over maintaining the relationship.\n\nIn terms of right or wrong, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong. The hurt from exclusion is valid, and if the friendship has changed, attending might not be necessary. However, not attending could be seen as avoiding the situation rather than addressing it. But since the author has already decided not to attend and cut contact, maybe it's her prerogative.\n\nSo, considering the options, the answer would be B (No, the author is not in the wrong) because her feelings are valid, and she has the right to make her own decisions based on her perception of the friendship.\n"
