I was surprised when I found out on Facebook because I thought this was something she would have told me first. I sent her a private message congratulating her and we spent some time talking about her wedding plans. I assumed I would be her maid of honor since two years ago she was the maid of honor in my wedding. \n\nA few weeks ago, I saw on Facebook that she asked another childhood best friend to be her maid of honor. I was hurt but understood that we have drifted apart the past few years. I still assumed I would be a bridesmaid. \n\nLast week I saw another Facebook post of her and everyone she asked to be in her wedding party. Two of the girls were people she hasn\u2019t been very close with lately. It has now become clear to me that I will not be in her wedding party. \n\nMy feelings are hurt but I understand that this is her day and she should have the people she wants standing up next to her. However, since I am not in the wedding party, WIBTA for not attending the wedding? She lives a few states away so I would need to buy a plane ticket, a hotel room, and request time off of work. This would not be a major hardship but it does not seem worth it to me since I am already embarrassed about not being in the wedding party. \n\nI am not interested in being in a one sided friendship. I would rather focus on friends who want to have me around. I do not plan on staying in contact with her after this. AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. Let me start by reading through the situation carefully.\n\nThe author is a friend of 15 years who was surprised by their friend's engagement announcement on Facebook. They thought they would be the maid of honor since the friend was their maid of honor two years ago. But instead, the friend chose another childhood best friend for that role. The author felt hurt but understood that their friendship had drifted. However, when they saw the wedding party list, they realized they weren't part of it. Now, the author is considering not attending the wedding because they're not in the wedding party and think it's not worth the expense and effort, especially since they were embarrassed about being left out. They also mention not wanting a one-sided friendship anymore and planning to cut ties after this.\n\nThe user thinks the author is in the wrong but wants my opinion. Let me break it down.\n\nFirst, the author's main reasons for not attending are feeling slighted and not being part of the wedding party. They were friends for 15 years, so a wedding is a major life event. Not attending because they're not in the wedding party seems like a big decision. But is it justified?\n\nWeddings are typically for close friends and family, even if you're not part of the wedding party. The author might feel that their exclusion from the wedding party is a betrayal, but the friend might have chosen based on current relationships or circumstances. The author acknowledges that they have drifted apart, so maybe the friend's choice makes sense. However, the author is now deciding not to attend because of that, which could be seen as cutting off a long-term friend over a perceived slight.\n\nOn the other hand, attending a wedding is a personal choice. The author isn't obligated to go, especially if they feel hurt. But considering the friendship lasted 15 years, maybe the author is overreacting by not attending. Weddings are often about celebrating the couple, not about being in the wedding party. So, not attending because you're not a bridesmaid might be seen as self-centered, especially if the author values the friendship despite the drift.\n\nAlso, the author mentions planning to cut off contact after this. If they choose not to attend the wedding, it could be a final break, which might seem harsh. However, the author is making a point about wanting a mutual friendship. Maybe they feel the friendship has been one-sided for a while, and this is their way of standing up for themselves.\n\nBut the key question is whether not attending is the author being in the wrong. If the author were to attend, they might be showing respect for the friendship despite the hurt. Not attending could be seen as adding insult to injury, even if they have valid reasons. The friend might not have intended to hurt the author by not including them in the wedding party, especially if they drifted apart. The author's reaction might be more about their own feelings than the friend's intentions.\n\nIn some cases, attending a wedding even if you're not part of the wedding party is considered polite, especially for a long-time friend. The author's decision could be seen as petty, but it's also their choice. The user thinks the author is in the wrong, so maybe the answer is A. But I need to consider both sides.\n\nAnother angle: the author is not obligated to attend. They have a right to their feelings and can choose how to spend their time and money. If they feel the friendship isn't reciprocal, maybe not attending is a way of prioritizing their own well-being. However, the act of not attending might be hurtful to the friend, who might not realize the depth of the author's feelings. The author could have addressed the hurt feelings in the friendship before deciding, but instead, they're cutting off contact and not attending.\n\nSo, the author might be in the wrong if the decision not to attend is based on the friend's choice rather than a mutual discussion. But if the friendship was already strained, maybe it's understandable. The answer hinges on whether the author's decision is reasonable given the context. If the author was the maid of honor at the friend's wedding, they might expect a reciprocal role, but that's not a guarantee. The friend might have different reasons for choosing someone else. \n\nIn conclusion, the author's decision not to attend because they weren't in the wedding party could be seen as self-centered, even if they were hurt. Weddings are about the couple, and attending is a way to support the friend despite not being part of the wedding party. Therefore, the author might be in the wrong for not attending over this.\n"
