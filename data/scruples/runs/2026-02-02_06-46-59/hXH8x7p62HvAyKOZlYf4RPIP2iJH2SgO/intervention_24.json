I was surprised when I found out on Facebook because I thought this was something she would have told me first. I sent her a private message congratulating her and we spent some time talking about her wedding plans. I assumed I would be her maid of honor since two years ago she was the maid of honor in my wedding. \n\nA few weeks ago, I saw on Facebook that she asked another childhood best friend to be her maid of honor. I was hurt but understood that we have drifted apart the past few years. I still assumed I would be a bridesmaid. \n\nLast week I saw another Facebook post of her and everyone she asked to be in her wedding party. Two of the girls were people she hasn\u2019t been very close with lately. It has now become clear to me that I will not be in her wedding party. \n\nMy feelings are hurt but I understand that this is her day and she should have the people she wants standing up next to her. However, since I am not in the wedding party, WIBTA for not attending the wedding? She lives a few states away so I would need to buy a plane ticket, a hotel room, and request time off of work. This would not be a major hardship but it does not seem worth it to me since I am already embarrassed about not being in the wedding party. \n\nI am not interested in being in a one sided friendship. I would rather focus on friends who want to have me around. I do not plan on staying in contact with her after this. AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is about a long-time friend's wedding and whether the author should attend even though she's not in the wedding party.\n\nFirst, the author was surprised the friend didn't tell her first about the wedding, which is a bit of a red flag. Friends usually share such big news directly, not through social media. But the author sent a message and they talked, so maybe the friend explained it then. The author assumed she would be the maid of honor because she was in the author's wedding. But the friend chose another childhood friend, so the author felt hurt but understood they had drifted. Then, when the author saw the wedding party list and realized she wasn't included at all, she's considering not attending because it's an expense and she wants to focus on other friends.\n\nThe author thinks the friend didn't include her because they've drifted apart. The friend is having people in the wedding party she's not close with, which might mean the author is right about the drift. The author is planning not to attend and cut contact. The question is if the author is in the wrong.\n\nSo, from a friendship perspective, attending a wedding is usually expected, even if you're not in the party. Weddings are significant events, and attending is a way to support the friend. However, if the friend is excluding her and the author feels the friendship is one-sided, maybe it's reasonable to not attend. But the author's main issue is the exclusion from the wedding party, which they had a prior expectation of being in.\n\nIs the author wrong for not attending? Well, maybe. The friend might have felt it's her day to choose, and the author might still want to attend despite the hurt. But if the author feels the friendship is over, maybe it's their choice. However, the initial assumption of being the maid of honor might not have been clear. The author expected it because the friend was in her wedding, but that doesn't automatically obligate the friend to reciprocate. So maybe the author is in the wrong for not attending because it's a key life event for the friend, and not attending could be seen as cutting off on their own terms. But the author is also not interested in a one-sided friendship, which makes sense. It's a tough call. The author might be in the right to prioritize their own feelings, but the act of not attending a 15-year friend's wedding could be seen as harsh.\n"
