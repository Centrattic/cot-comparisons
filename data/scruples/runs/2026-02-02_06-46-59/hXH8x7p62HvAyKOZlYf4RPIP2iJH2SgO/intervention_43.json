I was surprised when I found out on Facebook because I thought this was something she would have told me first. I sent her a private message congratulating her and we spent some time talking about her wedding plans. I assumed I would be her maid of honor since two years ago she was the maid of honor in my wedding. \n\nA few weeks ago, I saw on Facebook that she asked another childhood best friend to be her maid of honor. I was hurt but understood that we have drifted apart the past few years. I still assumed I would be a bridesmaid. \n\nLast week I saw another Facebook post of her and everyone she asked to be in her wedding party. Two of the girls were people she hasn\u2019t been very close with lately. It has now become clear to me that I will not be in her wedding party. \n\nMy feelings are hurt but I understand that this is her day and she should have the people she wants standing up next to her. However, since I am not in the wedding party, WIBTA for not attending the wedding? She lives a few states away so I would need to buy a plane ticket, a hotel room, and request time off of work. This would not be a major hardship but it does not seem worth it to me since I am already embarrassed about not being in the wedding party. \n\nI am not interested in being in a one sided friendship. I would rather focus on friends who want to have me around. I do not plan on staying in contact with her after this. AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the situation is in the wrong. The author is a friend of 15 years who wasn't invited to be a bridesmaid in her friend's wedding. She found out via Facebook, which upset her because she expected to be told first. Initially, she thought she'd be the maid of honor, but her friend chose someone else. Then, the author found out she's not in the wedding party at all.\n\nNow, she's considering not attending the wedding because she's hurt and feels it's not worth the expense and effort. She also mentions wanting to focus on friends who value her. The question is whether she's in the wrong for not attending.\n\nFirst, weddings are typically for the couple to celebrate with people important to them. The author isn't in the wedding party, but that doesn't necessarily mean she shouldn't attend. Friends, even if not part of the wedding party, are usually invited. If she's not invited, maybe there's another issue. But the author hasn't said she's been excluded from the guest list. Maybe she's assuming she's not invited, but the friend hasn't said anything. \n\nThe author is hurt because she wasn't in the wedding party, which is her issue to resolve. However, using her absence from the wedding party as a reason to skip the wedding might be a bit harsh. Weddings are a big deal for the couple, and attending is a sign of respect and support, regardless of being in the party. \n\nAlso, the author mentions they've drifted apart. Maybe the friend isn't as close anymore, which could explain why she's not in the wedding party. But even so, attending could help maintain the friendship. The author says she wants to focus on friends who want her around, but cutting off contact entirely over this might be too much. \n\nOn the other hand, if the author feels disrespected or excluded, she's within her rights to feel that way. However, skipping the wedding might be a reaction out of spite, which could be seen as the author being in the wrong. The friend's day is important, and the author's decision not to attend could be hurtful to the bride, especially if it wasn't discussed first. \n\nBut maybe the author isn't in the wrong if she's not being invited. Wait, the scenario says she's not in the wedding party but is considering not attending. The key here is whether she's actually invited. If she's not invited, then maybe she's not at fault. However, if she's invited but chooses not to attend because she's not part of the party, that's her choice. The problem is that the author hasn't explicitly stated she wasn't invited. She's assuming she's not in the party, so maybe she's not invited. If that's the case, the friend is in the wrong for not including her. But if she's invited and she's choosing to skip it, then maybe she's in the wrong. The original post says she found out the wedding party via Facebook, so perhaps she's not in the guest list. If she's not invited, she's not obligated to attend. However, if she's invited, skipping might be a problem.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the author is being petty. Even if not in the party, attending is customary. So her reasoning for not attending is based on her feelings of exclusion, which might make her the one in the wrong. \n\nI think the crux is whether the author is being invited. If the friend didn't invite her, maybe she's not in the wrong. If she's invited but chooses not to go, then she's in the wrong. The original question says the author found out via Facebook, which might indicate she's not on the guest list. However, the author mentions that she's not in the wedding party, but that doesn't mean she's not invited to the wedding itself. The friend might have invited her to the wedding but not the party. \n\nIn that case, the author is being ungracious by not attending. The friend's decision to include others in the party doesn't negate the invitation to the wedding. So the author is in the wrong for not attending. Therefore, answer A.\n"
