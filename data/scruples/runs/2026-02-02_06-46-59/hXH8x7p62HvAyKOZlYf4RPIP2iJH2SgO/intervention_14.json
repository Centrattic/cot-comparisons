I was surprised when I found out on Facebook because I thought this was something she would have told me first. I sent her a private message congratulating her and we spent some time talking about her wedding plans. I assumed I would be her maid of honor since two years ago she was the maid of honor in my wedding. \n\nA few weeks ago, I saw on Facebook that she asked another childhood best friend to be her maid of honor. I was hurt but understood that we have drifted apart the past few years. I still assumed I would be a bridesmaid. \n\nLast week I saw another Facebook post of her and everyone she asked to be in her wedding party. Two of the girls were people she hasn\u2019t been very close with lately. It has now become clear to me that I will not be in her wedding party. \n\nMy feelings are hurt but I understand that this is her day and she should have the people she wants standing up next to her. However, since I am not in the wedding party, WIBTA for not attending the wedding? She lives a few states away so I would need to buy a plane ticket, a hotel room, and request time off of work. This would not be a major hardship but it does not seem worth it to me since I am already embarrassed about not being in the wedding party. \n\nI am not interested in being in a one sided friendship. I would rather focus on friends who want to have me around. I do not plan on staying in contact with her after this. AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The person is asking if they're at fault for not wanting to attend their friend's wedding because they weren't asked to be a bridesmaid. Hmm.\n\nFirst, the friend found out about the wedding through Facebook, which might have been a red flag. The author thought they would be the maid of honor since the friend was their maid of honor two years ago. But when they saw the other friend chosen, they felt hurt. Then they realized they weren't in the wedding party at all. \n\nThe author is considering not attending because they're upset and don't want to be part of a one-sided friendship anymore. They mentioned it's not a huge hardship but don't think it's worth it. They also plan to cut off contact after this.\n\nSo, the main question is whether the author is in the wrong. Well, attending a wedding isn't a requirement. People have their reasons for attending or not. The author is hurt because they weren't asked to be in the wedding party, which is valid. But is it wrong to not attend? \n\nThe friend might expect them to come, but the author has valid reasons. They feel unappreciated and want to focus on other friends. On the other hand, the author could be overreacting. Maybe the friend just wanted to include others they've been closer to recently. \n\nBut the author's reasoning is based on their feelings of being overlooked. They're not attending because of hurt feelings, not out of spite. It's their choice to not attend if they feel it's not worth the emotional toll. Also, the author plans to end the friendship, which is their decision. \n\nI think the author isn't in the wrong. They have the right to make choices about their time and friendships based on mutual respect. So, answer B.\n"
