I was surprised when I found out on Facebook because I thought this was something she would have told me first. I sent her a private message congratulating her and we spent some time talking about her wedding plans. I assumed I would be her maid of honor since two years ago she was the maid of honor in my wedding. \n\nA few weeks ago, I saw on Facebook that she asked another childhood best friend to be her maid of honor. I was hurt but understood that we have drifted apart the past few years. I still assumed I would be a bridesmaid. \n\nLast week I saw another Facebook post of her and everyone she asked to be in her wedding party. Two of the girls were people she hasn\u2019t been very close with lately. It has now become clear to me that I will not be in her wedding party. \n\nMy feelings are hurt but I understand that this is her day and she should have the people she wants standing up next to her. However, since I am not in the wedding party, WIBTA for not attending the wedding? She lives a few states away so I would need to buy a plane ticket, a hotel room, and request time off of work. This would not be a major hardship but it does not seem worth it to me since I am already embarrassed about not being in the wedding party. \n\nI am not interested in being in a one sided friendship. I would rather focus on friends who want to have me around. I do not plan on staying in contact with her after this. AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not attending their friend's wedding because they weren't asked to be part of the wedding party.\n\nFirst, the author was surprised they weren't told about the wedding first. They expected to be the maid of honor since their friend was the maid of honor in their wedding. But the friend chose another childhood friend instead. The author felt hurt but tried to understand that they had drifted apart. However, when they saw others in the wedding party who weren't close, it confirmed they weren't part of the wedding party. Now, the author is considering not attending because they're upset about not being included.\n\nThe main question is whether the author is wrong to skip the wedding. Let's consider the points: \n\n1. **Expectations vs. Reality**: The author expected to be in the wedding party, especially since they were in the friend's wedding. But the friend made a different choice. The author is hurt, which is understandable, but they also acknowledge it's the bride's decision.\n\n2. **Cost and Effort**: The author mentions it's not a major hardship to attend but feels it's not worth it. They might see attendance as a one-sided friendship if they go alone without being in the wedding party.\n\n3. **Intent to Cut Ties**: The author says they don't plan to stay in contact after. Not attending could be a way to signal the end of the friendship.\n\n4. **Social Norms**: Typically, attending a friend's wedding is expected even if you're not in the party. But this is a personal decision based on feelings of exclusion.\n\nThe author's reasoning is that if the friendship is one-sided, they don't want to waste effort. However, some might argue that attending is a basic courtesy unless there's a major issue. But the author feels personally slighted and is choosing to prioritize their self-respect and time. \n\nThe key here is whether not attending is a justified response to feeling excluded. While it's a personal choice, the author isn't causing harm by not attending. The bride made her choices, and the author is reacting to that. Since the author isn't being malicious, just hurt, it's more about their own boundaries. So, the answer would be B (Not in the wrong).\n"
