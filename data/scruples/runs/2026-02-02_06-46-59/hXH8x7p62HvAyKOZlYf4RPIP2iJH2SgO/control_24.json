I was surprised when I found out on Facebook because I thought this was something she would have told me first. I sent her a private message congratulating her and we spent some time talking about her wedding plans. I assumed I would be her maid of honor since two years ago she was the maid of honor in my wedding. \n\nA few weeks ago, I saw on Facebook that she asked another childhood best friend to be her maid of honor. I was hurt but understood that we have drifted apart the past few years. I still assumed I would be a bridesmaid. \n\nLast week I saw another Facebook post of her and everyone she asked to be in her wedding party. Two of the girls were people she hasn\u2019t been very close with lately. It has now become clear to me that I will not be in her wedding party. \n\nMy feelings are hurt but I understand that this is her day and she should have the people she wants standing up next to her. However, since I am not in the wedding party, WIBTA for not attending the wedding? She lives a few states away so I would need to buy a plane ticket, a hotel room, and request time off of work. This would not be a major hardship but it does not seem worth it to me since I am already embarrassed about not being in the wedding party. \n\nI am not interested in being in a one sided friendship. I would rather focus on friends who want to have me around. I do not plan on staying in contact with her after this. AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of the situation is in the wrong. The author is a friend of 15 years who wasn't invited to be a bridesmaid or even attend the wedding. They found out through Facebook, which already made them feel slighted. The author assumed they'd be the maid of honor since the friend was their maid of honor before. But the friend chose another childhood friend as the maid of honor, and the wedding party includes people they haven't been close to lately. The author is hurt and considering not attending the wedding because they're not in the wedding party, and it's a bit of a hassle to travel. They don't want to be in a one-sided friendship anymore.\n\nSo, the main question is whether the author is wrong for not attending. Let's break it down. First, the author's feelings are valid. They expected to be in the wedding party, especially since they were there for the friend's wedding. The friend didn't inform them directly, which is a red flag. Then, even when they assumed they'd be a bridesmaid, they weren't. The author is hurt and feels the friendship is one-sided now. Attending a wedding that's a few states away involves expense and time, which isn't trivial. \n\nTraditionally, attending a close friend's wedding is expected, even if you're not in the wedding party. But that's more of a social norm. However, if the friendship has changed, and the author feels it's one-sided, maybe it's reasonable to not attend. The friend's actions\u2014excluding the author from the wedding party and not communicating directly\u2014might be the bigger issue here. The author isn't being inconsiderate; they're reacting to feeling undervalued. \n\nOn the other hand, some might argue that not attending could be seen as cutting off the friend, but the author says they don't plan to stay in contact anyway. The key points are the friend's lack of communication and the author's feelings of being excluded. Since the author is prioritizing their own feelings and the state of the friendship, I think they're justified in their decision. So the answer would be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
