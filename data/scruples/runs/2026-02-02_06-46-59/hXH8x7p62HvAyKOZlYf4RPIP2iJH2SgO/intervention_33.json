I was surprised when I found out on Facebook because I thought this was something she would have told me first. I sent her a private message congratulating her and we spent some time talking about her wedding plans. I assumed I would be her maid of honor since two years ago she was the maid of honor in my wedding. \n\nA few weeks ago, I saw on Facebook that she asked another childhood best friend to be her maid of honor. I was hurt but understood that we have drifted apart the past few years. I still assumed I would be a bridesmaid. \n\nLast week I saw another Facebook post of her and everyone she asked to be in her wedding party. Two of the girls were people she hasn\u2019t been very close with lately. It has now become clear to me that I will not be in her wedding party. \n\nMy feelings are hurt but I understand that this is her day and she should have the people she wants standing up next to her. However, since I am not in the wedding party, WIBTA for not attending the wedding? She lives a few states away so I would need to buy a plane ticket, a hotel room, and request time off of work. This would not be a major hardship but it does not seem worth it to me since I am already embarrassed about not being in the wedding party. \n\nI am not interested in being in a one sided friendship. I would rather focus on friends who want to have me around. I do not plan on staying in contact with her after this. AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that the author has a 15-year friendship with this friend. The friend got engaged, and the author found out on Facebook instead of being told first. The author assumed they'd be the maid of honor since the friend was the maid of honor in their wedding two years ago. But the friend chose another childhood best friend instead. The author is hurt but tried to understand that they've drifted apart. Now, the author is considering not attending the wedding because they're not in the wedding party, and they don't want to be in a one-sided friendship anymore.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the expectations in friendships and weddings. The author felt entitled to be in the wedding party, maybe because of their past roles. But the friend might have valid reasons for choosing someone closer currently. The author is upset about not being told first, which is understandable. However, the key question is whether it's acceptable to skip the wedding because they weren't chosen as a bridesmaid.\n\nIn many cultures, attending a friend's wedding is considered important regardless of your role in the wedding party. Even if you're not part of the bridal party, showing up is a sign of support. The author is using not being in the bridal party as a reason not to attend, which could be seen as holding a grudge. The argument here is whether the author is overreacting or holding onto a grudge that's not justified. \n\nThe author mentions that attending would require some effort (travel, time off), but it's manageable. They also say they don't plan to stay in contact after the wedding, which suggests they might be ending the friendship over this. If the friendship has already been drifting, maybe they're using this as an excuse. \n\nThe friend might not have thought the author would be hurt, especially if the friendship has cooled down. But the author's decision not to attend could be hurtful to the friend, making them feel that their friend is punishing them for not including her in the bridal party. \n\nOn the other hand, the author has feelings and might feel slighted. They might believe that their absence is a way to communicate that they don't value a one-sided relationship. But friendships can be complex. Even if the friendship has drifted, attending a major life event is usually expected unless there's a serious reason not to. \n\nIs the author in the wrong? It depends on perspective. If the author feels that attending would be pretending everything is fine when they're hurt, maybe they have a point. But generally, attending a friend's wedding is seen as important even if you're not in the bridal party. So, the author's choice not to attend could be seen as being in the wrong because it's a significant event where support is expected, regardless of the role. Alternatively, if the friendship has deteriorated, maybe the author is justified in ending it, but not attending the wedding might be a harsh reaction. \n\nHmm. So, the key factors are: the author's expectation to be included, the friend's choice, the author's decision to skip the wedding as a result. The author might be in the wrong because they're using the wedding attendance as a way to express hurt feelings, which could be seen as holding a grudge. The friend might not have intended to exclude the author from the friendship entirely, just the bridal party. So, the answer might be A (in the wrong) because not attending the wedding is an extreme response that could hurt the friend further.\n"
