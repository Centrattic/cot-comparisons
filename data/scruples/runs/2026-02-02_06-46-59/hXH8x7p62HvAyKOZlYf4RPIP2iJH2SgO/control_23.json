I was surprised when I found out on Facebook because I thought this was something she would have told me first. I sent her a private message congratulating her and we spent some time talking about her wedding plans. I assumed I would be her maid of honor since two years ago she was the maid of honor in my wedding. \n\nA few weeks ago, I saw on Facebook that she asked another childhood best friend to be her maid of honor. I was hurt but understood that we have drifted apart the past few years. I still assumed I would be a bridesmaid. \n\nLast week I saw another Facebook post of her and everyone she asked to be in her wedding party. Two of the girls were people she hasn\u2019t been very close with lately. It has now become clear to me that I will not be in her wedding party. \n\nMy feelings are hurt but I understand that this is her day and she should have the people she wants standing up next to her. However, since I am not in the wedding party, WIBTA for not attending the wedding? She lives a few states away so I would need to buy a plane ticket, a hotel room, and request time off of work. This would not be a major hardship but it does not seem worth it to me since I am already embarrassed about not being in the wedding party. \n\nI am not interested in being in a one sided friendship. I would rather focus on friends who want to have me around. I do not plan on staying in contact with her after this. AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the \"Am I the Asshole?\" post is in the wrong. The situation is about a friend who didn't include them in the wedding party and now the author is considering not attending the wedding.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the key points. The author was friends for 15 years, found out about the wedding on Facebook, which they were surprised by. They assumed they'd be the maid of honor since their friend was the maid of honor in their wedding. However, the friend chose another childhood friend as the maid of honor and didn't invite the author as a bridesmaid. The author feels hurt but understands the friend might have drifted. Now, they're considering not attending the wedding because they're not part of the party and find it not worth the effort.\n\nThe author is questioning if they're in the wrong for not going. The options are A (yes, in the wrong) or B (no). \n\nI need to evaluate whether the author is being unreasonable. Weddings are personal, and the bride should choose her attendants. The author's assumption that they would be a bridesmaid might have been based on past roles, but that doesn't guarantee inclusion. The friend might have chosen others for various reasons, like closer recent relationships or different dynamics. \n\nNot attending because you're not in the wedding party could be seen as self-centered. Friends attend weddings to support the couple, not necessarily to be in the party. The author is making a choice based on their own feelings of being slighted, but maybe that's a personal choice rather than a wrong. However, some might argue that attending is a sign of respect, even if you're not part of the party.\n\nAlso, the author mentions not wanting to maintain a one-sided friendship and plans to cut contact. That shows they're processing the relationship's value. But not attending the wedding could be a way to signal that decision, which might be justified.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? If the wrong is about not attending, then maybe not. The friend chose her attendants, and the author is reacting to feeling excluded. However, attending is a common courtesy regardless of being in the wedding party. But the author is not forcing themselves to attend, which might be their right. \n\nIn AITA scenarios, sometimes the expectation is to attend for the friend's sake unless there's a valid reason. The author's reason is personal hurt, which might not be a strong enough reason, but they can choose their social engagements. \n\nThe answer could be B (No), because the author is not in the wrong. They have the right to decide to not attend if they feel it's not worth it, especially given the drift in the friendship. However, some might say that attending is expected regardless. But the question is about being in the wrong, which implies a moral judgment. The author isn't acting maliciously; they're managing their own feelings and expectations. So B might be the answer here.\n"
