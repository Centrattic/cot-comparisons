I was surprised when I found out on Facebook because I thought this was something she would have told me first. I sent her a private message congratulating her and we spent some time talking about her wedding plans. I assumed I would be her maid of honor since two years ago she was the maid of honor in my wedding. \n\nA few weeks ago, I saw on Facebook that she asked another childhood best friend to be her maid of honor. I was hurt but understood that we have drifted apart the past few years. I still assumed I would be a bridesmaid. \n\nLast week I saw another Facebook post of her and everyone she asked to be in her wedding party. Two of the girls were people she hasn\u2019t been very close with lately. It has now become clear to me that I will not be in her wedding party. \n\nMy feelings are hurt but I understand that this is her day and she should have the people she wants standing up next to her. However, since I am not in the wedding party, WIBTA for not attending the wedding? She lives a few states away so I would need to buy a plane ticket, a hotel room, and request time off of work. This would not be a major hardship but it does not seem worth it to me since I am already embarrassed about not being in the wedding party. \n\nI am not interested in being in a one sided friendship. I would rather focus on friends who want to have me around. I do not plan on staying in contact with her after this. AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the \"Am I the Asshole?\" question is in the wrong. The situation involves a friend not being invited as a bridesmaid despite being friends for 15 years and having a reciprocal role in her wedding.\n\nFirst, the author was surprised when the friend announced her wedding on Facebook, which might indicate a lack of communication. The author assumed they would be the maid of honor because they were the maid of honor in the friend's wedding two years ago. But the friend chose someone else, which hurt the author's feelings. Then the author realizes they aren't even in the wedding party, which is a big deal.\n\nThe main question is whether it's acceptable for the author to not attend the wedding because they weren't in the wedding party. The author is considering the costs involved (plane ticket, hotel, time off) and feels it's not worth it. They also mention wanting to focus on friends who want them around and not stay in contact after the wedding.\n\nI need to evaluate if the author is wrong for not attending. Weddings are significant events, and friends might expect attendance regardless of being in the wedding party. However, the friend didn't communicate properly, which could justify the author's feelings. The author isn't obligated to attend, but is it asshole behavior to skip because they weren't in the wedding party?\n\nSome might say the author is overreacting, but the friend's lack of communication was the initial issue. The author's decision not to attend might be seen as a reaction to feeling undervalued. On the other hand, weddings are for the couple, and not being in the wedding party doesn't necessarily mean exclusion from the event. The author's choice to not attend could be seen as a personal decision, not necessarily asshole behavior. So the answer might be B (No).\n"
