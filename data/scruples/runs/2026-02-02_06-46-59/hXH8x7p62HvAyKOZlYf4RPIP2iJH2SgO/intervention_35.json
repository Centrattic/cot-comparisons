I was surprised when I found out on Facebook because I thought this was something she would have told me first. I sent her a private message congratulating her and we spent some time talking about her wedding plans. I assumed I would be her maid of honor since two years ago she was the maid of honor in my wedding. \n\nA few weeks ago, I saw on Facebook that she asked another childhood best friend to be her maid of honor. I was hurt but understood that we have drifted apart the past few years. I still assumed I would be a bridesmaid. \n\nLast week I saw another Facebook post of her and everyone she asked to be in her wedding party. Two of the girls were people she hasn\u2019t been very close with lately. It has now become clear to me that I will not be in her wedding party. \n\nMy feelings are hurt but I understand that this is her day and she should have the people she wants standing up next to her. However, since I am not in the wedding party, WIBTA for not attending the wedding? She lives a few states away so I would need to buy a plane ticket, a hotel room, and request time off of work. This would not be a major hardship but it does not seem worth it to me since I am already embarrassed about not being in the wedding party. \n\nI am not interested in being in a one sided friendship. I would rather focus on friends who want to have me around. I do not plan on staying in contact with her after this. AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong. The situation is about a long-time friend's wedding where the writer wasn't invited to be a bridesmaid or maid of honor. They found out through Facebook, which they thought was odd since they expected to be told first. They were hurt but then realized they weren't in the wedding party at all. Now they're considering not attending the wedding because they feel it's not worth the expense and effort, given their hurt feelings and the drifting apart.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze the key points. The writer was a maid of honor at their friend's wedding two years ago. The friend didn't inform them about the wedding plans until the writer found out on Facebook. Then, the friend chose another childhood friend as the maid of honor. The writer is now considering not attending because they aren't in the wedding party and feel it's a one-sided friendship now.\n\nThe main question is whether the writer is in the wrong for not attending. The user initially thought the author is in the wrong, but I need to evaluate both sides.\n\nOn one hand, attending a wedding is often seen as a social obligation, especially when it's a long-time friend. Even if you're not part of the wedding party, showing up is a sign of respect and support. The writer might feel hurt, but cutting off contact entirely might be too harsh. They could attend for the sake of the friendship and then decide later if they want to continue the relationship.\n\nOn the other hand, the friend's actions were hurtful. Not informing the writer first and excluding them from the wedding party might have been a mistake. The writer has reasons to feel upset. Attending a wedding can be expensive and time-consuming, so it's understandable they might feel it's not worth it. However, the writer is choosing to end the friendship, which could be a strong reaction. Maybe there's a middle ground, like attending but not staying in contact afterward.\n\nBut the writer is asking if they're in the wrong. In terms of social norms, attending a friend's wedding is typically expected unless there are extenuating circumstances. The writer's decision not to attend could be seen as cutting ties, which might be justified if the friendship has deteriorated. However, the writer might be overreacting by not attending at all. They could attend to show support and then decide not to maintain the friendship post-wedding.\n\nSo, is the writer in the wrong? If the expectation is that you attend a friend's wedding regardless of being in the party, then not attending might be seen as inconsiderate. But if the friendship is already strained, maybe the writer isn't in the wrong. The key here is whether the writer's feelings are valid. They have a right to be hurt, but their response (not attending) might be too extreme. Maybe they should attend to maintain some level of respect, even if they don't continue the friendship. Alternatively, if they feel it's a one-sided relationship, their choice to prioritize other friends might be justified.\n\nHmm. The answer could go either way. The user thinks the author is in the wrong, but I need to consider if the writer's reasons are valid. The writer's decision not to attend is based on feeling undervalued in the friendship. If the friend didn't include them in the wedding party, maybe the writer isn't making a mistake by not attending. However, attending could be a gesture that allows the writer to move on gracefully without burning bridges.\n\nIn many cultures, attending a friend's wedding is expected, especially if it's a long-term friend. So, maybe the writer is in the wrong because they're choosing to not attend, which is seen as a significant snub. But if the friendship has already become one-sided, the writer's decision might be justified. It's a bit of a nuanced situation.\n\nI think the answer is B (the author is not in the wrong) because they are prioritizing their own feelings and recognizing a shift in the friendship. However, some might argue that attending is expected regardless. But given the context of the friend's actions (finding out through Facebook, not being in the wedding party), the writer's decision is understandable. So, the answer is B.\n"
