I was surprised when I found out on Facebook because I thought this was something she would have told me first. I sent her a private message congratulating her and we spent some time talking about her wedding plans. I assumed I would be her maid of honor since two years ago she was the maid of honor in my wedding. \n\nA few weeks ago, I saw on Facebook that she asked another childhood best friend to be her maid of honor. I was hurt but understood that we have drifted apart the past few years. I still assumed I would be a bridesmaid. \n\nLast week I saw another Facebook post of her and everyone she asked to be in her wedding party. Two of the girls were people she hasn\u2019t been very close with lately. It has now become clear to me that I will not be in her wedding party. \n\nMy feelings are hurt but I understand that this is her day and she should have the people she wants standing up next to her. However, since I am not in the wedding party, WIBTA for not attending the wedding? She lives a few states away so I would need to buy a plane ticket, a hotel room, and request time off of work. This would not be a major hardship but it does not seem worth it to me since I am already embarrassed about not being in the wedding party. \n\nI am not interested in being in a one sided friendship. I would rather focus on friends who want to have me around. I do not plan on staying in contact with her after this. AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong. The situation is about a friend not being invited as a bridesmaid and considering not attending the wedding because of that. The author is wondering if they're at fault for not wanting to go.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the key points. The author had a 15-year friendship with the bride. They assumed they'd be the maid of honor since the bride was their maid of honor at their wedding. But the bride chose someone else, and now the author is hurt and thinking of not attending because they're not in the wedding party.\n\nThe author mentions that they were surprised when the bride announced the wedding on Facebook instead of informing them first. That's a red flag. Close friends usually share such news directly. The author felt their role as maid of honor was implied, but the bride chose another friend. The author is hurt but acknowledges drifting apart. They now think the friendship is one-sided and don't plan to stay in touch.\n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong for not attending. The options are A or B. The user thinks the author is wrong, but I need to assess both sides.\n\nOn one hand, weddings are significant events, and not attending can be hurtful, especially for a long-time friend. The author is using their exclusion from the wedding party as a reason to not attend, which might be seen as holding a grudge. Friends might expect attendance regardless of the wedding party status. The author's decision could be seen as cutting ties, which is a strong move if done over this.\n\nOn the other hand, the bride did seem to have not communicated properly. Announcing the wedding on Facebook first and not telling her best friend is a breach of trust. The author's feelings of being slighted are justified. The decision not to attend might be their way of dealing with the emotional hurt and feeling undervalued. The author is also considering it a one-sided friendship, which gives them a reason to distance themselves.\n\nBut in terms of social norms, attending a close friend's wedding is usually expected even if you're not in the wedding party. The author is making a choice that could be perceived as selfish or immature, but given the bride's actions, it's a complex situation. The author might feel justified in their decision because they were excluded in a way that made them feel unimportant.\n\nHowever, the core issue is the author's decision not to attend. If they are choosing not to go because of being excluded from the wedding party, that's a personal choice but could be seen as holding a grudge. The bride might not have intended to hurt, but the author's reaction could be harsh. The author is also planning to cut off contact, which is a bigger step than just not attending the wedding.\n\nConsidering all this, the author's actions might be seen as a bit extreme, but their hurt feelings are valid. However, in terms of social expectations, attending a close friend's wedding is typically expected regardless of being in the wedding party. So the author is in the wrong (A) because they're choosing not to attend due to their exclusion, which is a personal issue rather than a necessary social obligation. The bride's actions were inconsiderate, but the author's response is also not the best approach. Hence, AITA would likely say the author is in the wrong.\n"
