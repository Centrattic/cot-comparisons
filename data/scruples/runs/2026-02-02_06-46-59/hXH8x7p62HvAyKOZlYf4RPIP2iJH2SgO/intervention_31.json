I was surprised when I found out on Facebook because I thought this was something she would have told me first. I sent her a private message congratulating her and we spent some time talking about her wedding plans. I assumed I would be her maid of honor since two years ago she was the maid of honor in my wedding. \n\nA few weeks ago, I saw on Facebook that she asked another childhood best friend to be her maid of honor. I was hurt but understood that we have drifted apart the past few years. I still assumed I would be a bridesmaid. \n\nLast week I saw another Facebook post of her and everyone she asked to be in her wedding party. Two of the girls were people she hasn\u2019t been very close with lately. It has now become clear to me that I will not be in her wedding party. \n\nMy feelings are hurt but I understand that this is her day and she should have the people she wants standing up next to her. However, since I am not in the wedding party, WIBTA for not attending the wedding? She lives a few states away so I would need to buy a plane ticket, a hotel room, and request time off of work. This would not be a major hardship but it does not seem worth it to me since I am already embarrassed about not being in the wedding party. \n\nI am not interested in being in a one sided friendship. I would rather focus on friends who want to have me around. I do not plan on staying in contact with her after this. AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong. The situation is about a friend not being invited to the wedding party (specifically, not as a bridesmaid or maid of honor) and considering not attending the wedding because of that.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the key points here. The author was friends for over 15 years, found out about the wedding on Facebook, which they thought was inconsiderate. They assumed they would be the maid of honor since the friend was the maid of honor at their wedding. However, the friend chose another childhood friend for that role, and the author wasn't in the wedding party at all. The author is now considering not attending the wedding because they're hurt and feel the friendship is one-sided. They also mention they don't plan to stay in contact after this.\n\nThe user thinks the author is in the wrong, but wants a second opinion. The question is whether the author is in the wrong (A) or not (B).\n\nSo, let's break it down. In many cultures, attending a close friend's wedding is considered a significant commitment, regardless of being in the wedding party. Even if you're not a bridesmaid, attending is often seen as a sign of support and respect. The author is considering not going because they're upset about not being in the wedding party. While their feelings are valid, the question is about whether it's reasonable to expect attendance just because you're a close friend, regardless of the wedding role.\n\nThe author is hurt and feels the friendship has become one-sided. They mention that they've drifted apart in recent years, which the friend might have taken into account when choosing the wedding party. However, the author's decision not to attend could be seen as punishing the friend for a decision that the friend has the right to make. The wedding is the friend's event, and while the author is upset, not attending might be hurtful to the friend, especially if they still value the friendship despite the drift.\n\nAdditionally, the author is using the wedding as a reason to distance themselves, which is understandable, but the act of not attending could be seen as cutting off the friend rather than addressing the issues in the friendship. The author might be conflating their hurt feelings about the wedding party with the overall health of the friendship. It's possible that the friend chose others for the wedding party for various reasons (like closer recent contact), but that doesn't negate the author's right to attend the wedding if they still consider the friendship important.\n\nOn the other hand, if the author feels the friendship is one-sided and has been drifting apart, maybe it's time to move on. But the question of whether they're in the wrong for not attending hinges on social expectations. In many cases, attending a close friend's wedding is expected, even if you're not in the party. So, the author's decision not to attend could be seen as inconsiderate, even if their feelings are valid. Therefore, they might be in the wrong (A). However, if the author feels that the friendship is over, then their decision is a personal choice, but it's still a social faux pas not to attend. So there's a nuance here.\n\nBut the key point is whether the author is in the wrong. The AITA framework often considers social norms. The general consensus in such cases might lean towards the author being in the wrong for not attending, even if their feelings are hurt. Alternatively, some might argue that if the friendship is ending, it's acceptable. However, the author's reasoning is based on being upset about not being in the wedding party, which might be a selfish reason to skip the wedding. So, the answer might be A.\n"
