I was surprised when I found out on Facebook because I thought this was something she would have told me first. I sent her a private message congratulating her and we spent some time talking about her wedding plans. I assumed I would be her maid of honor since two years ago she was the maid of honor in my wedding. \n\nA few weeks ago, I saw on Facebook that she asked another childhood best friend to be her maid of honor. I was hurt but understood that we have drifted apart the past few years. I still assumed I would be a bridesmaid. \n\nLast week I saw another Facebook post of her and everyone she asked to be in her wedding party. Two of the girls were people she hasn\u2019t been very close with lately. It has now become clear to me that I will not be in her wedding party. \n\nMy feelings are hurt but I understand that this is her day and she should have the people she wants standing up next to her. However, since I am not in the wedding party, WIBTA for not attending the wedding? She lives a few states away so I would need to buy a plane ticket, a hotel room, and request time off of work. This would not be a major hardship but it does not seem worth it to me since I am already embarrassed about not being in the wedding party. \n\nI am not interested in being in a one sided friendship. I would rather focus on friends who want to have me around. I do not plan on staying in contact with her after this. AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, so I need to figure out if the person who wrote this is in the wrong. Let me start by going through the situation step by step.\n\nFirst, the user is a close friend of the bride for over 15 years. They got married two years ago, with the bride being the maid of honor. Now, the bride is getting married again, and the user found out via Facebook, which was a surprise. The user thought the bride would have told them first. They messaged her and talked about the wedding plans, assuming they would be the maid of honor. But later, the bride chose another childhood friend as the maid of honor. The user was hurt but thought they might still be a bridesmaid. However, when they saw the wedding party list, they realized they weren't included at all. Now, the user is considering not attending the wedding because they're not in the wedding party, even though it's not a huge hardship to go (plane ticket, hotel, time off). They feel the friendship is one-sided and don't want to attend. The question is whether they're in the wrong for not attending.\n\nHmm. Let's break this down. The user has been friends for a long time, but there's been some drifting. The bride didn't inform them first, which is a red flag. The user expected to be in the wedding party, given their past roles, but wasn't included. The user is hurt and feels the friendship is one-sided. They're considering not attending the wedding because they don't want to be in a one-sided friendship and are embarrassed about not being in the wedding party.\n\nIs the user in the wrong for not attending? Well, attending a wedding is a personal choice. The bride didn't include them in the wedding party, which is her right. The user might feel hurt, but the decision to attend or not is up to them. However, maybe there's an expectation as a long-time friend. But the user also mentions that they've drifted apart. If the friendship isn't as close as before, maybe the user is justified in not attending. Also, the bride didn't communicate properly, which is on her side. The user might be within their rights to prioritize their feelings and not put resources into a friendship that's become one-sided. So, the user isn't in the wrong. Answer B.\n"
