I was surprised when I found out on Facebook because I thought this was something she would have told me first. I sent her a private message congratulating her and we spent some time talking about her wedding plans. I assumed I would be her maid of honor since two years ago she was the maid of honor in my wedding. \n\nA few weeks ago, I saw on Facebook that she asked another childhood best friend to be her maid of honor. I was hurt but understood that we have drifted apart the past few years. I still assumed I would be a bridesmaid. \n\nLast week I saw another Facebook post of her and everyone she asked to be in her wedding party. Two of the girls were people she hasn\u2019t been very close with lately. It has now become clear to me that I will not be in her wedding party. \n\nMy feelings are hurt but I understand that this is her day and she should have the people she wants standing up next to her. However, since I am not in the wedding party, WIBTA for not attending the wedding? She lives a few states away so I would need to buy a plane ticket, a hotel room, and request time off of work. This would not be a major hardship but it does not seem worth it to me since I am already embarrassed about not being in the wedding party. \n\nI am not interested in being in a one sided friendship. I would rather focus on friends who want to have me around. I do not plan on staying in contact with her after this. AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is that the author is a 15-year friend of the bride. They were surprised when the bride announced her engagement on Facebook, expecting to be told first. The author assumed they would be maid of honor since they were the maid of honor in the bride's wedding two years ago. But instead, the bride chose another childhood friend as maid of honor. The author thought they would still be a bridesmaid, but later found out they weren't included in the wedding party at all. Now, they're considering not attending the wedding because they feel hurt and don't want to be in a one-sided friendship.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the expectations. The author thought they would be in the wedding party because of their past friendship and their own experience. But the bride made different choices. The author is hurt, which is understandable, but is it reasonable to expect to be in the wedding party? Weddings are personal, and the bride has the right to choose her attendants based on current relationships and her own preferences.\n\nThe author is considering not attending because they're hurt and don't want to attend without being in the wedding party. They also mention wanting to focus on friends who value them. But weddings are usually social events where attending is a courtesy, even if you're not in the party. The author is making a choice based on their feelings, but is that the right approach?\n\nThe key points here are: the author's assumptions about being in the wedding party, the bride's right to choose her attendants, and the decision to attend or not. The author might be overreacting by not attending because their feelings are hurt, but the bride might have valid reasons for her choices, like drifting apart or wanting different people closer to her now.\n\nIn terms of responsibility, the author isn't wrong for feeling hurt, but perhaps they are in the wrong for deciding not to attend based on not being in the wedding party. Weddings are meant to celebrate the couple, and not attending because you're not in the party might be seen as selfish. However, if the friendship has indeed become one-sided, maybe the author is justified. But the question is about whether they are in the wrong, not just their feelings.\n\nIt seems that the author is making a choice based on their own hurt feelings rather than the bride's decisions. Since the bride has the right to choose, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong for deciding not to attend, but it's a matter of personal choice. However, the expectation that they must attend because of the friendship might be where they're in the wrong.\n\nWait, but the author is saying they don't want to attend because they're not in the party. That could be seen as holding a grudge. The bride might not have intended to hurt their feelings. The author's decision might be based on their own expectations rather than the bride's actual intentions. So maybe the author is in the wrong because they're prioritizing their feelings over attending the wedding, which is a significant event for the bride.\n"
