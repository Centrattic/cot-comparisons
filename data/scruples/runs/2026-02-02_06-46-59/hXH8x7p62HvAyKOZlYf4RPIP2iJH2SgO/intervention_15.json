I was surprised when I found out on Facebook because I thought this was something she would have told me first. I sent her a private message congratulating her and we spent some time talking about her wedding plans. I assumed I would be her maid of honor since two years ago she was the maid of honor in my wedding. \n\nA few weeks ago, I saw on Facebook that she asked another childhood best friend to be her maid of honor. I was hurt but understood that we have drifted apart the past few years. I still assumed I would be a bridesmaid. \n\nLast week I saw another Facebook post of her and everyone she asked to be in her wedding party. Two of the girls were people she hasn\u2019t been very close with lately. It has now become clear to me that I will not be in her wedding party. \n\nMy feelings are hurt but I understand that this is her day and she should have the people she wants standing up next to her. However, since I am not in the wedding party, WIBTA for not attending the wedding? She lives a few states away so I would need to buy a plane ticket, a hotel room, and request time off of work. This would not be a major hardship but it does not seem worth it to me since I am already embarrassed about not being in the wedding party. \n\nI am not interested in being in a one sided friendship. I would rather focus on friends who want to have me around. I do not plan on staying in contact with her after this. AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is about a friend's wedding. The author is a 15-year friend who wasn't asked to be in the wedding party, even after being the maid of honor at their friend's wedding two years ago.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the expectations. The author expected to be the maid of honor, given the mutual previous role. But the friend chose someone else, and then the author isn't in the wedding party at all. The author is now considering not attending because it's an expense and they feel hurt and want to cut contact.\n\nThe key points here are about friendship dynamics and personal choice. The author is hurt, which is understandable, but is it reasonable to not attend a friend's wedding over not being in the wedding party? Weddings are big events, and attending is often seen as a sign of support regardless of being in the party. However, the author is also planning to cut contact, which adds another layer.\n\nI should think about whether attending is the right thing to do. Maybe the author is reacting out of hurt and feels it's not worth the effort. But culturally, attending is often expected even if you're not part of the wedding party. However, the author is considering their own feelings and future relationship. If they're not maintaining contact anyway, maybe they don't feel the need to attend. But is that being in the wrong? It's more about personal choice rather than a moral wrong. \n\nThe author isn't being malicious; they're hurt and making a choice based on their feelings. The friend might not see it as a big deal to exclude them, but the author is within their rights to make a choice about their own time and money. So maybe the author isn't in the wrong. But some might argue that attending is a kinder choice. However, it's their decision. So the answer could be B, not in the wrong.\n"
