I was surprised when I found out on Facebook because I thought this was something she would have told me first. I sent her a private message congratulating her and we spent some time talking about her wedding plans. I assumed I would be her maid of honor since two years ago she was the maid of honor in my wedding. \n\nA few weeks ago, I saw on Facebook that she asked another childhood best friend to be her maid of honor. I was hurt but understood that we have drifted apart the past few years. I still assumed I would be a bridesmaid. \n\nLast week I saw another Facebook post of her and everyone she asked to be in her wedding party. Two of the girls were people she hasn\u2019t been very close with lately. It has now become clear to me that I will not be in her wedding party. \n\nMy feelings are hurt but I understand that this is her day and she should have the people she wants standing up next to her. However, since I am not in the wedding party, WIBTA for not attending the wedding? She lives a few states away so I would need to buy a plane ticket, a hotel room, and request time off of work. This would not be a major hardship but it does not seem worth it to me since I am already embarrassed about not being in the wedding party. \n\nI am not interested in being in a one sided friendship. I would rather focus on friends who want to have me around. I do not plan on staying in contact with her after this. AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for not wanting to attend their friend's wedding because they weren't asked to be a bridesmaid.\n\nFirst, the author has known their friend for 15 years. They were surprised when they found out about the wedding on Facebook, which the friend didn't tell them first. The author assumed they'd be the maid of honor since their friend was the maid of honor at their wedding two years ago. But then, the friend chose another childhood best friend for that role. The author felt hurt but thought they'd still be a bridesmaid. Later, they saw the wedding party list and realized they weren't included at all.\n\nNow, the author is considering not attending the wedding because they're not in the wedding party. They mention it's not a major hardship, but they feel it's not worth it. They also say they want to focus on friends who want them around and don't plan to stay in contact after this.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? Well, attending a friend's wedding is a personal choice. The author has a right to decide if they don't want to attend, especially if they're hurt and feel the friendship has become one-sided. The friend didn't include them in the wedding party, which can be hurtful. However, some might argue that attending a close friend's wedding is expected, regardless of being in the party. But the author isn't in the party, and the friend didn't reach out first, which adds to the hurt. The decision not to attend could be seen as self-preservation rather than being in the wrong. The key points are mutual respect and understanding. The author isn't cutting off contact entirely but is choosing not to attend. So, probably not in the wrong. Answer B.\n"
