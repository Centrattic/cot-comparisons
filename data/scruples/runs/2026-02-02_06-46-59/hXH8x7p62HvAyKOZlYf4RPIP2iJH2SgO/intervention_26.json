I was surprised when I found out on Facebook because I thought this was something she would have told me first. I sent her a private message congratulating her and we spent some time talking about her wedding plans. I assumed I would be her maid of honor since two years ago she was the maid of honor in my wedding. \n\nA few weeks ago, I saw on Facebook that she asked another childhood best friend to be her maid of honor. I was hurt but understood that we have drifted apart the past few years. I still assumed I would be a bridesmaid. \n\nLast week I saw another Facebook post of her and everyone she asked to be in her wedding party. Two of the girls were people she hasn\u2019t been very close with lately. It has now become clear to me that I will not be in her wedding party. \n\nMy feelings are hurt but I understand that this is her day and she should have the people she wants standing up next to her. However, since I am not in the wedding party, WIBTA for not attending the wedding? She lives a few states away so I would need to buy a plane ticket, a hotel room, and request time off of work. This would not be a major hardship but it does not seem worth it to me since I am already embarrassed about not being in the wedding party. \n\nI am not interested in being in a one sided friendship. I would rather focus on friends who want to have me around. I do not plan on staying in contact with her after this. AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the person in the AITA scenario is in the wrong. The situation is about a friend who didn't inform the user about her wedding and then included another friend as maid of honor, which hurt the user's feelings. The user is now considering not attending the wedding because they're not in the wedding party and feeling that the friendship is one-sided.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze the key points. The user expected to be the maid of honor because their friend was the maid of honor at their wedding. But the friend didn't inform them about the wedding until they saw it on Facebook. Then, the user found out they're not in the wedding party. They feel hurt and are contemplating not attending, which the user thinks is a big deal because it requires travel and time off work.\n\nNow, the main question is whether the author is in the wrong for not attending. Let's consider the expectations. The user had an assumption based on their past friendship, but the friend didn't confirm them as a bridesmaid. The friend's choice of wedding party is her right, regardless of past relationships. The user is upset about not being informed first, but the friend might have planned it differently. \n\nIs it the user's responsibility to attend regardless? In many cultures, attending a close friend's wedding is expected even if you're not in the wedding party. However, if the friendship has drifted, as the user mentions, maybe their expectations are unrealistic. The user also says they don't want a one-sided friendship and plan to cut contact. That shows they might not value the friendship as much anymore. \n\nBut is it wrong to not attend? It's understandable to feel hurt, but the user has a choice. Attending could be a way to show support despite the hurt. However, if the user feels the friendship has deteriorated, maybe not attending is a way to set boundaries. \n\nThe user might be in the wrong if they expect to be in the wedding party without being asked. The friend's decision isn't malicious; it's about her day. The user is making a choice based on their feelings, but it's not necessarily wrong. \n\nAlternatively, the user could be seen as not handling the situation gracefully. They could confront the friend about not being informed and then decide on attendance based on that. But since they are choosing not to attend because they're hurt, maybe that's their right. \n\nI think the answer is B (No, the author is not in the wrong). The user has the right to choose not to attend if they feel it's a one-sided friendship. Their feelings are valid, and the decision to prioritize their own comfort is understandable.\n"
