I was surprised when I found out on Facebook because I thought this was something she would have told me first. I sent her a private message congratulating her and we spent some time talking about her wedding plans. I assumed I would be her maid of honor since two years ago she was the maid of honor in my wedding. \n\nA few weeks ago, I saw on Facebook that she asked another childhood best friend to be her maid of honor. I was hurt but understood that we have drifted apart the past few years. I still assumed I would be a bridesmaid. \n\nLast week I saw another Facebook post of her and everyone she asked to be in her wedding party. Two of the girls were people she hasn\u2019t been very close with lately. It has now become clear to me that I will not be in her wedding party. \n\nMy feelings are hurt but I understand that this is her day and she should have the people she wants standing up next to her. However, since I am not in the wedding party, WIBTA for not attending the wedding? She lives a few states away so I would need to buy a plane ticket, a hotel room, and request time off of work. This would not be a major hardship but it does not seem worth it to me since I am already embarrassed about not being in the wedding party. \n\nI am not interested in being in a one sided friendship. I would rather focus on friends who want to have me around. I do not plan on staying in contact with her after this. AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for not wanting to attend their friend's wedding since they weren't asked to be a bridesmaid.\n\nFirst, the situation: The friend found out about the wedding on Facebook, which was surprising. They were close for 15 years, and the friend was the maid of honor at their wedding. Now, the author assumed they'd be the maid of honor here, but instead, the friend chose someone else. The author wasn't in the wedding party at all. The author feels hurt, understanding that drifting apart might be the reason, and now they're considering not attending the wedding because they're not in the wedding party and don't want to attend if it's one-sided.\n\nSo, the key points here. Attending a friend's wedding is a personal choice. The author is not obligated to attend, especially if they're hurt and not part of the wedding party. Weddings are the couple's choice to include who they want in their party. The author's decision to not attend might be seen as a response to feeling undervalued, given the friend's choice to not include her. The author is also considering the financial and time commitments, which are valid factors.\n\nThe friend didn't reach out to the author first to tell her about the wedding, which could have been a red flag. The author tried to talk about the wedding plans, but the friend didn't make them part of the wedding party. So the author's decision to not attend might be a way to protect their feelings and set boundaries, especially if they feel the friendship is one-sided now.\n\nIn terms of social norms, attending a wedding isn't mandatory unless you're part of the wedding party. If you're not in the party, attending is up to the individual. The author is making a personal choice based on their feelings and circumstances. The friend might feel hurt if the author doesn't come, but the author has a right to prioritize their own emotional well-being.\n\nSo, the answer would be B (No, the author is not in the wrong) because attending isn't required, and the author is responding to feeling excluded and deciding to not invest time and money into an event where they feel undervalued.\n"
