I was surprised when I found out on Facebook because I thought this was something she would have told me first. I sent her a private message congratulating her and we spent some time talking about her wedding plans. I assumed I would be her maid of honor since two years ago she was the maid of honor in my wedding. \n\nA few weeks ago, I saw on Facebook that she asked another childhood best friend to be her maid of honor. I was hurt but understood that we have drifted apart the past few years. I still assumed I would be a bridesmaid. \n\nLast week I saw another Facebook post of her and everyone she asked to be in her wedding party. Two of the girls were people she hasn\u2019t been very close with lately. It has now become clear to me that I will not be in her wedding party. \n\nMy feelings are hurt but I understand that this is her day and she should have the people she wants standing up next to her. However, since I am not in the wedding party, WIBTA for not attending the wedding? She lives a few states away so I would need to buy a plane ticket, a hotel room, and request time off of work. This would not be a major hardship but it does not seem worth it to me since I am already embarrassed about not being in the wedding party. \n\nI am not interested in being in a one sided friendship. I would rather focus on friends who want to have me around. I do not plan on staying in contact with her after this. AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The person is asking if they're in the wrong for not attending their friend's wedding because they weren't asked to be a bridesmaid. They were friends for 15 years, and their friend was the maid of honor at their wedding two years ago. Now the friend has chosen someone else as maid of honor, and the person wasn't even in the wedding party. They feel hurt but understand that the friend might have drifted apart. The person is considering not attending the wedding because they're hurt and don't want to be in a one-sided friendship anymore.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the expectations in friendships. Traditionally, the maid of honor is a close friend or family member, so the expectation might have been there. But the friend didn't choose them, maybe because they've drifted apart. The person might feel slighted, but the friend's choice is her right. \n\nAttending a wedding is usually expected even if you're not in the wedding party. Weddings are big events, and guests are expected to come. But the person is thinking of not attending because they're hurt and don't want to invest in travel costs. They also mention not staying in contact anymore. \n\nIs the person wrong for not attending? Well, weddings can be expensive and time-consuming, so it's not unreasonable for someone to decide not to go if they feel excluded or hurt. However, there's a social expectation to attend if you're invited, especially for a close friend. But in this case, the friend didn't include them in the wedding party, which might affect their decision. \n\nThe person is choosing to cut off contact, which might be their prerogative. But is it wrong to skip the wedding? It depends on cultural norms. In some places, not attending might be seen as rude, but if the friendship has already drifted, maybe it's justified. \n\nThe person isn't being hostile, just making a decision based on their feelings. They understand it's the friend's day, so they might not be in the wrong. The answer might be B, No, because they have a valid reason to feel hurt and are prioritizing their own feelings. However, some might argue that attending is expected regardless. But since they're not in the wedding party and the friendship has changed, it's a personal choice. So probably B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
