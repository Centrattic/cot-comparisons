I was surprised when I found out on Facebook because I thought this was something she would have told me first. I sent her a private message congratulating her and we spent some time talking about her wedding plans. I assumed I would be her maid of honor since two years ago she was the maid of honor in my wedding. \n\nA few weeks ago, I saw on Facebook that she asked another childhood best friend to be her maid of honor. I was hurt but understood that we have drifted apart the past few years. I still assumed I would be a bridesmaid. \n\nLast week I saw another Facebook post of her and everyone she asked to be in her wedding party. Two of the girls were people she hasn\u2019t been very close with lately. It has now become clear to me that I will not be in her wedding party. \n\nMy feelings are hurt but I understand that this is her day and she should have the people she wants standing up next to her. However, since I am not in the wedding party, WIBTA for not attending the wedding? She lives a few states away so I would need to buy a plane ticket, a hotel room, and request time off of work. This would not be a major hardship but it does not seem worth it to me since I am already embarrassed about not being in the wedding party. \n\nI am not interested in being in a one sided friendship. I would rather focus on friends who want to have me around. I do not plan on staying in contact with her after this. AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong. The situation involves a friend's wedding where the author wasn't invited to be a bridesmaid or maid of honor, even though they had a close friendship for 15 years. The author is considering not attending the wedding because they weren't included in the wedding party, even though they understand it's her day.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The friend found out about the wedding via Facebook, which might have already caused some hurt feelings. The author assumed they would be the maid of honor since the friend was their maid of honor in their own wedding. But the friend chose another childhood best friend for that role. Then, the author saw the wedding party list and realized they weren't included. They're hurt and considering not attending the wedding because they're embarrassed and don't want a \"one-sided\" friendship anymore.\n\nSo, the main issue here is the author's decision not to attend the wedding due to not being in the wedding party. The question is whether they're in the wrong for that. \n\nFrom a social standpoint, attending a friend's wedding is a significant gesture. Even if you're not in the wedding party, showing up is often seen as a sign of support and respect for the couple. Weddings are expensive and logistically complex, so not being invited as a bridesmaid doesn't necessarily mean you're not welcome. The author is choosing not to attend because of their hurt feelings, which could be seen as selfish. \n\nHowever, there's also the aspect of the relationship. The friend didn't keep the author informed first and didn't include them in the wedding party, which might indicate a shift in their friendship. If the author feels the friendship is no longer balanced, maybe they're justified in cutting ties. But not attending the wedding could be a harsh reaction. It's possible the friend had valid reasons for not including them in the wedding party, maybe due to personal preferences or other factors. \n\nThe author's reasoning is that they don't want a one-sided friendship, but by not attending, they're choosing to end the friendship publicly. That might be a strong move. Also, the cost and effort of attending aren't prohibitive for them, so using that as a reason not to go might not hold up. \n\nIn terms of social norms, it's generally expected to attend a friend's wedding unless there's a major reason. Not attending because you weren't included in the wedding party could be seen as being petty. The author might be taking their hurt feelings out on the entire event, which is understandable but not necessarily justified. \n\nOn the flip side, if the friendship has indeed become one-sided and the friend hasn't been close in recent years, maybe the author isn't wrong to distance themselves. But the decision to not attend the wedding is a big step. People might argue that even if you're not in the wedding party, attending is a kind gesture. \n\nSo, weighing these factors, the author is likely in the wrong because they're letting their hurt feelings prevent them from supporting their friend in a major life event. The cost and effort are manageable, and not attending could be seen as cutting off the friendship in a public and abrupt manner. However, if the friendship was already strained, the author's decision might be more understandable. But generally, attending is expected unless there's a valid reason like a conflict or health issue. Since the author is choosing not to go because of the wedding party, it's more about personal feelings rather than a legitimate reason.\n"
