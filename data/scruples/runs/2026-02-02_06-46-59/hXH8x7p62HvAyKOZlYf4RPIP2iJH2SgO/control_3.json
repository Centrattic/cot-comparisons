I was surprised when I found out on Facebook because I thought this was something she would have told me first. I sent her a private message congratulating her and we spent some time talking about her wedding plans. I assumed I would be her maid of honor since two years ago she was the maid of honor in my wedding. \n\nA few weeks ago, I saw on Facebook that she asked another childhood best friend to be her maid of honor. I was hurt but understood that we have drifted apart the past few years. I still assumed I would be a bridesmaid. \n\nLast week I saw another Facebook post of her and everyone she asked to be in her wedding party. Two of the girls were people she hasn\u2019t been very close with lately. It has now become clear to me that I will not be in her wedding party. \n\nMy feelings are hurt but I understand that this is her day and she should have the people she wants standing up next to her. However, since I am not in the wedding party, WIBTA for not attending the wedding? She lives a few states away so I would need to buy a plane ticket, a hotel room, and request time off of work. This would not be a major hardship but it does not seem worth it to me since I am already embarrassed about not being in the wedding party. \n\nI am not interested in being in a one sided friendship. I would rather focus on friends who want to have me around. I do not plan on staying in contact with her after this. AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is wrong for not wanting to attend their friend's wedding because they're not a bridesmaid. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the author had a 15-year friendship. They expected to be the maid of honor since their friend was maids of honor at their wedding. The friend chose someone else, which hurt the author. Now they're considering not attending because they're not in the wedding party.\n\nHmm. The key points here are expectations versus reality. The author felt entitled to a role based on past reciprocity. But their friend moved on, maybe drifting apart. The author is hurt, understandable. But is it wrong to skip the wedding?\n\nWell, weddings are important events. Even if you're not in the wedding party, attending is a common courtesy. The author is using their exclusion as a reason not to go. But maybe they should attend to support their friend, despite the hurt. However, the author feels the friendship is one-sided now and plans to cut ties. That complicates things.\n\nIs there a cultural norm about attending weddings regardless? Yes, generally. But the author is justifying it by the expense and the fact that they're not in the wedding party. But maybe the friend didn't ask them to be in the party, but still expects attendance. The author is deciding based on their feelings. \n\nOn the other hand, if the friend didn't communicate properly, maybe the author's hurt is valid. The friend posted on Facebook instead of telling them first, which is inconsiderate. The author's decision not to attend might be a reaction to that. But is it wrong? It depends on the friendship's state. If they're drifting apart and not staying in touch, maybe it's not a major issue. The author might not be in the wrong for prioritizing their feelings, especially if they're planning to discontinue contact.\n\nSo, the answer would be B (No, the author is not in the wrong). They have a right to their feelings and the friendship has changed. Attending might not be necessary if the friendship is ending.\n"
