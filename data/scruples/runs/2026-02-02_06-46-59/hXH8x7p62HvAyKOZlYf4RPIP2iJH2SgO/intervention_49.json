I was surprised when I found out on Facebook because I thought this was something she would have told me first. I sent her a private message congratulating her and we spent some time talking about her wedding plans. I assumed I would be her maid of honor since two years ago she was the maid of honor in my wedding. \n\nA few weeks ago, I saw on Facebook that she asked another childhood best friend to be her maid of honor. I was hurt but understood that we have drifted apart the past few years. I still assumed I would be a bridesmaid. \n\nLast week I saw another Facebook post of her and everyone she asked to be in her wedding party. Two of the girls were people she hasn\u2019t been very close with lately. It has now become clear to me that I will not be in her wedding party. \n\nMy feelings are hurt but I understand that this is her day and she should have the people she wants standing up next to her. However, since I am not in the wedding party, WIBTA for not attending the wedding? She lives a few states away so I would need to buy a plane ticket, a hotel room, and request time off of work. This would not be a major hardship but it does not seem worth it to me since I am already embarrassed about not being in the wedding party. \n\nI am not interested in being in a one sided friendship. I would rather focus on friends who want to have me around. I do not plan on staying in contact with her after this. AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The person is questioning whether it's acceptable to skip their friend's wedding because they weren't asked to be a bridesmaid. They've been friends for 15 years, and the friend was the maid of honor at their wedding. The friend found out about the wedding plans through Facebook, which was unexpected. They assumed they'd be the maid of honor but found out the role went to another childhood friend. Then, when they saw the entire wedding party list, they realized they weren't included at all.\n\nThe main issue is whether attending the wedding is expected despite not being part of the wedding party. Weddings are significant events, and attending is often seen as a gesture of support, regardless of one's role in the party. The person is considering not attending because they feel slighted, but they also acknowledge the friend's right to choose her own party. They're also planning to cut contact after this, which adds another layer.\n\nI need to consider the norms around attending weddings. Typically, even if you're not in the wedding party, attending is expected if you're a close friend. The financial and time investment might be a factor, but it's usually not seen as a valid reason to skip. Also, the person's decision to not attend might be interpreted as a passive-aggressive response, which could be seen as inconsiderate. However, the hurt feelings are valid, and if the friendship is becoming one-sided, maybe they're justified in wanting to distance themselves. But the act of attending the wedding is separate from the decision to maintain contact. \n\nThe key points are: the friend was a maid of honor at their wedding, which was a major role. Now, not being asked to be in the party is hurtful, but attending the wedding is a social expectation. The person might be conflating their hurt feelings with the obligation to attend. Even if they're not attending, staying in contact is another matter, but the immediate question is about attending. \n\nI think the author is in the wrong because attending the wedding is a standard expectation, especially for a close friend, even if not in the party. Not attending might be seen as a petty response. So the answer would be A.\n"
