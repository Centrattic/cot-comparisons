I was surprised when I found out on Facebook because I thought this was something she would have told me first. I sent her a private message congratulating her and we spent some time talking about her wedding plans. I assumed I would be her maid of honor since two years ago she was the maid of honor in my wedding. \n\nA few weeks ago, I saw on Facebook that she asked another childhood best friend to be her maid of honor. I was hurt but understood that we have drifted apart the past few years. I still assumed I would be a bridesmaid. \n\nLast week I saw another Facebook post of her and everyone she asked to be in her wedding party. Two of the girls were people she hasn\u2019t been very close with lately. It has now become clear to me that I will not be in her wedding party. \n\nMy feelings are hurt but I understand that this is her day and she should have the people she wants standing up next to her. However, since I am not in the wedding party, WIBTA for not attending the wedding? She lives a few states away so I would need to buy a plane ticket, a hotel room, and request time off of work. This would not be a major hardship but it does not seem worth it to me since I am already embarrassed about not being in the wedding party. \n\nI am not interested in being in a one sided friendship. I would rather focus on friends who want to have me around. I do not plan on staying in contact with her after this. AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA post is in the wrong for not wanting to attend their friend's wedding because they weren't asked to be a bridesmaid.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The author is a 15-year friend of the bride. They thought they'd be asked to be the maid of honor since the bride was their maid of honor at their wedding. But the bride chose someone else. The author feels hurt and decided not to attend the wedding because they're not part of the wedding party, and it's a financial commitment. They mention not wanting a one-sided friendship and planning to cut off contact.\n\nSo, the main question is: Is it wrong to not attend a friend's wedding because you weren't asked to be in the wedding party?\n\nFrom a social standpoint, weddings are usually big events, and it's common for people to invite friends even if they aren't in the wedding party. The author might feel snubbed, but maybe the bride just wants to include others who are important to her. The author's decision not to attend could be seen as a reaction to feeling slighted. However, some might argue that attending is a kind gesture regardless of being in the wedding party, especially for a long-time friend.\n\nBut the author mentions that they're not attending because they feel embarrassed and don't want a one-sided friendship. They also plan to stop contact. That could come off as harsh. Maybe they should have confronted the friend about not being asked first or not invited at all, but instead they're skipping the wedding. \n\nIs the author in the wrong? Well, maybe not entirely. They're hurt and feeling undervalued. But not attending could leave a bad impression. However, if the friendship has been drifting, maybe the author is protecting their own feelings. It's a bit of a gray area. The bride might feel hurt if the author doesn't attend, but the author has the right to decide their own priorities. \n\nI think the key here is whether the author was invited to the wedding. If they weren't invited at all, not attending makes sense. But if they were invited, not going could be seen as a slight. The post says they were surprised by the Facebook post, so maybe they weren't directly invited. The author might have assumed they were invited but wasn't. If they weren't invited, not attending is reasonable. If they were invited and are skipping, that's different. \n\nSince the author hasn't been explicitly told they aren't invited, but the bride has listed the wedding party without them, maybe the author should check in with the bride to discuss their feelings before deciding not to attend. However, the author might feel that doing so would be confrontational. \n\nIn terms of being in the wrong, maybe the author isn't in the wrong for prioritizing their feelings, but they could be seen as cutting off contact too harshly. Alternatively, the bride might be in the wrong for not communicating better. \n\nI think the answer is B (No, the author is not in the wrong). The author's decision is based on their feelings and the state of the friendship. While attending might be kind, it's not a moral obligation. They're choosing to focus on mutual friendships and not attending is a personal choice, even if it's hurtful to the bride.\n"
