I was surprised when I found out on Facebook because I thought this was something she would have told me first. I sent her a private message congratulating her and we spent some time talking about her wedding plans. I assumed I would be her maid of honor since two years ago she was the maid of honor in my wedding. \n\nA few weeks ago, I saw on Facebook that she asked another childhood best friend to be her maid of honor. I was hurt but understood that we have drifted apart the past few years. I still assumed I would be a bridesmaid. \n\nLast week I saw another Facebook post of her and everyone she asked to be in her wedding party. Two of the girls were people she hasn\u2019t been very close with lately. It has now become clear to me that I will not be in her wedding party. \n\nMy feelings are hurt but I understand that this is her day and she should have the people she wants standing up next to her. However, since I am not in the wedding party, WIBTA for not attending the wedding? She lives a few states away so I would need to buy a plane ticket, a hotel room, and request time off of work. This would not be a major hardship but it does not seem worth it to me since I am already embarrassed about not being in the wedding party. \n\nI am not interested in being in a one sided friendship. I would rather focus on friends who want to have me around. I do not plan on staying in contact with her after this. AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote this is in the wrong for not wanting to attend their friend's wedding because they weren't asked as a bridesmaid.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The friend of 15 years didn't tell them about the wedding first, found out on Facebook. They messaged their friend and discussed the wedding plans, assuming they'd be maid of honor since their friend was in their own wedding. Then, they found out the friend chose someone else as maid of honor, but they still thought they'd be a bridesmaid. Finally, they saw the wedding party list and realized they weren't included at all. The author is hurt but understands it's the friend's day. They're considering not attending because it's an expense and they feel embarrassed, and they don't want a one-sided friendship anymore.\n\nSo, the main question is whether the author is in the wrong for deciding not to attend. The options are A (yes) or B (no). \n\nLet me think. Attending a wedding is typically a personal choice. The author is upset because they were excluded from the wedding party, which can be a sensitive issue. In their own wedding, the friend was the maid of honor, which might imply an expectation of reciprocity. However, the friend might have changed their mind or drifted apart. The author is considering not attending because they feel it's a one-sided friendship now. \n\nIs it wrong to not attend? Well, the author isn't being forced to go. If they're not in the wedding party, maybe the friend doesn't want them there, but the author isn't certain. The friend might still want them to attend even without being a bridesmaid. But the author feels hurt and is using the expense as a reason. They mention it's not a major hardship but doesn't seem worth it. They also plan to cut contact after this. \n\nThe key points here are the author's feelings of being slighted, the value they place on mutual effort in the friendship, and the decision to not attend. In many cases, people do choose to attend weddings even if they're not in the bridal party, especially for long-term friends. However, the author's perspective is that the friendship is one-sided now, so they're prioritizing their own emotional well-being. \n\nThere's also the aspect of the friend not being the first to inform them. The author might feel undervalued in the friendship overall. If they believe the friendship has deteriorated to the point where they don't want to maintain it, then not attending the wedding could be a way to set boundaries. \n\nOn the other hand, some might argue that attending the wedding is a gesture of support regardless of the wedding party status. But the author isn't being disrespectful; they're processing the exclusion and the drift, and making a choice based on their current feelings. \n\nI think the answer leans towards B (No), because the author isn't obligated to attend. They have a valid reason based on their feelings and the state of the friendship. The friend may have made a different choice, but the author's decision to not put in the effort if the friendship is one-sided is understandable. It's a personal choice, and while it might be a hard one, it's not necessarily wrong.\n"
