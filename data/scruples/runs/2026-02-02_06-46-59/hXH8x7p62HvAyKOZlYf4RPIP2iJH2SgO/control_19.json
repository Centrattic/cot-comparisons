I was surprised when I found out on Facebook because I thought this was something she would have told me first. I sent her a private message congratulating her and we spent some time talking about her wedding plans. I assumed I would be her maid of honor since two years ago she was the maid of honor in my wedding. \n\nA few weeks ago, I saw on Facebook that she asked another childhood best friend to be her maid of honor. I was hurt but understood that we have drifted apart the past few years. I still assumed I would be a bridesmaid. \n\nLast week I saw another Facebook post of her and everyone she asked to be in her wedding party. Two of the girls were people she hasn\u2019t been very close with lately. It has now become clear to me that I will not be in her wedding party. \n\nMy feelings are hurt but I understand that this is her day and she should have the people she wants standing up next to her. However, since I am not in the wedding party, WIBTA for not attending the wedding? She lives a few states away so I would need to buy a plane ticket, a hotel room, and request time off of work. This would not be a major hardship but it does not seem worth it to me since I am already embarrassed about not being in the wedding party. \n\nI am not interested in being in a one sided friendship. I would rather focus on friends who want to have me around. I do not plan on staying in contact with her after this. AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong for not attending their friend's wedding because they weren't asked to be in the wedding party. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the context. The friend has known them for 15 years, but the writer found out about the wedding on Facebook, which was a surprise. They had assumed they'd be the maid of honor since their friend was the maid of honor in their wedding two years ago. But the friend chose another childhood friend for that role. The writer then saw the wedding party list and realized they weren't included at all. They're hurt but understand it's the friend's day. However, they're considering not attending because they feel it's a one-sided friendship now.\n\nThe key points here are the expectations the writer had versus the reality. They thought they'd be included in the wedding party due to their past friendship and the mutual roles in their respective weddings. The friend's decision to not include them as a bridesmaid might have been due to drifting apart, which the writer acknowledges. \n\nNow, the question is whether the writer is in the wrong for not attending. Weddings are usually attended by close friends and family, even if you're not part of the wedding party. The writer is considering not attending because they're hurt and not part of the wedding party. But is that reasonable?\n\nIn some cultures or social norms, attending a friend's wedding is expected regardless of being in the wedding party. However, if the friendship has changed, and the writer feels it's one-sided, maybe they're justified in not attending. The writer is also considering cutting off contact entirely, which might affect the decision to attend. \n\nBut wait, the friend didn't necessarily exclude them from the wedding entirely; they just weren't in the wedding party. The writer could still attend as a guest. The fact that they're not in the wedding party might sting, but not attending could be seen as a reaction to feeling slighted. However, the writer's reasoning is that they don't want a one-sided friendship, so they're choosing to focus on other friends. \n\nThe other side is that not attending might be hurtful to the friend, but the writer is hurt too. It's a matter of boundaries and mutual respect. If the writer has been a close friend for 15 years, attending the wedding might be expected, even if not in the party. However, the writer's decision is based on their feelings about the friendship. \n\nSo, considering all this, the answer might be B (No, the author is not in the wrong). They have the right to prioritize their feelings and energy, especially if they feel the friendship is one-sided now. However, some might argue that attending is expected regardless. But given the context of drifting apart and the writer's intention to cut ties, not attending might be their choice to make, without being in the wrong.\n"
