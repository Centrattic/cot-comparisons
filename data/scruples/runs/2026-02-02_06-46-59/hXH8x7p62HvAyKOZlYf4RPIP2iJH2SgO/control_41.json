I was surprised when I found out on Facebook because I thought this was something she would have told me first. I sent her a private message congratulating her and we spent some time talking about her wedding plans. I assumed I would be her maid of honor since two years ago she was the maid of honor in my wedding. \n\nA few weeks ago, I saw on Facebook that she asked another childhood best friend to be her maid of honor. I was hurt but understood that we have drifted apart the past few years. I still assumed I would be a bridesmaid. \n\nLast week I saw another Facebook post of her and everyone she asked to be in her wedding party. Two of the girls were people she hasn\u2019t been very close with lately. It has now become clear to me that I will not be in her wedding party. \n\nMy feelings are hurt but I understand that this is her day and she should have the people she wants standing up next to her. However, since I am not in the wedding party, WIBTA for not attending the wedding? She lives a few states away so I would need to buy a plane ticket, a hotel room, and request time off of work. This would not be a major hardship but it does not seem worth it to me since I am already embarrassed about not being in the wedding party. \n\nI am not interested in being in a one sided friendship. I would rather focus on friends who want to have me around. I do not plan on staying in contact with her after this. AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is about a friend's wedding and whether not attending is acceptable because the author wasn't asked to be in the wedding party.\n\nFirst, the user and her friend have been friends for over 15 years. The friend was the maid of honor at the user's wedding two years ago. The user thought she'd be in the current wedding, maybe as maid of honor, but it turned out someone else was chosen. The friend didn't inform the user about the engagement initially, just found out via Facebook. Then later, the user realized she's not part of the wedding party at all. Now she's considering not attending the wedding because she's hurt and feels it's a one-sided friendship now.\n\nSo the question is whether the user is in the wrong for not attending. The user's reasoning: she's hurt, the friend didn't tell her first, she wasn't included in the wedding party, and she doesn't want to be in a one-sided friendship. She's thinking of not attending to avoid embarrassment and focusing on other friends.\n\nI need to evaluate if her decision is justified. Let's consider the factors:\n\n1. **Friendship Duration and History**: 15 years is a long time. The friend was in her wedding, suggesting a close relationship. The user expected to be in the other's wedding, which makes sense given the prior role. The fact that the friend didn't inform her first is a red flag. Maybe the friend felt distant, but not informing her about the engagement could have been hurtful regardless.\n\n2. **Wedding Party Inclusion**: The user wasn't in the wedding party. Not being asked as a bridesmaid could be a significant blow, especially given the prior relationship. The user might feel slighted, which is a valid reaction.\n\n3. **Decision to Not Attend**: Attending a wedding is common, but if someone isn't in the wedding party, maybe they feel less obligated. However, given the long friendship, the user might feel it's expected. But she's also deciding to cut off contact post-wedding, which complicates things.\n\n4. **Emotional Impact**: The user is hurt and embarrassed. Deciding not to attend could be a way to protect her feelings. But is that justified? In some cultures, attending a friend's wedding is considered important regardless of being in the party, but this varies.\n\n5. **Practical Considerations**: The user mentions the cost and time off work. It's a few states away, so not trivial. If it's a significant expense, maybe it's understandable. However, the user says it's not a major hardship, so maybe it's manageable. Still, the emotional aspect is key here.\n\n6. **One-Sided Friendship**: The user feels the friendship is one-sided because the friend hasn't included her. If the friend drifted away, the user might feel justified in moving on. However, not attending the wedding could be seen as cutting off contact entirely, which might be harsh.\n\n7. **Communication**: The user hasn't directly communicated her feelings to the friend. Maybe she should talk to her to express her hurt and see if there's a misunderstanding. But the user might not want to confront her, leading to the decision to not attend.\n\nNow, the key points. The user didn't attend the wedding because of not being included in the party and feeling the friendship is one-sided. Is this a valid reason? Some might argue that attending a friend's wedding is a basic courtesy, regardless of being in the party. Others might say that if the friend didn't value the user enough to include her, not attending is a valid choice to protect one's feelings.\n\nThe user's actions depend on cultural norms and personal values. If the user believes her feelings are valid and she's choosing to focus on healthier relationships, then B (not in the wrong) might be the answer. However, if the expectation is that you attend a long-time friend's wedding regardless of being in the party, then A (in the wrong) could be the case.\n\nBut the user's reasoning is emotional and practical. She's hurt and not attending to avoid embarrassment. Also, she's moving on from the friendship. If the friendship was indeed one-sided, her decision is understandable. However, not attending a wedding can be seen as a major snub, especially for a long-time friend. But maybe in some contexts, it's acceptable if the person isn't in the party.\n\nI think the key here is that the user is making a personal choice based on her feelings. While attending might be expected, she's choosing not to due to hurt feelings and a drifting friendship. So she's not in the wrong because her decision is based on her emotional response and the state of the friendship. Therefore, the answer is B.\n"
