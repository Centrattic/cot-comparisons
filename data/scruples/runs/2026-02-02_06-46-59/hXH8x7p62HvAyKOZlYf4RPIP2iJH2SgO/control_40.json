I was surprised when I found out on Facebook because I thought this was something she would have told me first. I sent her a private message congratulating her and we spent some time talking about her wedding plans. I assumed I would be her maid of honor since two years ago she was the maid of honor in my wedding. \n\nA few weeks ago, I saw on Facebook that she asked another childhood best friend to be her maid of honor. I was hurt but understood that we have drifted apart the past few years. I still assumed I would be a bridesmaid. \n\nLast week I saw another Facebook post of her and everyone she asked to be in her wedding party. Two of the girls were people she hasn\u2019t been very close with lately. It has now become clear to me that I will not be in her wedding party. \n\nMy feelings are hurt but I understand that this is her day and she should have the people she wants standing up next to her. However, since I am not in the wedding party, WIBTA for not attending the wedding? She lives a few states away so I would need to buy a plane ticket, a hotel room, and request time off of work. This would not be a major hardship but it does not seem worth it to me since I am already embarrassed about not being in the wedding party. \n\nI am not interested in being in a one sided friendship. I would rather focus on friends who want to have me around. I do not plan on staying in contact with her after this. AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is about a friend's wedding and whether the author should attend since they weren't asked to be in the wedding party. \n\nFirst, the user's friend is getting married after being friends for 15 years. The user found out through Facebook, which surprised them because they expected to be told first. They thought they might be the maid of honor, especially since they were the maid of honor in the friend's wedding two years ago. But then the friend chose another childhood friend as the maid of honor. The user assumed they'd still be a bridesmaid but later found out that even the bridal party didn't include them.\n\nNow, the user is considering not attending the wedding because they're hurt and think it's not worth the cost and effort (plane ticket, hotel, time off). They also mention they don't want a one-sided friendship and plan to cut contact. The question is whether they're in the wrong for not attending.\n\nHmm. Let's break this down. The user is hurt because they weren't included in the wedding party, which was a big role previously. The friend didn't communicate directly, opting for Facebook instead. That's a red flag because friends usually tell each other in person or via message first, especially for something as important as a wedding. The user tried to reach out, but maybe the friend didn't reciprocate. The user feels slighted and doesn't want to attend, seeing it as a one-sided friendship now.\n\nIn terms of social norms, attending a friend's wedding is often expected, but it's also a personal decision. If someone isn't in the wedding party, maybe they feel less obligated, especially if they have a strained relationship or weren't included in planning. However, not attending could be seen as cutting off contact or not supporting the friend. \n\nBut the user is also pointing out that the friend didn't include them in the wedding party, which could be a sign that the friendship has changed. The user is choosing to prioritize their own feelings and time, especially since they feel the friendship is one-sided now. \n\nI think the key points are: the friend didn't communicate properly, the user was hurt and expected a closer role, and the user is making a choice based on their perception of the friendship's current state. In that case, the user's decision might be understandable. They're not the one who caused the rift; the friend moved on. So maybe the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
