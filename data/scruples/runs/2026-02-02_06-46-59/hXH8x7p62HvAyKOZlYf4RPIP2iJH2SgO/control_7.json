I was surprised when I found out on Facebook because I thought this was something she would have told me first. I sent her a private message congratulating her and we spent some time talking about her wedding plans. I assumed I would be her maid of honor since two years ago she was the maid of honor in my wedding. \n\nA few weeks ago, I saw on Facebook that she asked another childhood best friend to be her maid of honor. I was hurt but understood that we have drifted apart the past few years. I still assumed I would be a bridesmaid. \n\nLast week I saw another Facebook post of her and everyone she asked to be in her wedding party. Two of the girls were people she hasn\u2019t been very close with lately. It has now become clear to me that I will not be in her wedding party. \n\nMy feelings are hurt but I understand that this is her day and she should have the people she wants standing up next to her. However, since I am not in the wedding party, WIBTA for not attending the wedding? She lives a few states away so I would need to buy a plane ticket, a hotel room, and request time off of work. This would not be a major hardship but it does not seem worth it to me since I am already embarrassed about not being in the wedding party. \n\nI am not interested in being in a one sided friendship. I would rather focus on friends who want to have me around. I do not plan on staying in contact with her after this. AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person in the scenario is in the wrong for not wanting to attend their friend's wedding because they weren't asked to be in the wedding party. \n\nFirst, I need to break down the situation. The friend has known them for over 15 years, and the person was surprised when they found out about the wedding on Facebook. They thought they'd be the maid of honor since their friend was their maid of honor in their own wedding two years ago. But the friend chose another childhood best friend as the maid of honor. The person was hurt but thought they'd still be a bridesmaid. Then they saw the wedding party list, which included people not close anymore, and realized they weren't in it.\n\nThe person is now considering not attending the wedding because they're hurt and don't want to be in a one-sided friendship. They don't plan to stay in touch after. The question is whether they're in the wrong.\n\nHmm. Well, weddings are usually for close friends and family, and attending is a big deal. Not being asked to be in the wedding party can be hurtful, especially if there's a history of mutual roles. The person might feel slighted, and maybe the friend drifted away. But weddings are the host's choice, so the friend might have valid reasons. However, the person isn't in the wedding party, so maybe they feel it's not worth the effort to attend. \n\nBut culturally, attending a close friend's wedding is expected, even if you're not in the party. Not attending might be seen as rude. But the person is hurt and wants to focus on friends who value them. On the other hand, the friend might have thought they'd be in the wedding party and were wrong. \n\nSo the question is whether the person is in the wrong. If they decide not to attend, is that the right choice? The user wants to know if the answer is A or B. \n\nIn terms of AITA (Am I the Asshole) forums, sometimes the person isn't in the wrong if they're hurt and not in the wedding party. But others might say that attending is important regardless. The person is choosing not to attend, which could be seen as cutting off the friendship over not being in the wedding party. But they also mention not wanting a one-sided friendship. \n\nI think the key points are: the person is hurt, not in the wedding party, and doesn't want to attend. The friend might have drifted, but the hurt is real. However, attending a close friend's wedding is a social norm. So there's a conflict between personal feelings and social expectations. \n\nIn the end, the person isn't necessarily in the wrong because they're making a choice based on their feelings and the friend's actions. They're not attending because they're not in the wedding party and feel the friendship is one-sided. So maybe B, they are not in the wrong. But some might argue that attending is expected. However, the person has a valid reason for their decision.\n"
