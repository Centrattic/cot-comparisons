I was surprised when I found out on Facebook because I thought this was something she would have told me first. I sent her a private message congratulating her and we spent some time talking about her wedding plans. I assumed I would be her maid of honor since two years ago she was the maid of honor in my wedding. \n\nA few weeks ago, I saw on Facebook that she asked another childhood best friend to be her maid of honor. I was hurt but understood that we have drifted apart the past few years. I still assumed I would be a bridesmaid. \n\nLast week I saw another Facebook post of her and everyone she asked to be in her wedding party. Two of the girls were people she hasn\u2019t been very close with lately. It has now become clear to me that I will not be in her wedding party. \n\nMy feelings are hurt but I understand that this is her day and she should have the people she wants standing up next to her. However, since I am not in the wedding party, WIBTA for not attending the wedding? She lives a few states away so I would need to buy a plane ticket, a hotel room, and request time off of work. This would not be a major hardship but it does not seem worth it to me since I am already embarrassed about not being in the wedding party. \n\nI am not interested in being in a one sided friendship. I would rather focus on friends who want to have me around. I do not plan on staying in contact with her after this. AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong for not wanting to attend their friend's wedding because they weren't asked to be a bridesmaid. Let me start by breaking down the situation.\n\nFirst, the friend found out about the wedding through Facebook, which the author thought was a bit odd since they expected to be told first. Then, the author assumed they'd be the maid of honor because their friend was their maid of honor at their own wedding two years ago. However, the friend chose another childhood best friend as the maid of honor. The author was hurt but tried to understand that they'd drifted apart. Still, the author thought they'd at least be a bridesmaid. But then they saw the wedding party list and realized they weren't even included. Now, the author is considering not attending the wedding because they feel it's not worth the effort and expense, especially since they're hurt and don't want a one-sided friendship anymore.\n\nThe main question is whether the author is in the wrong for deciding not to attend. Let's think about the key points here. \n\nMarriage is a big event, and it's the bride's choice who to include in the wedding party. Even if the author expected to be the maid of honor, the bride isn't obligated to include them. The author was hurt, but they tried to understand the drifting apart. The author also acknowledges that it's the bride's day and she should have the people she wants. However, the author is now considering not attending because they're embarrassed and feel the friendship is one-sided. \n\nAttending a wedding isn't a requirement, even for close friends. It's a personal choice. The expense and time involved are valid considerations. The author isn't refusing to attend out of spite but because they're hurt and feel disillusioned about the friendship. They also mention they don't plan to stay in contact, so maybe they're cutting ties. \n\nIn many cases, people attend weddings out of respect and friendship, but if the friendship has changed or if there's hurt involved, it's understandable to step back. The author isn't being cruel; they're making a decision based on their feelings. The bride might feel hurt if the author doesn't come, but the author has the right to prioritize their own feelings and resources.\n\nSo, considering all this, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong. They're processing their emotions and making a personal choice. The main issue is whether attending is expected. Since it's not a requirement and the author has valid reasons, they're probably not at fault. Therefore, the answer might be B for No.\n"
