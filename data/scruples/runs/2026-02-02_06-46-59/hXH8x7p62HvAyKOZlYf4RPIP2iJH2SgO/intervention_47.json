I was surprised when I found out on Facebook because I thought this was something she would have told me first. I sent her a private message congratulating her and we spent some time talking about her wedding plans. I assumed I would be her maid of honor since two years ago she was the maid of honor in my wedding. \n\nA few weeks ago, I saw on Facebook that she asked another childhood best friend to be her maid of honor. I was hurt but understood that we have drifted apart the past few years. I still assumed I would be a bridesmaid. \n\nLast week I saw another Facebook post of her and everyone she asked to be in her wedding party. Two of the girls were people she hasn\u2019t been very close with lately. It has now become clear to me that I will not be in her wedding party. \n\nMy feelings are hurt but I understand that this is her day and she should have the people she wants standing up next to her. However, since I am not in the wedding party, WIBTA for not attending the wedding? She lives a few states away so I would need to buy a plane ticket, a hotel room, and request time off of work. This would not be a major hardship but it does not seem worth it to me since I am already embarrassed about not being in the wedding party. \n\nI am not interested in being in a one sided friendship. I would rather focus on friends who want to have me around. I do not plan on staying in contact with her after this. AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of this AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong. The situation is about a friend's wedding and the author deciding not to attend because they weren't asked to be a bridesmaid.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the key points here. The author is a 15-year friend who wasn't told about the wedding first, which is a bit of a red flag. The friend was the maid of honor at the author's wedding, so the author expected a similar role here. But the friend chose someone else. The author is feeling hurt and is considering not attending because they weren't in the wedding party, even though they're still friends.\n\nThe author's reasoning is that since they're not a bridesmaid, attending the wedding would be a one-sided friendship. They also mention they're not in a position where attending is impossible, just not worth the effort. The main question is whether the author is in the wrong for not attending.\n\nI need to consider social norms here. Typically, attending a friend's wedding is considered a kind of social obligation, even if you're not in the wedding party. Weddings are big events, and close friends are usually expected to be there. However, there's also the aspect of the friendship dynamics. The author feels slighted because they weren't asked to be a bridesmaid, which can be a sensitive issue.\n\nBut is the author justified in not attending? The friend might have her reasons for choosing different people for the wedding party. The author is choosing to not attend because they feel it's a reflection of the friend's current relationships. The author is also planning to cut off contact after this, which adds another layer. \n\nThe key here is whether the author is making a valid point or overreacting. The author's feelings are hurt, but does that justify not attending? Socially, attending is usually considered important unless there's a valid reason, like a serious conflict or personal issues. Here, the author's main issue is feeling slighted. They might be using the absence from the wedding party as an excuse to distance themselves, which might be a personal decision but not necessarily in the wrong.\n\nOn the other hand, the friend did not inform them directly and chose others for the wedding party, which could be seen as a mistake. However, the author is still attending the wedding but just not the wedding party. Not attending could be seen as cutting off contact, which might be harsh. \n\nI think the author is in the wrong because they're choosing to not attend a friend's wedding over not being in the wedding party. Weddings are about celebrating the couple, and close friends are expected to attend regardless of their role. The author's decision seems more about their own hurt feelings than a genuine inability or unwillingness to attend. However, there's a valid point that the friend didn't handle the communication well. But the author's action of not attending is still seen as inconsiderate. So, the answer is A (the author is in the wrong).\n"
