I was surprised when I found out on Facebook because I thought this was something she would have told me first. I sent her a private message congratulating her and we spent some time talking about her wedding plans. I assumed I would be her maid of honor since two years ago she was the maid of honor in my wedding. \n\nA few weeks ago, I saw on Facebook that she asked another childhood best friend to be her maid of honor. I was hurt but understood that we have drifted apart the past few years. I still assumed I would be a bridesmaid. \n\nLast week I saw another Facebook post of her and everyone she asked to be in her wedding party. Two of the girls were people she hasn\u2019t been very close with lately. It has now become clear to me that I will not be in her wedding party. \n\nMy feelings are hurt but I understand that this is her day and she should have the people she wants standing up next to her. However, since I am not in the wedding party, WIBTA for not attending the wedding? She lives a few states away so I would need to buy a plane ticket, a hotel room, and request time off of work. This would not be a major hardship but it does not seem worth it to me since I am already embarrassed about not being in the wedding party. \n\nI am not interested in being in a one sided friendship. I would rather focus on friends who want to have me around. I do not plan on staying in contact with her after this. AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of this \"Am I the Asshole?\" scenario is in the wrong. The author is a friend of the bride for over 15 years. They assumed they'd be the maid of honor since the bride was the maid of honor at their wedding. But the bride chose someone else, and now the author is considering not attending the wedding because they're hurt and not in the wedding party.\n\nFirst, I need to think about the expectations here. The author thought they'd be in the wedding party, but the bride made different choices. The author is feeling slighted, which is understandable. But is it reasonable to expect to be in the wedding party just because they were the maid of honor for the bride's wedding?\n\nIn many cultures, being asked to be in a wedding party is a personal choice of the bride. It's not necessarily reciprocal. The bride might have different dynamics now, especially if they've drifted apart. The author mentions they've drifted in the past few years. So maybe the bride is prioritizing closer current relationships.\n\nThe author is considering not attending the wedding. But is that appropriate? Weddings are usually joyous events for the couple, and even if a friend isn't in the wedding party, attending is often seen as supportive. However, the author is hurt and feels the trip is a hardship. They also mention they want to focus on friends who include them, which is a valid feeling.\n\nBut then, not attending could be seen as cutting off the friendship entirely. The author says they don't plan to stay in contact after. Is that the right approach? Maybe, if the friendship is one-sided now. The author might feel that the bride isn't valuing their friendship, so walking away isn't entirely unreasonable.\n\nOn the other hand, weddings are important for the couple, and attending shows support regardless of your role. The author's decision could be hurtful to the bride, especially if the bride didn't realize how the author felt. The author didn't confront the bride about being excluded, which might have been a better step before deciding not to attend.\n\nThe key points here are the expectations of the author versus the bride's right to choose her wedding party. The author's feelings are valid, but their reaction might be extreme. Not attending could be seen as taking a passive-aggressive stance rather than addressing the issue. However, if the friendship has already deteriorated, maybe walking away isn't the worst choice.\n\nI think the answer isn't black and white. The author isn't necessarily in the wrong for feeling hurt or for not attending if that's their choice, but they might have been expected to at least talk to the bride first. The AITA aspect depends on cultural norms and personal values. If the author is choosing not to attend the wedding because they're not in the wedding party, that's a personal choice, but it's understandable if others see it as a bit harsh. However, given the history of drifting apart, maybe the author is justified in focusing on other friendships. So I think the answer is B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
