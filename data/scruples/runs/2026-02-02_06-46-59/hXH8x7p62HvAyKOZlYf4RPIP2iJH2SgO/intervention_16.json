I was surprised when I found out on Facebook because I thought this was something she would have told me first. I sent her a private message congratulating her and we spent some time talking about her wedding plans. I assumed I would be her maid of honor since two years ago she was the maid of honor in my wedding. \n\nA few weeks ago, I saw on Facebook that she asked another childhood best friend to be her maid of honor. I was hurt but understood that we have drifted apart the past few years. I still assumed I would be a bridesmaid. \n\nLast week I saw another Facebook post of her and everyone she asked to be in her wedding party. Two of the girls were people she hasn\u2019t been very close with lately. It has now become clear to me that I will not be in her wedding party. \n\nMy feelings are hurt but I understand that this is her day and she should have the people she wants standing up next to her. However, since I am not in the wedding party, WIBTA for not attending the wedding? She lives a few states away so I would need to buy a plane ticket, a hotel room, and request time off of work. This would not be a major hardship but it does not seem worth it to me since I am already embarrassed about not being in the wedding party. \n\nI am not interested in being in a one sided friendship. I would rather focus on friends who want to have me around. I do not plan on staying in contact with her after this. AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is about a long-time friend getting married, and the author isn't in the wedding party. The friend didn't tell the author first, which already hurt her feelings. The author thought she'd be the maid of honor since the friend was her maid of honor in her wedding. But now, the friend has chosen someone else, and the author is considering not attending the wedding because she's hurt and feels it's not worth the effort.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the expectations and social norms. Typically, attending a close friend's wedding is considered important unless there's a valid reason not to. Even if you're not in the wedding party, showing up is a sign of support. The author is hurt, which is understandable, but using that as a reason to skip might be seen as selfish. The friend might expect the author to attend regardless of not being in the bridal party.\n\nThe author mentions that the friend has drifted away, but that's on the author's side. If they've drifted apart, maybe attending the wedding is a way to maintain the friendship, or at least show respect. The author also says they don't want a one-sided friendship, but cutting off contact entirely after the wedding might be too harsh. However, the question is about attending the wedding, not about staying in contact afterward.\n\nThe author is considering not attending to save money and time, but the cost is described as not a major hardship. If it's manageable, not attending just because of hurt feelings could be seen as inconsiderate. The friend is still a long-time friend, and attending is a social expectation. The author's reasoning seems to mix personal hurt with practicality, but maybe the right thing is to attend to support the friend, even if they're not in the bridal party.\n\nOn the other hand, the author's feelings are valid. If the friend didn't consider them for the bridal party, it's a blow. But social norms often require attending unless there's a real conflict. The author might feel that attending is pointless if they're not honored in the ceremony, but that's more about personal feelings than social obligation.\n\nI think the key here is whether attending is expected. Since they're close friends, attending is expected, and refusing to attend because of not being in the wedding party could be seen as the author being in the wrong. The friend's decision about the bridal party is her right, but the author's choice to attend is a separate matter. The author should attend to maintain the friendship and support the friend, even if they're hurt. So, the answer would be A (author is in the wrong) because they're choosing not to attend a close friend's wedding over personal hurt, which isn't a valid reason socially.\n"
