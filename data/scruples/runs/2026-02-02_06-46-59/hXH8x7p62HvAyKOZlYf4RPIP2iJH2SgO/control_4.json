I was surprised when I found out on Facebook because I thought this was something she would have told me first. I sent her a private message congratulating her and we spent some time talking about her wedding plans. I assumed I would be her maid of honor since two years ago she was the maid of honor in my wedding. \n\nA few weeks ago, I saw on Facebook that she asked another childhood best friend to be her maid of honor. I was hurt but understood that we have drifted apart the past few years. I still assumed I would be a bridesmaid. \n\nLast week I saw another Facebook post of her and everyone she asked to be in her wedding party. Two of the girls were people she hasn\u2019t been very close with lately. It has now become clear to me that I will not be in her wedding party. \n\nMy feelings are hurt but I understand that this is her day and she should have the people she wants standing up next to her. However, since I am not in the wedding party, WIBTA for not attending the wedding? She lives a few states away so I would need to buy a plane ticket, a hotel room, and request time off of work. This would not be a major hardship but it does not seem worth it to me since I am already embarrassed about not being in the wedding party. \n\nI am not interested in being in a one sided friendship. I would rather focus on friends who want to have me around. I do not plan on staying in contact with her after this. AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is that she's a 15-year friend who wasn't told about the wedding first and wasn't asked to be in the wedding party. She's considering not attending.\n\nFirst, I need to assess if she's in the wrong. Let's break down the key points. The friend didn't tell her first, which is a red flag. They were close, and she assumed she'd be maid of honor. The friend ended up choosing someone else, and now she's hurt but considering not attending because she's not in the wedding party. \n\nMarriage is a big deal, so not attending might be a big decision. But why is she considering not going? Because she's hurt and doesn't want to attend a one-sided friendship. However, weddings are generally seen as important events where people try to attend for the couple, even if they're not in the party. \n\nBut wait, there's the part where she found out through Facebook, which is a bit rude. The friend didn't inform her first. That's a breach of friendship etiquette. Also, the fact that the friend included other people she hasn't been close with might indicate that the friend is prioritizing different things now. \n\nShe's not in the wedding party, so maybe she's not expected to have a central role. But attending is still a social expectation unless there's a valid reason. Her reasoning is that she doesn't want to attend if she's not in the party because it's one-sided. However, friendships can change, and not being in the party doesn't mean she should cut off completely. \n\nBut she's already planning not to stay in contact, which might be a bigger issue. The question is whether she's in the wrong for not attending. If she's hurt and the friend didn't include her properly, maybe she's justified. However, choosing not to attend because she's not in the party could be seen as selfish. \n\nOn the other hand, if the friend didn't respect her by not telling her first, maybe she's justified in not attending. The problem is that weddings are about celebrating the couple, so attending is usually expected. But if the friendship is already drifting, maybe she's within her rights. \n\nIn AITA scenarios, the community often considers intentions and actions. She didn't attend because she's hurt and doesn't want to put in the effort, but it's her choice. However, there's a line between self-respect and cutting someone off. Not attending might be within her right, but it's a personal choice. \n\nSo, is she in the wrong? If she's not attending because she's hurt and the friend didn't include her, maybe not. But if she's just avoiding the effort because she's not in the party, that's different. The fact that she's already planning to cut off contact suggests she's done with the friendship, which might make attending less important. \n\nOverall, the answer might be B (not in the wrong) because the friend didn't include her properly, and she's choosing to focus on her own well-being. But I need to be careful because not attending could be seen as a breach of etiquette unless there's a good reason.\n"
