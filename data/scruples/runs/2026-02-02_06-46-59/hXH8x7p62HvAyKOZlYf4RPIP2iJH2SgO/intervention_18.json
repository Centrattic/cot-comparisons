I was surprised when I found out on Facebook because I thought this was something she would have told me first. I sent her a private message congratulating her and we spent some time talking about her wedding plans. I assumed I would be her maid of honor since two years ago she was the maid of honor in my wedding. \n\nA few weeks ago, I saw on Facebook that she asked another childhood best friend to be her maid of honor. I was hurt but understood that we have drifted apart the past few years. I still assumed I would be a bridesmaid. \n\nLast week I saw another Facebook post of her and everyone she asked to be in her wedding party. Two of the girls were people she hasn\u2019t been very close with lately. It has now become clear to me that I will not be in her wedding party. \n\nMy feelings are hurt but I understand that this is her day and she should have the people she wants standing up next to her. However, since I am not in the wedding party, WIBTA for not attending the wedding? She lives a few states away so I would need to buy a plane ticket, a hotel room, and request time off of work. This would not be a major hardship but it does not seem worth it to me since I am already embarrassed about not being in the wedding party. \n\nI am not interested in being in a one sided friendship. I would rather focus on friends who want to have me around. I do not plan on staying in contact with her after this. AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not wanting to attend their friend's wedding because they weren't asked to be in the wedding party. The author was close friends for 15 years, thought they'd be maid of honor since their friend was maid of honor at their wedding. But now the friend chose someone else, and the author is considering not attending.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the norms around attending weddings. Typically, people attend weddings of close friends even if they aren't in the wedding party. The author might be feeling hurt and wants to make a point, but is that justified? They mention not wanting a one-sided friendship, which is a valid feeling. However, not attending a wedding because you're not in the party could be seen as a petty reaction. \n\nThe author's reasoning is that since they aren't in the wedding party, attending isn't worth the effort. But friends attending each other's weddings is a common courtesy, regardless of being in the party. The author might be overreacting by using this as a reason to cut off the friend. \n\nThey also say they don't plan to stay in contact after. That could be a separate issue. Maybe the author is using the wedding as an excuse to end the friendship, which might be valid if there's been drifting. But the main question is about attending. \n\nThe friend did reach out and talk about the wedding plans, which shows some level of inclusion. The author might be conflating their hurt feelings with the decision to attend. Even if they're hurt, attending could show support. Not attending might be seen as holding a grudge. \n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? If they choose not to attend, maybe they are, because it's a significant event for the friend. However, if the friendship has already been drifting, maybe it's a way to set boundaries. But the act of attending isn't about being in the party, it's about being present for a friend's big day. So maybe the author is in the wrong for not attending. Answer A.\n"
