I was surprised when I found out on Facebook because I thought this was something she would have told me first. I sent her a private message congratulating her and we spent some time talking about her wedding plans. I assumed I would be her maid of honor since two years ago she was the maid of honor in my wedding. \n\nA few weeks ago, I saw on Facebook that she asked another childhood best friend to be her maid of honor. I was hurt but understood that we have drifted apart the past few years. I still assumed I would be a bridesmaid. \n\nLast week I saw another Facebook post of her and everyone she asked to be in her wedding party. Two of the girls were people she hasn\u2019t been very close with lately. It has now become clear to me that I will not be in her wedding party. \n\nMy feelings are hurt but I understand that this is her day and she should have the people she wants standing up next to her. However, since I am not in the wedding party, WIBTA for not attending the wedding? She lives a few states away so I would need to buy a plane ticket, a hotel room, and request time off of work. This would not be a major hardship but it does not seem worth it to me since I am already embarrassed about not being in the wedding party. \n\nI am not interested in being in a one sided friendship. I would rather focus on friends who want to have me around. I do not plan on staying in contact with her after this. AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the author of the question is in the wrong for not attending their friend's wedding after not being asked to be in the wedding party. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The author was a close friend for 15 years and was the maid of honor at the friend's wedding. Now, the friend is getting married, but the author wasn't asked to be in the wedding party. The author is hurt but says they understand it's the friend's day. However, they're considering not attending because they're embarrassed and don't want to be part of a one-sided friendship anymore.\n\nSo, the main question is whether it's wrong to not attend. Let's break it down. Weddings are usually social events where friends and family are invited, even if they're not in the wedding party. Not being in the party doesn't mean you shouldn't attend. The author is making a choice based on their feelings of being slighted. But is that a valid reason?\n\nOn one hand, the author has a right to their feelings. If they feel hurt and want to distance themselves, that's their choice. On the other hand, weddings are important events for the couple, and attending is a social norm unless there's a good reason not to. The author is using the lack of being in the party as a reason to skip, which might come off as petty. \n\nAlso, the author mentions that they're willing to spend money and time to attend. They just don't think it's worth it because of their embarrassment. But is attending a wedding worth it just because you're not in the party? Maybe not, but the question is about being in the wrong. \n\nThe author's intention is to focus on friends who want their presence. That's a valid reason to let the friendship fade, but not attending the wedding could be seen as cutting ties. However, the friend didn't reach out to the author first, either, which is a point in the author's favor. \n\nIn terms of social etiquette, it's generally expected to attend if you're invited, regardless of your role. The author wasn't invited to the wedding party, but they might still be invited as a friend. If they are invited as a guest, not attending without a reason might be considered rude. But if they're not invited, then they don't have to go. However, the friend might have invited them. The author hasn't mentioned being explicitly invited or not, but since they saw Facebook posts, maybe they were just not in the party but still a guest. \n\nIf the author decides not to attend to avoid being embarrassed, is that wrong? It's their choice, but maybe they should attend and handle their feelings there. Alternatively, if they feel the friendship is ending, not attending might be a way to move on. \n\nIn terms of AITA (Am I the Asshole?), the key is whether the author's action is unreasonable. If the friend didn't ask them to be in the party, maybe they're overreacting, but the author's feelings are valid. However, the act of not attending might be seen as harsh, especially if the friend didn't communicate directly. \n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? If they are invited, not attending could be considered rude. But if they're not invited, then it's not. The scenario isn't clear on whether the author is invited. Given the friend didn't reach out first and the author found out via Facebook, maybe the friend didn't consider the author important enough to include in the party or even as a guest. But that's speculative. \n\nIn summary, if the author is still invited as a guest even without being in the party, not attending without a reason might be inconsiderate. However, if the author feels the friendship is one-sided and they're moving on, then it's a personal choice and not necessarily wrong. The answer depends on the specific circumstances of the invitation, which aren't fully clear here. But given the information, the author might be in the wrong if they're expected to attend but choose not to out of spite. But if they're not invited, then they aren't in the wrong. Since the author wasn't explicitly told they weren't invited, maybe the friend might have still wanted them to attend, so the author's choice to skip is the issue. Therefore, the answer might be A (they're in the wrong), but I'm not entirely sure.\n"
