I was surprised when I found out on Facebook because I thought this was something she would have told me first. I sent her a private message congratulating her and we spent some time talking about her wedding plans. I assumed I would be her maid of honor since two years ago she was the maid of honor in my wedding. \n\nA few weeks ago, I saw on Facebook that she asked another childhood best friend to be her maid of honor. I was hurt but understood that we have drifted apart the past few years. I still assumed I would be a bridesmaid. \n\nLast week I saw another Facebook post of her and everyone she asked to be in her wedding party. Two of the girls were people she hasn\u2019t been very close with lately. It has now become clear to me that I will not be in her wedding party. \n\nMy feelings are hurt but I understand that this is her day and she should have the people she wants standing up next to her. However, since I am not in the wedding party, WIBTA for not attending the wedding? She lives a few states away so I would need to buy a plane ticket, a hotel room, and request time off of work. This would not be a major hardship but it does not seem worth it to me since I am already embarrassed about not being in the wedding party. \n\nI am not interested in being in a one sided friendship. I would rather focus on friends who want to have me around. I do not plan on staying in contact with her after this. AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about a friend's wedding and deciding not to attend because they weren't asked to be in the wedding party. \n\nFirst, the author and the friend have been friends for over 15 years. The friend was a maid of honor at the author's wedding, so the author expected to be the maid of honor here. But the friend chose someone else. The author felt hurt but understood they had drifted apart. However, when the author saw the wedding party list, it included people the friend isn't close to anymore. The author is now considering not attending because they aren't in the wedding party and feel it's a one-sided friendship.\n\nSo the main question is whether not attending is wrong. Let's break it down. \n\nWeddings are big events with many costs involved. The author mentions that attending would require a plane ticket, hotel, and time off work. While they say it's not a major hardship, it's still an expense and effort. The author feels hurt and embarrassed for not being in the wedding party. They want to focus on friends who value them.\n\nOn one hand, weddings are about the couple celebrating. The author might feel unappreciated, especially since they thought the friend would include them. On the other hand, not attending because you weren't in the wedding party could be seen as holding a grudge. The friend might not have known how important it was to the author to be in the wedding party. \n\nAnother angle: The author didn't confront the friend directly. They found out through Facebook posts. Maybe they should have talked to the friend to express their feelings before deciding not to attend. By not attending, the author might be cutting off a long-term friendship over an unspoken expectation. \n\nBut the author also says they don't want a one-sided friendship and plan to stop contact after this. That shows they're prioritizing their own feelings. However, not attending a close friend's wedding is a big step. \n\nCultural norms might play a role here. In many places, attending a close friend's wedding is expected regardless of being in the wedding party. But expectations vary. The author might feel that their exclusion is a slight, so their reaction is understandable. \n\nIn conclusion, the author's decision could be seen as reasonable if they feel the friendship is one-sided. However, not attending without addressing the issue with the friend might be considered cutting off communication abruptly. The right answer depends on whether the author acted out of justified hurt or overreacted. Since the author is hurt and considering ending the friendship, maybe they aren't in the wrong. But if the decision is based on unspoken expectations and not discussing it, then maybe they are. Hmm.\n"
