I was surprised when I found out on Facebook because I thought this was something she would have told me first. I sent her a private message congratulating her and we spent some time talking about her wedding plans. I assumed I would be her maid of honor since two years ago she was the maid of honor in my wedding. \n\nA few weeks ago, I saw on Facebook that she asked another childhood best friend to be her maid of honor. I was hurt but understood that we have drifted apart the past few years. I still assumed I would be a bridesmaid. \n\nLast week I saw another Facebook post of her and everyone she asked to be in her wedding party. Two of the girls were people she hasn\u2019t been very close with lately. It has now become clear to me that I will not be in her wedding party. \n\nMy feelings are hurt but I understand that this is her day and she should have the people she wants standing up next to her. However, since I am not in the wedding party, WIBTA for not attending the wedding? She lives a few states away so I would need to buy a plane ticket, a hotel room, and request time off of work. This would not be a major hardship but it does not seem worth it to me since I am already embarrassed about not being in the wedding party. \n\nI am not interested in being in a one sided friendship. I would rather focus on friends who want to have me around. I do not plan on staying in contact with her after this. AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of the AITA story is in the wrong. The situation is about a friend not being invited as a bridesmaid and considering not attending the wedding because of that.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the key points. The author and their friend have been friends for 15 years. The author assumed they would be the maid of honor since their friend was the maid of honor in their wedding. But the friend chose someone else, and the author is now upset about not being in the wedding party. They're considering not attending because of the hurt feelings and the cost involved. The author says they don't want a one-sided friendship and plan to cut off contact after the wedding.\n\nThe user thinks the author is in the wrong. Let me break this down. The main issue is whether attending the wedding is expected regardless of being in the wedding party. The author is using the absence from the wedding party as a reason to not attend, which could be seen as punitive. \n\nFriendships often require effort from both sides. The author mentions drifting apart in recent years, which might explain why the friend didn't choose them as a bridesmaid. However, even if the friendship has changed, attending a wedding is a common social expectation unless there's a valid reason. The author is using the decision to not attend as a way to express hurt feelings, which could be seen as holding a grudge.\n\nAnother angle: the author is prioritizing their own feelings over maintaining the friendship. They're not attending because they're hurt, but the friend might not realize the depth of the author's feelings. However, the author is also acknowledging that the wedding is the friend's day and that the friend has the right to choose her wedding party. \n\nFinancial and time considerations are mentioned, but the author admits it's not a major hardship. That suggests other factors are at play. The author is using the opportunity to cut ties, which might be a mature decision if the friendship has indeed become one-sided. But by not attending, they're taking an action that affects the friend, which could be seen as inconsiderate.\n\nIn AITA scenarios, the community often emphasizes social norms and expectations. Attending a close friend's wedding is typically expected, even if you're not in the wedding party. The author's decision to not attend because of being excluded from the wedding party could be seen as inconsiderate and cutting off contact as a punishment. \n\nHowever, there's also the aspect of the friendship dynamics. If the author feels ignored or that the friend has moved on, maybe their decision is a reflection of their own boundaries. But the key here is that the author is using the wedding attendance as a way to enforce their expectations on the friend, which might not be fair.\n\nSo, considering all this, the author is prioritizing their own hurt feelings over attending a significant event in their friend's life, which is not typical social behavior. The answer would be AITA, meaning the author is in the wrong for not attending the wedding. The correct choice is A.\n"
