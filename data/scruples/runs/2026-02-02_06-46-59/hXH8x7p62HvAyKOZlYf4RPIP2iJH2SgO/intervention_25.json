I was surprised when I found out on Facebook because I thought this was something she would have told me first. I sent her a private message congratulating her and we spent some time talking about her wedding plans. I assumed I would be her maid of honor since two years ago she was the maid of honor in my wedding. \n\nA few weeks ago, I saw on Facebook that she asked another childhood best friend to be her maid of honor. I was hurt but understood that we have drifted apart the past few years. I still assumed I would be a bridesmaid. \n\nLast week I saw another Facebook post of her and everyone she asked to be in her wedding party. Two of the girls were people she hasn\u2019t been very close with lately. It has now become clear to me that I will not be in her wedding party. \n\nMy feelings are hurt but I understand that this is her day and she should have the people she wants standing up next to her. However, since I am not in the wedding party, WIBTA for not attending the wedding? She lives a few states away so I would need to buy a plane ticket, a hotel room, and request time off of work. This would not be a major hardship but it does not seem worth it to me since I am already embarrassed about not being in the wedding party. \n\nI am not interested in being in a one sided friendship. I would rather focus on friends who want to have me around. I do not plan on staying in contact with her after this. AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is about a long-time friend's wedding. The author was expecting to be the maid of honor because their friend was her maid of honor in her wedding two years ago. But now, the friend chose someone else, and the author is considering not attending because she's not in the wedding party.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the friendship's history. They've been friends for 15 years, which is a significant amount of time. The author was surprised the friend didn't tell her first about the wedding, which might indicate some hurt feelings there. Then, the friend did choose another childhood friend as the maid of honor, and two others who aren't as close. The author feels hurt but also wants to make a statement by not attending.\n\nNow, the question is whether it's acceptable to not attend the wedding. Weddings are big events, and while the author is hurt, is not attending a reasonable response? On one hand, the author might feel it's a slight not being included in the wedding party. But on the other hand, the friend might have her own reasons, like wanting to include others or feeling closer to them at the moment. The author is saying she doesn't want a one-sided friendship anymore.\n\nI need to think about social expectations. Generally, attending a close friend's wedding is considered important, even if you're not part of the wedding party. But maybe the author's feelings are valid. However, walking out on a long-term friend's wedding could be seen as cutting off contact, which might be harsh. The author is planning not to stay in contact either, which might be a bigger issue. \n\nIs the author overreacting? Maybe. The wedding is the friend's choice, and while it's hurtful not to be in the wedding party, the author is making a big decision based on that. Not attending could be seen as a punishment, which might not be fair. The friend might not have intended to hurt her feelings, even if she did choose someone else. \n\nAlso, the author mentions it's not a major hardship to attend. So, if she can afford the trip and time off, maybe she should go as a sign of respect and to maintain the friendship. But if she's planning not to stay in contact anyway, maybe she's already decided to cut ties. \n\nBut is that the right approach? Cutting off contact because you weren't chosen as a bridesmaid might be extreme. The author might be right to feel hurt, but responding by not attending the wedding could be seen as inconsiderate. The friend might be expecting the author to attend regardless, given their long history. \n\nIn summary, while the author's feelings are valid, using non-attendance as a response might be seen as inconsiderate and cutting off contact could be too harsh. So maybe the author is in the wrong here by choosing not to attend and end the friendship over this.\n"
