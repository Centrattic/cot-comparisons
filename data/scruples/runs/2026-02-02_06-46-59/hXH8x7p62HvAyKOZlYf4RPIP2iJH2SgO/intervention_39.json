I was surprised when I found out on Facebook because I thought this was something she would have told me first. I sent her a private message congratulating her and we spent some time talking about her wedding plans. I assumed I would be her maid of honor since two years ago she was the maid of honor in my wedding. \n\nA few weeks ago, I saw on Facebook that she asked another childhood best friend to be her maid of honor. I was hurt but understood that we have drifted apart the past few years. I still assumed I would be a bridesmaid. \n\nLast week I saw another Facebook post of her and everyone she asked to be in her wedding party. Two of the girls were people she hasn\u2019t been very close with lately. It has now become clear to me that I will not be in her wedding party. \n\nMy feelings are hurt but I understand that this is her day and she should have the people she wants standing up next to her. However, since I am not in the wedding party, WIBTA for not attending the wedding? She lives a few states away so I would need to buy a plane ticket, a hotel room, and request time off of work. This would not be a major hardship but it does not seem worth it to me since I am already embarrassed about not being in the wedding party. \n\nI am not interested in being in a one sided friendship. I would rather focus on friends who want to have me around. I do not plan on staying in contact with her after this. AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that the author is a 15-year friend of the person getting married. The author thought they were going to be the maid of honor since the friend was their maid of honor two years ago. But then, the friend chose someone else, a childhood best friend, who the author thought they had drifted from. The author was hurt but understood, assuming they'd still be a bridesmaid. But then, the author saw the list of the wedding party and realized they aren't even a bridesmaid. Now, the author is considering not attending the wedding because they don't want to go as just a guest, especially since it's not a major hardship but feels embarrassing.\n\nThe user thinks the author is in the wrong. I need to evaluate that. First, the author's reasoning. They feel that since they weren't included in the wedding party, it's a one-sided friendship and they'd rather focus on other friends. The question is, is that a valid reason to not attend? \n\nTraditionally, weddings are events where friends and family gather to support the couple, regardless of their role in the wedding party. Even if you're not a bridesmaid or maid of honor, attending can be a gesture of goodwill and respect. The author is hurt because they weren't invited in the role they expected. But is it their place to decide not to attend because of that? \n\nI should consider the dynamics of the friendship. The friend didn't inform the author first, which is a red flag. Maybe that's a bigger issue. But the author is choosing to not attend the wedding as a result. That could be seen as cutting off the friend entirely, especially since they've known each other for 15 years. The author mentioned they don't plan to stay in contact afterwards, which might be fair if they feel the friendship has become one-sided. However, not attending the wedding could be hurtful to the bride, who might not expect that. \n\nOn the other hand, the author has the right to set boundaries. If they feel the friendship has deteriorated and the friend is not making an effort to include them (like informing them first), then their decision to not attend might be a way to protect their feelings. Weddings are also expensive and require time, so the author is considering the effort involved. \n\nBut is it right to not attend a close friend's wedding? Many people would attend regardless of their role because it's a significant life event. The author's choice could be viewed as selfish or immature, especially if they've been friends for so long. However, if the friendship has indeed become one-sided, maybe the author is justified in their decision. \n\nThe key points are: 15-year friendship, not being informed first, exclusion from the wedding party, and the author's choice to not attend. The bride's perspective is also important. The author might be reacting to hurt feelings, but attending the wedding as a guest might still be appropriate. The author's plan to cut off contact after the wedding is separate from attending the event. \n\nI think the author is not in the wrong because they're prioritizing their feelings and setting boundaries. However, some might argue that not attending a long-time friend's wedding is inconsiderate. But given the context of being excluded and the drift in the friendship, the author's decision is understandable. So the answer is B.\n"
