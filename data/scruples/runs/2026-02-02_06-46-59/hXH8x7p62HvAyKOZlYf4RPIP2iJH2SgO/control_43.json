I was surprised when I found out on Facebook because I thought this was something she would have told me first. I sent her a private message congratulating her and we spent some time talking about her wedding plans. I assumed I would be her maid of honor since two years ago she was the maid of honor in my wedding. \n\nA few weeks ago, I saw on Facebook that she asked another childhood best friend to be her maid of honor. I was hurt but understood that we have drifted apart the past few years. I still assumed I would be a bridesmaid. \n\nLast week I saw another Facebook post of her and everyone she asked to be in her wedding party. Two of the girls were people she hasn\u2019t been very close with lately. It has now become clear to me that I will not be in her wedding party. \n\nMy feelings are hurt but I understand that this is her day and she should have the people she wants standing up next to her. However, since I am not in the wedding party, WIBTA for not attending the wedding? She lives a few states away so I would need to buy a plane ticket, a hotel room, and request time off of work. This would not be a major hardship but it does not seem worth it to me since I am already embarrassed about not being in the wedding party. \n\nI am not interested in being in a one sided friendship. I would rather focus on friends who want to have me around. I do not plan on staying in contact with her after this. AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the person is in the wrong here. The situation is about a friend's wedding they're not attending because they weren't asked to be a bridesmaid. Let's break down the key points.\n\nFirst, the person has known the friend for 15 years. The friend found out about the wedding from Facebook instead of being told directly, which is a bit awkward. The user thought they'd be the maid of honor since their friend was in their wedding two years ago. But then another childhood friend was chosen as the maid of honor, and the user wasn't in the wedding party at all. They feel hurt but understand the friend's choice. Now they're considering not attending the wedding because they're not part of the party.\n\nThe main question is whether it's wrong to skip the wedding. Let's consider social norms. Generally, attending a friend's wedding is expected, especially a long-time friend. But there are exceptions. If someone isn't in the wedding party, maybe they can still attend. But the user feels it's not worth the expense and effort because they're already hurt and don't want a one-sided friendship anymore.\n\nThe user's reasons are emotional. They're hurt and don't want to invest time/money into a friendship that's become one-sided. But is that a valid reason? Some might say that attending is important regardless of being in the party, as it's a significant event. Others might argue that if the friendship has drifted, it's okay to step back.\n\nAlso, the user isn't staying in contact after, which adds to the one-sidedness. But maybe the friend's decision to not include them in the party was due to the drift. The user's choice to not attend could be seen as cutting ties, which might be justified if they feel the friendship isn't mutual anymore.\n\nIn terms of right or wrong, it's a bit subjective. The user isn't doing anything malicious by not attending, but they might be cutting off a long-term friend. However, if the friendship has been drifting, maybe it's natural. The user isn't in the wedding party, so maybe the expense and effort aren't worth it. Socially, not attending might be seen as rude, but the user's reasoning is understandable. \n\nI think the answer hinges on whether attending is expected even without being in the party. If the user wants to focus on other friends, maybe it's okay. But if the friend expects all close friends to attend, then not going could be seen as a slight. However, the user hasn't been in close contact recently either. So it's a bit of a gray area. The user's not in the wrong for choosing to not attend, especially given the circumstances. They are making a personal choice based on their feelings and the current state of the friendship. So the answer might be B (not in the wrong).\n"
