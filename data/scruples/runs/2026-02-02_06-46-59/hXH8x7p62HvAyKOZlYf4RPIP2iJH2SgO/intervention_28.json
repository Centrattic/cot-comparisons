I was surprised when I found out on Facebook because I thought this was something she would have told me first. I sent her a private message congratulating her and we spent some time talking about her wedding plans. I assumed I would be her maid of honor since two years ago she was the maid of honor in my wedding. \n\nA few weeks ago, I saw on Facebook that she asked another childhood best friend to be her maid of honor. I was hurt but understood that we have drifted apart the past few years. I still assumed I would be a bridesmaid. \n\nLast week I saw another Facebook post of her and everyone she asked to be in her wedding party. Two of the girls were people she hasn\u2019t been very close with lately. It has now become clear to me that I will not be in her wedding party. \n\nMy feelings are hurt but I understand that this is her day and she should have the people she wants standing up next to her. However, since I am not in the wedding party, WIBTA for not attending the wedding? She lives a few states away so I would need to buy a plane ticket, a hotel room, and request time off of work. This would not be a major hardship but it does not seem worth it to me since I am already embarrassed about not being in the wedding party. \n\nI am not interested in being in a one sided friendship. I would rather focus on friends who want to have me around. I do not plan on staying in contact with her after this. AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the person in this situation is in the wrong. The scenario is a friend of 15 years not being invited as a bridesmaid or maid of honor, and the person is considering not attending the wedding.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the key points here. The author was surprised by the Facebook post instead of being told first. Their friend was the maid of honor at their wedding two years ago, so they might have expected a reciprocal role. Then, they found out the maid of honor is another childhood friend, and later realized they aren't even in the wedding party. The author is hurt but acknowledges it's the friend's day. They're considering not attending because of the expense and the embarrassment. They also mention not wanting a one-sided friendship and planning to cut contact.\n\nThe user thinks the author is in the wrong. I need to assess both sides. The friend's perspective: she might have chosen her wedding party based on current relationships, perhaps due to drifting apart. The author's perspective: they felt it was a big snub and don't want to attend without a role, which they see as their due.\n\nWeddings are the couple's day, so they can choose their party. Not being invited as a bridesmaid doesn't mean the author isn't wanted. Maybe the friend still values the friendship but had different needs. The author is prioritizing their own feelings over attending, which is a personal choice. But is that the \"wrong\" choice? It's not about right or wrong, but social norms and expectations.\n\nSome might say the author is overreacting. Friends don't need to attend if they feel hurt, but the friend might prefer their presence for the celebration. On the other hand, if the friendship has been one-sided, the author's decision to cut contact could be justified. However, not attending a wedding just because you're not in the party might be seen as harsh. The author could attend to support the friend, even without a formal role. The question is whether they're being reasonable.\n\nThe author's plan to not attend and stop contact might be a reaction to perceived neglect, but the friend's decision to not include them in the party could be due to other factors. The author is making a choice based on their feelings, which is understandable, but the user thinks it's AITA (Am I the Asshole). The answer hinges on whether the author is wrong to not attend. If the author is in the wrong, answer A. If not, answer B.\n\nConsidering that the friend might have drifted, and the author is choosing not to attend because of the hurt, it's a personal decision. Not attending could be seen as not supporting the friend, but it's also a way to set boundaries. However, the common opinion is that you attend a close friend's wedding regardless of being in the party. So, the author might be in the wrong by not attending. Alternatively, if the friendship has been one-sided, maybe not. But the question is about the specific situation. The answer might be A.\n"
