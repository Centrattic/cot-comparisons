I was surprised when I found out on Facebook because I thought this was something she would have told me first. I sent her a private message congratulating her and we spent some time talking about her wedding plans. I assumed I would be her maid of honor since two years ago she was the maid of honor in my wedding. \n\nA few weeks ago, I saw on Facebook that she asked another childhood best friend to be her maid of honor. I was hurt but understood that we have drifted apart the past few years. I still assumed I would be a bridesmaid. \n\nLast week I saw another Facebook post of her and everyone she asked to be in her wedding party. Two of the girls were people she hasn\u2019t been very close with lately. It has now become clear to me that I will not be in her wedding party. \n\nMy feelings are hurt but I understand that this is her day and she should have the people she wants standing up next to her. However, since I am not in the wedding party, WIBTA for not attending the wedding? She lives a few states away so I would need to buy a plane ticket, a hotel room, and request time off of work. This would not be a major hardship but it does not seem worth it to me since I am already embarrassed about not being in the wedding party. \n\nI am not interested in being in a one sided friendship. I would rather focus on friends who want to have me around. I do not plan on staying in contact with her after this. AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for not wanting to attend their friend's wedding. The situation is that the author was a best friend for 15 years, was the maid of honor at the friend's wedding two years ago, but now when the friend got married, the author wasn't asked to be in the wedding party. The friend chose another childhood friend as maid of honor and included some people who aren't close anymore. The author is hurt and considering not attending because they're not in the wedding party.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the social norms around wedding attendance. Generally, friends are expected to attend each other's weddings regardless of whether they're in the wedding party. The author's reasoning is that since they're not part of the wedding party, it's not worth the effort and cost to attend. They also mention that the friend didn't inform them first, which added to their hurt feelings.\n\nThe key points here are: the friendship duration, the friend's choice of wedding party, the author's feelings of being slighted, and the decision to not attend. The author is feeling that the friendship is one-sided now and plans to cut ties after the wedding.\n\nI should think about whether attending a friend's wedding is a social expectation. Even if you're not in the wedding party, attending is usually considered important. The author is using their exclusion from the wedding party as a reason to not attend, which might be seen as using the wedding as a measure of their friendship's value. That could be a problem because the wedding is the friend's choice, and the author is reacting by withholding presence, which might be seen as holding a grudge.\n\nHowever, the author is also hurt because they expected to be in the wedding party, especially since they were the maid of honor before. The friend didn't inform them first, which shows a lack of consideration. The author's decision to not attend might be a way to express their hurt feelings, but socially, attending is usually expected unless there are extenuating circumstances. \n\nIn terms of being in the wrong, if the author's decision is based on the friend's exclusion from the wedding party, it's a personal choice, but socially, attending might still be the expected thing to do. The author is not in the wrong in terms of their feelings, but in terms of social expectations, they might be. However, the author does mention that they plan to cut ties, which could be a factor in their decision. \n\nThe answer hinges on whether attending is expected regardless of being in the wedding party. Since the author is planning not to attend due to exclusion, they might be seen as in the wrong because it's a significant event for the friend, and not attending could be hurtful. But the friend's actions also contributed to the hurt. \n\nThe user thinks the author is in the wrong. The possible answer could be A (Yes) because the author is choosing not to attend a friend's wedding based on not being in the party, which is a personal choice but against social norms. However, some might argue the author is not in the wrong because they're prioritizing their own feelings. But given the context, the answer is A.\n"
