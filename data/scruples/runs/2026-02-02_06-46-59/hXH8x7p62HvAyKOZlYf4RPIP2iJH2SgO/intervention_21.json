I was surprised when I found out on Facebook because I thought this was something she would have told me first. I sent her a private message congratulating her and we spent some time talking about her wedding plans. I assumed I would be her maid of honor since two years ago she was the maid of honor in my wedding. \n\nA few weeks ago, I saw on Facebook that she asked another childhood best friend to be her maid of honor. I was hurt but understood that we have drifted apart the past few years. I still assumed I would be a bridesmaid. \n\nLast week I saw another Facebook post of her and everyone she asked to be in her wedding party. Two of the girls were people she hasn\u2019t been very close with lately. It has now become clear to me that I will not be in her wedding party. \n\nMy feelings are hurt but I understand that this is her day and she should have the people she wants standing up next to her. However, since I am not in the wedding party, WIBTA for not attending the wedding? She lives a few states away so I would need to buy a plane ticket, a hotel room, and request time off of work. This would not be a major hardship but it does not seem worth it to me since I am already embarrassed about not being in the wedding party. \n\nI am not interested in being in a one sided friendship. I would rather focus on friends who want to have me around. I do not plan on staying in contact with her after this. AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person in the given situation is in the wrong. The scenario is about a long-time friend not being invited to the wedding as a bridesmaid or maid of honor, and considering not attending because of that.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the key points. The friend found out via Facebook, which upset her. She assumed she'd be maid of honor since her friend was in hers. But the friend chose someone else, and now the author is thinking of skipping the wedding because she's not in the party. She mentions it's not a major hardship but doesn't want to attend. She also says she doesn't want a one-sided friendship anymore.\n\nNow, the user thinks the author is wrong, but wants to know. Let me break it down. The main question is whether it's right to not attend the wedding over not being in the bridal party. The author's reasoning is that since she's not part of the party, it's not worth the effort and she's already hurt. She also plans to cut ties.\n\nI should consider social norms. Weddings are usually attended by close friends regardless of being in the party. Not attending might seem hurtful. The friend might have had reasons for not including her, like drift over time. The author's reaction is a choice, but is it wrong? Maybe the author is overreacting. But maybe she's justified in feeling hurt.\n\nThe author mentions she's not interested in a one-sided relationship. So maybe she's making a boundary. However, attending a wedding is a common courtesy unless there's a conflict. The author's decision not to attend might be seen as cutting off the friend entirely, which could be hurtful if the friend didn't realize the impact.\n\nBut the author is within her rights to choose to not attend. However, socially, it's expected to attend for a close friend's wedding unless there's a valid reason. The author's reason is personal hurt, which might not be sufficient for most people. So maybe the answer is A, she's in the wrong. But others might argue she's protecting her feelings.\n\nAlternatively, if the friendship has indeed drifted, maybe her decision isn't wrong. The key is whether the author is justified in her decision. If she's not in the party, does that negate the need to attend? Not necessarily. Friends attend each other's weddings regardless of being in the party. So the author's choice could be seen as inconsiderate. Therefore, AITA would say she's in the wrong. So the answer is A.\n"
