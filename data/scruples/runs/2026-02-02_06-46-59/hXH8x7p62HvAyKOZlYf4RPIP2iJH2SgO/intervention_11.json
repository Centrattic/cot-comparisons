I was surprised when I found out on Facebook because I thought this was something she would have told me first. I sent her a private message congratulating her and we spent some time talking about her wedding plans. I assumed I would be her maid of honor since two years ago she was the maid of honor in my wedding. \n\nA few weeks ago, I saw on Facebook that she asked another childhood best friend to be her maid of honor. I was hurt but understood that we have drifted apart the past few years. I still assumed I would be a bridesmaid. \n\nLast week I saw another Facebook post of her and everyone she asked to be in her wedding party. Two of the girls were people she hasn\u2019t been very close with lately. It has now become clear to me that I will not be in her wedding party. \n\nMy feelings are hurt but I understand that this is her day and she should have the people she wants standing up next to her. However, since I am not in the wedding party, WIBTA for not attending the wedding? She lives a few states away so I would need to buy a plane ticket, a hotel room, and request time off of work. This would not be a major hardship but it does not seem worth it to me since I am already embarrassed about not being in the wedding party. \n\nI am not interested in being in a one sided friendship. I would rather focus on friends who want to have me around. I do not plan on staying in contact with her after this. AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong for not wanting to attend their friend's wedding because they weren't chosen as a bridesmaid.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The person has been friends with their friend for 15 years. They found out about the wedding on Facebook, which surprised them because they expected the friend to tell them first. They assumed they would be the maid of honor since the friend was the maid of honor at their wedding two years ago. But the friend chose another childhood best friend for the role. The author still thought they'd be a bridesmaid, but later realized they weren't in the wedding party at all. Now, they're considering not attending, which would involve some expenses and time off work, and they're thinking of cutting off contact afterward.\n\nThe key points here are the expectations and the decision not to attend. The author feels hurt and embarrassed. They mention that they don't want a one-sided friendship anymore. The question is whether they're wrong to not attend because they weren't in the wedding party.\n\nFrom a social perspective, attending a friend's wedding is often seen as a kind gesture, regardless of being in the wedding party. Weddings are significant events, and even if you're not part of the bridal party, showing up can be a way to support the friend. However, the author is facing personal costs and emotional distress. They also plan to cut off contact, which might indicate deeper issues in the friendship.\n\nThe friend didn't inform them first, which could be a point against the friend's consideration. But the author is now making a decision based on their own feelings. It's a balance between respecting the friend's choices and taking care of one's own well-being.\n\nIn AITA scenarios, the community often looks at both sides. If the author is choosing not to attend because of hurt feelings, some might say it's a bit self-centered. Others might argue that the friend didn't show proper respect by not informing them first or including them, especially after being a maid of honor themselves. The author's plan to cut off contact adds another layer, suggesting they feel betrayed or unappreciated.\n\nBut is it wrong to not attend? Attending a wedding is usually expected, but if the person is not in the wedding party, maybe it's less expected. However, the author is in a position where they can afford the trip and time off, so it's not like they can't attend if they wanted. Their decision not to attend might be seen as a reaction to being excluded, which could be justified if the friend was inconsiderate.\n\nBut the friend might have her reasons for the guest list and bridal party. The author's assumption that they should be included might be based on their previous roles, but the friend could have chosen differently. The author is now punishing the friend by not attending, which could be seen as holding a grudge. However, if the friendship has drifted, maybe it's time to move on.\n\nSo, considering all that, the author might be in the wrong if they're prioritizing their hurt feelings over the friendship. But if the friend was inconsiderate by not informing them first and excluding them without explanation, the author's decision could be seen as justified. It's a bit of a gray area. However, in AITA discussions, people often emphasize attending weddings even if you're not in the party, as it's a big day. So maybe the answer is AITA for the author.\n"
