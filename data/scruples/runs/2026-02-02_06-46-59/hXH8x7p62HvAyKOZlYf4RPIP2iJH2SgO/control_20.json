I was surprised when I found out on Facebook because I thought this was something she would have told me first. I sent her a private message congratulating her and we spent some time talking about her wedding plans. I assumed I would be her maid of honor since two years ago she was the maid of honor in my wedding. \n\nA few weeks ago, I saw on Facebook that she asked another childhood best friend to be her maid of honor. I was hurt but understood that we have drifted apart the past few years. I still assumed I would be a bridesmaid. \n\nLast week I saw another Facebook post of her and everyone she asked to be in her wedding party. Two of the girls were people she hasn\u2019t been very close with lately. It has now become clear to me that I will not be in her wedding party. \n\nMy feelings are hurt but I understand that this is her day and she should have the people she wants standing up next to her. However, since I am not in the wedding party, WIBTA for not attending the wedding? She lives a few states away so I would need to buy a plane ticket, a hotel room, and request time off of work. This would not be a major hardship but it does not seem worth it to me since I am already embarrassed about not being in the wedding party. \n\nI am not interested in being in a one sided friendship. I would rather focus on friends who want to have me around. I do not plan on staying in contact with her after this. AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not wanting to attend their friend's wedding because they weren't asked into the wedding party. The author has been friends with this person for over 15 years. Initially, they thought they'd be the maid of honor because the friend was their maid of honor in their wedding two years ago. But the friend chose someone else, and then even people who haven't been close recently.\n\nThe author feels hurt but understands it's the friend's choice. However, they're considering not attending the wedding because they weren't asked to be in the wedding party. They mention it's a few states away, so there's a financial and time commitment involved. The author says they don't want a one-sided friendship anymore and plan to cut off contact after this.\n\nFirst, I need to consider social norms around weddings. Generally, attending a friend's wedding is expected unless there are valid reasons, like a major conflict of interest, family issues, or personal emergencies. The author's reasoning here is their exclusion from the wedding party, which they feel is a slight. But does that justify not attending?\n\nThe key points here are the friendship's duration and the author's current feelings. The author feels the friendship has been drifting, and the friend made choices that excluded them. The author is prioritizing their own emotional well-being by choosing not to attend an event where they might feel humiliated or left out. \n\nHowever, some might argue that attending a wedding is about supporting the friend's big day regardless of personal hurt feelings. Others might say that if the friend excluded them from the wedding party, the author isn't obligated to attend. The answer depends on cultural expectations and personal boundaries. \n\nIn many cases, people attend weddings of close friends even if they're not in the party. But if the friendship has already deteriorated, maybe it's reasonable to step back. The author isn't cutting contact entirely but is focusing on other relationships. \n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? It's a tricky balance. The author's feelings are valid, and they have the right to prioritize their own well-being. However, some might see not attending as a breach of friendship norms. But given the circumstances of being excluded and the drift in the friendship, maybe it's understandable. \n\nI think the answer leans towards B (No), because the author isn't obligated to attend if they feel excluded and the friendship isn't reciprocal. They're making a personal choice based on their emotional needs, which is a valid reason.\n"
