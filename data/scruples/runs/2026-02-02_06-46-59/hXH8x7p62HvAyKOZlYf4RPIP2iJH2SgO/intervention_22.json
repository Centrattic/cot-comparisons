I was surprised when I found out on Facebook because I thought this was something she would have told me first. I sent her a private message congratulating her and we spent some time talking about her wedding plans. I assumed I would be her maid of honor since two years ago she was the maid of honor in my wedding. \n\nA few weeks ago, I saw on Facebook that she asked another childhood best friend to be her maid of honor. I was hurt but understood that we have drifted apart the past few years. I still assumed I would be a bridesmaid. \n\nLast week I saw another Facebook post of her and everyone she asked to be in her wedding party. Two of the girls were people she hasn\u2019t been very close with lately. It has now become clear to me that I will not be in her wedding party. \n\nMy feelings are hurt but I understand that this is her day and she should have the people she wants standing up next to her. However, since I am not in the wedding party, WIBTA for not attending the wedding? She lives a few states away so I would need to buy a plane ticket, a hotel room, and request time off of work. This would not be a major hardship but it does not seem worth it to me since I am already embarrassed about not being in the wedding party. \n\nI am not interested in being in a one sided friendship. I would rather focus on friends who want to have me around. I do not plan on staying in contact with her after this. AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person in the AITA (Am I the Asshole) scenario is in the wrong for not wanting to attend their friend's wedding after not being asked into the wedding party.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the situation. The author is a friend of 15 years. They were surprised when they found out about the wedding via Facebook, expecting to be told first. They assumed they'd be the maid of honor since the friend was the maid of honor at their wedding. Then, they found out another friend was chosen, which hurt them, but they understood they've drifted apart. Now, the author is considering not attending the wedding because they aren't in the wedding party, even though they were close before.\n\nThe key points here are the expectations the author had. They thought they'd be in the wedding party based on past reciprocation. When that didn't happen, they felt hurt and are now considering not attending. The question is whether it's justified.\n\nI need to consider social norms. Typically, attending a friend's wedding is considered important, even if you're not in the wedding party. Friendships, especially long ones, usually expect you to attend. The author is framing it as a one-sided friendship now, but the friend might not see it that way. The author's decision not to attend could be seen as cutting off the friendship, which might not be in line with the value placed on long-term relationships.\n\nAlso, the financial aspect is mentioned, but the author says it's not a major hardship. So the main issue is emotional hurt and feeling undervalued. However, weddings are significant events, and not attending could be hurtful to the friend. The author is using their hurt feelings as a reason to not attend, which might be seen as self-centered. The friend might have other reasons for not choosing them in the wedding party, like differing priorities or changes in the relationship.\n\nAnother angle is communication. The author didn't confront the friend about being excluded from the wedding party. If they had discussed it, maybe there's a chance to resolve the hurt feelings without avoiding the wedding. The author's plan to not attend and cut contact might be a reaction without a conversation. \n\nSocial expectations often prioritize attending weddings even if you're not in the party. The author is choosing to not attend, which could be seen as inconsiderate towards the friend. The friend might feel rejected if the author doesn't attend, especially after 15 years of friendship. \n\nSo, weighing these factors, the author is letting their hurt feelings influence a major life event (not attending a friend's wedding) without seeking resolution. This could be seen as self-centered, making them the asshole. The answer is likely A, yes, they're in the wrong.\n"
