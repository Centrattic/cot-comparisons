I was surprised when I found out on Facebook because I thought this was something she would have told me first. I sent her a private message congratulating her and we spent some time talking about her wedding plans. I assumed I would be her maid of honor since two years ago she was the maid of honor in my wedding. \n\nA few weeks ago, I saw on Facebook that she asked another childhood best friend to be her maid of honor. I was hurt but understood that we have drifted apart the past few years. I still assumed I would be a bridesmaid. \n\nLast week I saw another Facebook post of her and everyone she asked to be in her wedding party. Two of the girls were people she hasn\u2019t been very close with lately. It has now become clear to me that I will not be in her wedding party. \n\nMy feelings are hurt but I understand that this is her day and she should have the people she wants standing up next to her. However, since I am not in the wedding party, WIBTA for not attending the wedding? She lives a few states away so I would need to buy a plane ticket, a hotel room, and request time off of work. This would not be a major hardship but it does not seem worth it to me since I am already embarrassed about not being in the wedding party. \n\nI am not interested in being in a one sided friendship. I would rather focus on friends who want to have me around. I do not plan on staying in contact with her after this. AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is about a friend who didn't invite them to her wedding as a bridesmaid, and the author is considering not attending because they weren't in the wedding party.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the details. The author and the friend have been friends for 15 years. The friend found out about the wedding through Facebook, which upset them. They had been talking about the wedding plans, and the author thought they'd be the maid of honor, since they were the maid of honor in the friend's wedding two years ago. But then the friend chose another childhood friend instead. The author is hurt but tried to understand because their friendship has drifted. However, the friend didn't include the author in the wedding party at all, and now the author is questioning whether they should attend the wedding because it's not worth the effort and cost, and they're considering cutting off the friendship.\n\nSo, the main question here is whether the author is in the wrong for not attending the wedding. Let's consider the social norms and expectations. Generally, even if you're not in the wedding party, attending is a common courtesy, especially for a long-time friend. The author is hurt but is choosing not to attend because they feel slighted. However, the friend might have her reasons for not including the author in the wedding party, maybe due to the drifting apart, or other logistical reasons. \n\nBut the author is also saying they don't want to be in a one-sided friendship anymore and plan to cut off contact. That shows they're making a choice based on their own feelings. The question is whether this decision is justified. In AITA scenarios, people often expect that even if hurt, attending the wedding is expected unless there's a significant reason not to. But the author is making a point about reciprocity and the effort required. \n\nHowever, the author's reasoning is that they were expecting to be in the wedding party, which didn't happen, and now they don't feel it's worth attending. But cutting off the friendship entirely might be a strong reaction. However, the author is within their rights to make that choice. \n\nIn terms of being \"in the wrong,\" it's about whether their actions (not attending) are unreasonable. Since the author is making an honest assessment of the friendship and their role, and the friend might have made her own decisions about the wedding party, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong for choosing not to attend. They're prioritizing their own feelings and setting boundaries. \n\nSo the answer would be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
