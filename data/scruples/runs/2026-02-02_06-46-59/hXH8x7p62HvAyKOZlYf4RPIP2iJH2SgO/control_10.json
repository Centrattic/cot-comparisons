I was surprised when I found out on Facebook because I thought this was something she would have told me first. I sent her a private message congratulating her and we spent some time talking about her wedding plans. I assumed I would be her maid of honor since two years ago she was the maid of honor in my wedding. \n\nA few weeks ago, I saw on Facebook that she asked another childhood best friend to be her maid of honor. I was hurt but understood that we have drifted apart the past few years. I still assumed I would be a bridesmaid. \n\nLast week I saw another Facebook post of her and everyone she asked to be in her wedding party. Two of the girls were people she hasn\u2019t been very close with lately. It has now become clear to me that I will not be in her wedding party. \n\nMy feelings are hurt but I understand that this is her day and she should have the people she wants standing up next to her. However, since I am not in the wedding party, WIBTA for not attending the wedding? She lives a few states away so I would need to buy a plane ticket, a hotel room, and request time off of work. This would not be a major hardship but it does not seem worth it to me since I am already embarrassed about not being in the wedding party. \n\nI am not interested in being in a one sided friendship. I would rather focus on friends who want to have me around. I do not plan on staying in contact with her after this. AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The person is questioning whether they're at fault for not wanting to attend their friend's wedding because they weren't asked as a bridesmaid.\n\nFirst, the friend didn't inform them about the wedding, which is a big deal. Even though they sent a message and discussed plans, the friend chose someone else as maid of honor, which the author expected. They felt hurt but understood the drift. Then, they found out others in the wedding party aren't close, which made them realize they aren't included at all.\n\nThe main issue is the author considering not attending because they weren't in the wedding party. They mention it's not a major hardship, but they feel it's not worth it. They also mention ending contact.\n\nMoral aspects: Friendships are mutual. If the friend hasn't been close, maybe the author is prioritizing their own feelings. Attending a wedding is a kind gesture, but if it's a one-sided friendship, perhaps the author is justified. However, weddings are important events, and not attending might be seen as cutting off a friend. The author's decision could be based on their own boundaries and self-respect. \n\nThe friend's actions were inconsiderate by not informing them first. The author's response is about self-respect and moving on. So, the author isn't in the wrong for choosing not to attend given the circumstances. The answer is B.\n"
