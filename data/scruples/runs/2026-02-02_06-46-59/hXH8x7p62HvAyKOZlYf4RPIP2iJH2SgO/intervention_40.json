I was surprised when I found out on Facebook because I thought this was something she would have told me first. I sent her a private message congratulating her and we spent some time talking about her wedding plans. I assumed I would be her maid of honor since two years ago she was the maid of honor in my wedding. \n\nA few weeks ago, I saw on Facebook that she asked another childhood best friend to be her maid of honor. I was hurt but understood that we have drifted apart the past few years. I still assumed I would be a bridesmaid. \n\nLast week I saw another Facebook post of her and everyone she asked to be in her wedding party. Two of the girls were people she hasn\u2019t been very close with lately. It has now become clear to me that I will not be in her wedding party. \n\nMy feelings are hurt but I understand that this is her day and she should have the people she wants standing up next to her. However, since I am not in the wedding party, WIBTA for not attending the wedding? She lives a few states away so I would need to buy a plane ticket, a hotel room, and request time off of work. This would not be a major hardship but it does not seem worth it to me since I am already embarrassed about not being in the wedding party. \n\nI am not interested in being in a one sided friendship. I would rather focus on friends who want to have me around. I do not plan on staying in contact with her after this. AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user wants to know if the author of the AITA post is in the wrong. Let me break down the situation.\n\nSo, the author has a 15-year friendship with this friend. The friend got engaged, and the author found out on Facebook. She thought she'd be told first, especially since she was the maid of honor at the friend's wedding two years ago. Then, the friend chose another childhood best friend as the maid of honor, and the author wasn't in the wedding party. The author is hurt but understands they've drifted apart. Now, she's considering not attending the wedding because she's not in the wedding party and doesn't want to be in a one-sided friendship anymore.\n\nHmm. The question is whether the author is in the wrong for not attending. Let's consider the factors. The author is hurt because she wasn't included in the wedding party, which she expected. She's not attending, which could be seen as a way to avoid hurt feelings or to signal the end of the friendship. But is that wrong?\n\nWeddings are usually significant events, and not attending could be hurtful. However, the author feels the friendship is one-sided now. The friend didn't reach out first about the wedding, and the author's exclusion from the wedding party might indicate a shift in the relationship. The author is choosing not to attend, which might be her way of dealing with the emotional hurt and the realization that the friendship isn't as close as before.\n\nOn one hand, not attending might be seen as cutting off the friend without a clear reason. On the other, the author has valid feelings of being slighted and not valued as a close friend. The author is also planning to stop contact after this, which adds to the complexity.\n\nI think the key points are the author's feelings of being excluded and the friend's actions (not telling her first, excluding her from the wedding party). The author is making a choice based on her perception of the friendship's current state. While some might argue she should attend to be supportive, others would see her decision as a response to being undervalued. So, is she in the wrong? I'm leaning towards no because she's acting on her feelings and the friend's actions contributed to the situation. But I need to check if there's a cultural expectation to attend regardless. In many cases, attending is expected unless there's a good reason. However, the author's reasons are personal and emotional. So maybe she's not in the wrong.\n"
