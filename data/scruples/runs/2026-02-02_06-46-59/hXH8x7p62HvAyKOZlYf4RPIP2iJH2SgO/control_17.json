I was surprised when I found out on Facebook because I thought this was something she would have told me first. I sent her a private message congratulating her and we spent some time talking about her wedding plans. I assumed I would be her maid of honor since two years ago she was the maid of honor in my wedding. \n\nA few weeks ago, I saw on Facebook that she asked another childhood best friend to be her maid of honor. I was hurt but understood that we have drifted apart the past few years. I still assumed I would be a bridesmaid. \n\nLast week I saw another Facebook post of her and everyone she asked to be in her wedding party. Two of the girls were people she hasn\u2019t been very close with lately. It has now become clear to me that I will not be in her wedding party. \n\nMy feelings are hurt but I understand that this is her day and she should have the people she wants standing up next to her. However, since I am not in the wedding party, WIBTA for not attending the wedding? She lives a few states away so I would need to buy a plane ticket, a hotel room, and request time off of work. This would not be a major hardship but it does not seem worth it to me since I am already embarrassed about not being in the wedding party. \n\nI am not interested in being in a one sided friendship. I would rather focus on friends who want to have me around. I do not plan on staying in contact with her after this. AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that the author is a friend of the bride for over 15 years. They had a close relationship enough that the friend was the maid of honor at the author's wedding two years ago. Now, the author found out about the wedding on Facebook and later discovered that another childhood friend was chosen as the maid of honor, and the author isn't in the wedding party at all. The author is hurt but understands that their friend might have drifted away. Now they're considering not attending the wedding because they're not part of the wedding party and feel it's a one-sided friendship. The question is whether the author is in the wrong (AITA) for not attending.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the expectations here. The author assumed they would be in the wedding party since they were the maid of honor at their friend's wedding. That's a common expectation, right? If you were in someone's wedding party, you might expect to be in theirs. But maybe things changed over the years. The author mentions that they've drifted apart in the past few years. So maybe the friend's choice to include others isn't due to the author's actions but just the natural drift in their relationship. \n\nThen there's the aspect of attending the wedding. Attending a wedding is a personal choice. Even if you're not in the wedding party, it's not mandatory to attend. But the author is choosing not to attend because they feel hurt and want to focus on friends who value them. On the other hand, the bride might expect that a close long-term friend would attend regardless of being in the wedding party. But the author isn't expecting to be in the wedding party anymore, just wants to attend. \n\nFinancial considerations are mentioned too. The author would have to spend on a plane ticket, hotel, time off, which isn't a major hardship but not something they want to spend if they're not in the wedding party. So maybe they feel it's not worth the expense. \n\nThe author also plans to cut contact after this. That might be a separate issue, but the immediate question is about attending the wedding. \n\nIs the author in the wrong? Well, from a social standpoint, people often attend each other's weddings regardless of being in the wedding party. However, if a friendship has become one-sided, maybe the author isn't wrong for not wanting to attend. The hurt feelings are valid, but is it the author's fault that they weren't chosen again? The friend might have reasons, like the wedding party is full or other factors. \n\nBut the author didn't do anything to deserve not being in the wedding party. They were the maid of honor before. However, the friend might have changed over time, or the author might have been distant. The author's decision not to attend is a personal choice, and they're not obligated to attend. So maybe they are not in the wrong. \n\nOn the other hand, some might argue that a 15-year friendship and being a maid of honor in the past makes attending a reasonable expectation. But the author's feelings are hurt and they're choosing to prioritize other relationships. So it's a bit of a gray area. \n\nI think the key here is that the author is making a choice based on their feelings and the direction they want their friendships to go. They aren't being malicious; they're just deciding to not invest time and money into a friendship that they feel is one-sided. So the answer might be B, not in the wrong.\n"
