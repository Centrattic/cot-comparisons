I was surprised when I found out on Facebook because I thought this was something she would have told me first. I sent her a private message congratulating her and we spent some time talking about her wedding plans. I assumed I would be her maid of honor since two years ago she was the maid of honor in my wedding. \n\nA few weeks ago, I saw on Facebook that she asked another childhood best friend to be her maid of honor. I was hurt but understood that we have drifted apart the past few years. I still assumed I would be a bridesmaid. \n\nLast week I saw another Facebook post of her and everyone she asked to be in her wedding party. Two of the girls were people she hasn\u2019t been very close with lately. It has now become clear to me that I will not be in her wedding party. \n\nMy feelings are hurt but I understand that this is her day and she should have the people she wants standing up next to her. However, since I am not in the wedding party, WIBTA for not attending the wedding? She lives a few states away so I would need to buy a plane ticket, a hotel room, and request time off of work. This would not be a major hardship but it does not seem worth it to me since I am already embarrassed about not being in the wedding party. \n\nI am not interested in being in a one sided friendship. I would rather focus on friends who want to have me around. I do not plan on staying in contact with her after this. AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not wanting to attend their friend's wedding because they weren't asked to be a bridesmaid. The author and the friend have been close for 15 years. The author assumed they would be the maid of honor since the friend was their maid of honor at their wedding. But the friend chose another childhood friend instead. The author is hurt but then saw that the friend didn't even include them as a bridesmaid. They're considering not attending because they feel it's not worth the effort and don't want a one-sided friendship.\n\nHmm. The key points here are the assumptions made by the author. They thought they would be the maid of honor, but the friend made different choices. The author is now deciding whether to attend. The question is whether not attending makes them the AITA.\n\nTraditionally, attending a friend's wedding is seen as a sign of support, even if you're not in the wedding party. But the author feels slighted and is trying to decide if it's worth the cost and effort. They also mention wanting to focus on friends who value them. But is cutting off contact over this justified? \n\nThe friend might have drifted apart, as the author acknowledges. If the friend hasn't reached out, maybe the relationship has naturally changed. The author's decision to not attend could be seen as a way to set boundaries, which is normal. But some might say attending is still important regardless of the role. However, the author is not in the wedding party, so maybe they feel it's not necessary. \n\nI think the answer is B, the author isn't in the wrong. They're respecting the friend's choices and prioritizing their own feelings. While attending a friend's wedding is typically expected, the author has valid reasons for not wanting to go, especially given the drift in the relationship and the cost. It's their right to decide to not attend if it's too emotionally taxing or if they feel the friendship is one-sided now. So, No, they're not in the wrong.\n"
