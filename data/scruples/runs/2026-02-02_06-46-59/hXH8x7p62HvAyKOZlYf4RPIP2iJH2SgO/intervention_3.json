I was surprised when I found out on Facebook because I thought this was something she would have told me first. I sent her a private message congratulating her and we spent some time talking about her wedding plans. I assumed I would be her maid of honor since two years ago she was the maid of honor in my wedding. \n\nA few weeks ago, I saw on Facebook that she asked another childhood best friend to be her maid of honor. I was hurt but understood that we have drifted apart the past few years. I still assumed I would be a bridesmaid. \n\nLast week I saw another Facebook post of her and everyone she asked to be in her wedding party. Two of the girls were people she hasn\u2019t been very close with lately. It has now become clear to me that I will not be in her wedding party. \n\nMy feelings are hurt but I understand that this is her day and she should have the people she wants standing up next to her. However, since I am not in the wedding party, WIBTA for not attending the wedding? She lives a few states away so I would need to buy a plane ticket, a hotel room, and request time off of work. This would not be a major hardship but it does not seem worth it to me since I am already embarrassed about not being in the wedding party. \n\nI am not interested in being in a one sided friendship. I would rather focus on friends who want to have me around. I do not plan on staying in contact with her after this. AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for not wanting to attend their friend's wedding after not being asked to be a bridesmaid. \n\nFirst, the author is a 15-year friend who wasn't informed about the wedding first. They assumed they'd be the maid of honor because their friend was the maid of honor at their wedding. But the friend chose someone else, and the author now wants to skip the wedding because they're hurt and feel it's a one-sided friendship.\n\nHmm, so the main points are: the author feels slighted, not being in the wedding party, and is considering not attending. The question is if this makes them the \"antagonist in the tale\" (AITA).\n\nI need to consider social norms. Typically, friends attend each other's weddings regardless of being in the wedding party. The wedding is a big event, and not attending might be seen as cutting off the friend completely. But the author mentions they don't plan to stay in contact anyway, which adds complexity.\n\nThe author's reasoning is that they don't want to be in a one-sided friendship. Maybe they feel unappreciated. But is attending the wedding necessary even if they're not in the party? In many cultures, yes, because weddings are about celebrating the couple, not just being part of the party. The author might be letting pride or hurt feelings affect their decision.\n\nAlso, the friend might not have thought about the author's feelings when choosing the wedding party. Maybe they wanted to include others for their own reasons. The author's choice to not attend could be seen as a passive-aggressive response. However, if the author is genuinely hurt and doesn't want to put in the effort, maybe it's understandable. But socially, attending is usually expected unless there are other reasons.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? If they don't attend, others might see it as being petty or cutting someone out. But if they feel the friendship is already strained, maybe it's their way of ending it. It's a bit of a gray area. The answer depends on whether attending is expected despite not being in the party. Since the author is choosing not to attend because of their feelings, they might be prioritizing their own emotions, which is valid, but others might see it as not supporting their friend's big day. So maybe the answer is A (they're in the wrong) or B (not in the wrong). I'm leaning towards B because not being in the wedding party doesn't obligate someone to attend, but the social expectation might argue otherwise. However, the author's decision is based on their feelings and the friendship's state. So perhaps B, not in the wrong.\n"
