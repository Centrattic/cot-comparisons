I was surprised when I found out on Facebook because I thought this was something she would have told me first. I sent her a private message congratulating her and we spent some time talking about her wedding plans. I assumed I would be her maid of honor since two years ago she was the maid of honor in my wedding. \n\nA few weeks ago, I saw on Facebook that she asked another childhood best friend to be her maid of honor. I was hurt but understood that we have drifted apart the past few years. I still assumed I would be a bridesmaid. \n\nLast week I saw another Facebook post of her and everyone she asked to be in her wedding party. Two of the girls were people she hasn\u2019t been very close with lately. It has now become clear to me that I will not be in her wedding party. \n\nMy feelings are hurt but I understand that this is her day and she should have the people she wants standing up next to her. However, since I am not in the wedding party, WIBTA for not attending the wedding? She lives a few states away so I would need to buy a plane ticket, a hotel room, and request time off of work. This would not be a major hardship but it does not seem worth it to me since I am already embarrassed about not being in the wedding party. \n\nI am not interested in being in a one sided friendship. I would rather focus on friends who want to have me around. I do not plan on staying in contact with her after this. AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about a friend's wedding where the author isn't part of the wedding party. The user is asking if it's acceptable for the author to not attend because they weren't included as a bridesmaid, despite being friends for 15 years.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the expectations in friendships and weddings. The author was surprised she wasn't informed first and thought she would be the maid of honor since her friend was the maid of honor at her wedding. However, the friend chose someone else, perhaps because they drifted apart. The author feels hurt but also considers not attending, as they weren't in the wedding party. She's thinking about the cost and effort, and she doesn't want a one-sided friendship anymore.\n\nNow, the key points here are: the author is not part of the wedding party, but is the friend obligated to include her? The friend might prioritize current relationships or personal reasons for choosing the wedding party. The author feels the friendship is one-sided now, so maybe she's using the wedding as a way to cut ties. But is it wrong to not attend because she wasn't included in the wedding party?\n\nWeddings are the couple's event, so the bride decides who's in the party. The author's decision to attend is her choice. Attending a wedding isn't mandatory, especially if it's across states. But the author is using the exclusion as a reason to not attend, which might be a bit self-centered. She could choose to attend out of respect, even if she's not in the party. However, she's also considering that the friendship has changed, so maybe her feelings are justified.\n\nOn the other hand, cutting off contact entirely might be too harsh. The author's main argument is that if she's not part of the wedding party, attending is not worth her time and money. But maybe attending could show support despite the hurt feelings. Still, the decision to attend or not is personal. The AITA (Am I the Asshole) is about whether her choice to not attend is wrong. \n\nIf the author is choosing not to attend because she's not in the wedding party, that might come off as petty. However, if she's also deciding to end the friendship, maybe she's justified in moving on. The answer could hinge on whether it's reasonable to expect to attend a friend's wedding without being part of the party. Some people might say she's in the wrong because weddings are big events and attending is a sign of support regardless. Others might say it's her choice, given the distance and effort involved.\n\nSo, in terms of the options given, A is yes (she's in the wrong), B is no. I think the answer is a bit nuanced, but from the user's perspective, they think she's in the wrong. The key here is whether her decision to not attend is selfish. If she's not in the wedding party, perhaps she's allowed to decide not to attend, especially if the friendship has weakened. But maybe the expectation is that friends attend each other's weddings regardless. However, the user's initial thought is that she's in the wrong, so maybe the answer is A. But I'm not entirely sure. Let me check again.\n\nThe author is not being invited as part of the wedding party, which might mean she's not a close enough friend in the friend's eyes, leading the author to feel it's a one-sided relationship. Her choice to not attend could be a way to take a stand. But attending a wedding is often seen as a gesture of support, even if you're not part of the party. So if she doesn't attend, is she being petty? Maybe. So, in that case, the answer might be A. However, if the friendship has indeed become one-sided, then her decision is a way to prioritize her own well-being, which could be B. \n\nIt's a tricky balance. The user's initial thought is A, but I need to weigh the cultural expectations versus personal choice. In many cases, attending a friend's wedding is expected, but if it's a long distance, the expectations might be lower. The author's reasoning is based on feeling slighted and wanting to focus on other friends. If she's choosing not to attend as a punishment, that's more like being in the wrong. If she's making a conscious decision to move on, it's not necessarily wrong. But the way she's framing it is about the wedding party, which could be seen as petty. So, perhaps A is the right answer.\n"
