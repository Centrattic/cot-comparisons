I was surprised when I found out on Facebook because I thought this was something she would have told me first. I sent her a private message congratulating her and we spent some time talking about her wedding plans. I assumed I would be her maid of honor since two years ago she was the maid of honor in my wedding. \n\nA few weeks ago, I saw on Facebook that she asked another childhood best friend to be her maid of honor. I was hurt but understood that we have drifted apart the past few years. I still assumed I would be a bridesmaid. \n\nLast week I saw another Facebook post of her and everyone she asked to be in her wedding party. Two of the girls were people she hasn\u2019t been very close with lately. It has now become clear to me that I will not be in her wedding party. \n\nMy feelings are hurt but I understand that this is her day and she should have the people she wants standing up next to her. However, since I am not in the wedding party, WIBTA for not attending the wedding? She lives a few states away so I would need to buy a plane ticket, a hotel room, and request time off of work. This would not be a major hardship but it does not seem worth it to me since I am already embarrassed about not being in the wedding party. \n\nI am not interested in being in a one sided friendship. I would rather focus on friends who want to have me around. I do not plan on staying in contact with her after this. AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA story is in the wrong for not wanting to attend their friend's wedding because they weren't asked to be a bridesmaid.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The friend has known each other for 15 years. The author was surprised when they found out about the wedding on Facebook, which is already a point of hurt. Then, they assumed they'd be the maid of honor because their friend was the maid of honor in their wedding. But the friend chose another childhood friend as maid of honor, and the author wasn't even in the wedding party. Now, they're considering not attending because they're hurt and feel it's not worth the effort, especially since they're not in the wedding party. They also mention not wanting a one-sided friendship anymore and planning to cut ties.\n\nSo, the main question is whether not attending is the wrong thing to do. \n\nI should consider social norms around weddings. Typically, attending a friend's wedding is seen as important, regardless of being in the wedding party. Weddings are big events, and not attending could be seen as a slight. However, the author feels they weren't included and are hurt. They also mention that they're not in contact anymore, which might affect their responsibility to attend.\n\nBut wait, even if they drifted apart, attending a wedding is a significant gesture. The author is using the lack of being in the wedding party as a reason not to attend. Is that a valid reason? Maybe not. Not being in the wedding party doesn't mean they shouldn't attend. People often attend without being part of the party. \n\nThe author is also considering the cost and time, but they admit it's not a major hardship. So maybe the real issue is their hurt feelings. But cutting off contact after this might be a bigger issue. If they don't attend, they might be ending the friendship entirely, which could be seen as harsh. However, the author feels it's a one-sided relationship now.\n\nOn the other hand, the friend might have had reasons for not asking them to be in the wedding party. They mentioned drifting apart, which could be valid. The friend might not have considered the author's feelings when choosing the wedding party. But it's their wedding, so they have the final say.\n\nThe key points are: Is attending a friend's wedding expected even if not in the wedding party? Yes. The author's decision not to attend could be seen as not supporting the friend during a significant life event. However, the author's feelings of being slighted and the desire to end a one-sided friendship add context.\n\nI think the answer is B (No), because the author isn't in the wrong for not attending given their hurt and the friend's decision to not include them. However, there's a nuance here. Attending a wedding is a social expectation, but the author's decision is a personal choice based on their feelings. The friend might feel slighted if the author doesn't attend, but the author isn't necessarily in the wrong for prioritizing their own feelings in this situation.\n"
