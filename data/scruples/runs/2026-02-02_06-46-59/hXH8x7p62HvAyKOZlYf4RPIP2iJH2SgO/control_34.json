I was surprised when I found out on Facebook because I thought this was something she would have told me first. I sent her a private message congratulating her and we spent some time talking about her wedding plans. I assumed I would be her maid of honor since two years ago she was the maid of honor in my wedding. \n\nA few weeks ago, I saw on Facebook that she asked another childhood best friend to be her maid of honor. I was hurt but understood that we have drifted apart the past few years. I still assumed I would be a bridesmaid. \n\nLast week I saw another Facebook post of her and everyone she asked to be in her wedding party. Two of the girls were people she hasn\u2019t been very close with lately. It has now become clear to me that I will not be in her wedding party. \n\nMy feelings are hurt but I understand that this is her day and she should have the people she wants standing up next to her. However, since I am not in the wedding party, WIBTA for not attending the wedding? She lives a few states away so I would need to buy a plane ticket, a hotel room, and request time off of work. This would not be a major hardship but it does not seem worth it to me since I am already embarrassed about not being in the wedding party. \n\nI am not interested in being in a one sided friendship. I would rather focus on friends who want to have me around. I do not plan on staying in contact with her after this. AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not wanting to attend their friend's wedding because they weren't asked to be a bridesmaid. The author has been friends with this person for 15 years, and the friend was the maid of honor at their wedding two years ago. The author found out about the wedding on Facebook and was hurt when the friend chose someone else as the maid of honor, and now the author isn't in the wedding party at all. They're considering not attending because it's a hassle and they feel it's a one-sided friendship now.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the social expectations around attending weddings. Generally, even if you're not in the wedding party, attending is considered polite, especially for a long-time friend. However, there's also the aspect of personal boundaries and feelings of being slighted. The author feels hurt and embarrassed, which is understandable. The friend didn't inform them first, which adds to the hurt.\n\nThe key points here are: the author's feelings of being excluded, the friend's actions (not telling them first, choosing others for the wedding party), and the author's decision to not attend. The question is whether the author is in the wrong for choosing not to attend. \n\nOn one hand, not attending could be seen as cutting off contact, which might be harsh. But on the other hand, the author is making a point about the one-sidedness of the friendship. If the author is not interested in maintaining the friendship anymore, choosing not to attend could be a way of setting boundaries. \n\nHowever, the author is also avoiding the situation, which might lead to unresolved feelings or further hurt. But the user is asking if the author is in the wrong. From a social standpoint, attending is usually expected unless there's a major reason not to. But in this case, the author feels they're not valued anymore, which could be a valid reason. \n\nSo, the answer would likely be B (No), because the author is making a choice based on their feelings of being undervalued in the friendship. It's their right to prioritize their emotional well-being and set boundaries. The friend may be in the wrong for not keeping the author informed and excluding them, so the author isn't wrong for responding accordingly.\n"
