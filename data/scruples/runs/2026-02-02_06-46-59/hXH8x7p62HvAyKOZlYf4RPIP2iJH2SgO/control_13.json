I was surprised when I found out on Facebook because I thought this was something she would have told me first. I sent her a private message congratulating her and we spent some time talking about her wedding plans. I assumed I would be her maid of honor since two years ago she was the maid of honor in my wedding. \n\nA few weeks ago, I saw on Facebook that she asked another childhood best friend to be her maid of honor. I was hurt but understood that we have drifted apart the past few years. I still assumed I would be a bridesmaid. \n\nLast week I saw another Facebook post of her and everyone she asked to be in her wedding party. Two of the girls were people she hasn\u2019t been very close with lately. It has now become clear to me that I will not be in her wedding party. \n\nMy feelings are hurt but I understand that this is her day and she should have the people she wants standing up next to her. However, since I am not in the wedding party, WIBTA for not attending the wedding? She lives a few states away so I would need to buy a plane ticket, a hotel room, and request time off of work. This would not be a major hardship but it does not seem worth it to me since I am already embarrassed about not being in the wedding party. \n\nI am not interested in being in a one sided friendship. I would rather focus on friends who want to have me around. I do not plan on staying in contact with her after this. AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong for not wanting to attend their friend's wedding since they're not a bridesmaid.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The friend of 15 years didn't tell them about the wedding first, which already seems a bit hurtful. The writer assumed they'd be the maid of honor because their friend was the maid of honor at their wedding two years ago. But then the friend chose someone else, maybe a childhood best friend. The writer feels hurt that they aren't in the wedding party but still understands that it's the friend's day. The main question is whether it's okay for the writer not to attend the wedding because they're not in the wedding party. \n\nSo, the key points here are: the friend didn't reach out first, there's a drift in the friendship, the writer is hurt but acknowledges the friend's choice, and they're considering skipping the wedding to avoid embarrassment. The user wants to know if the writer is in the wrong for that decision.\n\nIn terms of social norms, attending a friend's wedding is a common courtesy, but it's not a strict rule. However, there's a personal relationship here. The writer is hurt and feels the relationship has become one-sided. If attending the wedding would cause them emotional distress or feel like a one-sided effort, maybe it's valid to skip. On the other hand, weddings are significant events, and not going could be seen as cutting off contact or being resentful. But the writer mentions they don't plan to stay in touch anyway, so maybe they're already moving on from the friendship. \n\nThe writer isn't being inconsiderate by not attending, but they are making a choice based on their feelings. The friend might be hurt if they don't come, but the writer's feelings about the friendship drifting and the one-sidedness could justify their decision. In terms of right or wrong, it's more about personal feelings and boundaries. Since the writer is honest about their hurt and the change in the relationship, they might not be in the wrong for deciding not to attend. The answer depends on whether the writer's reasoning is valid, which it seems to be. So, the answer would be B, No.\n"
