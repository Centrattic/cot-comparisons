I was surprised when I found out on Facebook because I thought this was something she would have told me first. I sent her a private message congratulating her and we spent some time talking about her wedding plans. I assumed I would be her maid of honor since two years ago she was the maid of honor in my wedding. \n\nA few weeks ago, I saw on Facebook that she asked another childhood best friend to be her maid of honor. I was hurt but understood that we have drifted apart the past few years. I still assumed I would be a bridesmaid. \n\nLast week I saw another Facebook post of her and everyone she asked to be in her wedding party. Two of the girls were people she hasn\u2019t been very close with lately. It has now become clear to me that I will not be in her wedding party. \n\nMy feelings are hurt but I understand that this is her day and she should have the people she wants standing up next to her. However, since I am not in the wedding party, WIBTA for not attending the wedding? She lives a few states away so I would need to buy a plane ticket, a hotel room, and request time off of work. This would not be a major hardship but it does not seem worth it to me since I am already embarrassed about not being in the wedding party. \n\nI am not interested in being in a one sided friendship. I would rather focus on friends who want to have me around. I do not plan on staying in contact with her after this. AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for not wanting to attend their friend's wedding after not being asked to be a bridesmaid.\n\nFirst, the friend of 15 years didn't inform the author first, which is surprising. The author was expecting to be the maid of honor since they did the same for her. But the friend chose someone else. The author feels hurt but understands they've drifted apart. Now, the author is considering not attending the wedding because they're not in the wedding party, even though it's a few states away and involves some effort and expense. They mention not wanting a one-sided friendship and plan to cut contact.\n\nSo, the key points here: attending a friend's wedding is a personal choice. While not being in the wedding party might be hurtful, it doesn't obligate the author to attend. The author's feelings are valid, and they're making a decision based on their own emotional state and the current state of the friendship. It's their right to choose how to spend their time and money. The friend's actions (not telling first, not including in the party) might contribute to the author's decision. So, the answer is B (No), the author isn't in the wrong for deciding not to attend.\n"
