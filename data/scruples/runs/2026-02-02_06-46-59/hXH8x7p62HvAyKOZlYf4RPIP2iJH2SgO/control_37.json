I was surprised when I found out on Facebook because I thought this was something she would have told me first. I sent her a private message congratulating her and we spent some time talking about her wedding plans. I assumed I would be her maid of honor since two years ago she was the maid of honor in my wedding. \n\nA few weeks ago, I saw on Facebook that she asked another childhood best friend to be her maid of honor. I was hurt but understood that we have drifted apart the past few years. I still assumed I would be a bridesmaid. \n\nLast week I saw another Facebook post of her and everyone she asked to be in her wedding party. Two of the girls were people she hasn\u2019t been very close with lately. It has now become clear to me that I will not be in her wedding party. \n\nMy feelings are hurt but I understand that this is her day and she should have the people she wants standing up next to her. However, since I am not in the wedding party, WIBTA for not attending the wedding? She lives a few states away so I would need to buy a plane ticket, a hotel room, and request time off of work. This would not be a major hardship but it does not seem worth it to me since I am already embarrassed about not being in the wedding party. \n\nI am not interested in being in a one sided friendship. I would rather focus on friends who want to have me around. I do not plan on staying in contact with her after this. AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The person is asking if they're in the wrong for not attending their friend's wedding because they weren't asked to be in the wedding party. They were friends for 15 years, and the friend was the maid of honor at their wedding two years ago. Now, the friend is getting married and has chosen someone else as maid of honor, and the person found out through Facebook.\n\nFirst, the friend's actions: she didn't inform the person about the engagement first, which the person expected. Then, she didn't include them in the wedding party, which was a surprise. The person feels hurt and thinks the friendship has drifted. They're considering not attending because they don't want to be in a one-sided relationship anymore.\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Well, attending a wedding is typically expected unless there's a good reason not to. But the author is hurt and feels uninvolved in the planning. However, the wedding is the friend's day, so the guest list is the friend's decision. The author might feel slighted, but not attending could be seen as cutting off the friend, which might be harsh. However, the author is also making a point about the friendship being one-sided.\n\nBut wait, the author is not in the wedding party, but is it their right to attend? Usually, weddings have guest lists, and if you're not invited, you don't attend. But in this case, the person found out via Facebook and hasn't been officially invited yet. The author is planning to not attend, but maybe they should check if they're actually invited. If they're not invited, they can't go. But the problem here is that the author is deciding not to go because they're not in the wedding party. The friend might have invited them as a guest, but the author is choosing not to go. Is that right?\n\nThe key points: the author has been a friend for 15 years, the friend didn't inform them first, and the author feels excluded. But the author is making a choice based on hurt feelings. The author's reasoning is that they don't want a one-sided friendship. However, not attending a friend's wedding because you're not in the wedding party might be extreme. But if the friend didn't include them in the planning and the wedding party, maybe the author is justified in feeling that the friendship isn't reciprocal. The author is also planning not to stay in touch afterward, which complicates things.\n\nSo, the author might not be in the wrong because they're setting boundaries based on how the friend treated them. But some might argue that attending is important regardless of being in the wedding party. However, given the circumstances, the author's decision could be seen as a way to protect their own feelings, not the friend's. The answer would lean towards B (Not in the wrong) because the friendship issues are significant, and the author is making a personal choice based on their feelings.\n"
