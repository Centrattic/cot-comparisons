I was surprised when I found out on Facebook because I thought this was something she would have told me first. I sent her a private message congratulating her and we spent some time talking about her wedding plans. I assumed I would be her maid of honor since two years ago she was the maid of honor in my wedding. \n\nA few weeks ago, I saw on Facebook that she asked another childhood best friend to be her maid of honor. I was hurt but understood that we have drifted apart the past few years. I still assumed I would be a bridesmaid. \n\nLast week I saw another Facebook post of her and everyone she asked to be in her wedding party. Two of the girls were people she hasn\u2019t been very close with lately. It has now become clear to me that I will not be in her wedding party. \n\nMy feelings are hurt but I understand that this is her day and she should have the people she wants standing up next to her. However, since I am not in the wedding party, WIBTA for not attending the wedding? She lives a few states away so I would need to buy a plane ticket, a hotel room, and request time off of work. This would not be a major hardship but it does not seem worth it to me since I am already embarrassed about not being in the wedding party. \n\nI am not interested in being in a one sided friendship. I would rather focus on friends who want to have me around. I do not plan on staying in contact with her after this. AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the \"Am I the Asshole?\" post is in the wrong for not wanting to attend their friend's wedding after not being asked to be in the wedding party.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the situation. The author was a surprise about the wedding, which might have been a point of hurt. Their friend, who they've known for 15 years, was the maid of honor at the author's wedding two years ago. The author expected to be a bridesmaid, maybe even the maid of honor, but the friend chose someone else. The author found out through Facebook posts that they're not in the wedding party at all. Now, the author is considering skipping the wedding because they're hurt and feel it's a one-sided friendship. The question is whether they're in the wrong for not attending.\n\nI should consider the dynamics here. The friend didn't tell the author about the wedding first, which is a common courtesy in close friendships. Then, the author wasn't asked to be in the wedding party, which is a big deal. Weddings are expensive events, and the author is questioning the effort required to attend without a special role. The author also mentions they don't want to maintain the friendship anymore, which is their right, but the main issue is whether they're wrong for not attending the wedding.\n\nIn terms of social norms, attending a friend's wedding is often expected, especially for someone who's known each other for 15 years. However, the expectation can vary. If the friend excluded the author from the wedding party, maybe they feel less obligated to attend. The author's reasoning is about the effort and the fact that they're not part of the wedding party. They also mention that they're not in a one-sided friendship and plan to cut contact. So, maybe they feel that attending would be a waste of time and energy since the friendship is ending.\n\nBut there's a cultural aspect here. In some cultures, attending a wedding is important regardless of being in the party. In others, it's more about your current relationship. The key here is the friend's actions. The friend didn't inform the author first and didn't include them in the wedding party, which could be seen as a breach of trust or respect. The author's decision to not attend could be a response to that. \n\nHowever, the author might be overreacting. Maybe the friend had other reasons for not asking them, like personal choices or changes in the friendship. But the author does acknowledge that it's the friend's day and they should pick their own people. The author's hurt is valid, but the decision to not attend is a personal choice. \n\nI think the author is not in the wrong because they have a valid reason to feel hurt and the effort involved is significant. They're also making a decision to move on from the friendship, which is their right. So the answer would be B, No.\n"
