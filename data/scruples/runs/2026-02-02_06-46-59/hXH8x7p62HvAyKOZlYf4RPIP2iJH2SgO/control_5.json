I was surprised when I found out on Facebook because I thought this was something she would have told me first. I sent her a private message congratulating her and we spent some time talking about her wedding plans. I assumed I would be her maid of honor since two years ago she was the maid of honor in my wedding. \n\nA few weeks ago, I saw on Facebook that she asked another childhood best friend to be her maid of honor. I was hurt but understood that we have drifted apart the past few years. I still assumed I would be a bridesmaid. \n\nLast week I saw another Facebook post of her and everyone she asked to be in her wedding party. Two of the girls were people she hasn\u2019t been very close with lately. It has now become clear to me that I will not be in her wedding party. \n\nMy feelings are hurt but I understand that this is her day and she should have the people she wants standing up next to her. However, since I am not in the wedding party, WIBTA for not attending the wedding? She lives a few states away so I would need to buy a plane ticket, a hotel room, and request time off of work. This would not be a major hardship but it does not seem worth it to me since I am already embarrassed about not being in the wedding party. \n\nI am not interested in being in a one sided friendship. I would rather focus on friends who want to have me around. I do not plan on staying in contact with her after this. AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the \"Am I the Asshole?\" post is in the wrong. The situation is that the author, a friend of 15 years, wasn't invited as a bridesmaid or maid of honor to her friend's wedding. The friend had been the maid of honor at the author's wedding two years ago. The author found out about the wedding on Facebook and was hurt when she later discovered that another best friend was chosen as maid of honor. Now, the author is considering not attending the wedding because she's not in the wedding party and feels it's not worth the effort and expense. She also mentions wanting to cut off the friendship since it feels one-sided now.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze the key points. The author feels slighted because she wasn't invited to the wedding party. The friend didn't inform her first, which was unexpected. However, the author is considering not attending the wedding, which is a big deal because it's a long-distance event requiring time and money. The question is whether the author is in the wrong for not attending.\n\nIn terms of social norms, attending a friend's wedding is often expected, especially if you're close. But the author isn't in the wedding party, which might affect that expectation. The friend might have thought that not being in the party means the author isn't as close now, given their drifting apart. However, the author still considered being a bridesmaid, so she might feel the friendship is one-sided now. \n\nThe author's reasoning is that since the friend didn't include her in the wedding party, it's a sign of not valuing the friendship, so she doesn't want to attend. Is this a valid reason? Well, weddings are the couple's day, and the choice of wedding party is personal. The friend might have her reasons, even if the author feels hurt. But the author is also considering cutting off contact, which adds another layer. \n\nIn terms of right or wrong, the author isn't necessarily \"in the wrong\" for not attending, especially if she feels unappreciated. However, it might be considered rude not to attend, regardless of the wedding party status, if the author was close. But if the friendship has cooled, maybe it's not so clear. The key is whether the author is overreacting by not attending. Some might say she should attend out of respect, even if she's not in the party. Others might agree that if the friend excluded her from the party, attending is optional. \n\nAlso, the fact that the friend didn't inform the author first about the wedding could be a point. Maybe the author should confront that, but she didn't. However, the main issue here is the attendance. The author is deciding not to attend because she's not in the wedding party. So, is that reasonable? \n\nIn some cultures or social circles, attending a friend's wedding is expected even if you're not in the party. In others, it's more flexible. The author is choosing not to attend, which could be seen as cutting ties, but she's already planning to stop contact. So maybe she's not in the wrong because she's making a choice based on her feelings of being undervalued. The friend's decision to not include her in the party might have contributed to the author's decision. \n\nTherefore, the answer is likely B (No, not in the wrong). The author has the right to prioritize her feelings and the state of the friendship. While attending might be the more socially expected choice, it's not necessarily her fault for choosing not to go, especially if the friendship is already strained."
