I was surprised when I found out on Facebook because I thought this was something she would have told me first. I sent her a private message congratulating her and we spent some time talking about her wedding plans. I assumed I would be her maid of honor since two years ago she was the maid of honor in my wedding. \n\nA few weeks ago, I saw on Facebook that she asked another childhood best friend to be her maid of honor. I was hurt but understood that we have drifted apart the past few years. I still assumed I would be a bridesmaid. \n\nLast week I saw another Facebook post of her and everyone she asked to be in her wedding party. Two of the girls were people she hasn\u2019t been very close with lately. It has now become clear to me that I will not be in her wedding party. \n\nMy feelings are hurt but I understand that this is her day and she should have the people she wants standing up next to her. However, since I am not in the wedding party, WIBTA for not attending the wedding? She lives a few states away so I would need to buy a plane ticket, a hotel room, and request time off of work. This would not be a major hardship but it does not seem worth it to me since I am already embarrassed about not being in the wedding party. \n\nI am not interested in being in a one sided friendship. I would rather focus on friends who want to have me around. I do not plan on staying in contact with her after this. AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The person is asking if they're in the wrong for not wanting to attend their friend's wedding because they weren't asked to be a bridesmaid. Hmm. They were surprised when they found out on Facebook, which is a bit rude, maybe? Because usually, you'd tell a close friend first. But the friend did reach out after seeing the Facebook post and they talked. Then the person assumed they would be maid of honor since the friend was in their wedding as maid of honor. But the friend chose someone else. The person is hurt but okay with understanding they drifted apart. Then the friend included other people who aren't close. The author is considering not attending the wedding because they're not in the wedding party and don't want to be in a one-sided friendship.\n\nSo, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. Well, weddings are usually for close friends and family, but not everyone gets to be in the wedding party. The author is feeling slighted but is considering not attending because they aren't in the wedding party. But is that justified? Not being in the wedding party doesn't mean you can't attend. The author is making a decision based on their own hurt feelings. They also mention they don't plan to stay in contact after. \n\nFrom an etiquette standpoint, attending a wedding isn't mandatory, especially if you're not in the party. But cutting off contact entirely because they weren't in the wedding party might be overreacting. The friend didn't exclude them from the wedding entirely; they just didn't include them in the party. The author's main issue is the betrayal of not being told first and not being chosen, which is a big deal, but maybe they're overreacting. On the other hand, if the friendship has been drifting, maybe this is a good time to step back. But is it right to skip the wedding? Maybe not. Weddings are about celebration, not punishment. \n\nI think the author is not in the wrong entirely. They have the right to their feelings. However, not attending might be a bit harsh, but it's their choice. The real issue is the friend not telling them first, but the author's decision to not attend is a personal choice. So, maybe the answer is B, No, they aren't in the wrong. But I'm not sure. Maybe some would say they should attend regardless. But it's their decision.\n"
