I was surprised when I found out on Facebook because I thought this was something she would have told me first. I sent her a private message congratulating her and we spent some time talking about her wedding plans. I assumed I would be her maid of honor since two years ago she was the maid of honor in my wedding. \n\nA few weeks ago, I saw on Facebook that she asked another childhood best friend to be her maid of honor. I was hurt but understood that we have drifted apart the past few years. I still assumed I would be a bridesmaid. \n\nLast week I saw another Facebook post of her and everyone she asked to be in her wedding party. Two of the girls were people she hasn\u2019t been very close with lately. It has now become clear to me that I will not be in her wedding party. \n\nMy feelings are hurt but I understand that this is her day and she should have the people she wants standing up next to her. However, since I am not in the wedding party, WIBTA for not attending the wedding? She lives a few states away so I would need to buy a plane ticket, a hotel room, and request time off of work. This would not be a major hardship but it does not seem worth it to me since I am already embarrassed about not being in the wedding party. \n\nI am not interested in being in a one sided friendship. I would rather focus on friends who want to have me around. I do not plan on staying in contact with her after this. AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, so I need to figure out if the author of this situation is in the wrong for not wanting to attend their friend's wedding. Let me start by breaking down the key points.\n\nFirst, the author has been friends with this person for over 15 years. That's a long time, so there's some history here. The friend didn't tell the author about the wedding first; instead, the author found out on Facebook. The author assumed they would be the maid of honor because the friend was the maid of honor at their wedding two years ago. However, the friend chose someone else as the maid of honor, a childhood best friend. The author was hurt but tried to understand that they had drifted apart. Then, when the author saw the wedding party list, they realized they weren't part of it at all. Now the author is considering not attending the wedding because it's not worth the effort (travel, time off work) and feels it's a one-sided friendship now. They don't plan to stay in contact afterward. The question is whether the author is in the wrong for not attending.\n\nHmm. Let's think about expectations. In many cultures, being in the wedding party is a big deal. It's a role with responsibilities and is seen as a sign of close friendship. The author expected to be a bridesmaid, at least, given their history. The friend didn't include them, which is hurtful. But is it the author's fault for not attending?\n\nThe author is feeling hurt and embarrassed. They're also considering the cost and effort. Weddings can be expensive, especially if you're traveling. But is that a valid reason to not attend? Maybe. The author feels it's a one-sided friendship now, which is a common reason people might choose to distance themselves. But is that a fair conclusion? The friend might have had reasons for not including them, maybe not knowing the depth of the author's feelings, or other dynamics.\n\nOn the other hand, the author is choosing not to attend a wedding of someone they've known for 15 years just because they weren't in the wedding party. That might seem harsh. Weddings are about celebrating the couple's union, not just about being in the party. Even if you're not a bridesmaid, attending is a gesture of support. Not going could be seen as a passive-aggressive way of getting back at the friend for not including them. That would be inconsiderate.\n\nBut the author is also feeling that the friendship is one-sided. Maybe they've been making efforts while the friend hasn't. If that's the case, walking away might be justified. However, the author hasn't mentioned any specific examples of the friend being inconsiderate beyond not including them in the wedding party. The assumption that the friendship is one-sided is based on the wedding party omission, which might not be the whole story.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? If they're not attending because they're holding a grudge over not being a bridesmaid, then yes, that's being petty. Weddings are for the couple, and the author's exclusion doesn't mean they should avoid the event. However, if the author feels the friendship has become one-sided and wants to focus on other relationships, that's understandable. But is that a valid reason to skip the wedding? Maybe, but it's a personal choice. The key is whether the author is being inconsiderate of their friend's feelings. If the friend would be hurt by their absence, then the author might be in the wrong. If the friendship is already on the rocks, maybe not.\n\nI think the main issue is the author's decision to not attend because of being excluded from the wedding party. While it's understandable to feel hurt, not attending might be seen as a harsh response. The author could express their feelings to the friend or attend and be there for them despite the hurt. So, maybe the author is in the wrong for not attending, but it's a nuanced situation. The answer might be A, but I'm not entirely sure. Let me check again. The author is choosing to not attend a 15-year friend's wedding because of not being a bridesmaid. That's a big deal. They might be justifying it as a one-sided friendship, but that's based on one instance. I think the answer is A.\n"
