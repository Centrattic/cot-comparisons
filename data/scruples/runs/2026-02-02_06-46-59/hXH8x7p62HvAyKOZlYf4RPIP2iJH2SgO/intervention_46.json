I was surprised when I found out on Facebook because I thought this was something she would have told me first. I sent her a private message congratulating her and we spent some time talking about her wedding plans. I assumed I would be her maid of honor since two years ago she was the maid of honor in my wedding. \n\nA few weeks ago, I saw on Facebook that she asked another childhood best friend to be her maid of honor. I was hurt but understood that we have drifted apart the past few years. I still assumed I would be a bridesmaid. \n\nLast week I saw another Facebook post of her and everyone she asked to be in her wedding party. Two of the girls were people she hasn\u2019t been very close with lately. It has now become clear to me that I will not be in her wedding party. \n\nMy feelings are hurt but I understand that this is her day and she should have the people she wants standing up next to her. However, since I am not in the wedding party, WIBTA for not attending the wedding? She lives a few states away so I would need to buy a plane ticket, a hotel room, and request time off of work. This would not be a major hardship but it does not seem worth it to me since I am already embarrassed about not being in the wedding party. \n\nI am not interested in being in a one sided friendship. I would rather focus on friends who want to have me around. I do not plan on staying in contact with her after this. AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person in the scenario is in the wrong for not attending their friend's wedding after not being asked to be a bridesmaid. \n\nFirst, the friend found out about the wedding via Facebook, which was a surprise. They thought they'd be the maid of honor since the friend was the maid of honor at their wedding two years ago. But the friend chose another childhood best friend instead. The user's friend then discovered that other people in the wedding party aren't close either. The author is hurt but considering not attending because they aren't part of the wedding party.\n\nNow, the question is if the author is in the wrong. Let's consider social norms and expectations. Typically, attending a friend's wedding is a social expectation, even if you're not in the wedding party. Weddings are big events, and guests are expected to attend regardless of their role in the ceremony. The author is planning to not attend because they're hurt and feel the friendship is one-sided. However, not attending a close friend's wedding could be seen as a breach of etiquette, especially if the friend hadn't reached out to the author first about the wedding date. \n\nAlso, the author mentions they still plan to attend the wedding but not the party. Wait, no, the original question says they're considering not attending at all. The author is hurt, but the decision to skip the wedding entirely might be seen as a reaction to personal feelings rather than a valid reason. The friend hasn't excluded the author from the wedding entirely; they just aren't part of the wedding party. The author could still attend as a regular guest. \n\nThe key points here are: the friend hasn't excluded them from the event, just not the wedding party. Attending the wedding is a social norm unless there's a significant reason not to. The author's decision to skip might be seen as a personal choice, but given the 15-year friendship, it could be considered inconsiderate. However, the author is also justified in feeling hurt by not being asked first and not being included in the wedding party. \n\nBut the main issue is whether attending is expected. Since the author is not in the wedding party, maybe they feel it's not necessary. However, the expectation is that all close friends attend, regardless of their role. The author's plan to not attend could be seen as a slight, especially if they were under the impression they would be included. \n\nSo, considering all that, the answer might be that the author is in the wrong because attending the wedding is expected, even if not in the wedding party. The author's decision to not attend could hurt the friend more, even if the author is hurt. However, there's a counterpoint that the author is reacting to being excluded from the wedding party. \n\nBut ultimately, the author is making a choice based on their hurt feelings rather than the friend's actions. The friend might not have intended to exclude them, just not include them in the bridal party. The author could attend as a guest, which is the norm. Therefore, the author might be in the wrong for not attending, as it's a social expectation unless there's a compelling reason.\n"
