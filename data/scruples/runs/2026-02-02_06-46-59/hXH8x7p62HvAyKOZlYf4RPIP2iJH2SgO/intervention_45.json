I was surprised when I found out on Facebook because I thought this was something she would have told me first. I sent her a private message congratulating her and we spent some time talking about her wedding plans. I assumed I would be her maid of honor since two years ago she was the maid of honor in my wedding. \n\nA few weeks ago, I saw on Facebook that she asked another childhood best friend to be her maid of honor. I was hurt but understood that we have drifted apart the past few years. I still assumed I would be a bridesmaid. \n\nLast week I saw another Facebook post of her and everyone she asked to be in her wedding party. Two of the girls were people she hasn\u2019t been very close with lately. It has now become clear to me that I will not be in her wedding party. \n\nMy feelings are hurt but I understand that this is her day and she should have the people she wants standing up next to her. However, since I am not in the wedding party, WIBTA for not attending the wedding? She lives a few states away so I would need to buy a plane ticket, a hotel room, and request time off of work. This would not be a major hardship but it does not seem worth it to me since I am already embarrassed about not being in the wedding party. \n\nI am not interested in being in a one sided friendship. I would rather focus on friends who want to have me around. I do not plan on staying in contact with her after this. AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not wanting to attend their friend's wedding because they weren't chosen as a bridesmaid. First, I need to understand the situation thoroughly.\n\nThe friend has known the author for 15 years. The author found out about the wedding on Facebook, which was unexpected. They were expecting to be the maid of honor since the friend was the maid of honor at their wedding. However, the friend chose someone else, and the author wasn't even in the wedding party. The author is considering not attending because they're hurt and don't want to be in a one-sided friendship. They're asking if they're the AITA.\n\nNow, the user thinks the author is in the wrong. I need to evaluate both sides. On one hand, weddings are significant events, and attending is often expected, especially for close friends. Not attending could be seen as cutting someone off, which might hurt the friend. On the other hand, the author feels slighted and is prioritizing their own feelings and deciding to focus on other friendships. \n\nThe key points here are the reasons for not attending. The author isn't refusing out of spite but because they're hurt and don't want to be in a one-sided friendship. They also mention not staying in contact after, which implies they're moving on. It's important to consider cultural norms as well. In many cultures, attending a close friend's wedding is expected, but if the friendship has drifted, maybe the expectations are different. \n\nThe author's reasoning is that they don't want to pretend to be close if the friend isn't including them. However, some might argue that attending is a sign of respect and support regardless of being in the wedding party. The author might be overreacting, but their feelings are valid. \n\nI think the answer depends on whether the author's decision is based on valid reasons beyond just not being in the wedding party. Since they mention drifting apart and not wanting a one-sided friendship, it's more about self-respect than spite. So maybe the answer is B, not in the wrong. But I need to be careful here. If the author is cutting off a friend over something that's the friend's choice (choosing wedding party), maybe they're being too harsh. But the author is setting boundaries, which is important for mental health. \n\nHmm. The AITA often depends on the intent. If the author is being petty, then A. If they're setting boundaries, then B. The author mentions they were hurt but understand it's the friend's day. They're not being malicious, just deciding not to attend because they don't want to be in a one-sided relationship. So perhaps B is correct. The friend's choice to not include them isn't the author's fault, but the author's response might be justified.\n"
