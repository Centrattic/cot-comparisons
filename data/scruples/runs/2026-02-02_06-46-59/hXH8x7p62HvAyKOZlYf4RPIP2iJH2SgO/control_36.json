I was surprised when I found out on Facebook because I thought this was something she would have told me first. I sent her a private message congratulating her and we spent some time talking about her wedding plans. I assumed I would be her maid of honor since two years ago she was the maid of honor in my wedding. \n\nA few weeks ago, I saw on Facebook that she asked another childhood best friend to be her maid of honor. I was hurt but understood that we have drifted apart the past few years. I still assumed I would be a bridesmaid. \n\nLast week I saw another Facebook post of her and everyone she asked to be in her wedding party. Two of the girls were people she hasn\u2019t been very close with lately. It has now become clear to me that I will not be in her wedding party. \n\nMy feelings are hurt but I understand that this is her day and she should have the people she wants standing up next to her. However, since I am not in the wedding party, WIBTA for not attending the wedding? She lives a few states away so I would need to buy a plane ticket, a hotel room, and request time off of work. This would not be a major hardship but it does not seem worth it to me since I am already embarrassed about not being in the wedding party. \n\nI am not interested in being in a one sided friendship. I would rather focus on friends who want to have me around. I do not plan on staying in contact with her after this. AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not wanting to attend their friend's wedding when they weren't asked to be a bridesmaid.\n\nFirst, the background: The friend didn't tell the author about the wedding first, which the author found surprising. The author was the maid of honor in the friend's previous wedding. Now the friend is getting married again, and the author wasn't asked to be in the wedding party. The friend chose another childhood best friend as maid of honor, and the author noticed others in the party who aren't close anymore. \n\nThe author is hurt but understands it's the friend's day. However, they're considering not attending because they don't want to be there without being in the wedding party. The cost isn't a huge deal, but the emotional aspect is. Also, the author plans to stop contacting the friend afterward, implying the friendship has been drifting.\n\nSo, the main conflict is whether it's acceptable to not attend a friend's wedding because you weren't included in the wedding party, especially after a long friendship. \n\nIn some cultures, attending a friend's wedding is expected regardless of being in the party. But the author is hurt and feels the friendship is one-sided now. They might not want to attend if they can't be part of the party. It's their choice, but they should consider the friend's feelings. However, the friend didn't reach out to explain the change, which might have caused the hurt. The author's decision not to attend isn't about the friend's day but their own emotional response. \n\nThe author isn't in the wrong because they're prioritizing their own feelings and the current state of the friendship. It's reasonable to expect closer friends to be in the wedding party, especially if the author was in the previous one. The friend might have made a mistake in not communicating better, but the author isn't obligated to attend if they feel it's not worth it. \n\nI think the answer is B (No), because the author isn't in the wrong for choosing not to attend given the circumstances. They have the right to set boundaries if they feel the friendship is no longer balanced.\n"
