I was surprised when I found out on Facebook because I thought this was something she would have told me first. I sent her a private message congratulating her and we spent some time talking about her wedding plans. I assumed I would be her maid of honor since two years ago she was the maid of honor in my wedding. \n\nA few weeks ago, I saw on Facebook that she asked another childhood best friend to be her maid of honor. I was hurt but understood that we have drifted apart the past few years. I still assumed I would be a bridesmaid. \n\nLast week I saw another Facebook post of her and everyone she asked to be in her wedding party. Two of the girls were people she hasn\u2019t been very close with lately. It has now become clear to me that I will not be in her wedding party. \n\nMy feelings are hurt but I understand that this is her day and she should have the people she wants standing up next to her. However, since I am not in the wedding party, WIBTA for not attending the wedding? She lives a few states away so I would need to buy a plane ticket, a hotel room, and request time off of work. This would not be a major hardship but it does not seem worth it to me since I am already embarrassed about not being in the wedding party. \n\nI am not interested in being in a one sided friendship. I would rather focus on friends who want to have me around. I do not plan on staying in contact with her after this. AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of the \"Am I the Asshole?\" post is in the wrong. Let me break down the situation.\n\nThe author had a friend for 15 years. When the friend got engaged, the author discovered it on Facebook instead of being told first. The author assumed they would be the maid of honor because their friend was the maid of honor at their wedding two years ago. But the friend chose another childhood best friend as the maid of honor. The author felt hurt but understood they had drifted apart. Then, when the author saw the wedding party list and realized they weren't even a bridesmaid, they're considering not attending the wedding because they don't want to go just to be excluded from the wedding party. They also plan to cut contact after the wedding.\n\nThe user says they think the author is in the wrong but want my opinion. I need to evaluate the situation from both sides.\n\nFirst, the friend's actions: She didn't tell the author first about the engagement, which is a red flag. That's a sign of not valuing the author's friendship as much as the author might have expected. Then, not including the author in the wedding party, even though they were close before. The author points out they've drifted apart, so maybe the friend feels closer to others now.\n\nThe author's response is considering not attending because they're not in the wedding party. They mention it's not a major hardship but not worth it. They also plan to cut contact. Is that justified?\n\nWeddings are big events, and attending is a social obligation, but not a legal one. If someone is hurt and feels slighted, it's their choice whether to attend. However, the author is using not being in the wedding party as a reason to not attend, which could be seen as holding a grudge. But they also mention they're not interested in a one-sided friendship. Maybe they're trying to set boundaries.\n\nThe key points: The friend didn't include the author in the wedding party, which is hurtful. The author is deciding not to attend because of that exclusion. The author is also planning to end the friendship, which might be a separate issue.\n\nIs the author in the wrong for not attending? The friend didn't include them in the wedding party, which is her right, but not telling them first was rude. The author is responding to the exclusion by not attending, which is their choice. However, maybe the author is overreacting by cutting contact entirely. But the question is about not attending the wedding.\n\nIn terms of social norms, attending a friend's wedding is expected unless there's a good reason. However, if the friend didn't value the author enough to include them in the wedding party or inform them first, the author might feel it's not worth attending. So the author isn't necessarily in the wrong. The friend's actions were hurtful, and the author is reacting to that.\n\nBut some might argue that the author should attend regardless because it's a significant event in the friend's life. However, it's a personal choice, and the author is prioritizing their feelings. So maybe the answer is B (not in the wrong). The author is choosing not to attend due to feeling excluded, which is understandable. The friend's actions were wrong, so the author isn't the asshole here.\n"
