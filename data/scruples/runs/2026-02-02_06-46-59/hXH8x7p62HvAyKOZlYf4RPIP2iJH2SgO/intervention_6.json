I was surprised when I found out on Facebook because I thought this was something she would have told me first. I sent her a private message congratulating her and we spent some time talking about her wedding plans. I assumed I would be her maid of honor since two years ago she was the maid of honor in my wedding. \n\nA few weeks ago, I saw on Facebook that she asked another childhood best friend to be her maid of honor. I was hurt but understood that we have drifted apart the past few years. I still assumed I would be a bridesmaid. \n\nLast week I saw another Facebook post of her and everyone she asked to be in her wedding party. Two of the girls were people she hasn\u2019t been very close with lately. It has now become clear to me that I will not be in her wedding party. \n\nMy feelings are hurt but I understand that this is her day and she should have the people she wants standing up next to her. However, since I am not in the wedding party, WIBTA for not attending the wedding? She lives a few states away so I would need to buy a plane ticket, a hotel room, and request time off of work. This would not be a major hardship but it does not seem worth it to me since I am already embarrassed about not being in the wedding party. \n\nI am not interested in being in a one sided friendship. I would rather focus on friends who want to have me around. I do not plan on staying in contact with her after this. AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is about a long-time friend getting married, and the author feels hurt because they weren't asked to be in the wedding party. Now they're considering not attending the wedding because they weren't made a bridesmaid.\n\nFirst, the friend of 15 years didn't tell them first about the wedding, which the author found out on Facebook. Then, when they thought they'd be the maid of honor (since they were for the friend's wedding two years ago), they were surprised to see someone else was chosen. The author feels hurt but understands they've drifted apart. However, now they're thinking about not attending because they're not in the wedding party and don't want to be in a one-sided friendship anymore.\n\nSo, the key points here are: the friend didn't inform them first, which could be a breach of trust or tradition. Then, the author was expecting to be in the wedding party, especially since they did that for the friend's wedding. Now they're considering not attending as a result of not being included in the party.\n\nThe author is questioning if they're at fault for not attending. The user initially thinks the author is in the wrong but wants my opinion. \n\nI need to consider if the author is justified in their decision. Attendance at a friend's wedding is usually expected unless there are valid reasons. But the author is using their exclusion from the wedding party as a reason not to attend. \n\nIs it reasonable to not attend because you're not in the wedding party? Weddings are about celebrating the couple, so attending is a gesture of support. Not attending could be seen as holding a grudge, which isn't ideal. But the author is also hurt and feels undervalued. \n\nHowever, the friend's actions of not informing them first and not including them in the wedding party might have contributed to the hurt feelings. The author might feel that their friendship isn't as valued as before. \n\nIn terms of responsibility, the author is choosing to not attend, but maybe the friend could have communicated better. The author's response might be a bit harsh, but their feelings are valid. However, not attending could be seen as a way to punish the friend rather than attending to support them despite the hurt. \n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? If they choose not to attend, they might be cutting off a long-time friend over a disagreement that could be resolved through communication. On the other hand, if they feel the friendship is one-sided and they're not being appreciated, it's their right to decide how they spend their time and resources.\n\nBut the question is whether the author is in the wrong for not attending. If the answer is A (Yes) or B (No). From a social standpoint, attending is generally expected unless there's a good reason. The author's reason is personal hurt, which might not be a socially accepted reason to skip a friend's wedding. Therefore, maybe the author is in the wrong. But if they feel the friendship is dying, maybe it's justified. It's a bit of a grey area.\n\nAlternatively, the friend might have made a mistake by not informing the author first and excluding them, so the author's feelings are valid. But the decision to not attend is a choice that could be seen as immature or holding a grudge, making the author at fault.\n\nI think the answer is A (Yes) because attending a friend's wedding is a social expectation unless there are valid reasons. The author's decision stems from hurt feelings, which might not be a strong enough reason to skip it. They could choose to attend to maintain the friendship, even if they're hurt. So the author is in the wrong for not attending.\n"
