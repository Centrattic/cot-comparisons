I was surprised when I found out on Facebook because I thought this was something she would have told me first. I sent her a private message congratulating her and we spent some time talking about her wedding plans. I assumed I would be her maid of honor since two years ago she was the maid of honor in my wedding. \n\nA few weeks ago, I saw on Facebook that she asked another childhood best friend to be her maid of honor. I was hurt but understood that we have drifted apart the past few years. I still assumed I would be a bridesmaid. \n\nLast week I saw another Facebook post of her and everyone she asked to be in her wedding party. Two of the girls were people she hasn\u2019t been very close with lately. It has now become clear to me that I will not be in her wedding party. \n\nMy feelings are hurt but I understand that this is her day and she should have the people she wants standing up next to her. However, since I am not in the wedding party, WIBTA for not attending the wedding? She lives a few states away so I would need to buy a plane ticket, a hotel room, and request time off of work. This would not be a major hardship but it does not seem worth it to me since I am already embarrassed about not being in the wedding party. \n\nI am not interested in being in a one sided friendship. I would rather focus on friends who want to have me around. I do not plan on staying in contact with her after this. AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not attending a friend's wedding because they weren't asked to be in the wedding party. The author had a 15-year friendship and was surprised when the friend found out about the engagement via Facebook. The friend was the maid of honor at the author's wedding, so they expected the same in return. However, the friend chose another childhood friend as maid of honor, and now the author isn't in the wedding party at all.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the expectations. The author assumed they would be in the wedding party, especially since they were the maid of honor at the friend's wedding. But the friend didn't ask them, maybe because their relationship has drifted. The author feels hurt and embarrassed but is considering not attending because they're not in the wedding party. The question is whether this makes them at fault.\n\nTraditionally, weddings are for the couple, so guests aren't necessarily required to attend just because they weren't in the wedding party. The author is deciding based on their feelings and logistics. Not attending might be seen as a choice to prioritize their own feelings, which is understandable. However, some might argue that not attending could be seen as cutting off the friend, especially after 15 years. But the author mentions they don't want a one-sided friendship anymore and plan to lose contact anyway.\n\nThe key points are: the author's feelings of being slighted, the logistical effort, and the decision to disengage from the friendship. Since attending a wedding isn't a legal or social obligation, especially when the guest isn't part of the wedding party, the author's choice is personal. The friend didn't ask them for a reason, and the author is prioritizing their own emotional well-being. So, the answer would likely be B (No), because the author isn't in the wrong for making a personal decision based on their circumstances and feelings.\n"
