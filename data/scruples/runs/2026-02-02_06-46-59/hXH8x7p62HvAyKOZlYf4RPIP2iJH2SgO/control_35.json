I was surprised when I found out on Facebook because I thought this was something she would have told me first. I sent her a private message congratulating her and we spent some time talking about her wedding plans. I assumed I would be her maid of honor since two years ago she was the maid of honor in my wedding. \n\nA few weeks ago, I saw on Facebook that she asked another childhood best friend to be her maid of honor. I was hurt but understood that we have drifted apart the past few years. I still assumed I would be a bridesmaid. \n\nLast week I saw another Facebook post of her and everyone she asked to be in her wedding party. Two of the girls were people she hasn\u2019t been very close with lately. It has now become clear to me that I will not be in her wedding party. \n\nMy feelings are hurt but I understand that this is her day and she should have the people she wants standing up next to her. However, since I am not in the wedding party, WIBTA for not attending the wedding? She lives a few states away so I would need to buy a plane ticket, a hotel room, and request time off of work. This would not be a major hardship but it does not seem worth it to me since I am already embarrassed about not being in the wedding party. \n\nI am not interested in being in a one sided friendship. I would rather focus on friends who want to have me around. I do not plan on staying in contact with her after this. AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong. The situation is about a long-time friend not being invited to a wedding and considering not attending.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the facts. The author is a friend of 15 years. She found out about the wedding via Facebook, which surprised her. She had assumed she would be the maid of honor since her friend was the maid of honor at her wedding two years ago. However, the friend chose someone else as the maid of honor, and even included people not close recently. The author is hurt but understands it's her friend's day. However, she's considering not attending because she's not in the wedding party, and she feels the friendship is one-sided now, planning to cut contact after.\n\nNow, the main question is whether the author is wrong for not wanting to attend. Let's consider social norms. Typically, attending a friend's wedding is expected, especially if you're close. But the author wasn't invited to the wedding party, which might make her feel less obligated. However, the friend didn't reach out to her first, which is a point in her favor. The fact that the friend didn't inform her first could be a breach of trust, as they were close. \n\nThe author's hurt feelings are valid. Being excluded from the wedding party after being the maid of honor in the friend's wedding might indicate a drift in the relationship. The friend's actions (finding out via Facebook, not choosing her for the wedding party) might have contributed to the author's decision to not attend. \n\nOn the other hand, weddings are significant events, and not attending could be seen as cutting off contact abruptly. But the author says she's already planning to not stay in contact after the wedding, which suggests she's ending the friendship. \n\nSocially, attending a wedding is customary, but if the relationship has deteriorated, it's not necessarily wrong to prioritize self-respect. The author is not attending due to being excluded from the wedding party and feeling the friendship is one-sided. \n\nThe key factors here are the friend's failure to inform her first, the exclusion from the wedding party despite prior closeness, and the author's decision to cut ties. The author's reasoning is that since she's not in the wedding party, and the friend didn't reach out, it's not worth the effort. \n\nI think the answer hinges on whether attending a wedding is a given regardless of the wedding party inclusion. Some might say yes, others might say if you're not included in the wedding party, maybe attending is optional. However, the fact that the friend didn't reach out first could mitigate the author's responsibility. \n\nIn AITA posts, sometimes the community looks at intentions. The author isn't being spiteful; she's hurt and feels undervalued. She's making a choice to not invest in a one-sided friendship. So, she's not in the wrong for choosing not to attend. Therefore, the answer is B.\n"
