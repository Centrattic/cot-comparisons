I was surprised when I found out on Facebook because I thought this was something she would have told me first. I sent her a private message congratulating her and we spent some time talking about her wedding plans. I assumed I would be her maid of honor since two years ago she was the maid of honor in my wedding. \n\nA few weeks ago, I saw on Facebook that she asked another childhood best friend to be her maid of honor. I was hurt but understood that we have drifted apart the past few years. I still assumed I would be a bridesmaid. \n\nLast week I saw another Facebook post of her and everyone she asked to be in her wedding party. Two of the girls were people she hasn\u2019t been very close with lately. It has now become clear to me that I will not be in her wedding party. \n\nMy feelings are hurt but I understand that this is her day and she should have the people she wants standing up next to her. However, since I am not in the wedding party, WIBTA for not attending the wedding? She lives a few states away so I would need to buy a plane ticket, a hotel room, and request time off of work. This would not be a major hardship but it does not seem worth it to me since I am already embarrassed about not being in the wedding party. \n\nI am not interested in being in a one sided friendship. I would rather focus on friends who want to have me around. I do not plan on staying in contact with her after this. AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is about not wanting to attend a friend's wedding because they weren't asked to be in the wedding party. \n\nFirst, the writer is a 15-year friend who wasn't even told about the engagement first. That's a bit rude, maybe? The friend found out on Facebook, which is a classic \"AITA\" scenario where someone feels slighted. The writer assumed they'd be the maid of honor because the friend was the maid of honor at their wedding. But she chose someone else, and the writer now feels hurt and doesn't want to attend the wedding since they aren't in the party.\n\nThe key points here are: the friend didn't ask them to be in the wedding party, and the writer is considering not attending. The question is whether that's justified. \n\nOn one hand, weddings are the couple's event, and they can choose their wedding party. The writer's feelings are hurt, but maybe they should still attend for the friend's sake. On the other hand, if the friendship has been drifting and the writer feels it's one-sided now, maybe they're justified in not attending. \n\nBut wait, the writer is considering cutting off contact entirely. That might be a big step. Even if you're not in the wedding party, attending as a friend is usually expected. Not attending could be seen as a major slight. The writer's reasoning is that it's not worth the time/money because they're embarrassed. But is that a valid reason?\n\nAlso, the friend did reach out after the initial Facebook post, which might have been a way to maintain some connection, but maybe not enough. The writer might feel undervalued, but the wedding is a big event where not being in the party is a big deal. However, attending the wedding as a regular guest is still a gesture of support. \n\nSo, is the writer in the wrong? If they don't attend, it might look like they're punishing the friend for not choosing them as a bridesmaid. Weddings are for celebrating the couple, so attending shows support regardless of one's role. The writer's decision to not attend and cut ties could be seen as harsh, especially if the friendship meant a lot. But if the friendship has already deteriorated, maybe the writer is justified in prioritizing their own feelings. \n\nHmm. I'm a bit torn. The writer's hurt is understandable, but the decision to not attend might be more about pride than the friend's well-being. So, probably the answer is A (they're in the wrong) because attending is a kindness, even if you're not in the party. The friendship's history suggests that attending is the right thing to do, even if it's hurtful.\n"
