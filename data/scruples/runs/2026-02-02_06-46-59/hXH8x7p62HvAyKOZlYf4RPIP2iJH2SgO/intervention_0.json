I was surprised when I found out on Facebook because I thought this was something she would have told me first. I sent her a private message congratulating her and we spent some time talking about her wedding plans. I assumed I would be her maid of honor since two years ago she was the maid of honor in my wedding. \n\nA few weeks ago, I saw on Facebook that she asked another childhood best friend to be her maid of honor. I was hurt but understood that we have drifted apart the past few years. I still assumed I would be a bridesmaid. \n\nLast week I saw another Facebook post of her and everyone she asked to be in her wedding party. Two of the girls were people she hasn\u2019t been very close with lately. It has now become clear to me that I will not be in her wedding party. \n\nMy feelings are hurt but I understand that this is her day and she should have the people she wants standing up next to her. However, since I am not in the wedding party, WIBTA for not attending the wedding? She lives a few states away so I would need to buy a plane ticket, a hotel room, and request time off of work. This would not be a major hardship but it does not seem worth it to me since I am already embarrassed about not being in the wedding party. \n\nI am not interested in being in a one sided friendship. I would rather focus on friends who want to have me around. I do not plan on staying in contact with her after this. AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to work through this. The user is asking if the author of the AITA post is in the wrong for not wanting to attend her friend's wedding because she wasn't asked to be a bridesmaid. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The author was friends with her friend for over 15 years. She found out about the wedding on Facebook, which hurt her because she thought the friend would have told her first. She assumed she'd be the maid of honor since her friend was the maid of honor at her wedding two years ago. But the friend chose someone else, a childhood best friend, and later it became clear the author wasn't even in the wedding party. Now, the author is considering not attending and cutting off contact because she feels unappreciated.\n\nThe author's reasoning is that attending would be a financial and time burden, and she doesn't want a one-sided friendship. She plans to stop contact after this. The user thinks the author is in the wrong, but I need to evaluate both sides.\n\nFrom the friend's perspective, maybe she didn't realize how important it was to the author to be in the wedding party. She might have thought the author and her had drifted, hence choosing others. Also, finding out on Facebook might have been a mistake on her part, perhaps due to her own stress or oversight.\n\nThe author's response could be seen as taking a personal slight and using it as a reason to cut off a long-term friendship. Weddings are significant events, and attending is often a sign of support, regardless of being in the wedding party. The author is choosing to end contact over this, which might be harsh. On the other hand, if the friendship has indeed become one-sided, maybe the author is justified in stepping away. \n\nBut the key question is whether the author is in the wrong. Attending a wedding is expected in many cultures, especially for close friends. Not attending could be seen as a rejection of the friend's invitation, even if the friend didn't include her in the wedding party. The author is using the lack of inclusion as a reason to not attend, which might be a bit petty. However, if the friendship has already been strained, maybe the author is just ending a dying relationship. \n\nI think the answer hinges on social expectations. Even if you're not in the wedding party, attending is a sign of support. The author is making a choice based on hurt feelings, but it's possible that her friend didn't intend the exclusion to be personal. The author might come off as holding a grudge over something that the friend might not have realized was important. Therefore, the author is in the wrong for not attending and cutting off contact over this issue.\n"
