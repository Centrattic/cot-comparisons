I was surprised when I found out on Facebook because I thought this was something she would have told me first. I sent her a private message congratulating her and we spent some time talking about her wedding plans. I assumed I would be her maid of honor since two years ago she was the maid of honor in my wedding. \n\nA few weeks ago, I saw on Facebook that she asked another childhood best friend to be her maid of honor. I was hurt but understood that we have drifted apart the past few years. I still assumed I would be a bridesmaid. \n\nLast week I saw another Facebook post of her and everyone she asked to be in her wedding party. Two of the girls were people she hasn\u2019t been very close with lately. It has now become clear to me that I will not be in her wedding party. \n\nMy feelings are hurt but I understand that this is her day and she should have the people she wants standing up next to her. However, since I am not in the wedding party, WIBTA for not attending the wedding? She lives a few states away so I would need to buy a plane ticket, a hotel room, and request time off of work. This would not be a major hardship but it does not seem worth it to me since I am already embarrassed about not being in the wedding party. \n\nI am not interested in being in a one sided friendship. I would rather focus on friends who want to have me around. I do not plan on staying in contact with her after this. AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that they're a friend of 15 years, and they weren't included in the wedding party. They were surprised they weren't told first, expected to be maid of honor since they did that for their friend's wedding two years ago. But the friend chose another childhood friend as maid of honor, and others in the party who aren't as close. The author is hurt but now considering not attending the wedding because they're not in the wedding party and think the friendship is one-sided now.\n\nFirst, I need to consider social norms. Typically, attending a friend's wedding is seen as important, even if you're not in the wedding party. Weddings are big events, and friends are usually expected to attend if they're close. The author is thinking of not going because they're hurt about not being in the wedding party. But is that a valid reason to skip a wedding?\n\nThe author mentions that the friend didn't tell them first, which is a point. Maybe that was a mistake on the friend's part, but the author is using that as a reason to not attend. However, the author is focusing on their own feelings of hurt and not attending as a form of punishment, which might not be fair. The friend's choice of bridal party members is her right, even if it excludes someone. The author's decision to not attend could be seen as holding a grudge over not being chosen, which might be the author's fault because they assumed their role without the friend confirming.\n\nAlso, the author says they don't want to be in a one-sided friendship and plan to not stay in contact. That could be valid if the friend has been distant, but cutting off contact entirely because of the wedding party decision might be too harsh. It's possible the friendship has been drifting, and the author is using this as an excuse to end it, which might not be fair to the friend.\n\nOn the other hand, the author might feel deeply hurt and not attending could be their way of dealing with the emotional pain. But socially, attending a close friend's wedding is usually expected unless there are exceptional circumstances. The author is not in the wedding party, but that doesn't automatically mean they shouldn't attend. The cost and time might be a factor, but the author says it's not a major hardship, just not worth it emotionally.\n\nSo, the key points are: expecting to be in the wedding party without confirmation, the friend's possible drift in the relationship, and the author's decision to not attend as a reaction. The author might be in the wrong because they're letting personal hurt affect attending a significant event for a long-time friend. However, if the friendship has already been drifting, maybe their decision is understandable. But I think socially, attending is expected unless there's something more serious. So, the answer might be A (the author is in the wrong) because they're not attending due to personal hurt rather than the friend's actions.\n"
