I was surprised when I found out on Facebook because I thought this was something she would have told me first. I sent her a private message congratulating her and we spent some time talking about her wedding plans. I assumed I would be her maid of honor since two years ago she was the maid of honor in my wedding. \n\nA few weeks ago, I saw on Facebook that she asked another childhood best friend to be her maid of honor. I was hurt but understood that we have drifted apart the past few years. I still assumed I would be a bridesmaid. \n\nLast week I saw another Facebook post of her and everyone she asked to be in her wedding party. Two of the girls were people she hasn\u2019t been very close with lately. It has now become clear to me that I will not be in her wedding party. \n\nMy feelings are hurt but I understand that this is her day and she should have the people she wants standing up next to her. However, since I am not in the wedding party, WIBTA for not attending the wedding? She lives a few states away so I would need to buy a plane ticket, a hotel room, and request time off of work. This would not be a major hardship but it does not seem worth it to me since I am already embarrassed about not being in the wedding party. \n\nI am not interested in being in a one sided friendship. I would rather focus on friends who want to have me around. I do not plan on staying in contact with her after this. AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA scenario is in the wrong for not wanting to attend their friend's wedding because they weren't asked to be a bridesmaid.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The author is a 15-year friend who was surprised when the friend found out about the wedding on Facebook. They assumed they'd be the maid of honor since the friend was their maid of honor two years ago. But the friend chose someone else, and now the author is considering not attending because they aren't in the wedding party. They also mention drifting apart and not wanting a one-sided friendship anymore.\n\nSo, the key points here: the author feels hurt and slighted, but they're considering not attending the wedding, which requires some effort and expense. The question is whether that's reasonable.\n\nFrom a social standpoint, attending a friend's wedding is usually expected unless there's a major conflict. But the author feels excluded, which might affect their decision. The friend didn't inform them initially, which is rude, but maybe there's a reason. The author had a close relationship, but they've drifted. The friend chose others for the wedding party, which the author found out through social media.\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Well, not attending a wedding because you're not in the wedding party is a personal choice. Weddings are the couple's event, and the guest list is up to them. The author might feel hurt, but it's their choice to prioritize other friends who value their presence. However, not attending might be seen as cutting ties, but the author says they don't plan to stay in contact anyway.\n\nI think the author isn't in the wrong. They have a right to their feelings and can choose how to spend their time and money. The friend's actions (not informing them first, not including them in the wedding party) contributed to the author's decision. So the answer should be B (No).\n"
