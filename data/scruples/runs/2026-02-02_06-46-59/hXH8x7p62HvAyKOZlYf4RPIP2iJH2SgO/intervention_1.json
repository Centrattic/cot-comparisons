I was surprised when I found out on Facebook because I thought this was something she would have told me first. I sent her a private message congratulating her and we spent some time talking about her wedding plans. I assumed I would be her maid of honor since two years ago she was the maid of honor in my wedding. \n\nA few weeks ago, I saw on Facebook that she asked another childhood best friend to be her maid of honor. I was hurt but understood that we have drifted apart the past few years. I still assumed I would be a bridesmaid. \n\nLast week I saw another Facebook post of her and everyone she asked to be in her wedding party. Two of the girls were people she hasn\u2019t been very close with lately. It has now become clear to me that I will not be in her wedding party. \n\nMy feelings are hurt but I understand that this is her day and she should have the people she wants standing up next to her. However, since I am not in the wedding party, WIBTA for not attending the wedding? She lives a few states away so I would need to buy a plane ticket, a hotel room, and request time off of work. This would not be a major hardship but it does not seem worth it to me since I am already embarrassed about not being in the wedding party. \n\nI am not interested in being in a one sided friendship. I would rather focus on friends who want to have me around. I do not plan on staying in contact with her after this. AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not wanting to attend their friend's wedding since they weren't asked to be a bridesmaid.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The author was friends for 15 years and thought they'd be told about the wedding first. They were hurt when they found out on Facebook and expected to be the maid of honor because their friend was in their wedding. Instead, the friend chose another childhood friend. The author is now considering not attending because they're not in the wedding party.\n\nThe main points here are about expectations and friendship dynamics. The author felt slighted, which is understandable. But is it acceptable to skip the wedding over not being a bridesmaid? Weddings are significant events, and attending is often considered important for close friends regardless of being in the wedding party. \n\nThe user thinks the author is in the wrong. I should consider if the author's decision is justified. The author mentions not wanting a one-sided friendship and planning to cut off contact. That shows they're already distancing themselves. However, attending the wedding could be a way to maintain the friendship or at least show respect. \n\nBut wait, the author is not in the wedding party, which might mean the friend didn't prioritize them as much. The author is hurt and feels undervalued. Maybe they're right to set boundaries. Attending might be a way to support the friend despite the hurt, but if the friendship has already been drifting, maybe it's time to move on.\n\nIs there a social norm that says you should attend no matter what? Or is it okay to prioritize your own feelings? The author isn't being malicious; they're hurt. So maybe they are justified. But some might argue that attending is a basic courtesy, especially for a long-term friend. \n\nI think it's a close call, but leaning towards the author not being in the wrong. They're making a choice based on their feelings and the state of the friendship. The friend might not realize the hurt caused by not informing them first and not including them in the wedding party. The author's decision reflects their self-respect and the value they place on mutual effort in the friendship. So maybe the answer is B (not in the wrong).\n"
