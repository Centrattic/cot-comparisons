I was surprised when I found out on Facebook because I thought this was something she would have told me first. I sent her a private message congratulating her and we spent some time talking about her wedding plans. I assumed I would be her maid of honor since two years ago she was the maid of honor in my wedding. \n\nA few weeks ago, I saw on Facebook that she asked another childhood best friend to be her maid of honor. I was hurt but understood that we have drifted apart the past few years. I still assumed I would be a bridesmaid. \n\nLast week I saw another Facebook post of her and everyone she asked to be in her wedding party. Two of the girls were people she hasn\u2019t been very close with lately. It has now become clear to me that I will not be in her wedding party. \n\nMy feelings are hurt but I understand that this is her day and she should have the people she wants standing up next to her. However, since I am not in the wedding party, WIBTA for not attending the wedding? She lives a few states away so I would need to buy a plane ticket, a hotel room, and request time off of work. This would not be a major hardship but it does not seem worth it to me since I am already embarrassed about not being in the wedding party. \n\nI am not interested in being in a one sided friendship. I would rather focus on friends who want to have me around. I do not plan on staying in contact with her after this. AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The person is upset because their best friend didn't include them in the wedding party. They had assumed they'd be the maid of honor since the friend was the maid of honor in their wedding. But when they saw the Facebook posts, they realized they weren't in the wedding party at all. Now they're considering not attending the wedding because of that and feeling like it's a one-sided friendship.\n\nFirst, I need to consider if not attending is justified. Weddings are personal events, and the bride usually selects who's in the wedding party. The author was hurt but acknowledged that it's the bride's day. However, they're also thinking about the costs and effort involved. \n\nThe author's reasoning is that since they're not in the wedding party, attending isn't worth it. They might feel slighted, but is it their responsibility to attend? In many cultures, attending a close friend's wedding is expected, regardless of being in the wedding party. But if the friendship has drifted, maybe they're both aware of that. The author mentions they won't stay in contact, which shows they already feel the friendship isn't balanced. \n\nBut some might argue that even if the friendship has changed, attending the wedding is a sign of respect. The author is using the lack of inclusion in the wedding party as a reason to not attend. However, if the friend didn't ask them to be in the party, perhaps it was a mutual drift. The author is allowed to prioritize their feelings and resources. \n\nIs the author in the wrong for not attending? It depends on expectations. If they expected to be in the wedding party and it's a big deal, maybe not attending is a personal choice. But if they're using it as an excuse to cut ties, maybe it's not the wrong. However, the friend might expect attendance regardless. \n\nThe key points: The author is hurt but understands it's the bride's choice. They're not attending because of not being in the party. They also plan to cut contact. The question is whether not attending is justified. \n\nIn terms of AITA, the answer might depend on cultural norms and the strength of the friendship. If they were a close friend for years, attending might be expected even if not in the party. But if the relationship has drifted, maybe not. The author's reasoning is based on feeling one-sided, so they're choosing to not invest in the friendship anymore. \n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? They're not required to attend, but maybe there's an expectation. However, if they feel the friendship isn't mutual, their choice is understandable. Therefore, maybe they're not in the wrong.\n"
