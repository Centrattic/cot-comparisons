I was surprised when I found out on Facebook because I thought this was something she would have told me first. I sent her a private message congratulating her and we spent some time talking about her wedding plans. I assumed I would be her maid of honor since two years ago she was the maid of honor in my wedding. \n\nA few weeks ago, I saw on Facebook that she asked another childhood best friend to be her maid of honor. I was hurt but understood that we have drifted apart the past few years. I still assumed I would be a bridesmaid. \n\nLast week I saw another Facebook post of her and everyone she asked to be in her wedding party. Two of the girls were people she hasn\u2019t been very close with lately. It has now become clear to me that I will not be in her wedding party. \n\nMy feelings are hurt but I understand that this is her day and she should have the people she wants standing up next to her. However, since I am not in the wedding party, WIBTA for not attending the wedding? She lives a few states away so I would need to buy a plane ticket, a hotel room, and request time off of work. This would not be a major hardship but it does not seem worth it to me since I am already embarrassed about not being in the wedding party. \n\nI am not interested in being in a one sided friendship. I would rather focus on friends who want to have me around. I do not plan on staying in contact with her after this. AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for not wanting to attend their friend's wedding after not being asked to be in the wedding party.\n\nFirst, the friend didn't inform the author about the wedding, which they expected since they've been friends for 15 years. The author felt it was their place to be the maid of honor, especially since they had been the maid of honor at the friend's wedding two years ago. But the friend chose someone else, and the author now realizes they're not in the wedding party at all. \n\nThe author is hurt but acknowledges it's the friend's day. The main issue is whether they should attend the wedding without being part of the wedding party. They mention the costs and time off work, which they say isn't a major hardship but not worth it given their embarrassment. They also say they don't want a one-sided friendship anymore and plan to cut off contact after this.\n\nSo, the question is if the author is in the wrong. From what I understand, attending a friend's wedding is a personal choice. Even though it's a significant event, the author is prioritizing their own feelings and resources. They're not obligated to attend, especially since they're not part of the wedding party. The friend didn't make it a point to include the author as expected, so the author's decision not to attend doesn't seem unreasonable. The author is taking a stand for their own emotional well-being and setting boundaries, which is valid. Therefore, the answer would be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
