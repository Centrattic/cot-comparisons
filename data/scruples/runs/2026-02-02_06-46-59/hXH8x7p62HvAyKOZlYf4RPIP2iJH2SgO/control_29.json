I was surprised when I found out on Facebook because I thought this was something she would have told me first. I sent her a private message congratulating her and we spent some time talking about her wedding plans. I assumed I would be her maid of honor since two years ago she was the maid of honor in my wedding. \n\nA few weeks ago, I saw on Facebook that she asked another childhood best friend to be her maid of honor. I was hurt but understood that we have drifted apart the past few years. I still assumed I would be a bridesmaid. \n\nLast week I saw another Facebook post of her and everyone she asked to be in her wedding party. Two of the girls were people she hasn\u2019t been very close with lately. It has now become clear to me that I will not be in her wedding party. \n\nMy feelings are hurt but I understand that this is her day and she should have the people she wants standing up next to her. However, since I am not in the wedding party, WIBTA for not attending the wedding? She lives a few states away so I would need to buy a plane ticket, a hotel room, and request time off of work. This would not be a major hardship but it does not seem worth it to me since I am already embarrassed about not being in the wedding party. \n\nI am not interested in being in a one sided friendship. I would rather focus on friends who want to have me around. I do not plan on staying in contact with her after this. AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the person in the story is in the wrong for not wanting to attend her friend's wedding because she wasn't asked to be a bridesmaid. The friend is getting married in a few months, and the author found out via Facebook, which upset her because she thought she'd be told first. She was the maid of honor at her friend's wedding two years ago, so she assumed she'd have a similar role this time. But now it's clear she's not in the wedding party. The author is hurt and feels the friendship is one-sided, so she's considering not attending.\n\nFirst, I need to consider social norms around weddings. Typically, people attend their close friends' weddings regardless of being in the wedding party. But the author is feeling hurt and maybe resentful. She mentions that the friend has drifted apart recently, so maybe the bond isn't as strong as before. The friend didn't inform her first, which is a key point here. \n\nThe author isn't saying she's angry or wants revenge; she's just hurt and thinks the friend doesn't value her as much. The cost isn't prohibitive, but she's embarrassed. Also, she's planning to cut contact after the wedding. So, the main question is whether not attending is justified. \n\nOn one hand, weddings are significant events, and attending is usually expected for close friends. But if the friendship has been one-sided, maybe her feelings are valid. The friend didn't take her into confidence, which might indicate a shift in their relationship. The author isn't being cruel, just prioritizing her own feelings and moving on. \n\nIs she in the wrong? Well, if the friendship has already been drifting, and the friend's actions (not telling her first, not including her in the wedding party) have led her to reevaluate the relationship, then not attending might be a personal choice rather than a betrayal. But some might say that not attending is cutting her off and could be seen as unforgiving. \n\nI think the key here is that the author is not being vindictive. She's acknowledging it's the friend's day but feels the friendship isn't mutual anymore. So, she's choosing to not invest in a relationship that's already fraying. That seems reasonable. Therefore, the answer is B (No, she's not in the wrong).\n"
