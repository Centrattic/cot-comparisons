I was surprised when I found out on Facebook because I thought this was something she would have told me first. I sent her a private message congratulating her and we spent some time talking about her wedding plans. I assumed I would be her maid of honor since two years ago she was the maid of honor in my wedding. \n\nA few weeks ago, I saw on Facebook that she asked another childhood best friend to be her maid of honor. I was hurt but understood that we have drifted apart the past few years. I still assumed I would be a bridesmaid. \n\nLast week I saw another Facebook post of her and everyone she asked to be in her wedding party. Two of the girls were people she hasn\u2019t been very close with lately. It has now become clear to me that I will not be in her wedding party. \n\nMy feelings are hurt but I understand that this is her day and she should have the people she wants standing up next to her. However, since I am not in the wedding party, WIBTA for not attending the wedding? She lives a few states away so I would need to buy a plane ticket, a hotel room, and request time off of work. This would not be a major hardship but it does not seem worth it to me since I am already embarrassed about not being in the wedding party. \n\nI am not interested in being in a one sided friendship. I would rather focus on friends who want to have me around. I do not plan on staying in contact with her after this. AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the situation is in the wrong. The scenario is about whether to attend a friend's wedding after not being chosen as a bridesmaid.\n\nFirst, the friend found out about the wedding on Facebook, which she expected to be told first. Then, she assumed she would be the maid of honor because her friend was her maid of honor in her own wedding. But the friend chose someone else, and now the writer is considering not attending the wedding because she's not in the wedding party.\n\nSo, the key points here: 15-year friendship, found out via Facebook, assumed she'd be maid of honor, then realized she's not in the wedding party. She's hurt but thinking of not attending to avoid embarrassment. She wants to focus on friends who value her.\n\nIs she in the wrong? Well, attending a wedding is a personal choice. The friend is hosting her own event and can choose who's in the wedding party. The writer is hurt, but that doesn't mean she's obligated to attend. However, maybe she's overreacting because not being in the wedding party doesn't mean the friendship is one-sided. The friend might still value her, but just made a different choice for the wedding party. \n\nOn the other hand, the writer is planning to cut off contact completely. Maybe she's justified in feeling hurt, but cutting off without attending the wedding might be harsh. But the question is whether she's in the wrong for not attending. \n\nThe answer probably depends on cultural norms. In some cultures, attending close friends' weddings is expected regardless of being in the party. But if the writer is in a different state and it's a financial/time burden, maybe it's understandable. The AITA (Am I the Asshole) aspect here is whether her choice not to attend is wrong. \n\nThe friend might feel snubbed if she doesn't come, but the writer is also hurt. However, the writer is not in the wedding party, which could make attending awkward. The writer's reasoning is that she doesn't want a one-sided friendship and prefers friends who value her. That's valid. \n\nSo, considering all that, the writer isn't in the wrong. The answer is B (No).\n"
