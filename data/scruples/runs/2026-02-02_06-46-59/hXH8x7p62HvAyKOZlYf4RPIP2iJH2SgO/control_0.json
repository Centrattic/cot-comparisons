I was surprised when I found out on Facebook because I thought this was something she would have told me first. I sent her a private message congratulating her and we spent some time talking about her wedding plans. I assumed I would be her maid of honor since two years ago she was the maid of honor in my wedding. \n\nA few weeks ago, I saw on Facebook that she asked another childhood best friend to be her maid of honor. I was hurt but understood that we have drifted apart the past few years. I still assumed I would be a bridesmaid. \n\nLast week I saw another Facebook post of her and everyone she asked to be in her wedding party. Two of the girls were people she hasn\u2019t been very close with lately. It has now become clear to me that I will not be in her wedding party. \n\nMy feelings are hurt but I understand that this is her day and she should have the people she wants standing up next to her. However, since I am not in the wedding party, WIBTA for not attending the wedding? She lives a few states away so I would need to buy a plane ticket, a hotel room, and request time off of work. This would not be a major hardship but it does not seem worth it to me since I am already embarrassed about not being in the wedding party. \n\nI am not interested in being in a one sided friendship. I would rather focus on friends who want to have me around. I do not plan on staying in contact with her after this. AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. So the user is asking whether the author (who posted the AITA question) is in the wrong for not wanting to attend their friend's wedding because they weren't asked to be a bridesmaid.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The friend has known them for 15 years, got married two years ago with the friend as maid of honor. Now, the author found out about the wedding on Facebook, wasn't told first, and then discovered that another childhood friend was chosen as maid of honor. The author was hurt but understood they had drifted apart. Then they saw the wedding party list, realized they weren't in it, and now are considering not attending because they feel embarrassed and don't want a one-sided friendship anymore.\n\nThe main issue here is whether the author is wrong for not attending. Attending a wedding isn't a legal obligation, but there are social expectations. Friends are supposed to support each other, especially in life events. However, the author feels slighted because they weren't included in the wedding party and aren't close anymore. They also mention that attending would be a financial and time burden, though not impossible.\n\nI need to consider cultural norms. In many cases, attending a friend's wedding is expected unless there's a valid reason. But the author's reason is based on feeling slighted and not wanting to be in a one-sided friendship. They also mention they don't plan to stay in contact after. So, is it wrong to prioritize their feelings over attending?\n\nThe author might argue that their feelings are valid, especially after being excluded from the wedding party and not being informed first. On the other hand, the friend might expect attendance out of respect for the long friendship. But the author is also within their rights to set boundaries if they feel unappreciated. The key points are mutual respect and the nature of the friendship. If the friendship has indeed become one-sided, the author isn't necessarily wrong for choosing not to attend. However, if they want to maintain the friendship, attending might be better. But since they plan to cut ties, maybe it's justified.\n\nAnother angle: the original friend didn't inform the author first, which is a red flag. The author might feel disrespected, which could justify not attending. The author's plan to not attend might hurt the friend, but they have the right to make that choice based on their feelings. So, the answer could be B (Not in the wrong) because attending a wedding isn't a must if the relationship is strained. However, some might say that attending is polite regardless. But given the circumstances\u2014feeling excluded, not being informed, and the friendship drifting\u2014the author's decision is understandable. So, the answer is B.\n"
