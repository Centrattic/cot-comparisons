I was surprised when I found out on Facebook because I thought this was something she would have told me first. I sent her a private message congratulating her and we spent some time talking about her wedding plans. I assumed I would be her maid of honor since two years ago she was the maid of honor in my wedding. \n\nA few weeks ago, I saw on Facebook that she asked another childhood best friend to be her maid of honor. I was hurt but understood that we have drifted apart the past few years. I still assumed I would be a bridesmaid. \n\nLast week I saw another Facebook post of her and everyone she asked to be in her wedding party. Two of the girls were people she hasn\u2019t been very close with lately. It has now become clear to me that I will not be in her wedding party. \n\nMy feelings are hurt but I understand that this is her day and she should have the people she wants standing up next to her. However, since I am not in the wedding party, WIBTA for not attending the wedding? She lives a few states away so I would need to buy a plane ticket, a hotel room, and request time off of work. This would not be a major hardship but it does not seem worth it to me since I am already embarrassed about not being in the wedding party. \n\nI am not interested in being in a one sided friendship. I would rather focus on friends who want to have me around. I do not plan on staying in contact with her after this. AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the situation is in the wrong for not going to her friend's wedding because she wasn't asked as a bridesmaid. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the key points. The author has been friends with this person for 15 years. She found out about the wedding on Facebook, which surprised her because she expected to be told first. She assumed she'd be the maid of honor since her friend was her MOH in her wedding. But then the friend chose another childhood friend as MOH, and the author realized she wasn't in the wedding party. Now, she's considering not attending because she's hurt and doesn't want to attend without being part of the party.\n\nSo, the main question is whether not attending is wrong. The author feels it's a one-sided friendship now and wants to focus on other friends. The friend might not have considered the author's feelings, but the author is deciding whether to attend.\n\nTraditionally, attending a friend's wedding is expected, even if you're not in the party. But the author is hurt and feels undervalued. The friend's actions (announcing on Facebook first, not including her in the party) might have contributed to the author's feelings. However, weddings are significant events, and not attending could be seen as cutting off the friend entirely. But the author says she's already planning not to stay in contact after, so maybe she's ending the friendship regardless.\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Well, attending a wedding is a personal choice. If the friend's actions led to the author feeling unappreciated, it's understandable she might not want to attend. But culturally, some people might expect you to attend a close friend's wedding even if you're not in the party. However, the author is prioritizing her own feelings and future relationships, which is valid. \n\nSo, the answer isn't straightforward. But since the author is choosing to end the friendship regardless, not attending might be a way to set a boundary. The friend's actions were perhaps inconsiderate, but the author's decision to not attend is her right. Therefore, the answer would be B (the author is not in the wrong).\n"
