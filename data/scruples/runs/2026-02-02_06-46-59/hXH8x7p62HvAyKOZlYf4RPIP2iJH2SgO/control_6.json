I was surprised when I found out on Facebook because I thought this was something she would have told me first. I sent her a private message congratulating her and we spent some time talking about her wedding plans. I assumed I would be her maid of honor since two years ago she was the maid of honor in my wedding. \n\nA few weeks ago, I saw on Facebook that she asked another childhood best friend to be her maid of honor. I was hurt but understood that we have drifted apart the past few years. I still assumed I would be a bridesmaid. \n\nLast week I saw another Facebook post of her and everyone she asked to be in her wedding party. Two of the girls were people she hasn\u2019t been very close with lately. It has now become clear to me that I will not be in her wedding party. \n\nMy feelings are hurt but I understand that this is her day and she should have the people she wants standing up next to her. However, since I am not in the wedding party, WIBTA for not attending the wedding? She lives a few states away so I would need to buy a plane ticket, a hotel room, and request time off of work. This would not be a major hardship but it does not seem worth it to me since I am already embarrassed about not being in the wedding party. \n\nI am not interested in being in a one sided friendship. I would rather focus on friends who want to have me around. I do not plan on staying in contact with her after this. AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not wanting to attend their friend's wedding because they weren't asked to be a bridesmaid. The situation is about a long-time friend, 15 years, and the author felt surprised they weren't told first. The friend was the maid of honor at their wedding, so they expected to be in the wedding party. But the friend chose someone else, and now the author is considering not attending.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The key points are: the friend didn't inform them first, leading to feeling slighted. Then, not being in the wedding party. The author is hurt but understands it's the friend's choice. However, they're questioning if they're in the wrong for not attending. The main question is whether attending the wedding is expected even if you're not in the wedding party.\n\nWeddings are significant events, and traditionally, close friends are expected to attend regardless of being in the wedding party. But the author is hurt and feels the friendship has drifted. They mention not wanting a one-sided friendship and planning to cut contact. \n\nIs it wrong to not attend? Well, it's a personal choice. The friend didn't include them in the wedding party, which can be a big deal. The author is dealing with hurt feelings. Attending a wedding is usually a sign of respect and support, but if the friendship is already strained, maybe it's not worth the effort. Also, the financial and time commitment isn't too hard, but they don't think it's worth it. \n\nI think the author isn't in the wrong here. They have the right to prioritize their feelings. The friend's actions already caused hurt, so not attending is a valid response. The author isn't obligated to attend just because of past friendship. So the answer is B.\n"
