I was surprised when I found out on Facebook because I thought this was something she would have told me first. I sent her a private message congratulating her and we spent some time talking about her wedding plans. I assumed I would be her maid of honor since two years ago she was the maid of honor in my wedding. \n\nA few weeks ago, I saw on Facebook that she asked another childhood best friend to be her maid of honor. I was hurt but understood that we have drifted apart the past few years. I still assumed I would be a bridesmaid. \n\nLast week I saw another Facebook post of her and everyone she asked to be in her wedding party. Two of the girls were people she hasn\u2019t been very close with lately. It has now become clear to me that I will not be in her wedding party. \n\nMy feelings are hurt but I understand that this is her day and she should have the people she wants standing up next to her. However, since I am not in the wedding party, WIBTA for not attending the wedding? She lives a few states away so I would need to buy a plane ticket, a hotel room, and request time off of work. This would not be a major hardship but it does not seem worth it to me since I am already embarrassed about not being in the wedding party. \n\nI am not interested in being in a one sided friendship. I would rather focus on friends who want to have me around. I do not plan on staying in contact with her after this. AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the person in the situation is in the wrong for not attending their friend's wedding because they weren't asked as a bridesmaid.\n\nFirst, the friend found out about the wedding on Facebook, which was unexpected. They thought the friend would tell them first, especially since she was the maid of honor at their own wedding two years ago. Now, the bride is choosing someone else as maid of honor, and the friend is hurt because they've drifted apart in recent years. The friend is considering not attending the wedding because they weren't in the wedding party, and they don't want a one-sided friendship anymore.\n\nHmm. So the key points here are the expectation based on past roles, the method of finding out (social media vs. personal), and the decision to not attend. The author is feeling unvalued since they were the maid of honor before but now aren't in the wedding party. The bride might have her reasons, maybe closer current relationships or other factors. But the author is prioritizing their own feelings and not wanting to be in a one-sided friendship. \n\nI think it's important to consider that whether you're in the wedding party or not doesn't necessarily mean you have to attend. Weddings can be expensive and time-consuming, especially if you're not part of the party. The author's feelings are valid because they were caught off guard and expected to be included. But the bride's decision to include others in her wedding party doesn't obligate the author to attend. \n\nSo the author is not in the wrong for choosing not to go if they feel it's not worth the effort and emotional toll. They have the right to set boundaries, especially if they feel the friendship is becoming one-sided. The answer should be B, No. The author isn't in the wrong.\n"
