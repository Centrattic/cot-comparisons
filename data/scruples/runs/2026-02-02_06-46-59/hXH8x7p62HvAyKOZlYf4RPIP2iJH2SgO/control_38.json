I was surprised when I found out on Facebook because I thought this was something she would have told me first. I sent her a private message congratulating her and we spent some time talking about her wedding plans. I assumed I would be her maid of honor since two years ago she was the maid of honor in my wedding. \n\nA few weeks ago, I saw on Facebook that she asked another childhood best friend to be her maid of honor. I was hurt but understood that we have drifted apart the past few years. I still assumed I would be a bridesmaid. \n\nLast week I saw another Facebook post of her and everyone she asked to be in her wedding party. Two of the girls were people she hasn\u2019t been very close with lately. It has now become clear to me that I will not be in her wedding party. \n\nMy feelings are hurt but I understand that this is her day and she should have the people she wants standing up next to her. However, since I am not in the wedding party, WIBTA for not attending the wedding? She lives a few states away so I would need to buy a plane ticket, a hotel room, and request time off of work. This would not be a major hardship but it does not seem worth it to me since I am already embarrassed about not being in the wedding party. \n\nI am not interested in being in a one sided friendship. I would rather focus on friends who want to have me around. I do not plan on staying in contact with her after this. AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote this is in the wrong. The situation is about a friend not inviting them to their wedding, and the author considering not attending because they weren't in the wedding party.\n\nFirst, the author was a maid of honor at their friend's wedding two years ago. They assumed they'd be in the wedding party again, but their friend chose someone else. The author feels hurt but understands they've drifted apart. Now they're thinking about not attending because they're not in the wedding party, even though they were close for 15 years.\n\nHmm, so the main question is whether the author is in the wrong for not wanting to attend. Let's break it down. Weddings are big events, and while attending is usually expected, especially for close friends, the author is facing some emotional hurt and logistical costs. The friend didn't include them in the wedding party, which might be a big blow since they were MHO before. But it's the friend's choice to invite whomever they want. \n\nThe author's reasoning is that they don't want to be in a one-sided friendship and would rather focus on other friends. That's a valid perspective. They're not being vindictive but are prioritizing their own feelings. On the other hand, not attending might be seen as cutting off a long-time friend, but the author says they don't plan to stay in contact anyway. \n\nIs it wrong to choose not to attend? Well, the friend didn't necessarily exclude them maliciously but made different choices. The author might feel it's a sign of being less valued, but that's a personal interpretation. It's their right to decide whether to attend, especially considering the financial and time commitment. So maybe the answer is B, they're not in the wrong.\n"
