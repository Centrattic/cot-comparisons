I was surprised when I found out on Facebook because I thought this was something she would have told me first. I sent her a private message congratulating her and we spent some time talking about her wedding plans. I assumed I would be her maid of honor since two years ago she was the maid of honor in my wedding. \n\nA few weeks ago, I saw on Facebook that she asked another childhood best friend to be her maid of honor. I was hurt but understood that we have drifted apart the past few years. I still assumed I would be a bridesmaid. \n\nLast week I saw another Facebook post of her and everyone she asked to be in her wedding party. Two of the girls were people she hasn\u2019t been very close with lately. It has now become clear to me that I will not be in her wedding party. \n\nMy feelings are hurt but I understand that this is her day and she should have the people she wants standing up next to her. However, since I am not in the wedding party, WIBTA for not attending the wedding? She lives a few states away so I would need to buy a plane ticket, a hotel room, and request time off of work. This would not be a major hardship but it does not seem worth it to me since I am already embarrassed about not being in the wedding party. \n\nI am not interested in being in a one sided friendship. I would rather focus on friends who want to have me around. I do not plan on staying in contact with her after this. AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is about a friend not being invited as a bridesmaid and considering not attending the wedding because of it.\n\nFirst, the author is a 15-year friend who thought she'd be the maid of honor since she was the maid of honor in the friend's wedding. But the friend chose someone else. The author is hurt but understands the drift. However, now she's considering not attending the wedding because she's not in the wedding party, and she's also planning to cut off contact after.\n\nI need to evaluate if her actions are justified. Bridesmaid roles are often based on the bride's preferences for her day. Even if the author was hurt, the bride might have her reasons. Not attending because she wasn't in the wedding party could be seen as holding a grudge. The author mentions it's not a major hardship but doesn't seem worth it. But weddings are usually for celebrating the couple, not the attendees' feelings. \n\nAlso, the author says she's not interested in a one-sided friendship and plans to stop contact. That might be her choice, but deciding not to attend a wedding because she wasn't asked as a bridesmaid might be a bit harsh. People often attend weddings out of respect and to celebrate, even if they're not in the party. \n\nHowever, the initial hurt is valid. The friend didn't inform her first, which was rude. But the decision to not attend the actual event because of not being a bridesmaid could be seen as putting her feelings above the friendship. It's a bit of a toss-up. \n\nIn AITA scenarios, usually, the expectation is to attend a friend's wedding unless there's a serious reason. Not being a bridesmaid isn't typically a reason to skip. So the author might be in the wrong for not attending. But maybe she's within her rights to prioritize her feelings. Hmm. The answer might be B (not in the wrong) because it's her choice to attend or not, but some might argue she's being petty. But the user thinks the author is in the wrong. Need to consider cultural norms. In many cases, people attend even if not in the party. So maybe the answer is A. But the author is allowed to choose not to go. So maybe B. This is tricky.\n"
