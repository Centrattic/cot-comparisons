I was surprised when I found out on Facebook because I thought this was something she would have told me first. I sent her a private message congratulating her and we spent some time talking about her wedding plans. I assumed I would be her maid of honor since two years ago she was the maid of honor in my wedding. \n\nA few weeks ago, I saw on Facebook that she asked another childhood best friend to be her maid of honor. I was hurt but understood that we have drifted apart the past few years. I still assumed I would be a bridesmaid. \n\nLast week I saw another Facebook post of her and everyone she asked to be in her wedding party. Two of the girls were people she hasn\u2019t been very close with lately. It has now become clear to me that I will not be in her wedding party. \n\nMy feelings are hurt but I understand that this is her day and she should have the people she wants standing up next to her. However, since I am not in the wedding party, WIBTA for not attending the wedding? She lives a few states away so I would need to buy a plane ticket, a hotel room, and request time off of work. This would not be a major hardship but it does not seem worth it to me since I am already embarrassed about not being in the wedding party. \n\nI am not interested in being in a one sided friendship. I would rather focus on friends who want to have me around. I do not plan on staying in contact with her after this. AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person in the situation is in the wrong. The scenario is about a friend not being invited as a bridesmaid and considering not attending the wedding. The person is hurt but thinking about skipping the event.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the key points. The friend of 15 years found out about the wedding on Facebook, which upset them. They expected to be the maid of honor since the friend was their maid of honor. When they weren't in the wedding party, they're considering not attending. They also mention wanting to focus on friends who value them and not staying in contact anymore.\n\nThe question is if the author is in the wrong. So, the main issue here is whether not attending the wedding is wrong. The user is asking for a judgment between A (yes, in the wrong) or B (no).\n\nI should consider the norms around weddings. Generally, attending a friend's wedding is seen as important, even if you're not in the wedding party. But there are exceptions. The person is hurt because they weren't invited to the wedding party. Maybe they feel slighted. However, the bride has the right to choose her wedding party based on current relationships. The author mentions they've drifted apart, so maybe the bride chose closer friends. \n\nThe author is hurt, but is it wrong to not attend? The cost and effort are factors. The author is deciding to prioritize their feelings and focus on other friendships. In some views, attending a wedding is a social obligation, but others might see it as the bride's choice to include people. If the author is okay with not attending and not staying in touch, maybe that's their prerogative. \n\nAlso, the author didn't confront the bride about the invitation. Maybe they could have discussed it, but they didn't. However, the bride already made her choices. The author's decision to not attend might be seen as cutting off contact, but if they were already drifting apart, perhaps it's a mutual decision. \n\nIn terms of being in the wrong, if the author is choosing to not attend due to personal feelings, it's a personal choice. The bride isn't obligated to include them. So the author isn't necessarily in the wrong for not attending. The answer might be B (No).\n"
