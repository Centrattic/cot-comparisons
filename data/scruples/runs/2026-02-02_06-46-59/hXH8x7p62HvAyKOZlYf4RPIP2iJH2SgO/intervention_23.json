I was surprised when I found out on Facebook because I thought this was something she would have told me first. I sent her a private message congratulating her and we spent some time talking about her wedding plans. I assumed I would be her maid of honor since two years ago she was the maid of honor in my wedding. \n\nA few weeks ago, I saw on Facebook that she asked another childhood best friend to be her maid of honor. I was hurt but understood that we have drifted apart the past few years. I still assumed I would be a bridesmaid. \n\nLast week I saw another Facebook post of her and everyone she asked to be in her wedding party. Two of the girls were people she hasn\u2019t been very close with lately. It has now become clear to me that I will not be in her wedding party. \n\nMy feelings are hurt but I understand that this is her day and she should have the people she wants standing up next to her. However, since I am not in the wedding party, WIBTA for not attending the wedding? She lives a few states away so I would need to buy a plane ticket, a hotel room, and request time off of work. This would not be a major hardship but it does not seem worth it to me since I am already embarrassed about not being in the wedding party. \n\nI am not interested in being in a one sided friendship. I would rather focus on friends who want to have me around. I do not plan on staying in contact with her after this. AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is about not attending a friend's wedding because they weren't asked to be a bridesmaid.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the dynamics here. The author has been friends with the bride for over 15 years. The bride didn't tell her about the wedding first, which already seems like a breach of some kind. Then, the author assumed she would be the maid of honor because the bride was the maid of honor at her wedding two years ago. But the bride chose someone else, another childhood friend. The author felt hurt but understood they had drifted apart. Now, the author is considering not attending the wedding because she's not part of the wedding party, even though it's a few states away and they were close friends once.\n\nThe key points here are the friendship duration, the breach of expecting to be told first, the assumption of being a bridesmaid, and the decision to not attend because of that. The author is feeling slighted and wants to cut ties.\n\nI think the author's reasoning is flawed. Weddings are about the couple's day, and while it's hurtful not to be asked to be in the wedding party, that doesn't mean the author isn't welcome to attend. The decision to attend should be based on the friendship, not just the role in the wedding. The author is using not attending as a punishment, which might be a valid response, but morally, is it the right thing?\n\nThe bride didn't tell her about the wedding first, which is a problem. But maybe the author should still attend for the sake of the friendship. However, the author mentions they've drifted apart. So maybe it's time to move on. But is it wrong to not go to the wedding because you're not in the wedding party? It's a personal choice, but the author is making a judgment based on the bride's actions. The question is whether the author is in the wrong by not attending.\n\nIn AITA scenarios, the focus is on social norms. Typically, friends attend each other's weddings regardless of roles. So not attending might be seen as wrong. But if the friendship has deteriorated, maybe it's okay. The author is using the wedding as a way to end the friendship, which might be justified if it's one-sided. However, the author is using the wedding as a cutoff point, which could be seen as harsh. The author's reasoning is that since they're not part of the wedding party, the friendship isn't worth maintaining. But maybe attending the wedding despite the hurt could be a kinder action to show support, even if the friendship isn't as close.\n\nSo, from a moral standpoint, is the author in the wrong? If the friendship has already drifted, maybe it's not wrong. But generally, attending a friend's wedding is a social expectation. If the author doesn't attend, people might think they're in the wrong. But given that they've drifted apart, maybe it's reasonable. The answer could be B (not in the wrong) because the friendship has changed, and attending a wedding is a big commitment. However, some might argue that attending is still expected regardless of the role. It's a bit of a toss-up, but leaning towards the author not being in the wrong because they feel the friendship is one-sided and they're choosing to focus on other relationships. But maybe the author should attend to be polite, even if hurt. Hmm.\n"
