I was surprised when I found out on Facebook because I thought this was something she would have told me first. I sent her a private message congratulating her and we spent some time talking about her wedding plans. I assumed I would be her maid of honor since two years ago she was the maid of honor in my wedding. \n\nA few weeks ago, I saw on Facebook that she asked another childhood best friend to be her maid of honor. I was hurt but understood that we have drifted apart the past few years. I still assumed I would be a bridesmaid. \n\nLast week I saw another Facebook post of her and everyone she asked to be in her wedding party. Two of the girls were people she hasn\u2019t been very close with lately. It has now become clear to me that I will not be in her wedding party. \n\nMy feelings are hurt but I understand that this is her day and she should have the people she wants standing up next to her. However, since I am not in the wedding party, WIBTA for not attending the wedding? She lives a few states away so I would need to buy a plane ticket, a hotel room, and request time off of work. This would not be a major hardship but it does not seem worth it to me since I am already embarrassed about not being in the wedding party. \n\nI am not interested in being in a one sided friendship. I would rather focus on friends who want to have me around. I do not plan on staying in contact with her after this. AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of the situation is in the wrong. The author is considering not attending their friend's wedding because they weren't invited as a bridesmaid, even though they were a maid of honor in the friend's wedding two years ago. \n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The friend is getting married, and the author found out via Facebook instead of being told directly. That's a point of hurt. The author assumed they would be the maid of honor since they did the same for the friend's wedding. But then the friend chose another childhood friend as the maid of honor, and others who aren't as close. The author feels hurt but understands the drift. Now, they're considering not attending because they're not in the wedding party, even though it's not a huge hardship financially or logistically. The author also mentions wanting to focus on friends who value their presence and not engage in a one-sided friendship.\n\nThe user thinks the author is in the wrong. The question is whether skipping the wedding is justified. \n\nWeddings are significant events, and while the friend didn't include the author in the wedding party, the author might still be expected to attend out of respect for the friendship. The fact that they haven't been in close contact recently might affect this. But the author is hurt and feels unappreciated. \n\nIn terms of social norms, attending a friend's wedding is a common expectation, even if you're not in the wedding party. However, if the friendship has deteriorated, maybe the author is within their rights to prioritize their own feelings. But there's also the aspect of the long-term friendship (15 years) and the author's role in the previous wedding. \n\nThe author isn't attending because of hurt feelings, not because of a major conflict. They're choosing not to support the friend during this big event. That could be seen as selfish, especially if the friend didn't communicate directly. However, the friend's actions (finding out via social media, not including them) contributed to the hurt. \n\nI need to weigh the social expectations versus the personal feelings. The author's decision might be hurtful but not entirely without reason. It's a tough call. However, generally, attending a friend's wedding is expected unless there's a genuine conflict. The author is choosing not to attend for emotional reasons, which might be seen as inconsiderate despite their feelings. So maybe the author is in the wrong (A), but I'm a bit conflicted. Another perspective is that if the friendship is one-sided, it's okay to walk away. But the wedding is a key milestone. Hmm.\n"
