I was surprised when I found out on Facebook because I thought this was something she would have told me first. I sent her a private message congratulating her and we spent some time talking about her wedding plans. I assumed I would be her maid of honor since two years ago she was the maid of honor in my wedding. \n\nA few weeks ago, I saw on Facebook that she asked another childhood best friend to be her maid of honor. I was hurt but understood that we have drifted apart the past few years. I still assumed I would be a bridesmaid. \n\nLast week I saw another Facebook post of her and everyone she asked to be in her wedding party. Two of the girls were people she hasn\u2019t been very close with lately. It has now become clear to me that I will not be in her wedding party. \n\nMy feelings are hurt but I understand that this is her day and she should have the people she wants standing up next to her. However, since I am not in the wedding party, WIBTA for not attending the wedding? She lives a few states away so I would need to buy a plane ticket, a hotel room, and request time off of work. This would not be a major hardship but it does not seem worth it to me since I am already embarrassed about not being in the wedding party. \n\nI am not interested in being in a one sided friendship. I would rather focus on friends who want to have me around. I do not plan on staying in contact with her after this. AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not wanting to attend their friend's wedding after not being asked to be in the wedding party.\n\nFirst, the author and friend have been friends for 15 years. The friend didn't tell the author about the wedding first but rather the author found out on Facebook. The author assumed they would be the maid of honor since the friend was their maid of honor two years ago. But then another childhood friend was chosen as the maid of honor. The author still thought they'd be a bridesmaid, but it turns out the friend included people they haven't been close with recently. The author is hurt but tries to understand. However, they're considering not attending the wedding because they're not in the wedding party and don't want to spend money or time on a one-way friendship. They also don't plan to stay in touch after.\n\nSo, the key points here: The author feels slighted, maybe even betrayed by the friend not including them. They're not attending, which is a big decision. Normally, attending a friend's wedding is considered important, but there are exceptions. The author is hurt and feels the friendship is one-sided. But is it the author's fault? Did they do anything wrong in the situation?\n\nThe friend didn't reach out first, which might be a problem, but the author found out on social media. They did message the friend when they found out, which was good. Then, the friend included others the author isn't close with, which shows maybe the friend's priorities shifted. The author is choosing not to attend, which could be seen as a self-preservation move. They don't want to be in a one-sided friendship anymore. \n\nIn terms of social norms, attending a friend's wedding is common, even if you're not in the wedding party. But if someone isn't in the wedding party, maybe they feel less obligated. However, the distance and cost are factors. The author is making a choice based on their feelings and the perceived value of the friendship now. \n\nI think the key here is whether the author did something to deserve not being included. The friend's actions (not telling them first, not including them) are the main issues. The author isn't in the wrong for not attending, especially if they feel the friendship has become one-sided. They're prioritizing their own feelings and time. So the answer is B (No). But maybe someone could argue that attending is expected regardless. However, given the hurt and the author's reasoning, it's understandable. So B.\n"
