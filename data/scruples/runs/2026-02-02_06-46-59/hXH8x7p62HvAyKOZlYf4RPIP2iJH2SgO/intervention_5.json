I was surprised when I found out on Facebook because I thought this was something she would have told me first. I sent her a private message congratulating her and we spent some time talking about her wedding plans. I assumed I would be her maid of honor since two years ago she was the maid of honor in my wedding. \n\nA few weeks ago, I saw on Facebook that she asked another childhood best friend to be her maid of honor. I was hurt but understood that we have drifted apart the past few years. I still assumed I would be a bridesmaid. \n\nLast week I saw another Facebook post of her and everyone she asked to be in her wedding party. Two of the girls were people she hasn\u2019t been very close with lately. It has now become clear to me that I will not be in her wedding party. \n\nMy feelings are hurt but I understand that this is her day and she should have the people she wants standing up next to her. However, since I am not in the wedding party, WIBTA for not attending the wedding? She lives a few states away so I would need to buy a plane ticket, a hotel room, and request time off of work. This would not be a major hardship but it does not seem worth it to me since I am already embarrassed about not being in the wedding party. \n\nI am not interested in being in a one sided friendship. I would rather focus on friends who want to have me around. I do not plan on staying in contact with her after this. AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, they're a friend of 15 years, and their friend is getting married. The author thought they'd be the maid of honor because the friend was the maid of honor at their wedding two years ago. But instead, the friend chose another childhood best friend for that role. The author then discovered that others in the wedding party aren't close either. They feel hurt and embarrassed, and now they're considering not attending the wedding because they're not in the wedding party. They're also planning to cut off contact.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the expectations. The author assumed they'd be in the wedding party, especially the maid of honor, based on reciprocity. But the friend made different choices, maybe due to changing dynamics. The author is upset because they weren't told first and weren't included. But is it the author's right to expect to be in the wedding party just because they were once close?\n\nWeddings are personal, and the bride chooses her party. The author's friend might have valid reasons for her choices, like closer current relationships or other factors. The author's decision to not attend because they're not in the party could be seen as selfish. Weddings are significant events, and not attending might hurt the friend, even if the author is hurt. Also, the author mentions they don't plan to stay in contact, which adds to the conflict.\n\nBut the author's feelings are hurt, and they feel the friendship is one-sided. However, not attending a wedding, especially of a 15-year friend, might be a big move. Is it fair to punish the friend for not including them in the party? Or is the author overreacting? The fact that they're not attending could send a message, but it's possible they're letting personal hurt affect their actions in a way that's not considerate of the friend's perspective.\n\nThe key points are: the author's expectations vs. the friend's autonomy in choosing her wedding party, the decision to not attend, and cutting contact. The author might be wrong to not attend because the friend might not have control over who is in the wedding party, and the author's choice could be more about their own feelings than the friend's intentions. Alternatively, if the friendship has indeed become one-sided, maybe the author is justified in distancing themselves.\n\nBut the main question is whether the author is in the wrong for not attending. I think the answer depends on cultural expectations and the value placed on attending friends' weddings regardless of being in the party. In many cases, attending is expected even if you're not part of the party. So the author's decision might be seen as inconsiderate, making them the AITA. However, if the friendship has deteriorated, maybe it's a mutual thing. But the author is making a choice based on their own hurt feelings, which could be seen as wrong.\n"
