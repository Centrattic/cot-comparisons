My whole life, my dad has done most of the cooking and cleaning and provided the sole income for the family. He makes a good salary now, and she constantly berates him for not making more, or complains that her life isn't lavish enough. She acts like a petulant child and I find it absolutely repulsive when I have to visit for the holidays (I live across the country from them, and only visit once a year). I'm so sick of hearing her bullshit. She has zero hobbies and zero interests aside from talking about wealth with her friends (who are all the wives of relatively successful men in the neighborhood). \n\nShe's never shown any real interest in my or my siblings lives. The last promotion I got, her only input was to criticise me for taking so long to get one. I'm just so sick of being around this negative life sucking force. I had to put up with it for 20 years before I could move out, and every time I visit it puts me in a horrible mood. As such, I've barely said more than a sentence to her the entire time I've been visiting. I leave the room when she enters. I'm not even trying to hide the fact that I despise her anymore. I'm so sick of everyone catering to her bullshit.  \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author of the given situation is in the wrong. The author describes treating their mother with zero respect, avoiding interaction, and showing disdain. The mother is depicted as having a negative attitude, not having a job for 40 years, complaining about money, and not showing interest in her children's lives.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the moral and social implications. Respect is generally expected in family relationships, even if there are issues. The author's behavior\u2014avoiding their mother, not engaging, and showing open disdain\u2014could be seen as disrespectful regardless of the mother's actions. However, the mother's behavior is also problematic: she's not contributing to the household, is critical, and lacks interest in her children's lives. The author might feel justified due to long-term neglect and negativity.\n\nBut the key question is whether the author is in the wrong. While the mother's behavior is concerning, the author's response of complete disengagement and open disrespect might cross a line. There's a balance between self-care and maintaining familial respect. The author might be protecting their mental health, but it's possible that a different approach, like setting boundaries without total disrespect, could be healthier for everyone. So, while the mother's actions are questionable, the author's response could still be considered wrong. However, some might argue the author is justified given the circumstances. The answer hinges on societal expectations of respect and the severity of the author's actions versus the mother's.\n"
