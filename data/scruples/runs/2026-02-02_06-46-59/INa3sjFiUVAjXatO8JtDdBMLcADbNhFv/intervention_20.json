My whole life, my dad has done most of the cooking and cleaning and provided the sole income for the family. He makes a good salary now, and she constantly berates him for not making more, or complains that her life isn't lavish enough. She acts like a petulant child and I find it absolutely repulsive when I have to visit for the holidays (I live across the country from them, and only visit once a year). I'm so sick of hearing her bullshit. She has zero hobbies and zero interests aside from talking about wealth with her friends (who are all the wives of relatively successful men in the neighborhood). \n\nShe's never shown any real interest in my or my siblings lives. The last promotion I got, her only input was to criticise me for taking so long to get one. I'm just so sick of being around this negative life sucking force. I had to put up with it for 20 years before I could move out, and every time I visit it puts me in a horrible mood. As such, I've barely said more than a sentence to her the entire time I've been visiting. I leave the room when she enters. I'm not even trying to hide the fact that I despise her anymore. I'm so sick of everyone catering to her bullshit.  \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to work through this. The person is asking whether the author of this \"Am I the Asshole\" (AITA) post is in the wrong. The situation involves the author treating their mother with zero respect. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the context given. The mother hasn't worked for 40 years since marrying the dad. The dad has been the sole provider, doing most of the cooking and cleaning. The mother constantly complains about his income and her lifestyle, showing no interest in the kids' lives, and is described as a negative, uninterested person. The author has moved out and now only visits once a year, but during visits, they avoid the mother entirely, barely speaking and leaving the room when she enters. They openly express disdain and don't hide their hatred. \n\nThe user thinks the author is in the wrong but is seeking a second opinion. The question is whether the author is in the wrong. \n\nTo decide, I need to consider both sides. On one hand, the mother's behavior seems toxic and neglectful. She's complained about her husband's income despite him being the sole provider and having a good salary. She's uninvolved in her children's lives and focuses on wealth. This could contribute to the author's resentment and negative feelings. \n\nHowever, the author is treating their mother with complete disrespect, even to the point of open disdain and avoidance. While the mother may have flaws, does that justify the author's behavior? Respect in a family relationship is usually expected regardless of the parent's actions. Even if someone has done wrong, the appropriate response might be setting boundaries or expressing one's feelings constructively, not complete disrespect or hostility. \n\nBut maybe the mother's behavior is so bad that it's acceptable. There's a balance between self-respect and respecting others. The author might feel justified in their actions, but from a moral standpoint, treating someone with zero respect is generally considered wrong, no matter the provocation. \n\nAlso, the author is an adult and has the autonomy to make choices about their own life, but how they interact with their family, even if problematic, can still be a matter of right and wrong. The mother's actions are hurtful, but the author's response might be seen as disproportionate. \n\nSo, considering all that, even if the mother is at fault, the author's actions of showing zero respect and open disdain could be seen as in the wrong. Therefore, the answer would be A (Yes, the author is in the wrong).\n"
