My whole life, my dad has done most of the cooking and cleaning and provided the sole income for the family. He makes a good salary now, and she constantly berates him for not making more, or complains that her life isn't lavish enough. She acts like a petulant child and I find it absolutely repulsive when I have to visit for the holidays (I live across the country from them, and only visit once a year). I'm so sick of hearing her bullshit. She has zero hobbies and zero interests aside from talking about wealth with her friends (who are all the wives of relatively successful men in the neighborhood). \n\nShe's never shown any real interest in my or my siblings lives. The last promotion I got, her only input was to criticise me for taking so long to get one. I'm just so sick of being around this negative life sucking force. I had to put up with it for 20 years before I could move out, and every time I visit it puts me in a horrible mood. As such, I've barely said more than a sentence to her the entire time I've been visiting. I leave the room when she enters. I'm not even trying to hide the fact that I despise her anymore. I'm so sick of everyone catering to her bullshit.  \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user wants to know if the author is in the wrong for treating their mother with zero respect. The situation is pretty detailed. The mother hasn't worked in 40 years since marrying the dad. The dad does most of the work and provides the income, while the mom is always complaining about money and not showing interest in the kids' lives. The author is visiting once a year and can't stand the mom, so they avoid interaction and act like they hate her.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The mother's behavior sounds toxic\u2014complaining, lack of support, focusing on wealth. The author's response is to withdraw and show disdain. The question is whether this is justified or if the author is in the wrong.\n\nOn one hand, disrespecting a parent is generally frowned upon. Society often expects children to show respect regardless of the parent's behavior. Also, cutting off completely might be extreme, but maybe the mom is at fault here. On the other hand, the mother's actions are hurtful and neglectful. The author might feel justified in their reaction because of the mom's behavior over 20 years.\n\nBut the key point is the author's actions. Even if the mother is awful, treating someone with zero respect and actively avoiding them to the point of disdain could be seen as wrong. The author might not be in the wrong morally if the mother is abusive, but socially, disrespecting a family member, even a parent, is often seen as wrong. It's a complex situation where both parties have issues. The mom's behavior is definitely problematic, but the author's response is also extreme. The user thinks the author is in the wrong, but maybe they're not entirely right. The answer might depend on cultural perspectives and what's considered acceptable in family dynamics. However, the author's actions are hurtful regardless of the mother's faults. So, the author might be in the wrong (A) because they're choosing to be disrespectful, even if the mother deserves it. But maybe there's a balance here where the mother's actions justify the author's response. Hmm. This is tricky. I think the answer is A because the author is choosing to treat their mother with disrespect, which is wrong regardless of the mother's behavior. Even if the mother is terrible, the author should try to maintain some level of respect and maybe address the issues in a healthier way instead of complete disdain.\n"
