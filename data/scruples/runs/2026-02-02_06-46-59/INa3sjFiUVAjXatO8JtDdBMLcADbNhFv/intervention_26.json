My whole life, my dad has done most of the cooking and cleaning and provided the sole income for the family. He makes a good salary now, and she constantly berates him for not making more, or complains that her life isn't lavish enough. She acts like a petulant child and I find it absolutely repulsive when I have to visit for the holidays (I live across the country from them, and only visit once a year). I'm so sick of hearing her bullshit. She has zero hobbies and zero interests aside from talking about wealth with her friends (who are all the wives of relatively successful men in the neighborhood). \n\nShe's never shown any real interest in my or my siblings lives. The last promotion I got, her only input was to criticise me for taking so long to get one. I'm just so sick of being around this negative life sucking force. I had to put up with it for 20 years before I could move out, and every time I visit it puts me in a horrible mood. As such, I've barely said more than a sentence to her the entire time I've been visiting. I leave the room when she enters. I'm not even trying to hide the fact that I despise her anymore. I'm so sick of everyone catering to her bullshit.  \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong. The situation involves the author treating their mother with no respect. The mother hasn't worked since marrying the father 40 years ago, and the father does most of the work and provides income. The mother is described as complaining about wealth, not interested in her kids' lives, and being negative. The author, who lives far away, visits once a year but is rude, avoids interacting, and shows disdain.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The mother's behavior is certainly problematic\u2014complaining, not contributing, and being dismissive of her kids' achievements. That's not okay. But the author's response is to treat the mother with no respect, avoid her, and show open hostility. While the mother has flaws, the author's actions are disrespectful. Even if the mother is difficult, the author's approach might escalate the situation and not be the healthiest way to handle it. They might feel justified, but disrespecting a family member, especially in person during visits, can have negative consequences. The author could be in the wrong because they're using disrespect as a response instead of setting boundaries or trying to communicate. However, some might argue that the mother's behavior warrants such a reaction. But generally, the expectation is that one should treat family with respect regardless of their actions. So maybe the author is in the wrong (A). But I'm a bit conflicted because the mother's behavior is terrible too. However, the question is about the author's actions. So, the answer is A.\n"
