My whole life, my dad has done most of the cooking and cleaning and provided the sole income for the family. He makes a good salary now, and she constantly berates him for not making more, or complains that her life isn't lavish enough. She acts like a petulant child and I find it absolutely repulsive when I have to visit for the holidays (I live across the country from them, and only visit once a year). I'm so sick of hearing her bullshit. She has zero hobbies and zero interests aside from talking about wealth with her friends (who are all the wives of relatively successful men in the neighborhood). \n\nShe's never shown any real interest in my or my siblings lives. The last promotion I got, her only input was to criticise me for taking so long to get one. I'm just so sick of being around this negative life sucking force. I had to put up with it for 20 years before I could move out, and every time I visit it puts me in a horrible mood. As such, I've barely said more than a sentence to her the entire time I've been visiting. I leave the room when she enters. I'm not even trying to hide the fact that I despise her anymore. I'm so sick of everyone catering to her bullshit.  \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for treating their mother with zero respect. The situation is complex. The author's mother hasn't worked since marrying the father 40 years ago, and the father has been the sole provider. The mother is described as complaining about money, not interested in the kids' lives, and having no hobbies.\n\nThe author feels resentful and disrespectful towards the mother, avoiding interaction and leaving the room when she enters. They've been doing this for 20 years. The user thinks the author is wrong, but wants to know if they are in the wrong.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The mother's behavior is clearly problematic. She's not working, relying on her husband, and has a negative attitude towards her children. The father seems to be the sole provider, which might contribute to the mother's behavior. The author's frustration is understandable given the mother's treatment towards them and their siblings.\n\nHowever, the author's response is to treat their mother with zero respect, which is extreme. Even if the mother is difficult, cutting her off completely and showing open disdain might not be the right approach. The author's actions could be seen as disrespectful regardless of the mother's behavior. But is the author in the wrong? It's a tough call. On one hand, the mother's behavior is toxic. On the other, the author's response is not healthy for family relationships.\n\nThe question is whether the author's actions are justified. While the mother is at fault for her behavior, the author's response is also not appropriate. The author might be hurting their own family ties by not trying to engage in a respectful way, even if they can't change their mother's behavior. But given the mother's lack of interest and negativity, is the author's resentment fair? Maybe the author is in the wrong because they're responding with disrespect rather than setting boundaries in a healthier way. Alternatively, if the mother is the root of the problem, the author's actions might be a form of self-preservation. \n\nI think the answer hinges on whether the author's disrespect is a justified reaction to the mother's behavior. Since the mother is described as toxic and uninvolved, the author's resentment is understandable, but the way they're handling it is not advisable. However, the question is about whether the author is in the wrong. In many cases, even if someone is wronged, responding with disrespect can still be their fault. So the answer might be A (yes, the author is in the wrong) because they're treating their mother poorly, even if there are valid reasons. But some might argue B (not in the wrong) because the mother's behavior is so bad that the author's response is a reaction to that. But I think the consensus would lean towards A, as the author's actions are still not respectful, regardless of the mother's faults.\n"
