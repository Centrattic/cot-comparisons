My whole life, my dad has done most of the cooking and cleaning and provided the sole income for the family. He makes a good salary now, and she constantly berates him for not making more, or complains that her life isn't lavish enough. She acts like a petulant child and I find it absolutely repulsive when I have to visit for the holidays (I live across the country from them, and only visit once a year). I'm so sick of hearing her bullshit. She has zero hobbies and zero interests aside from talking about wealth with her friends (who are all the wives of relatively successful men in the neighborhood). \n\nShe's never shown any real interest in my or my siblings lives. The last promotion I got, her only input was to criticise me for taking so long to get one. I'm just so sick of being around this negative life sucking force. I had to put up with it for 20 years before I could move out, and every time I visit it puts me in a horrible mood. As such, I've barely said more than a sentence to her the entire time I've been visiting. I leave the room when she enters. I'm not even trying to hide the fact that I despise her anymore. I'm so sick of everyone catering to her bullshit.  \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for treating their mother with zero respect. The situation described is pretty complex.\n\nFirst, the author's mom hasn't worked in 40 years since marrying the dad. The dad does most of the cooking, cleaning, and provides all the income. The mom is critical of the dad's salary, complains about not having a lavish life, and has no hobbies. She's also dismissive of the author's achievements, like criticizing their promotion. The author feels resentful and treats their mom poorly, avoiding her, not talking, and showing disdain.\n\nNow, the user thinks the author is wrong but wants to know if that's accurate. Let me break this down.\n\nOn one hand, the author's behavior\u2014ignoring their mom, showing open disdain\u2014is disrespectful regardless of the reasons. Family relationships often require respect even in difficult circumstances. The mom's behavior is clearly problematic, but that doesn't justify the author's treatment of her. The author might be dealing with years of hurt, but cutting off communication entirely isn't healthy. They might need to address the mom's behavior through better communication rather than treating her with zero respect.\n\nOn the other hand, the mom's actions are pretty terrible. Being a constant critic, having no interests beyond wealth, and not caring about her children's lives is harmful. The author has been through a lot, living across the country and only visiting once a year. Their emotional response is understandable given the mom's behavior. However, the way they handle it is the issue here.\n\nSo, even though the mom is at fault, the author isn't in the right by treating her with no respect. The author should seek healthier ways to manage their feelings, maybe setting boundaries or seeking therapy. But the disrespect is still wrong. Therefore, the answer would be A (the author is in the wrong) because the way they're treating their mom is not acceptable, despite the mom's flaws.\n"
