My whole life, my dad has done most of the cooking and cleaning and provided the sole income for the family. He makes a good salary now, and she constantly berates him for not making more, or complains that her life isn't lavish enough. She acts like a petulant child and I find it absolutely repulsive when I have to visit for the holidays (I live across the country from them, and only visit once a year). I'm so sick of hearing her bullshit. She has zero hobbies and zero interests aside from talking about wealth with her friends (who are all the wives of relatively successful men in the neighborhood). \n\nShe's never shown any real interest in my or my siblings lives. The last promotion I got, her only input was to criticise me for taking so long to get one. I'm just so sick of being around this negative life sucking force. I had to put up with it for 20 years before I could move out, and every time I visit it puts me in a horrible mood. As such, I've barely said more than a sentence to her the entire time I've been visiting. I leave the room when she enters. I'm not even trying to hide the fact that I despise her anymore. I'm so sick of everyone catering to her bullshit.  \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The situation is about the author treating their mother with zero respect. The mother hasn't worked since marrying the father 40 years ago, and the father does most of the work and provides the income. The mom is described as complaining about money, not interested in the kids' lives, and having no hobbies. The author only visits once a year and has been ignoring the mom, even avoiding her.\n\nFirst, I need to consider cultural norms around family respect. In many cultures, especially traditional ones, children are expected to show respect to parents regardless of the parents' behavior. The author is actively avoiding their mother, which might be seen as disrespectful regardless of the mother's actions. But then, maybe the mother's behavior is toxic, so the author's reaction could be a form of self-preservation.\n\nThe mother's behavior includes constant criticism, lack of support, and focusing on wealth. The author's response is to withhold conversation and leave the room. While the mother's actions are problematic, the author's response could be seen as extreme. However, considering the mother's behavior over 20 years and the author's need for emotional well-being, some might argue it's justified.\n\nBut the question is whether the author is in the wrong. Legally, no. Socially, there's a debate. If the situation is causing harm to the author, setting boundaries is reasonable. However, completely cutting off communication might be seen as harsh. The answer depends on whether society expects respect even in the face of poor treatment. Since the mother is a parent, there's an expectation of respect in many cultures, so the author might be in the wrong. However, if the mother's behavior is truly abusive, it's a different angle. The story says the author is \"sick of being around this negative force,\" so maybe their actions are a form of self-care. But the question is about being in the wrong, not about right or wrong in a legal sense. So, culturally, treating a parent with zero respect is often frowned upon, even if the parent isn't perfect. Therefore, the answer might be A (the author is in the wrong). But some might argue B (not in the wrong) because the mother's behavior is terrible. The balance here is tricky. The author is an adult, so they have more autonomy. However, the way they're treating their mother is disrespectful. So maybe the answer is A, but with consideration for the mother's behavior.\n"
