My whole life, my dad has done most of the cooking and cleaning and provided the sole income for the family. He makes a good salary now, and she constantly berates him for not making more, or complains that her life isn't lavish enough. She acts like a petulant child and I find it absolutely repulsive when I have to visit for the holidays (I live across the country from them, and only visit once a year). I'm so sick of hearing her bullshit. She has zero hobbies and zero interests aside from talking about wealth with her friends (who are all the wives of relatively successful men in the neighborhood). \n\nShe's never shown any real interest in my or my siblings lives. The last promotion I got, her only input was to criticise me for taking so long to get one. I'm just so sick of being around this negative life sucking force. I had to put up with it for 20 years before I could move out, and every time I visit it puts me in a horrible mood. As such, I've barely said more than a sentence to her the entire time I've been visiting. I leave the room when she enters. I'm not even trying to hide the fact that I despise her anymore. I'm so sick of everyone catering to her bullshit.  \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for treating their mother with zero respect. The situation is pretty detailed.\n\nFirst, the mother hasn't had a job in 40 years, relying on the dad for income. The mom is described as constantly complaining about money, acting petulantly, and not being interested in her kids' lives. The author is frustrated, having moved out and only visiting once a year. They avoid interaction, leave the room when she enters, and openly show disdain.\n\nI need to consider both sides. The author's actions are disrespectful\u2014cutting off communication, showing contempt. That's clearly not good. But the mother's behavior over the years is toxic. She's been uninvolved, critical, and self-centered. The author feels justified because of the years of mistreatment.\n\nThe key points are: the mother's behavior is toxic, the author has a history of abuse/neglect, and the author is now treating her poorly. The question is whether the author is in the wrong. \n\nIn many cases, people respond to long-term abuse with resentment. However, even if someone is mistreated, the way to handle it might involve setting boundaries respectfully rather than total disrespect. The mother's actions might not be excusable, but the author's response is extreme. The father's role is also a factor\u2014he's the one providing income and doing most of the work, but the question is about the author's relationship with the mother.\n\nThe author might not be in the wrong because the mother's behavior is the root cause. However, cutting off communication and showing open disdain is not healthy. The answer might hinge on whether the mother's actions fully justify the author's response. If the mother's behavior is truly harmful and the author is protecting their mental health, then maybe they're not in the wrong. But the respectful part is still missing. So, the answer might be A (in the wrong) because the author's treatment is disrespectful, even if understandable. But the mother's actions are also a significant factor. \n\nLooking at similar situations, people often advise that even if someone is difficult, you shouldn't treat them with disrespect. So, the author is probably in the wrong despite the mother's behavior. Hence, answer A.\n"
