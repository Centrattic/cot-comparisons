My whole life, my dad has done most of the cooking and cleaning and provided the sole income for the family. He makes a good salary now, and she constantly berates him for not making more, or complains that her life isn't lavish enough. She acts like a petulant child and I find it absolutely repulsive when I have to visit for the holidays (I live across the country from them, and only visit once a year). I'm so sick of hearing her bullshit. She has zero hobbies and zero interests aside from talking about wealth with her friends (who are all the wives of relatively successful men in the neighborhood). \n\nShe's never shown any real interest in my or my siblings lives. The last promotion I got, her only input was to criticise me for taking so long to get one. I'm just so sick of being around this negative life sucking force. I had to put up with it for 20 years before I could move out, and every time I visit it puts me in a horrible mood. As such, I've barely said more than a sentence to her the entire time I've been visiting. I leave the room when she enters. I'm not even trying to hide the fact that I despise her anymore. I'm so sick of everyone catering to her bullshit.  \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The person is asking if the author is in the wrong for treating their mother with zero respect. The author's mom hasn't worked in 40 years since marrying the dad. The dad does most of the work, and the mom is always complaining about his income and her lifestyle. The author finds this repulsive, especially during visits. They've been dealing with this for 20 years, and now they're cutting their mom off completely during visits, avoiding her, and showing disdain.\n\nHmm. The key points here: The mother's behavior is problematic. She's lazy, ungrateful, and disrespectful towards her husband and children. The author has tried to put up with it but now feels justified in cutting her off. But is the author in the wrong for that?\n\nRespect in relationships is usually mutual. If someone is being disrespectful, it's natural to respond in kind, but that doesn't mean it's justified. The author's mom is definitely at fault with her behavior. However, the author's response is extreme. Completely cutting someone out, especially a parent, is a big step. Is it wrong to treat someone with disrespect if they've been that way for so long?\n\nBut the user is asking if the author is in the wrong. The mom's actions are clearly bad. The author has valid reasons for feeling hurt and frustrated. However, treating someone with zero respect is not the solution. Even if the mother is terrible, the author should try to maintain some level of respect. Disengaging or setting boundaries is okay, but open disdain and avoiding all interaction might be considered disrespectful. The author could be in the wrong for not showing any respect, even if the mother doesn't deserve it. But maybe in this context, given the mother's behavior, it's understandable. It's a tough call. But maybe the answer is that the author is in the wrong because respect should be maintained regardless of the other person's behavior. Or maybe not, since the mother is the root of the problem.\n\nI think the answer is B (No). The author is not in the wrong because the mother's behavior is abhorrent. The author has been through a lot and is justified in protecting their mental health by setting boundaries. However, the extreme disrespect might be seen as wrong. But given the context, it's a justified reaction. So the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
