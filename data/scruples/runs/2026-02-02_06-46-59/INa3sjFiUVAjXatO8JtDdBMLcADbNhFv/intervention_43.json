My whole life, my dad has done most of the cooking and cleaning and provided the sole income for the family. He makes a good salary now, and she constantly berates him for not making more, or complains that her life isn't lavish enough. She acts like a petulant child and I find it absolutely repulsive when I have to visit for the holidays (I live across the country from them, and only visit once a year). I'm so sick of hearing her bullshit. She has zero hobbies and zero interests aside from talking about wealth with her friends (who are all the wives of relatively successful men in the neighborhood). \n\nShe's never shown any real interest in my or my siblings lives. The last promotion I got, her only input was to criticise me for taking so long to get one. I'm just so sick of being around this negative life sucking force. I had to put up with it for 20 years before I could move out, and every time I visit it puts me in a horrible mood. As such, I've barely said more than a sentence to her the entire time I've been visiting. I leave the room when she enters. I'm not even trying to hide the fact that I despise her anymore. I'm so sick of everyone catering to her bullshit.  \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. Let me start by reading through the situation again carefully. The user is asking if the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong for treating their mother with zero respect. The author describes their mother as someone who hasn't worked since marrying their father 40 years ago. The father does most of the cooking, cleaning, and provides the sole income. The mother complains about the father's salary and isn't lavish enough, acts like a petulant child, and the author finds this repulsive. The author visits once a year and can't stand being around her, so they barely talk and leave the room when she enters, openly showing disdain.\n\nThe user thinks the author is in the wrong but wants my opinion. So, I need to evaluate both sides. On one hand, the mother's behavior is clearly problematic\u2014she's not working, relies on her husband, complains a lot, and doesn't support her children. The author has endured this for 20 years before moving out. On the other hand, the author is responding by showing no respect, which is the issue here. The question is whether their disrespectful behavior is justified given their mother's actions.\n\nIn many cultures, there's an expectation to respect family members, even if they're difficult. However, this isn't a straightforward case. The mother's behavior is toxic and negative, and the author is reacting to years of neglect and criticism. But the author's response is extreme: they're openly showing hatred, avoiding contact, and making the mother feel despised. While the mother's actions are deplorable, the author's approach might be seen as disrespectful, even if it's a reaction to abuse. However, in some cases, setting boundaries with toxic family members is necessary for one's mental health. The key is whether the author's treatment is excessive given the mother's behavior. If the mother is indeed a \"negative life-sucking force,\" the author might be protecting themselves, but the method could be questioned. The answer might depend on cultural norms and whether the author's actions are proportionate. But since the question is about being in the wrong, if the author is responding to abuse, maybe they aren't entirely in the wrong. However, the way they treat their mother is disrespectful regardless of the reasons. So, there's a conflict between the justification for the behavior and the act itself. I think the answer is A (the author is in the wrong) because disrespecting a family member, even if they're toxic, is generally frowned upon. But I'm not entirely sure because the mother's behavior is also terrible. However, the question is about the author's actions. So, the answer might be A because the author is choosing to be disrespectful, which is their fault even if the mother is awful. Alternatively, if the mother's behavior justifies the author's actions, then B. But I think the societal expectation is that you should respect family regardless, so the author is in the wrong. So I'll go with A.\n"
