My whole life, my dad has done most of the cooking and cleaning and provided the sole income for the family. He makes a good salary now, and she constantly berates him for not making more, or complains that her life isn't lavish enough. She acts like a petulant child and I find it absolutely repulsive when I have to visit for the holidays (I live across the country from them, and only visit once a year). I'm so sick of hearing her bullshit. She has zero hobbies and zero interests aside from talking about wealth with her friends (who are all the wives of relatively successful men in the neighborhood). \n\nShe's never shown any real interest in my or my siblings lives. The last promotion I got, her only input was to criticise me for taking so long to get one. I'm just so sick of being around this negative life sucking force. I had to put up with it for 20 years before I could move out, and every time I visit it puts me in a horrible mood. As such, I've barely said more than a sentence to her the entire time I've been visiting. I leave the room when she enters. I'm not even trying to hide the fact that I despise her anymore. I'm so sick of everyone catering to her bullshit.  \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong.\n\nFirst, the author's mom has been out of the workforce for 40 years since marrying their dad. The dad is the sole breadwinner, doing most of the cooking and cleaning. The mom is described as always complaining about money and being a \"petulant child.\" The author finds her behavior repulsive and avoids interacting with her during visits, showing clear disdain. The user thinks the author is in the wrong but wants to know my take.\n\nSo, the key points here are the mother's behavior versus the author's response. The mother's complaints and lack of interest in her children's lives are issues. The author, however, is cutting off communication and showing open contempt. Even if the mother is difficult, treating a family member with zero respect and avoiding them entirely might be crossing a line.\n\nBut wait, the author has a history of being mistreated. The mother criticized them for their promotion, shows no interest in their lives, and the author has endured this for 20 years. Moving out and moving across the country, but when visiting, the author still has to deal with her. The author's reaction is a result of years of frustration. \n\nIs it wrong to not want to interact with someone who's been this negative and dismissive? On one hand, respect is important even if you disagree with someone. On the other hand, the mother's behavior is toxic. However, the author's approach of complete avoidance and open disdain might not be healthy either. It's possible that the author is justified in feeling resentment, but the way they express it could be wrong. \n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong. If the mother is indeed the source of the problem, but the author's response is disrespectful and harmful, then the author could be at fault for their actions. Even if the mother is difficult, the author's choice to treat her with no respect might be the wrong approach. There's a difference between setting boundaries and completely cutting someone out with hostility. The author might need to find a healthier way to handle the situation rather than showing contempt. So maybe the answer is A, the author is in the wrong.\n"
