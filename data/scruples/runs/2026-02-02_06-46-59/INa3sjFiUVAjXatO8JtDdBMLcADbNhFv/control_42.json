My whole life, my dad has done most of the cooking and cleaning and provided the sole income for the family. He makes a good salary now, and she constantly berates him for not making more, or complains that her life isn't lavish enough. She acts like a petulant child and I find it absolutely repulsive when I have to visit for the holidays (I live across the country from them, and only visit once a year). I'm so sick of hearing her bullshit. She has zero hobbies and zero interests aside from talking about wealth with her friends (who are all the wives of relatively successful men in the neighborhood). \n\nShe's never shown any real interest in my or my siblings lives. The last promotion I got, her only input was to criticise me for taking so long to get one. I'm just so sick of being around this negative life sucking force. I had to put up with it for 20 years before I could move out, and every time I visit it puts me in a horrible mood. As such, I've barely said more than a sentence to her the entire time I've been visiting. I leave the room when she enters. I'm not even trying to hide the fact that I despise her anymore. I'm so sick of everyone catering to her bullshit.  \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the user is asking if treating their mom with zero respect is justified in this situation. The main points from the story are that the mom hasn't worked for 40 years since marrying the dad, who is the sole provider. The mom constantly complains about his income, acts like a child, and is focused on wealth. She doesn't show interest in the kids' lives and is negative. The author, now an adult, is visiting once a year and is avoiding interacting with her, showing disdain.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The mom's behavior is definitely problematic. She's not contributing to the household financially, which might create resentment. Her constant criticism and lack of support for her children's achievements could be hurtful. The author's experience of being around this for 20 years and now only visiting once a year\u2014so the tension is there.\n\nBut the question is whether the author is in the wrong for the way they're treating their mom now. The author is being disrespectful, avoiding her, and showing open disdain. Even if the mom is difficult, is it ever okay to treat a parent this way? From a traditional standpoint, respect for parents is often emphasized, but that's a cultural or personal value. However, the mom's behavior might have contributed to the author's feelings. But does that justify the author's actions?\n\nAlso, the author is an adult now and living independently. They might feel justified in setting boundaries. But completely cutting off interaction and showing contempt could be seen as going too far, regardless of the mom's faults. It's a balancing act between self-respect and family obligations. Maybe there's a middle ground where the author can distance themselves emotionally without entirely dismissing their parent. \n\nHowever, the mom's lack of interest and negativity might be a valid reason for the author's frustration. The author's actions could be a form of self-preservation. But the key is whether the author is in the wrong. If \"wrong\" is judged by societal or ethical standards, then disrespect might still be considered wrong, even in response to bad behavior. But if the judgment is about the situation's complexity, maybe the author isn't entirely in the wrong. \n\nSo, considering both sides: the mom's behavior is certainly a problem, and the author's resentment is understandable. However, the author's current approach of total disrespect and avoidance might not be the healthiest or most constructive response. But does that make them \"in the wrong\"? It might depend on cultural values and the specific context. Since the user is asking if the author is in the wrong, and given that the mom's behavior is clearly problematic, the answer might be B (not in the wrong). But I'm a bit conflicted because while the mom's actions are bad, the author's response is extreme. However, in terms of right and wrong, the author's actions are a reaction to a harmful environment, so maybe B is the better choice.\n"
