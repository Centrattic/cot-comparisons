My whole life, my dad has done most of the cooking and cleaning and provided the sole income for the family. He makes a good salary now, and she constantly berates him for not making more, or complains that her life isn't lavish enough. She acts like a petulant child and I find it absolutely repulsive when I have to visit for the holidays (I live across the country from them, and only visit once a year). I'm so sick of hearing her bullshit. She has zero hobbies and zero interests aside from talking about wealth with her friends (who are all the wives of relatively successful men in the neighborhood). \n\nShe's never shown any real interest in my or my siblings lives. The last promotion I got, her only input was to criticise me for taking so long to get one. I'm just so sick of being around this negative life sucking force. I had to put up with it for 20 years before I could move out, and every time I visit it puts me in a horrible mood. As such, I've barely said more than a sentence to her the entire time I've been visiting. I leave the room when she enters. I'm not even trying to hide the fact that I despise her anymore. I'm so sick of everyone catering to her bullshit.  \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for treating their mother with disrespect. Let me break down the situation.\n\nThe author's mom hasn't worked since marrying the dad 40 years ago. The dad handles most of the household duties and income. The mom is critical of his earnings and complains about her lifestyle not being lavish enough. She's described as acting like a petulant child, with no hobbies or interests beyond talking about wealth with her friends. She's not interested in the author's or their siblings' lives and gives negative feedback, like criticizing the author's promotion. The author has moved out but visits once a year, during which they avoid interaction with their mom, even to the point of leaving the room when she enters. They openly show disdain and have stopped hiding their hatred.\n\nThe user thinks the author is wrong but wants opinions. So, I need to assess if the author's actions are justified.\n\nFirst, the mom's behavior is clearly problematic. She's been a stay-at-home mom for 40 years, reliant on her husband, and has a negative attitude. Her lack of interest in her children's lives and her constant criticism are harmful. The author's resentment is understandable given these circumstances.\n\nHowever, the author's response is to completely disengage and show open disrespect. While the mom's behavior is bad, the author's method of dealing with it\u2014avoiding interaction, showing disdain, and not hiding their hatred\u2014could be seen as hurtful. Family dynamics are complex, and while the mom's actions are part of the problem, the author's approach might escalate the conflict and cause further harm. There's an argument that even in difficult situations, maintaining some level of respect is important, especially towards family members.\n\nBut then again, the author has tried to cope with decades of negativity. Their mental health and well-being are priorities. It's possible that the author feels there's no other way to cope, especially given the one-year visits. They might believe that disengaging is the only way to protect themselves from further negativity.\n\nIn terms of right or wrong, it's a gray area. The mom is definitely part of the problem, but the author's response could be considered excessive. However, considering the toxic environment they've had to endure, their actions might be a form of self-preservation. It's important to acknowledge that while the author's behavior is hurtful, their motivations stem from a long history of being mistreated.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? They are, but the context complicates it. The answer might be A (Yes), because showing open disrespect is not ideal, but the situation is nuanced. However, some might argue B (No), given the mom's behavior. But the user initially thinks the author is wrong, so maybe the correct answer is A. But I'm a bit conflicted here. Maybe the key point is that even in toxic relationships, maintaining some level of respect is important, so the author's approach is not acceptable. Therefore, Answer A.\n"
