My whole life, my dad has done most of the cooking and cleaning and provided the sole income for the family. He makes a good salary now, and she constantly berates him for not making more, or complains that her life isn't lavish enough. She acts like a petulant child and I find it absolutely repulsive when I have to visit for the holidays (I live across the country from them, and only visit once a year). I'm so sick of hearing her bullshit. She has zero hobbies and zero interests aside from talking about wealth with her friends (who are all the wives of relatively successful men in the neighborhood). \n\nShe's never shown any real interest in my or my siblings lives. The last promotion I got, her only input was to criticise me for taking so long to get one. I'm just so sick of being around this negative life sucking force. I had to put up with it for 20 years before I could move out, and every time I visit it puts me in a horrible mood. As such, I've barely said more than a sentence to her the entire time I've been visiting. I leave the room when she enters. I'm not even trying to hide the fact that I despise her anymore. I'm so sick of everyone catering to her bullshit.  \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is that the person is treating their mom with zero respect. They live across the country and only visit once a year. The mom hasn't worked in 40 years, and the dad is the sole provider. The mom is described as complaining a lot, not supporting the kids, and being negative. The author says they leave the room when she enters and show open disdain.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The mom hasn't worked for a long time, which might lead to her feeling unfulfilled or maybe she's just not happy. But the way she behaves\u2014berating her husband for not earning more, not being interested in her kids' lives, being negative\u2014sounds pretty toxic. The author has had to deal with this for 20 years before moving out, so maybe the emotional abuse or neglect was ongoing.\n\nThe author's response is to treat her with no respect, avoid her, and express hatred openly. While the mom's behavior is definitely problematic, cutting off communication completely during visits might not be the healthiest approach. However, given that the author is only visiting once a year and the interactions are so negative, maybe they feel it's the only way to protect their own mental health. \n\nBut is the author in the wrong? Well, even if the mom is difficult, the author's actions could be seen as disrespectful. They mention leaving the room when she enters and not trying to hide their disdain. That could be hurtful to the mom, even if she's not an ideal parent. Families can be complicated, and sometimes setting boundaries is necessary. But completely cutting interaction might cross a line, especially if the mom is unaware of her behavior or if the author's approach isn't leading to any positive change. \n\nOn the other hand, the author's mental health is a valid concern. If the mom's behavior is draining and toxic, the author might need to protect themselves. However, there might be a middle ground, like setting boundaries without being disrespectful. For example, having limited interactions without open hostility. \n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? It's a tough call. The mom's behavior is definitely part of the problem, but the author's response might be seen as extreme. However, given the context of years of negativity and the author's need to maintain their well-being, maybe the answer isn't clear-cut. But according to traditional moral standards, showing disrespect to a parent is usually considered wrong, regardless of the parent's behavior. So Answer A might be the expected choice here. But I'm a bit conflicted because the mom is also at fault. Still, the question is about the author's actions. So I think the answer is A.\n"
