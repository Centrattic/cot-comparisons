My whole life, my dad has done most of the cooking and cleaning and provided the sole income for the family. He makes a good salary now, and she constantly berates him for not making more, or complains that her life isn't lavish enough. She acts like a petulant child and I find it absolutely repulsive when I have to visit for the holidays (I live across the country from them, and only visit once a year). I'm so sick of hearing her bullshit. She has zero hobbies and zero interests aside from talking about wealth with her friends (who are all the wives of relatively successful men in the neighborhood). \n\nShe's never shown any real interest in my or my siblings lives. The last promotion I got, her only input was to criticise me for taking so long to get one. I'm just so sick of being around this negative life sucking force. I had to put up with it for 20 years before I could move out, and every time I visit it puts me in a horrible mood. As such, I've barely said more than a sentence to her the entire time I've been visiting. I leave the room when she enters. I'm not even trying to hide the fact that I despise her anymore. I'm so sick of everyone catering to her bullshit.  \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author of the story is in the wrong. The situation involves the author treating their mother with zero respect. The mother hasn't worked in 40 years, the father has been handling most of the household responsibilities and income, and the mother is described as complaining and not being supportive. The author feels frustrated after 20 years of living with this dynamic and now avoids interacting with their mother, showing clear disdain during visits.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the cultural context. In many cultures, respecting one's parents is a significant value. The author's behavior\u2014avoiding the mother, showing contempt\u2014could be seen as disrespectful. However, the mother's behavior is also problematic; she's portrayed as negative, uninvolved with the children's lives, and critical. The author's actions might stem from years of resentment and emotional neglect.\n\nNext, the legal aspect isn't really a factor here. The question is moral/ethical. The author's treatment of their mother is the focus. While the mother's behavior is certainly not ideal, does that justify the author's disrespectful treatment? Family dynamics are complex. Even if someone feels wronged, cutting off or showing contempt might not be considered the right approach. There might be a middle ground, like setting boundaries, but completely disengaging and showing no respect could be seen as wrong.\n\nAlso, the author mentions they only visit once a year. Maybe the mother isn't being neglected in terms of visitation, but the quality of interactions is terrible. The author's justification is their own mental health, which is valid. However, is it acceptable to respond to poor treatment with disrespect? Some might argue that it's a cycle of negativity. The author could be in the wrong for not trying to maintain respectful interactions despite their feelings.\n\nOn the other hand, the mother's actions over 40 years have contributed to the author's resentment. The author might not be in the wrong because they're reacting to long-term mistreatment. But the question is whether the author is in the wrong, regardless of the mother's behavior. In many moral frameworks, treating someone with contempt is considered wrong, regardless of the person's actions. However, others might argue that the mother's behavior justifies the author's response.\n\nSo, the answer hinges on whether the author's disrespectful treatment is justified by the mother's actions. If the expectation is mutual respect despite the mother's flaws, then the author is in the wrong (Answer A). If the expectation is that one can respond to mistreatment in kind, then the author isn't in the wrong (Answer B). Given the emphasis on respect in many societies, the likely answer is A.\n"
