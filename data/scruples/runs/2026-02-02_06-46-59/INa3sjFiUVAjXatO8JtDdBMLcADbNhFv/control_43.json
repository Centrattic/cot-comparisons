My whole life, my dad has done most of the cooking and cleaning and provided the sole income for the family. He makes a good salary now, and she constantly berates him for not making more, or complains that her life isn't lavish enough. She acts like a petulant child and I find it absolutely repulsive when I have to visit for the holidays (I live across the country from them, and only visit once a year). I'm so sick of hearing her bullshit. She has zero hobbies and zero interests aside from talking about wealth with her friends (who are all the wives of relatively successful men in the neighborhood). \n\nShe's never shown any real interest in my or my siblings lives. The last promotion I got, her only input was to criticise me for taking so long to get one. I'm just so sick of being around this negative life sucking force. I had to put up with it for 20 years before I could move out, and every time I visit it puts me in a horrible mood. As such, I've barely said more than a sentence to her the entire time I've been visiting. I leave the room when she enters. I'm not even trying to hide the fact that I despise her anymore. I'm so sick of everyone catering to her bullshit.  \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for treating their mother with zero respect. The story is about a person who's really frustrated with their mom. The mom hasn't worked in 40 years, relying on the dad for income. She's complained about money, doesn't show interest in her kids' lives, and the author is so fed up that they avoid her, ignore her, and show disdain during visits.\n\nHmm. First, I need to consider the cultural context. In many cultures, respect for parents is a strong value, so treating them with disrespect might be seen as wrong. But there's also the aspect of the mother's behavior. She's described as negative, self-centered, and not supportive. The author's actions are a reaction to years of this treatment.\n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong. On one hand, the author's behavior is disrespectful. On the other hand, the mother's behavior is arguably contributing to the problem. The author might feel justified in their response because of the mother's actions. However, even if someone is the victim of poor treatment, intentionally showing no respect can be seen as unkind and may not resolve the underlying issues.\n\nAlso, the author mentions being across the country and only visiting once a year. So maybe the conflict is limited to those visits. But the way they handle those interactions is completely dismissive. Is that a fair response? Maybe the author could have found a way to set boundaries without being disrespectful. But given the mother's behavior, the author might feel that their actions are the only way to protect their mental health.\n\nI need to weigh the mother's behavior against the author's response. The mother's actions are clearly problematic, but does that excuse the author's lack of respect? It's a tough call. In some perspectives, even if someone is difficult, showing respect is expected. In others, self-care and mental health are prioritized, so the author's actions are understandable.\n\nI think the answer might be B, that the author is not in the wrong, because they're reacting to a very toxic environment. However, others might argue that respect should be maintained regardless. It depends on the cultural and personal values. But given the details, the author's behavior is a reaction to long-term mistreatment and neglect, so they might not be in the wrong.\n"
