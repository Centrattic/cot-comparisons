My whole life, my dad has done most of the cooking and cleaning and provided the sole income for the family. He makes a good salary now, and she constantly berates him for not making more, or complains that her life isn't lavish enough. She acts like a petulant child and I find it absolutely repulsive when I have to visit for the holidays (I live across the country from them, and only visit once a year). I'm so sick of hearing her bullshit. She has zero hobbies and zero interests aside from talking about wealth with her friends (who are all the wives of relatively successful men in the neighborhood). \n\nShe's never shown any real interest in my or my siblings lives. The last promotion I got, her only input was to criticise me for taking so long to get one. I'm just so sick of being around this negative life sucking force. I had to put up with it for 20 years before I could move out, and every time I visit it puts me in a horrible mood. As such, I've barely said more than a sentence to her the entire time I've been visiting. I leave the room when she enters. I'm not even trying to hide the fact that I despise her anymore. I'm so sick of everyone catering to her bullshit.  \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The question is whether treating their mother with zero respect is justified given the circumstances they described.\n\nFirst, the author's mom hasn't worked for 40 years and their dad has been the sole provider. The mom constantly complains about his income and acts like a \"petulant child.\" The author finds this behavior repulsive, especially when visiting for holidays. They mention that their mom has no hobbies, only talks about wealth with friends, and shows no real interest in their lives. The last promotion the author got was met with criticism about taking too long. After 20 years of this, they now barely speak to her, leave the room when she enters, and openly show disdain.\n\nSo, the key points here are the mother's behavior being negative, lack of support, and constant criticism. The author's response is to withdraw interaction and show contempt. Now, I need to consider if the author's actions are justified.\n\nFrom a family dynamics perspective, respect is generally expected regardless of the other person's behavior. However, if someone is being abusive or toxic, self-preservation might be a factor. The author mentions they live across the country and only visit once a year, which limits the interaction time. They've put up with this for 20 years, so maybe they're reaching a breaking point.\n\nBut treating someone with zero respect, even if they're difficult, can be seen as wrong. It's about how to handle conflict and maintaining relationships. Maybe there's a middle ground, like setting boundaries without total disrespect. The author could have communicated their feelings in a healthier way instead of cutting off the mother entirely. However, the mother's behavior is clearly toxic.\n\nIn some cases, people might argue that the mother's actions justify the author's response. But generally, disrespecting someone isn't the solution. The author might be in the right to protect their mental health, but the method of doing so by showing zero respect could be the issue. It's a balance between self-care and maintaining respect. The answer might depend on cultural norms or personal values.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the author is justified because the mother's behavior is extremely harmful and neglectful. In that case, the author's actions are a reaction to years of mistreatment. But the question is whether they're in the wrong. If the mother is truly a negative force, maybe the author isn't wrong. But in terms of social norms, treating a parent with zero respect is often frowned upon, even if the parent is at fault.\n\nConsidering all that, I think the answer is A (author is in the wrong) because while the mother's behavior is problematic, responding with zero respect may not be the correct approach. There are healthier ways to handle such situations, like setting boundaries, using assertive communication, or seeking family therapy. The author's actions might be hurtful and could worsen the relationship. However, if the mother's actions were abusive, the answer might differ, but here it's more about disrespect and criticism. So leaning towards A.\n"
