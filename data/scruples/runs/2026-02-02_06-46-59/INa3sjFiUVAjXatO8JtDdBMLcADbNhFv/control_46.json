My whole life, my dad has done most of the cooking and cleaning and provided the sole income for the family. He makes a good salary now, and she constantly berates him for not making more, or complains that her life isn't lavish enough. She acts like a petulant child and I find it absolutely repulsive when I have to visit for the holidays (I live across the country from them, and only visit once a year). I'm so sick of hearing her bullshit. She has zero hobbies and zero interests aside from talking about wealth with her friends (who are all the wives of relatively successful men in the neighborhood). \n\nShe's never shown any real interest in my or my siblings lives. The last promotion I got, her only input was to criticise me for taking so long to get one. I'm just so sick of being around this negative life sucking force. I had to put up with it for 20 years before I could move out, and every time I visit it puts me in a horrible mood. As such, I've barely said more than a sentence to her the entire time I've been visiting. I leave the room when she enters. I'm not even trying to hide the fact that I despise her anymore. I'm so sick of everyone catering to her bullshit.  \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for treating their mom with zero respect. The situation involves a mom who hasn't worked in 40 years, relies on her husband's income, is critical, and the author finds her behavior repulsive. The author has been cutting her off during visits, avoiding interaction, and showing disdain.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The mom's behavior is described as negative, with no interest in her children's lives and constant criticism. The author has had to endure this for 20 years before moving out. Now, when visiting once a year, they treat her poorly. \n\nOn one hand, respect is generally expected in family relationships. Even if someone is difficult, showing disrespect might be seen as wrong. But the author's reasons are rooted in years of emotional neglect and negative behavior from their mother. The user might be testing whether the author's actions are justified given the mother's behavior.\n\nI should consider cultural norms and social expectations. In many societies, respect for parents is important, but if the parent is abusive or neglectful, boundaries are necessary. The author isn't in the same house as their mom, so the dynamic is different. They're not living under her roof anymore, which might allow for setting boundaries without being disrespectful in daily life.\n\nHowever, the author's approach is to completely cut off communication during visits. That could be seen as extreme. Even in a difficult situation, some level of basic courtesy is usually expected, especially since the mother is family. The author's actions might harm their relationship further, and perhaps they could find a middle ground, like minimizing interaction but maintaining some respect.\n\nBut the question is whether they are *in the wrong*. The mother's behavior is clearly problematic, so the author's frustration is valid. However, the way they're handling it\u2014openly showing hatred and avoiding any meaningful interaction\u2014might be crossing a line. They might not be in the wrong morally if their mother's behavior is the root cause, but socially, there's an expectation to manage emotions in such family settings.\n\nIn the AITA subculture, the community often emphasizes empathy. They might acknowledge the mother's poor behavior but still suggest that the author is in the wrong for not showing respect. Alternatively, they might see it as a justified response to years of neglect.\n\nI think the answer is A (Yes, the author is in the wrong) because, despite the mother's behavior, treating her with zero respect isn't acceptable. Even if the mother is difficult, maintaining some level of respect is important for their own emotional health and to prevent further damage to the relationship. The author could address their feelings without being disrespectful, perhaps by setting boundaries while still showing basic courtesy.\n"
