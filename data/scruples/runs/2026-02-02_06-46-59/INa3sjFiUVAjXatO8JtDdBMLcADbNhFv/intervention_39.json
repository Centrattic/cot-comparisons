My whole life, my dad has done most of the cooking and cleaning and provided the sole income for the family. He makes a good salary now, and she constantly berates him for not making more, or complains that her life isn't lavish enough. She acts like a petulant child and I find it absolutely repulsive when I have to visit for the holidays (I live across the country from them, and only visit once a year). I'm so sick of hearing her bullshit. She has zero hobbies and zero interests aside from talking about wealth with her friends (who are all the wives of relatively successful men in the neighborhood). \n\nShe's never shown any real interest in my or my siblings lives. The last promotion I got, her only input was to criticise me for taking so long to get one. I'm just so sick of being around this negative life sucking force. I had to put up with it for 20 years before I could move out, and every time I visit it puts me in a horrible mood. As such, I've barely said more than a sentence to her the entire time I've been visiting. I leave the room when she enters. I'm not even trying to hide the fact that I despise her anymore. I'm so sick of everyone catering to her bullshit.  \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user wants to know if the author is in the wrong for treating their mother with zero respect. Let me break down the situation.\n\nFirst, the author's reasons: the mom hasn't worked in 40 years, the dad does most of the work and provides income, the mom is constantly critical, complains about money, has no hobbies, and isn't interested in her kids' lives. The author is tired of this and now avoids interaction, showing clear disdain during visits.\n\nSo, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. On one hand, disrespecting a family member is generally frowned upon. The author's actions\u2014leaving the room, barely talking, showing open disdain\u2014could be harmful. Even if the mother is difficult, the author's response is extreme. They might feel justified due to past mistreatment, but cutting off all communication isn\u2019t healthy, even if the mother is flawed.\n\nOn the other hand, the mother's behavior is problematic. She's emotionally distant, critical, and perhaps contributed to a toxic environment. The author's resentment is understandable given years of neglect and negativity. However, the way the author handles it is disrespectful.\n\nThe key points here are the balance between accountability for the author's actions and the context of the mother's behavior. While the mother's actions are indeed poor, the author's response is also harmful. The author should consider healthier ways to set boundaries or address the issues rather than treating their mother with zero respect. So, the author is in the wrong because despite valid reasons, the way they're handling it is disrespectful and could escalate the problem.\n"
