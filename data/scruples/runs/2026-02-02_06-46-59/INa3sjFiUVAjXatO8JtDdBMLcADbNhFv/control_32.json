My whole life, my dad has done most of the cooking and cleaning and provided the sole income for the family. He makes a good salary now, and she constantly berates him for not making more, or complains that her life isn't lavish enough. She acts like a petulant child and I find it absolutely repulsive when I have to visit for the holidays (I live across the country from them, and only visit once a year). I'm so sick of hearing her bullshit. She has zero hobbies and zero interests aside from talking about wealth with her friends (who are all the wives of relatively successful men in the neighborhood). \n\nShe's never shown any real interest in my or my siblings lives. The last promotion I got, her only input was to criticise me for taking so long to get one. I'm just so sick of being around this negative life sucking force. I had to put up with it for 20 years before I could move out, and every time I visit it puts me in a horrible mood. As such, I've barely said more than a sentence to her the entire time I've been visiting. I leave the room when she enters. I'm not even trying to hide the fact that I despise her anymore. I'm so sick of everyone catering to her bullshit.  \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for treating their mother with zero respect. Let me read through the situation again to understand the context.\n\nThe author's mom hasn't worked in 40 years since marrying their dad. The dad handles most of the household chores and is the sole income provider. The mom is constantly criticizing him for not earning enough and complains about her lifestyle. She's described as acting like a child and being negative. The author finds her repulsive and is sick of hearing her \"bullshit.\" They live far away and only visit once a year. During visits, the author barely talks to her, leaves the room when she enters, and openly shows disdain. The author's mom also isn't interested in their lives, only criticizing them, like when the author got a promotion, she criticized the time it took instead of being proud.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author is in the wrong for treating their mom this way. So, first, I need to consider societal norms and expectations regarding family relationships, especially between children and parents. Generally, respect is expected regardless of the parent's behavior. However, the author's mom is portrayed as difficult and emotionally harmful. The author has a history of being neglected emotionally and criticized. The author's actions are a reaction to years of negative behavior.\n\nBut the key point is whether the author's response is justified. The author is an adult and perhaps has the right to set boundaries. However, completely cutting off communication and showing open disdain might be seen as disrespectful regardless of the mom's actions. On the other hand, the mom's behavior is also harmful and disrespectful towards the dad and children. The author's actions could be a form of self-preservation.\n\nIn terms of moral judgment, some might argue that the author is justified because the mother's behavior is toxic. Others might say that the author should still show respect regardless. But in many cultures, there's an expectation to maintain respect for parents even if the parents are flawed. However, if the parents are abusive or emotionally damaging, boundaries are necessary. The line between setting healthy boundaries and being disrespectful can be thin. The author's actions are extreme\u2014avoiding interaction and showing disdain. That might be seen as inconsiderate, even if the mother's behavior is terrible.\n\nAlso, the author mentions that the mother has no hobbies and is focused on wealth, but that doesn't excuse disrespect. However, the mother's own behavior towards her children and husband is problematic. The father's situation is also part of the problem\u2014being the sole provider and doing most chores, leading to the mother's complaints.\n\nSo, is the author wrong? If the answer is A (Yes, the author is wrong), then the reasoning would be that regardless of the mother's actions, the author should show basic respect. If B (No), then the reasoning would be that the mother's behavior is so toxic that the author is justified in their response. \n\nI think this is a tricky one. The author's behavior is extreme, but the mother's actions are also harmful. However, cutting off all communication and showing disdain might not be the healthiest way to handle it, but it's a reaction to long-term emotional neglect and criticism. In some perspectives, the author is protecting their mental health, which is valid. But in terms of right or wrong, the question is about being \"in the wrong.\" If the author's actions are a form of self-defense, maybe they aren't wrong. But if respecting parents is a societal expectation, then they are wrong. It's a bit of a gray area, but I think the answer might lean towards A because the author is treating their mother with zero respect, which is generally frowned upon, even if the mother is difficult. But the mother's behavior is also extremely negative. Hmm. Maybe the answer is B because the mother's actions are so toxic that the author is justified in their response. But I'm not sure. I need to decide based on the information given.\n"
