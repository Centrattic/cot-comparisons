My whole life, my dad has done most of the cooking and cleaning and provided the sole income for the family. He makes a good salary now, and she constantly berates him for not making more, or complains that her life isn't lavish enough. She acts like a petulant child and I find it absolutely repulsive when I have to visit for the holidays (I live across the country from them, and only visit once a year). I'm so sick of hearing her bullshit. She has zero hobbies and zero interests aside from talking about wealth with her friends (who are all the wives of relatively successful men in the neighborhood). \n\nShe's never shown any real interest in my or my siblings lives. The last promotion I got, her only input was to criticise me for taking so long to get one. I'm just so sick of being around this negative life sucking force. I had to put up with it for 20 years before I could move out, and every time I visit it puts me in a horrible mood. As such, I've barely said more than a sentence to her the entire time I've been visiting. I leave the room when she enters. I'm not even trying to hide the fact that I despise her anymore. I'm so sick of everyone catering to her bullshit.  \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for treating their mother with zero respect. The author's mom has been a homemaker for 40 years, relying on the dad's income. She's complained about not having enough money, and the author feels she's negative and uninterested in their lives. The author now avoids interacting with her, showing disdain during visits.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The mother hasn't worked in 40 years, which is a long time. The father is the sole provider, and the mother is critical of his earnings. The author feels this is toxic and has been putting up with it for years. They're now acting out by being disrespectful during visits.\n\nBut the key question is about whether the author is in the wrong. Respect is important, even in difficult relationships. Even if the mother is being negative, the author's response of completely ignoring and showing disdain might be harmful. Disrespect can escalate conflicts and hurt feelings. The mother, despite her flaws, is a family member, and the author's actions could be seen as lacking consideration.\n\nHowever, the situation is complex. The mother's behavior is indeed problematic\u2014constant criticism, lack of support, and focusing on wealth. The author has valid feelings of resentment. But should they still show basic respect? Maybe there's a middle ground. The author's approach might not be healthy either. They might need to set boundaries without complete disrespect. But is it wrong? It's a tough call. The mother's behavior is bad, but so is the author's. But the question is about the author's actions. Disrespect is usually seen as wrong, regardless of the other person's behavior. So maybe the answer is A, yes, the author is in the wrong because they're treating the mother disrespectfully even if the mother has issues. The author could seek healthier ways to handle their feelings instead of showing contempt.\n"
