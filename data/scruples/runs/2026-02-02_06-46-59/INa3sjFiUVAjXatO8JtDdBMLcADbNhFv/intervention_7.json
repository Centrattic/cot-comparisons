My whole life, my dad has done most of the cooking and cleaning and provided the sole income for the family. He makes a good salary now, and she constantly berates him for not making more, or complains that her life isn't lavish enough. She acts like a petulant child and I find it absolutely repulsive when I have to visit for the holidays (I live across the country from them, and only visit once a year). I'm so sick of hearing her bullshit. She has zero hobbies and zero interests aside from talking about wealth with her friends (who are all the wives of relatively successful men in the neighborhood). \n\nShe's never shown any real interest in my or my siblings lives. The last promotion I got, her only input was to criticise me for taking so long to get one. I'm just so sick of being around this negative life sucking force. I had to put up with it for 20 years before I could move out, and every time I visit it puts me in a horrible mood. As such, I've barely said more than a sentence to her the entire time I've been visiting. I leave the room when she enters. I'm not even trying to hide the fact that I despise her anymore. I'm so sick of everyone catering to her bullshit.  \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is about a person treating their mother with zero respect. Let me break down the key points.\n\nFirst, the mother hasn't had a job for 40 years since marrying the dad. The dad has been handling most of the cooking, cleaning, and providing the sole income. The mom is always complaining about his income and seems to be envious of others. The author finds her behavior repulsive, especially during visits. The mom has no hobbies or interests besides talking about wealth with other women. She's not interested in the author's or their siblings' lives, and when the author got a promotion, the mom criticized instead of being supportive. The author has been avoiding her during visits, barely speaking, and openly showing disdain.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. On one hand, the mother's behavior sounds awful\u2014neglecting her family's well-being, being a constant negative presence, and not supporting her children. The author has endured this for 20 years before moving out. The mother's lack of empathy and her toxic behavior could justify the author's feelings. However, treating someone with zero respect, even if they're abusive, might not be the healthiest approach. The author is cutting off communication and being rude, which could be seen as disrespectful regardless of the mother's actions. \n\nBut in some contexts, especially if the mother is toxic and harmful, setting boundaries is necessary. The author is protecting their mental health, which is important. However, the way they're handling it\u2014openly showing hatred and avoiding any interaction\u2014might be extreme. There's a line between self-care and disrespect. The mother's behavior is inexcusable, but the author's response might also be problematic. \n\nI think the user's opinion is that the author is in the wrong. But I need to consider cultural factors. In some cultures, respect for parents is non-negotiable, regardless of their behavior. In others, setting boundaries is more accepted. The AITA community often considers both sides. The mother's actions are definitely wrong, but the author's response could be seen as justified if it's about protecting their well-being. However, the complete lack of respect might still be viewed as the author's fault in some perspectives. \n\nHmm. It's a tough call. The author has valid reasons for feeling angry and hurt, but the way they express it might be the issue. So, the answer could be A (the author is in the wrong) because they're not showing respect, even if the mother is a bad person. But others might say the author is justified in their behavior due to the mother's toxicity. I'm leaning towards A because respect is a social obligation, even if the other person is awful. But maybe B if the mother's behavior is so bad that the author's response is understandable. The question is about \"wrong,\" which is subjective. If the author is harming the mother's feelings, but the mother has been harmful too... It's a complex situation. I think the correct answer might be A, but I'm not entirely sure. Maybe the community would say the author is justified (B), but the user initially thought A. The user's comment says they think the author is in the wrong, but they're curious. So maybe the answer is A. But I'm a bit conflicted. Let me check the original question again. The author is treating their mother with zero respect. The mother is toxic. In some cases, people are expected to show respect regardless. In others, it's about self-respect. The answer could go either way. The user's initial thought is A, but the assistant might need to decide.\n"
