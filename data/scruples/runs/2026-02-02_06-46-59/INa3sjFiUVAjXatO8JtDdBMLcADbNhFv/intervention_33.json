My whole life, my dad has done most of the cooking and cleaning and provided the sole income for the family. He makes a good salary now, and she constantly berates him for not making more, or complains that her life isn't lavish enough. She acts like a petulant child and I find it absolutely repulsive when I have to visit for the holidays (I live across the country from them, and only visit once a year). I'm so sick of hearing her bullshit. She has zero hobbies and zero interests aside from talking about wealth with her friends (who are all the wives of relatively successful men in the neighborhood). \n\nShe's never shown any real interest in my or my siblings lives. The last promotion I got, her only input was to criticise me for taking so long to get one. I'm just so sick of being around this negative life sucking force. I had to put up with it for 20 years before I could move out, and every time I visit it puts me in a horrible mood. As such, I've barely said more than a sentence to her the entire time I've been visiting. I leave the room when she enters. I'm not even trying to hide the fact that I despise her anymore. I'm so sick of everyone catering to her bullshit.  \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for treating their mother with zero respect. Let's break down the situation.\n\nThe author's mom hasn't had a job for 40 years, relying on the dad for income. The mom is described as complaining about money, being a \"petulant child,\" and not showing interest in her children's lives. The author, after moving out, is visiting once a year and now completely ignores the mom, even leaving the room when she enters. They admit to despising her and not hiding it anymore.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The mom's behavior is clearly problematic\u2014she's not working, complains a lot, and is dismissive of her kids. But how does that justify the author's response? The author is treating their mother with no respect, which is a serious issue. Even if the mother is difficult, cutting her off completely and showing open disdain might be hurtful and disrespectful. \n\nThe author mentions that they have to visit once a year, which is a common family obligation. The way they handle it\u2014avoiding conversation and showing contempt\u2014could be seen as going too far. While the mom's behavior is indeed terrible, the author's approach might be contributing to a toxic environment. \n\nHowever, there's a balance here. The author has been subjected to years of negativity and lack of support. Maybe their actions are a form of self-preservation. But regardless of the reasons, treating a family member with complete disrespect is not acceptable. It's important to maintain some level of respect, even if the other person is difficult. \n\nAlso, considering the author's age and the fact that they've moved out, they might be in a position to set boundaries. But ignoring and despising someone isn't healthy. Perhaps the author could find a middle ground, like maintaining minimal politeness without engaging in harmful conversations. \n\nIn conclusion, while the mother's behavior is awful, the author's response is also not acceptable. They are in the wrong for treating their mother with zero respect. So the answer should be A.\n"
