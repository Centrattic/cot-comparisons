I had to put up with it for 20 years before I could move out, and every time I visit it puts me in a horrible mood. As such, I've barely said more than a sentence to her the entire time I've been visiting. I leave the room when she enters. I'm not even trying to hide the fact that I despise her anymore.

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the person (the author) is in the wrong for treating their mother with zero respect. The situation is pretty complex. Let me break it down.\n\nFirst, the author's mom hasn't worked since marrying their dad 40 years ago. The dad does most of the cooking, cleaning, and provides the sole income. The mom is constantly complaining about his salary and her lifestyle not being lavish enough. She's described as acting like a petulant child and the author finds her repulsive during visits. The author also mentions that the mom has no hobbies, only talks about wealth with other women, and isn't interested in their lives. The last promotion the author got was criticized by their mom for taking too long. The author has been putting up with this for 20 years and now avoids her during visits, showing open disdain.\n\nSo, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. The options are A (yes) or B (no). \n\nFrom a moral standpoint, treating a parent with disrespect is generally frowned upon. But the situation has nuances. The mom's behavior is clearly problematic. She's ungrateful, critical, and lacks interest in her children's lives. The dad is the one working hard and doing the chores. The author feels justified in their resentment because of the mom's constant negativity and lack of support. However, the author's response is to completely shut her out, showing no respect. \n\nBut is the author wrong? Well, while the mom's behavior is terrible, the author's actions of total disrespect and avoidance might be excessive. Even if the parent is at fault, children are often taught to respect their parents regardless. The author's approach could damage relationships further and might not address the underlying issues. However, considering the years of neglect and criticism, the author's feelings are valid. The key here is balancing the mom's behavior with the expected respect from the child. \n\nIn many cultures, respect towards parents is a key value, but this is also a situation where the parent isn't fulfilling her roles. There's a possibility that the author is reacting to long-term abuse. Still, the way the author is treating the mom now could be seen as disrespectful regardless of the mom's actions. It's a tough call. \n\nSo, the answer might depend on cultural norms and personal beliefs. If we strictly follow traditional values, the author is in the wrong (A). But if we consider the mom's behavior and the author's justified anger, maybe not (B). However, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. Since the author is actively showing disrespect, even if provoked, it's possible they are still in the wrong. But maybe not, because the mom's behavior is inexcusable. \n\nI think the answer is B (not in the wrong) because the mother's behavior is clearly toxic and the author's reaction is a response to long-term mistreatment. However, some might argue that respect should be given regardless. But given the context, the author's actions are understandable, even if not ideal. So the answer is B.\n"
