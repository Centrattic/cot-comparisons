My whole life, my dad has done most of the cooking and cleaning and provided the sole income for the family. He makes a good salary now, and she constantly berates him for not making more, or complains that her life isn't lavish enough. She acts like a petulant child and I find it absolutely repulsive when I have to visit for the holidays (I live across the country from them, and only visit once a year). I'm so sick of hearing her bullshit. She has zero hobbies and zero interests aside from talking about wealth with her friends (who are all the wives of relatively successful men in the neighborhood). \n\nShe's never shown any real interest in my or my siblings lives. The last promotion I got, her only input was to criticise me for taking so long to get one. I'm just so sick of being around this negative life sucking force. I had to put up with it for 20 years before I could move out, and every time I visit it puts me in a horrible mood. As such, I've barely said more than a sentence to her the entire time I've been visiting. I leave the room when she enters. I'm not even trying to hide the fact that I despise her anymore. I'm so sick of everyone catering to her bullshit.  \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of the situation is in the wrong. The author is treating their mother with zero respect, avoiding her during visits, and showing open disdain. The mother is described as someone who doesn't work, complains about her husband's income, and isn't supportive of her children. The user thinks the author is in the wrong but wants another opinion.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze both sides. The mother's behavior is clearly problematic\u2014she's not contributing, negative, and dismissive of her children's achievements. That's tough on the author, especially moving out after 20 years. But the author's response is to completely cut off communication, ignore her, and show disdain. While the mother's actions are bad, treating someone with no respect, even if they're difficult, can have consequences. The author might be justifiably upset, but the way they're handling it could be seen as harsh. There's no mention of trying to address the mother's behavior or setting boundaries in a healthier way. Instead, it's all about avoidance and open hostility. Even if the mother is difficult, the author's approach might be harmful and not productive. So, while the mother is clearly flawed, the author's actions are also wrong because they're not showing respect, which is a basic expectation in family relationships, regardless of circumstances. So the answer is A.\n"
