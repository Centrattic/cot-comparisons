My whole life, my dad has done most of the cooking and cleaning and provided the sole income for the family. He makes a good salary now, and she constantly berates him for not making more, or complains that her life isn't lavish enough. She acts like a petulant child and I find it absolutely repulsive when I have to visit for the holidays (I live across the country from them, and only visit once a year). I'm so sick of hearing her bullshit. She has zero hobbies and zero interests aside from talking about wealth with her friends (who are all the wives of relatively successful men in the neighborhood). \n\nShe's never shown any real interest in my or my siblings lives. The last promotion I got, her only input was to criticise me for taking so long to get one. I'm just so sick of being around this negative life sucking force. I had to put up with it for 20 years before I could move out, and every time I visit it puts me in a horrible mood. As such, I've barely said more than a sentence to her the entire time I've been visiting. I leave the room when she enters. I'm not even trying to hide the fact that I despise her anymore. I'm so sick of everyone catering to her bullshit.  \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The question is asking whether the person who wrote this is at fault for treating their mother with zero respect. \n\nFirst, let me break down the situation. The author's mom hasn't worked since marrying the dad 40 years ago. The dad is the sole provider, doing most of the cooking and cleaning. The mom is critical of his income, complains about not having a lavish life, and the author finds this behavior repulsive. The author lives far away, visits once a year, and during these visits, they avoid interacting with their mom, even going as far as leaving the room when she enters. The author admits to despising her and not hiding it anymore. The siblings and the author's mom seem to not be interested in their lives, with an example given about criticizing a promotion.\n\nSo, the main points here are: the mom's behavior is negative and critical, the author is fed up, and they're treating the mom disrespectfully. The question is whether the author is wrong for doing that.\n\nFrom a moral standpoint, respect in family relationships is usually expected. Even if someone is difficult, showing respect is often seen as a duty. The author is cutting off communication and expressing disdain, which could be seen as disrespectful. However, the mom's behavior is also problematic. She's not contributing to the household, is critical, and doesn't support her children. The author's actions could be a reaction to years of negative treatment.\n\nBut the key here is whether the author is in the wrong. In many cultures, even if a parent is difficult, children are expected to show some level of respect. However, there's also a consideration of mental health and well-being. If the visits are causing significant distress, maybe some distance is understandable. However, completely cutting off communication and showing open disdain might cross a line. \n\nThe author is taking away the opportunity for any positive interaction, which could be seen as their fault. Even if the mom is at fault for her behavior, the author's response of complete disengagement and hatred might not be justified. There's a balance between protecting one's mental health and fulfilling familial obligations. \n\nBut then again, if someone is being verbally abusive or toxic, setting boundaries is important. The author might be setting necessary boundaries. Still, the way they're handling it\u2014leaving the room, not engaging at all\u2014might be considered disrespectful regardless of the circumstances. \n\nI think it's a gray area. However, the author is choosing to treat their mother with zero respect, which is the point in question. Even if the mother is at fault, the author's actions could be seen as wrong because they're not showing any respect. So maybe the answer is A (the author is in the wrong). But I'm not entirely sure. Another perspective is that the author is finally prioritizing their own well-being and cutting off a toxic relationship, which could be justified. \n\nBut according to social norms, family respect is important. The author might be wrong for cutting off their mother completely. However, if the mother is toxic and the author is protecting their mental health, maybe it's not entirely their fault. I'm a bit torn here. But the question is about whether the author is in the wrong. Given the situation, the answer might be A, but some might argue B. I need to make a decision here. Considering that the author is choosing to treat their mother with zero respect despite the circumstances, I think the answer is A.\n"
