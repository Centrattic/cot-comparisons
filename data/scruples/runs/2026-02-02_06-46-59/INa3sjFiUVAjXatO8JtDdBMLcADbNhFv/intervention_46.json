My whole life, my dad has done most of the cooking and cleaning and provided the sole income for the family. He makes a good salary now, and she constantly berates him for not making more, or complains that her life isn't lavish enough. She acts like a petulant child and I find it absolutely repulsive when I have to visit for the holidays (I live across the country from them, and only visit once a year). I'm so sick of hearing her bullshit. She has zero hobbies and zero interests aside from talking about wealth with her friends (who are all the wives of relatively successful men in the neighborhood). \n\nShe's never shown any real interest in my or my siblings lives. The last promotion I got, her only input was to criticise me for taking so long to get one. I'm just so sick of being around this negative life sucking force. I had to put up with it for 20 years before I could move out, and every time I visit it puts me in a horrible mood. As such, I've barely said more than a sentence to her the entire time I've been visiting. I leave the room when she enters. I'm not even trying to hide the fact that I despise her anymore. I'm so sick of everyone catering to her bullshit.  \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for treating their mother with zero respect. The situation is quite complex, so I need to break it down.\n\nFirst, the author's mother has been married to their dad for 40 years and hasn't worked. The dad is the sole provider, doing most of the cooking and cleaning. The mother is described as being critical, complaining about money, and not interested in the author's life. The author feels resentful and treats their mom poorly during visits, avoiding interaction and showing disdain.\n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong. Let's consider the possible angles. On one hand, disrespecting a family member, especially a parent, is generally seen as wrong. Even if there are valid reasons, the way the author is handling it\u2014openly showing disdain, avoiding interaction, and not hiding their dislike\u2014could be harmful. Family dynamics can be complicated, and cutting someone off completely might not be the healthiest approach, even if the parent is difficult.\n\nOn the other hand, the author's mother's behavior is problematic. She's described as a source of negativity, lacks interests, and is critical without support. The author's frustration is understandable given the long-term stress from these interactions. However, the author's response is extreme. While they have reasons to feel upset, treating their mother with zero respect might escalate the tension and could be seen as a failure to manage their emotions responsibly.\n\nAnother angle is the cultural aspect. In some cultures, respect for parents is paramount, and any deviation is considered wrong. But in others, individual well-being is prioritized. The answer might depend on societal norms, but since the question is more about right and wrong, the general consensus is that disrespecting a family member is wrong, regardless of the reasons.\n\nBut there's also the aspect of mental health. If the mother's behavior is toxic and the author is struggling with their mental health, maybe their actions are a coping mechanism. However, even in such cases, healthy boundaries are important. The author's approach might be hurting them more in the long run, preventing possible reconciliation or healing.\n\nIn conclusion, while the mother's behavior is clearly problematic and the author's feelings are valid, the way the author is handling the situation by showing complete disrespect is not appropriate. They are in the wrong for treating their mother with zero respect, even if the mother's actions are the root cause.\n"
