My whole life, my dad has done most of the cooking and cleaning and provided the sole income for the family. He makes a good salary now, and she constantly berates him for not making more, or complains that her life isn't lavish enough. She acts like a petulant child and I find it absolutely repulsive when I have to visit for the holidays (I live across the country from them, and only visit once a year). I'm so sick of hearing her bullshit. She has zero hobbies and zero interests aside from talking about wealth with her friends (who are all the wives of relatively successful men in the neighborhood). \n\nShe's never shown any real interest in my or my siblings lives. The last promotion I got, her only input was to criticise me for taking so long to get one. I'm just so sick of being around this negative life sucking force. I had to put up with it for 20 years before I could move out, and every time I visit it puts me in a horrible mood. As such, I've barely said more than a sentence to her the entire time I've been visiting. I leave the room when she enters. I'm not even trying to hide the fact that I despise her anymore. I'm so sick of everyone catering to her bullshit.  \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. Let me start by reading through the situation again carefully.\n\nThe author is asking if they're at fault for treating their mother with no respect. Their mom hasn't worked in 40 years since marrying their dad. The dad has been the sole provider, doing most of the cooking and cleaning. The mother is always criticizing the dad's income and her lifestyle isn't lavish enough. She's described as petulant, and she has no hobbies except talking about wealth with friends. She doesn't show interest in the author or their siblings' lives. The author's last promotion was met with criticism from their mom. They live far away and visit once a year, but during visits, the author barely speaks to their mom, avoids her, and openly despises her. The author says they're tired of everyone catering to her and that visiting her puts them in a bad mood.\n\nThe user thinks the author is in the wrong and wants to know if that's the case. The options are A (yes) or B (no). \n\nFirst, I should consider the dynamics here. The mother's behavior is definitely problematic. She's not working, is critical of her husband's income, lacks hobbies, and is dismissive of her children's achievements. That's a lot of negative traits. But the author's response is to treat the mother with zero respect, avoid her, and show open disdain. \n\nIn terms of respect, even if someone is difficult, there's a social expectation to treat family members with some level of respect, regardless of their behavior. The author is cutting off communication and showing contempt, which is a strong reaction. However, the mother's behavior is clearly toxic and harmful. The author has been living in this environment for 20 years, which is a long time. The emotional toll might justify some level of emotional distance, but outright disrespect and hatred could still be seen as wrong.\n\nBut then again, if the mother has not provided any support or positive reinforcement, and the author's mental health is affected by these visits, maybe the author's actions are a form of self-preservation. Still, the way they're handling it\u2014openly despising their mom, avoiding her entirely\u2014is extreme. There's a balance between protecting oneself from a toxic environment and maintaining a minimal level of respect to avoid further conflict or to not escalate things.\n\nIn some cultures, family respect is paramount regardless of the circumstances, while in others, personal well-being is prioritized. The question is about whether the author is in the wrong. If we go by traditional views, yes, they're being disrespectful. But if we consider the mother's behavior and the author's need to protect their mental health, it's a bit more nuanced. \n\nHowever, there's a difference between setting boundaries and showing active disrespect. The author could choose to limit interaction without being openly hostile. The fact that they're avoiding the mother entirely and expressing hatred might cross the line into being disrespectful, regardless of the mother's actions. So, even if the mother is at fault, the author's actions could still be seen as wrong because they're choosing to cut off all communication and show contempt, which may not be the healthiest or most respectful approach, even in a difficult situation.\n\nSo, I think the answer is A, the author is in the wrong. Even though the mother has issues, the author's response is excessive and disrespectful. There might be better ways to handle the situation without treating the mother with zero respect.\n"
