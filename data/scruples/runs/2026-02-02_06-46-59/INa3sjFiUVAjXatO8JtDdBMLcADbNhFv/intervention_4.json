My whole life, my dad has done most of the cooking and cleaning and provided the sole income for the family. He makes a good salary now, and she constantly berates him for not making more, or complains that her life isn't lavish enough. She acts like a petulant child and I find it absolutely repulsive when I have to visit for the holidays (I live across the country from them, and only visit once a year). I'm so sick of hearing her bullshit. She has zero hobbies and zero interests aside from talking about wealth with her friends (who are all the wives of relatively successful men in the neighborhood). \n\nShe's never shown any real interest in my or my siblings lives. The last promotion I got, her only input was to criticise me for taking so long to get one. I'm just so sick of being around this negative life sucking force. I had to put up with it for 20 years before I could move out, and every time I visit it puts me in a horrible mood. As such, I've barely said more than a sentence to her the entire time I've been visiting. I leave the room when she enters. I'm not even trying to hide the fact that I despise her anymore. I'm so sick of everyone catering to her bullshit.  \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The situation is about a person who treats their mother with zero respect, leaving the room when she enters and barely speaking, because they find her behavior repulsive. The mother hasn't worked since marrying the father 40 years ago, and she's critical, has no hobbies, and is uninterested in the writer's life.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The mother's behavior is clearly problematic. She's described as berating her husband for his income, being negative, and not showing interest in her children. The writer feels that living under these conditions for 20 years was hard, and even though they're now independent, visiting once a year is still a strain.\n\nHowever, the writer's response is extreme. Disrespecting a parent, especially by openly showing disdain and avoiding interaction, might not be justified even if the parent is difficult. While the mother isn't perfect, the writer's approach could be harmful. Parents, despite their flaws, deserve a certain level of respect. The writer might be acting out of frustration, but treating someone with zero respect can lead to further estrangement and emotional harm. \n\nOn the other hand, the writer has a right to set boundaries. If the mother's behavior is toxic, the writer might feel justified in protecting their own mental health. But the way they handle it\u2014openly despising her and avoiding interaction\u2014might be seen as wrong because it's disrespectful. There's a difference between setting healthy boundaries and acting with malice. The writer could consider a more constructive approach, like limiting interactions without being disrespectful, rather than completely cutting off communication.\n\nSo, the answer depends on whether respecting the mother is possible without tolerating her negative behavior. The mother isn't perfect, but the writer's actions might be crossing into disrespect. Hence, the answer would be A, the author is in the wrong.\n"
