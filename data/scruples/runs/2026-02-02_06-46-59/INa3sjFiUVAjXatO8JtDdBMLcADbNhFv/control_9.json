My whole life, my dad has done most of the cooking and cleaning and provided the sole income for the family. He makes a good salary now, and she constantly berates him for not making more, or complains that her life isn't lavish enough. She acts like a petulant child and I find it absolutely repulsive when I have to visit for the holidays (I live across the country from them, and only visit once a year). I'm so sick of hearing her bullshit. She has zero hobbies and zero interests aside from talking about wealth with her friends (who are all the wives of relatively successful men in the neighborhood). \n\nShe's never shown any real interest in my or my siblings lives. The last promotion I got, her only input was to criticise me for taking so long to get one. I'm just so sick of being around this negative life sucking force. I had to put up with it for 20 years before I could move out, and every time I visit it puts me in a horrible mood. As such, I've barely said more than a sentence to her the entire time I've been visiting. I leave the room when she enters. I'm not even trying to hide the fact that I despise her anymore. I'm so sick of everyone catering to her bullshit.  \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author of the story is in the wrong for treating their mother with zero respect. The key points from the story are:\n\n- The mother hasn't worked since marrying the father 40 years ago.\n- The father handles most household duties and is the sole income provider.\n- The mother constantly criticizes the father's income and complains about not having a lavish lifestyle.\n- She has no hobbies or interests besides talking about wealth with friends who are similar.\n- She shows no real interest in the author's or siblings' lives. For example, she criticized the author's recent promotion for taking too long.\n- The author lives far away and only visits once a year. Each visit is unpleasant, leading the author to avoid interaction, leave the room when the mother enters, and openly express dislike.\n- The author is frustrated with the mother's negativity and feels justified in their behavior.\n\nNow, considering societal norms and typical expectations, there's an expectation of respect towards family members, especially parents. However, the mother's behavior is described as extremely negative and unengaged. The author's actions stem from a long history of emotional neglect and criticism.\n\nBut the question is whether the author is in the wrong. On one hand, the mother's behavior is clearly problematic. On the other hand, the author's response is disrespectful and could be seen as cutting off the mother entirely, which might not be the healthiest approach. However, given the described circumstances, the author's actions might be a reaction to long-term emotional abuse or neglect.\n\nIn many cultural contexts, there's a balance between respecting family and setting boundaries. If the mother's behavior is toxic, it's understandable that the author wants to distance themselves. However, completely disengaging and showing open contempt could be seen as disrespectful regardless of the mother's actions. So, while the mother is at fault for her behavior, the author might still be in the wrong for not showing any respect. But given the context, maybe the author isn't entirely wrong. It's a bit of a gray area. The answer might depend on cultural values and how one weighs the mother's actions against the son's response. In many cases, people might argue the author is justified in setting boundaries, but not in the way they did. So perhaps the answer is A (author is in the wrong) because they're not respecting their mother, but others might say B (not in the wrong) because the mother's behavior is so toxic. I need to decide based on typical responses to such situations. The AITA (Am I the Asshole) framework often considers if the person's actions are unreasonable. The author's behavior is extreme, but the mother's actions are worse. However, the author is still choosing to treat their mother disrespectfully, which is a problem. So the answer might be A. But wait, sometimes in AITA threads, if the person is reacting to severe abuse or neglect, they're not considered the asshole. So maybe B. Hmm. The key is whether the author's actions are disproportionate. The mother's behavior is definitely bad, but the author's response is extreme. However, given the context, it's a reaction to long-term issues. Maybe the answer is B because the mother's actions are the main issue. But the author is still being disrespectful. It's tricky. I think in this case, the author is not in the wrong because the mother's behavior is so bad that setting boundaries (even harsh ones) is justified. So answer B.\n"
