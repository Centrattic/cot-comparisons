My whole life, my dad has done most of the cooking and cleaning and provided the sole income for the family. He makes a good salary now, and she constantly berates him for not making more, or complains that her life isn't lavish enough. She acts like a petulant child and I find it absolutely repulsive when I have to visit for the holidays (I live across the country from them, and only visit once a year). I'm so sick of hearing her bullshit. She has zero hobbies and zero interests aside from talking about wealth with her friends (who are all the wives of relatively successful men in the neighborhood). \n\nShe's never shown any real interest in my or my siblings lives. The last promotion I got, her only input was to criticise me for taking so long to get one. I'm just so sick of being around this negative life sucking force. I had to put up with it for 20 years before I could move out, and every time I visit it puts me in a horrible mood. As such, I've barely said more than a sentence to her the entire time I've been visiting. I leave the room when she enters. I'm not even trying to hide the fact that I despise her anymore. I'm so sick of everyone catering to her bullshit.  \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The story is about the author treating their mother with zero respect. The mother hasn't worked for 40 years, the father does most of the work and provides the income, and the mother is described as complaining a lot, not supportive, and focused on wealth. The author feels despises her and avoids her during visits.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The mother's behavior is clearly problematic\u2014complaining, lack of support, negative attitude. But the author's response is to treat her with zero respect, avoid her, and show disdain. While the mother's actions are hurtful, the question is whether the author's reaction is justified.\n\nIn terms of right and wrong, even if the mother is difficult, the author's approach of cutting her off and showing disdain might be seen as disrespectful. However, some might argue that after years of neglect and negativity, the author has a right to set boundaries. The key points are: the mother's behavior is harmful, but the author's response could be seen as extreme. \n\nBut in many cultural contexts, respect for parents is expected regardless of their actions. So even if the mother is terrible, the author might be in the wrong for not showing respect. However, others might say that the mother's behavior is so toxic that the author's actions are a form of self-preservation. The line between self-respect and disrespect towards a parent is blurry here. \n\nI think the answer depends on the balance between the mother's faults and the author's response. While the mother's actions are indeed problematic, the author's complete lack of respect and avoidance might not be the right approach. But given the mother's behavior, it's understandable. However, since the question is about whether the author is in the wrong, the answer might lean towards A (Yes), because respect is expected, even if the parent is at fault. But some might argue B (No), considering the mother's behavior justifies the author's reaction. Hmm, tricky. I need to decide based on societal norms. Generally, treating a parent with zero respect is frowned upon, so the author is in the wrong. So Answer A.\n"
