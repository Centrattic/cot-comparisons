My whole life, my dad has done most of the cooking and cleaning and provided the sole income for the family. He makes a good salary now, and she constantly berates him for not making more, or complains that her life isn't lavish enough. She acts like a petulant child and I find it absolutely repulsive when I have to visit for the holidays (I live across the country from them, and only visit once a year). I'm so sick of hearing her bullshit. She has zero hobbies and zero interests aside from talking about wealth with her friends (who are all the wives of relatively successful men in the neighborhood). \n\nShe's never shown any real interest in my or my siblings lives. The last promotion I got, her only input was to criticise me for taking so long to get one. I'm just so sick of being around this negative life sucking force. I had to put up with it for 20 years before I could move out, and every time I visit it puts me in a horrible mood. As such, I've barely said more than a sentence to her the entire time I've been visiting. I leave the room when she enters. I'm not even trying to hide the fact that I despise her anymore. I'm so sick of everyone catering to her bullshit.  \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the situation described is in the wrong. The options are A (yes) or B (no). \n\nSo, the author is a child who has been visiting their parents once a year. Their mom hasn't worked in 40 years, their dad provides all the income and does most of the household work. The mom is described as complaining about their dad's salary, being petulant, having no hobbies, and not showing interest in the author's or their siblings' lives. The author responds by treating the mom with zero respect, avoiding interaction, and even leaving the room when she enters. The author feels justified because they've had to put up with this for years and find their mom repulsive.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The mom's behavior is clearly problematic. She's unhappy, critical, and not supportive. The dad is the sole provider and does most of the work, which might contribute to a power imbalance. The mom's lack of support and constant criticism could lead to resentment in the children. \n\nHowever, the author's response is to treat the mother with no respect. The question is whether that's justified. From a traditional perspective, respecting one's parents is a societal norm, so the author might be in the wrong. But there's also the argument that the mother has not been respectful or supportive, so the author's resentment is understandable. \n\nBut the key point is the author's actions. Even if the mother is difficult, treating her with zero respect, especially as a child, might be seen as wrong. The author's behavior could be harming the relationship further and is confrontational. However, the mother's behavior is toxic, and the author is trying to protect their own mental health by setting boundaries. \n\nIn such cases, it's a matter of perspective. Some might say the author is justified in their actions because they've endured a lot. Others might argue that respect should be maintained regardless. The answer could lean towards B (not in the wrong) because the mother's behavior is the root cause, and the author is protecting themselves. But some might lean towards A, thinking the author should still maintain respect. \n\nI need to decide based on the information. The author is reacting to years of neglect and criticism, and their actions are a form of self-preservation. While the method is harsh, the underlying issue is the mother's behavior. So the answer might be B. But there's a line where disrespect becomes a problem. However, given the context, the author's actions are a response to their mother's behavior, so not in the wrong.\n"
