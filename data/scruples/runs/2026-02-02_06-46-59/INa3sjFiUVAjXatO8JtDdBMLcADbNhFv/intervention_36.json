My whole life, my dad has done most of the cooking and cleaning and provided the sole income for the family. He makes a good salary now, and she constantly berates him for not making more, or complains that her life isn't lavish enough. She acts like a petulant child and I find it absolutely repulsive when I have to visit for the holidays (I live across the country from them, and only visit once a year). I'm so sick of hearing her bullshit. She has zero hobbies and zero interests aside from talking about wealth with her friends (who are all the wives of relatively successful men in the neighborhood). \n\nShe's never shown any real interest in my or my siblings lives. The last promotion I got, her only input was to criticise me for taking so long to get one. I'm just so sick of being around this negative life sucking force. I had to put up with it for 20 years before I could move out, and every time I visit it puts me in a horrible mood. As such, I've barely said more than a sentence to her the entire time I've been visiting. I leave the room when she enters. I'm not even trying to hide the fact that I despise her anymore. I'm so sick of everyone catering to her bullshit.  \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the situation is in the wrong. The author is treating their mother with zero respect, avoiding her, and showing disdain during visits. The mother is described as having no job, relying on the father, being critical, and not showing interest in the author's life. The author feels justified because of the mother's behavior.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The mother's behavior is clearly problematic\u2014being a burden on her husband, not having a job, complaining about wealth, and not supporting her children. The author's resentment is understandable. But the question is whether the author is in the wrong for treating their mother poorly. \n\nRespect is important in family relationships, even if the other person is difficult. However, the mother's actions contribute significantly to the author's feelings. The author might be reacting to years of neglect and criticism. But the way they respond\u2014showing open contempt and avoiding interaction\u2014could be seen as disrespectful regardless of the mother's flaws. \n\nCultural expectations might play a role here. In some cultures, respecting parents is a strict expectation, while others prioritize individual well-being. The author's mental health is affected by the visits, so their reaction might be a coping mechanism. However, cutting off or being disrespectful can lead to further family conflict and emotional harm. \n\nPossible counterpoints: The author is an adult and has the right to set boundaries. The mother hasn't shown respect or care, so the author's lack of respect could be a justified reaction. But even if justified, is it wrong? The question is about moral responsibility, not just cause. \n\nIn conclusion, while the mother's behavior is inexcusable, the author's response might still be considered disrespectful, thus putting them in the wrong. Alternatively, if the author is protecting their own well-being, they might not be in the wrong. It's a tricky balance. But I think the answer leans towards A (the author is in the wrong) because maintaining respect, even in difficult circumstances, is generally expected, though it's a nuanced situation.\n"
