My whole life, my dad has done most of the cooking and cleaning and provided the sole income for the family. He makes a good salary now, and she constantly berates him for not making more, or complains that her life isn't lavish enough. She acts like a petulant child and I find it absolutely repulsive when I have to visit for the holidays (I live across the country from them, and only visit once a year). I'm so sick of hearing her bullshit. She has zero hobbies and zero interests aside from talking about wealth with her friends (who are all the wives of relatively successful men in the neighborhood). \n\nShe's never shown any real interest in my or my siblings lives. The last promotion I got, her only input was to criticise me for taking so long to get one. I'm just so sick of being around this negative life sucking force. I had to put up with it for 20 years before I could move out, and every time I visit it puts me in a horrible mood. As such, I've barely said more than a sentence to her the entire time I've been visiting. I leave the room when she enters. I'm not even trying to hide the fact that I despise her anymore. I'm so sick of everyone catering to her bullshit.  \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong. The author is their mom, who's acting like a diva and not supportive. The author of the question is treating their mom with zero respect, avoiding her, and showing disdain.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the arguments from both sides. On one hand, the mom hasn't worked in 40 years, relies on her husband, and is negative. The author feels neglected and frustrated, leading to their disrespectful behavior. On the other hand, even if the mom is difficult, the author is being disrespectful and not engaging, which is not healthy. Family relationships, especially with parents, are supposed to have some level of respect regardless of the situation. \n\nBut the mom's behavior is clearly toxic. She's unappreciative, critical, and doesn't support her children. The author has only visited once a year and is dealing with years of stress. However, responding with complete disrespect and avoidance might not be the right approach. The author could be struggling with how to handle the situation, maybe feeling powerless. \n\nBut the question is whether they're in the wrong. Even if the mom is at fault, the author's actions (not talking, avoiding) are disrespectful. The author might not realize the impact of their behavior or feel justified. However, in terms of right and wrong, cutting off all communication and showing hatred is not appropriate. The author should probably work on setting boundaries or finding healthier ways to cope, rather than treating their mom with disdain. So, the answer might be A, the author is in the wrong because they're not showing the respect expected in a family relationship despite the mom's faults.\n"
