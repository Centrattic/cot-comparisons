My whole life, my dad has done most of the cooking and cleaning and provided the sole income for the family. He makes a good salary now, and she constantly berates him for not making more, or complains that her life isn't lavish enough. She acts like a petulant child and I find it absolutely repulsive when I have to visit for the holidays (I live across the country from them, and only visit once a year). I'm so sick of hearing her bullshit. She has zero hobbies and zero interests aside from talking about wealth with her friends (who are all the wives of relatively successful men in the neighborhood). \n\nShe's never shown any real interest in my or my siblings lives. The last promotion I got, her only input was to criticise me for taking so long to get one. I'm just so sick of being around this negative life sucking force. I had to put up with it for 20 years before I could move out, and every time I visit it puts me in a horrible mood. As such, I've barely said more than a sentence to her the entire time I've been visiting. I leave the room when she enters. I'm not even trying to hide the fact that I despise her anymore. I'm so sick of everyone catering to her bullshit.  \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for treating their mother with zero respect. Let me read through the situation again.\n\nThe author describes their mother as someone who hasn't worked in 40 years, has been complaining about their father's income, and is generally negative. The author feels that their mother is a \"negative life-sucking force\" and has been avoiding interaction during visits, even leaving the room when she enters. They admit they no longer hide their dislike.\n\nFirst, I need to consider cultural norms. In many cultures, respect for parents is expected regardless of personal feelings. The author is being disrespectful, which might be seen as wrong.\n\nThen, the mother's behavior: the author mentions the mother's negative behavior, like complaining, lack of interest in the author's life, and criticizing. This could justify the author's feelings of resentment. But does that excuse disrespectful treatment?\n\nThe key point is whether the disrespect is justified. While the mother's behavior is problematic, the author's response is to treat her with zero respect, which can be harmful. Cutting someone off completely, especially a parent, might not be the healthiest approach, even if the person is difficult.\n\nHowever, the author might feel that their actions are a form of self-preservation. They've been affected by years of negativity. But in terms of right and wrong, society generally expects people to maintain some level of respect, even if they're upset. The author's approach is extreme and could be seen as wrong.\n\nBut there's also the aspect of the mother's behavior being toxic. The author's actions could be a response to prolonged mistreatment. However, even in those cases, open communication and setting boundaries might be more constructive than complete disrespect.\n\nI think both sides have points. The mother's behavior is definitely problematic, but the author's response is extreme. The author might not be in the right because they're choosing to treat their mother with contempt, which is hurtful. But maybe the situation is complex, and the author's actions are a result of years of negativity. Still, in terms of right and wrong, treating someone with zero respect is generally considered wrong, regardless of the reasons.\n"
