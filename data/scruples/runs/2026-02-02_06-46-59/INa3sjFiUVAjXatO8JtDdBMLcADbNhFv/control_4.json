My whole life, my dad has done most of the cooking and cleaning and provided the sole income for the family. He makes a good salary now, and she constantly berates him for not making more, or complains that her life isn't lavish enough. She acts like a petulant child and I find it absolutely repulsive when I have to visit for the holidays (I live across the country from them, and only visit once a year). I'm so sick of hearing her bullshit. She has zero hobbies and zero interests aside from talking about wealth with her friends (who are all the wives of relatively successful men in the neighborhood). \n\nShe's never shown any real interest in my or my siblings lives. The last promotion I got, her only input was to criticise me for taking so long to get one. I'm just so sick of being around this negative life sucking force. I had to put up with it for 20 years before I could move out, and every time I visit it puts me in a horrible mood. As such, I've barely said more than a sentence to her the entire time I've been visiting. I leave the room when she enters. I'm not even trying to hide the fact that I despise her anymore. I'm so sick of everyone catering to her bullshit.  \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the person who wrote this is in the wrong. Let's start by reading through the situation again to understand both sides.\n\nThe author is asking if they're at fault for treating their mother with no respect. The mom hasn't worked since marrying the dad 40 years ago. The dad does most of the cooking, cleaning, and provides the sole income. The mom is described as complaining about his salary, acting petulantly, and not showing interest in the author's life. The author feels resentful and avoids interacting with the mom during visits, showing clear disdain.\n\nFirst, I should consider the context. The mom's behavior is clearly problematic. She's not contributing to the household, is unhappy with her husband's income, and doesn't support her children. The author has had to endure this for 20 years and only visits once a year. The author's reaction is to avoid her entirely during visits, which might be seen as disrespectful.\n\nBut the question is whether the author is in the wrong. On one hand, the mom's behavior is terrible, and the author has valid reasons for their feelings. On the other hand, treating someone with zero respect, even if they deserve it, can have consequences. The author's actions are hurtful and dismissive. Maybe there's a better way to handle it, like setting boundaries without being disrespectful. However, the mom's behavior is toxic, so the author's resentment is understandable.\n\nI need to weigh the mom's actions against the author's response. The author isn't in the wrong for feeling this way, but the way they express it might be. The question is whether they're in the wrong for their actions. If the answer hinges on respect, then maybe the author is in the wrong because respect is about how you treat someone regardless of their behavior. However, if the scenario is about the right to distance oneself from a toxic person, then maybe not. But the author isn't just distancing\u2014they're being openly disrespectful. So perhaps they are in the wrong because even if the mom is problematic, treating her with no respect isn't justified. There's a difference between setting boundaries and being disrespectful. The author could still be respectful but limit interaction. Therefore, the answer would be A (the author is in the wrong).\n"
