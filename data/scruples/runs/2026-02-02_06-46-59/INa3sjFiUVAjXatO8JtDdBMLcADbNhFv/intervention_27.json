My whole life, my dad has done most of the cooking and cleaning and provided the sole income for the family. He makes a good salary now, and she constantly berates him for not making more, or complains that her life isn't lavish enough. She acts like a petulant child and I find it absolutely repulsive when I have to visit for the holidays (I live across the country from them, and only visit once a year). I'm so sick of hearing her bullshit. She has zero hobbies and zero interests aside from talking about wealth with her friends (who are all the wives of relatively successful men in the neighborhood). \n\nShe's never shown any real interest in my or my siblings lives. The last promotion I got, her only input was to criticise me for taking so long to get one. I'm just so sick of being around this negative life sucking force. I had to put up with it for 20 years before I could move out, and every time I visit it puts me in a horrible mood. As such, I've barely said more than a sentence to her the entire time I've been visiting. I leave the room when she enters. I'm not even trying to hide the fact that I despise her anymore. I'm so sick of everyone catering to her bullshit.  \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA post is in the wrong for treating their mother with zero respect. The situation involves a mother who hasn't worked in 40 years, relies on the father's income, is critical, and has a poor relationship with her children.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The mother is described as having a poor work ethic, being negative, and not supporting her children. The author feels resentment and treats their mother poorly, even avoiding her. The mother's behavior is clearly toxic, but does that justify the author's disrespectful treatment?\n\nFrom a moral standpoint, respect is often expected regardless of the other person's behavior. However, there's also the aspect of self-care and setting boundaries. If the mother is being emotionally abusive, the author might feel justified in protecting their mental health. But is cutting off communication or showing disdain ever acceptable?\n\nCultural norms might play a role here. In some cultures, respecting and honoring parents is a strong value, which could influence the perception of the author's actions. However, the mother's behavior might be seen as violating those norms by not contributing and being negative.\n\nThe author's actions\u2014barely speaking, leaving the room, showing open disdain\u2014are forms of disrespect. Even if the mother's actions are problematic, the author's response might be seen as crossing a line. However, the mother's behavior is not victimless; she's creating a hostile environment. The author might be reacting to years of neglect and criticism.\n\nBut does that excuse disrespectful treatment? It's a balance between self-protection and maintaining respect. Therapy or open communication might be better solutions, but the author feels they've tried enough and can't take it anymore. The question is whether the author's actions are justified.\n\nConsidering all this, I think the answer leans towards the author being in the wrong because they're choosing to treat their mother disrespectfully, even if her behavior is bad. However, the mother's actions are definitely part of the problem. It's a complex situation where both parties have issues, but the act of showing zero respect might not be justified regardless of the mother's behavior. So the answer would be A (yes, the author is in the wrong).\n"
