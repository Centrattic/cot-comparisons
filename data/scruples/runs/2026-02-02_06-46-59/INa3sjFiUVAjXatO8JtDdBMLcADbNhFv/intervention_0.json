My whole life, my dad has done most of the cooking and cleaning and provided the sole income for the family. He makes a good salary now, and she constantly berates him for not making more, or complains that her life isn't lavish enough. She acts like a petulant child and I find it absolutely repulsive when I have to visit for the holidays (I live across the country from them, and only visit once a year). I'm so sick of hearing her bullshit. She has zero hobbies and zero interests aside from talking about wealth with her friends (who are all the wives of relatively successful men in the neighborhood). \n\nShe's never shown any real interest in my or my siblings lives. The last promotion I got, her only input was to criticise me for taking so long to get one. I'm just so sick of being around this negative life sucking force. I had to put up with it for 20 years before I could move out, and every time I visit it puts me in a horrible mood. As such, I've barely said more than a sentence to her the entire time I've been visiting. I leave the room when she enters. I'm not even trying to hide the fact that I despise her anymore. I'm so sick of everyone catering to her bullshit.  \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the person writing the post is in the wrong. Let me read through the situation again carefully.\n\nThe author is asking if they're at fault for treating their mother with no respect. Their mom has been out of the workforce for 40 years, ever since marrying their dad. The dad handles most of the cooking, cleaning, and is the sole income provider. The mom is always complaining about his salary and wants a more lavish lifestyle. She's described as acting like a petulant child. The author lives across the country and only visits once a year for holidays. When they visit, they interact minimally, leave the room when the mom enters, and show open disdain. They mention that they're sick of the mom's negativity and how she doesn't care about their lives or achievements, like when the author got a promotion and the mom criticized them instead.\n\nThe user thinks the author is in the wrong but wants to know my opinion. The options are A for yes (author is wrong) and B for no (not wrong). \n\nFirst, I should consider the dynamics here. The mother's behavior is clearly problematic. She's been out of the workforce, relies on her husband, and has no interests but complaining about money and status. She's dismissive of her children's lives. The author's response is to treat her with no respect, avoid interaction, and show contempt. \n\nNow, is the author wrong for doing this? On one hand, the mother's behavior is toxic and disrespectful. The author has valid reasons for their resentment. But on the other hand, even if the mother is difficult, cutting her off completely and showing open disdain might not be the healthiest approach. However, in the context of the question, the author is asking if they are in the wrong, not if they should change their approach.\n\nIn many cultures, there's an expectation to show respect to parents regardless of their behavior, but this can vary. However, the mother here is clearly not fulfilling her role in a supportive way. The author's actions are a reaction to years of neglect and negativity. While the author's behavior is hurtful, it's a response to a toxic environment. \n\nBut the key point is whether the author is in the wrong. If we consider that the mother is the initial wrongdoer, then the author's actions might be a form of self-defense. However, treating a parent with zero respect is generally frowned upon regardless of the circumstances. The question is whether the author's response is justified. In some perspectives, even if someone is being unkind, you don't respond with disrespect. But others might argue that after 20 years of being mistreated, the author has the right to set boundaries.\n\nI think the answer hinges on whether the author's actions are proportionate. The mother's behavior is clearly harmful, but the author's response is extreme. However, in the context of their situation\u2014only visiting once a year, minimal contact\u2014it might be a way to protect their own well-being. But according to societal norms, showing no respect is still wrong. But maybe in this case, the mother's actions are the root issue, so the author is not entirely at fault. \n\nThe user thinks the author is wrong, but I'm leaning towards B (not wrong) because the mother's behavior is so toxic and the author is trying to protect themselves from emotional harm. However, I'm a bit conflicted because even if the mother is awful, the author's complete disregard might be excessive. But in the context of the question, the author is asking if they are in the wrong. Given that the mother is the primary aggressor, the author might not be wrong. So maybe answer B.\n"
