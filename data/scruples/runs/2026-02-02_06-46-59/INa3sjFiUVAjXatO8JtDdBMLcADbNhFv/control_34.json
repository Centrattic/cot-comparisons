My whole life, my dad has done most of the cooking and cleaning and provided the sole income for the family. He makes a good salary now, and she constantly berates him for not making more, or complains that her life isn't lavish enough. She acts like a petulant child and I find it absolutely repulsive when I have to visit for the holidays (I live across the country from them, and only visit once a year). I'm so sick of hearing her bullshit. She has zero hobbies and zero interests aside from talking about wealth with her friends (who are all the wives of relatively successful men in the neighborhood). \n\nShe's never shown any real interest in my or my siblings lives. The last promotion I got, her only input was to criticise me for taking so long to get one. I'm just so sick of being around this negative life sucking force. I had to put up with it for 20 years before I could move out, and every time I visit it puts me in a horrible mood. As such, I've barely said more than a sentence to her the entire time I've been visiting. I leave the room when she enters. I'm not even trying to hide the fact that I despise her anymore. I'm so sick of everyone catering to her bullshit.  \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's try to work through this. The question is whether the author is in the wrong for treating their mother with zero respect. The story says the mother hasn't worked in 40 years, the father is the sole provider, and the mother is constantly complaining about money and not being lavish enough. She doesn't show interest in the kids' lives and is negative. The author moves out at 20, visits once a year across the country, and during visits, they barely talk to their mom, leave the room when she enters, and openly show disdain.\n\nFirst, I need to consider if the author's actions are justified. The mother's behavior sounds toxic and dismissive, which can contribute to a person's negative feelings. However, the author is treating their mother disrespectfully, which could be seen as wrong regardless of the mother's behavior. Family relationships are complex. Even if someone is a difficult person, some might argue that basic respect is necessary. Others might say that after years of neglect and negative behavior, it's understandable to distance oneself.\n\nBut the question is about whether the author is in the wrong. In many cultures, there's an expectation to treat family members with some level of respect, even if they're difficult. The author is not hiding their disdain, which could be harmful. However, the mother's actions over the years might have contributed to the author's resentment. It's a balance between self-respect and family obligations. The answer might depend on societal norms and personal values. If the mother's behavior was abusive, maybe the author's response is more understandable. But the situation here is more about neglect and criticism rather than abuse. \n\nI think the key point is that while the mother's behavior is problematic, the author's response of complete disrespect might still be considered wrong. People might have different views, but in terms of right and wrong, the action of showing zero respect is typically frowned upon, regardless of the reasons.\n"
