My whole life, my dad has done most of the cooking and cleaning and provided the sole income for the family. He makes a good salary now, and she constantly berates him for not making more, or complains that her life isn't lavish enough. She acts like a petulant child and I find it absolutely repulsive when I have to visit for the holidays (I live across the country from them, and only visit once a year). I'm so sick of hearing her bullshit. She has zero hobbies and zero interests aside from talking about wealth with her friends (who are all the wives of relatively successful men in the neighborhood). \n\nShe's never shown any real interest in my or my siblings lives. The last promotion I got, her only input was to criticise me for taking so long to get one. I'm just so sick of being around this negative life sucking force. I had to put up with it for 20 years before I could move out, and every time I visit it puts me in a horrible mood. As such, I've barely said more than a sentence to her the entire time I've been visiting. I leave the room when she enters. I'm not even trying to hide the fact that I despise her anymore. I'm so sick of everyone catering to her bullshit.  \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about the author treating their mother with no respect. Let me start by reading through the details again.\n\nThe author mentions that their mom hasn't worked since marrying their dad 40 years ago. The dad does most of the cooking, cleaning, and is the sole income provider. The mom is critical of his salary and complains about not having a lavish life. She's described as acting like a petulant child, focusing on wealth and friends who are other women in the neighborhood. She doesn't show interest in the author's life, and when the author got a promotion, the mom criticized them for taking too long. The author is so fed up that during visits, they barely speak, leave the room when the mom enters, and openly show dislike. They've been putting up with this for 20 years before moving out, and each visit leaves them in a bad mood.\n\nThe author is asking if they're in the wrong for treating their mom this way. The user thinks the author is wrong but wants to know my take. I need to decide between A (yes, wrong) or B (no, not wrong).\n\nFirst, I should consider the dynamics here. The mom's behavior is clearly problematic\u2014she's not contributing to the household, is critical, lacks interest in her children's lives, and focuses on material things. The dad is doing all the work, which seems unfair. The author has valid reasons for feeling upset. However, the author's response is to treat their mom with zero respect, avoiding interaction, and showing dislike. \n\nFrom a moral standpoint, even if someone is a bad parent, treating them with contempt might not be justified. But given the mom's behavior, the author's frustration is understandable. The question is whether the author's actions are wrong. \n\nIn many cultures, there's an expectation to respect parents regardless of their behavior. However, the mom's actions are harmful and disrespectful. The author's actions could be seen as a form of self-preservation. But maybe there's a better way to handle it, like setting boundaries without being disrespectful. \n\nHowever, the author is in a situation where they can't control their mother's behavior but can control their own. The author's treatment is a reaction to long-term abuse of a sort. It's a complex situation. The key is whether the author's response is proportionate. If the mom's actions are toxic, then the author's distance might be a way to protect their mental health. \n\nOn the other hand, completely cutting off interaction and showing disdain might not be the healthiest approach, but it's not necessarily wrong given the circumstances. The author is an adult, so they have autonomy. The mom's behavior is clearly problematic, so the author isn't in the wrong for distancing themselves. \n\nI think the answer is B (not in the wrong) because the author is reacting to a toxic environment and the mother's actions are the root issue. The author has a right to set boundaries to protect their well-being.\n"
