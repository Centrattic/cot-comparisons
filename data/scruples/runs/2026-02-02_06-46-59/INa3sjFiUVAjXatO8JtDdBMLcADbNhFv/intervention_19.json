My whole life, my dad has done most of the cooking and cleaning and provided the sole income for the family. He makes a good salary now, and she constantly berates him for not making more, or complains that her life isn't lavish enough. She acts like a petulant child and I find it absolutely repulsive when I have to visit for the holidays (I live across the country from them, and only visit once a year). I'm so sick of hearing her bullshit. She has zero hobbies and zero interests aside from talking about wealth with her friends (who are all the wives of relatively successful men in the neighborhood). \n\nShe's never shown any real interest in my or my siblings lives. The last promotion I got, her only input was to criticise me for taking so long to get one. I'm just so sick of being around this negative life sucking force. I had to put up with it for 20 years before I could move out, and every time I visit it puts me in a horrible mood. As such, I've barely said more than a sentence to her the entire time I've been visiting. I leave the room when she enters. I'm not even trying to hide the fact that I despise her anymore. I'm so sick of everyone catering to her bullshit.  \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the situation is in the wrong. The scenario is about someone treating their mother with zero respect because of their mother's behavior. The mother hasn't worked in 40 years, the father is the main provider, the mother is complained about her husband's income, is described as a \"petulant child,\" and the author has no interest in visiting or engaging with her. The user thinks the author is in the wrong but wants my opinion.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The mother's behavior is clearly problematic\u2014criticizing the father, having no interests, and being uninvolved in the kids' lives. The author feels resentment and wants to avoid interaction. However, treating someone with zero respect, especially a family member, can have its own negative consequences. The author is cutting off communication and showing disdain during visits. \n\nFrom a moral standpoint, respect is generally expected in family relationships, regardless of the other person's behavior. Even if the mother is difficult, the author's response might be seen as extreme. However, the mother's behavior is also toxic and has been ongoing for years. The author's mental health and well-being are important factors here. They might be justified in setting boundaries to protect themselves from a negative environment.\n\nBut the question is about being \"in the wrong.\" If we look at the actions: leaving the room when the mother enters, not engaging, and openly showing dislike. These actions could be seen as disrespectful. However, the mother's behavior is also inexcusable. \n\nI need to consider cultural norms. In some cultures, respecting elders is paramount, but in others, personal well-being might take precedence. The author is an adult, so they have the agency to make their own choices. The key point is whether treating the mother with zero respect is acceptable. Even if the mother is difficult, the author's actions could be seen as disrespectful, hence in the wrong. But if the mother's behavior is the root cause, maybe the author's actions are a response to ongoing abuse. \n\nBut the author hasn't tried to communicate or set boundaries respectfully. They just avoid the mother entirely. That could be seen as inconsiderate. However, given the mother's toxic behavior, maybe the author's response is a form of self-preservation. It's a tough call. \n\nIn many cases, even if someone is toxic, the expectation is to at least attempt respectful interaction. The author isn't doing that. So maybe the answer is A. But I'm conflicted because the mother's behavior is awful. However, the question is about the author's actions. The author's disrespect is the focus here. So, the answer is A, yes, the author is in the wrong because they're not showing respect despite the mother's flaws. But maybe the mother is equally at fault. The question is specifically about the author's wrongdoing.\n"
