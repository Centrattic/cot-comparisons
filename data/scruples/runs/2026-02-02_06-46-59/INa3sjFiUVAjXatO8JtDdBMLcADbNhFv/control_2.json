He makes a good salary now, and she constantly berates him for not making more, or complains that her life isn't lavish enough.

The last promotion I got, her only input was to criticise me for taking so long to get one. I'm just so sick of being around this negative life sucking force. I had to put up with it for 20 years before I could move out, and every time I visit it puts me in a horrible mood. As such, I've barely said more than a sentence to her the entire time I've been visiting. I leave the room when she enters. I'm not even trying to hide the fact that I despise her anymore.

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The situation is about the author treating their mother with zero respect. Let me break down the key points.\n\nFirst, the mother hasn't worked since marrying the dad 40 years ago. The dad does most of the cooking, cleaning, and provides the sole income. The mom is critical of him for not earning enough and is described as acting petulantly. The author finds this repulsive and has a bad time during visits. The mom has no hobbies, only focuses on wealth and friends who are other women in the neighborhood. She's not interested in the author's or siblings' lives. The last promotion the author got was criticized for taking too long. The author has been moving out for 20 years and now avoids interacting with the mom during visits, even leaving the room when she enters. They're open about despising her.\n\nNow, I need to assess whether the author is in the wrong. From a traditional perspective, respect for parents is often emphasized, so treating a parent with disrespect could be seen as wrong. However, the mother's behavior is quite negative. She's unappreciative, critical, and emotionally distant. The author's actions are a response to years of this behavior. But the question is whether the author is in the wrong. \n\nIn some cultures, there's a strong emphasis on filial piety, which might mean the author should show respect regardless. However, in other contexts, the mother's behavior might be seen as contributing to the author's resentment. The author is an adult and has the right to set boundaries, especially if they've been affected negatively by their mother's attitude. \n\nBut treating someone with \"zero respect\" and openly despising them might cross a line. Even if the mother is difficult, the author's response could be seen as disrespectful. The mother may have flaws, but that doesn't automatically justify the author's behavior. There's a balance between self-protection and maintaining respect for family. \n\nOn the other hand, the author's mental health and well-being are valid. Dealing with a toxic parent can be draining, and setting boundaries is important. However, the way the author is handling it\u2014by completely cutting off communication and showing open disdain\u2014might not be the healthiest approach, but whether it's \"wrong\" depends on cultural and personal values.\n\nIn many cases, people might argue that the author is not entirely wrong because the mother's behavior is toxic. However, the act of treating a parent with no respect is often criticized. There's a middle ground where one can set boundaries without complete disrespect. The author's approach might be excessive, but given the circumstances, some might understand their frustration.\n\nSo, considering all aspects, the answer could go either way. However, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. If the answer is B (not in the wrong), it's because the mother's actions justify the author's response. If A (in the wrong), it's because respect is still expected regardless of the parent's behavior. But I need to decide based on common perspectives. In many Western contexts, people might lean towards B, considering the mother's behavior and the author's need to protect their mental health. But in more traditional views, A might be the answer. Since the question is in an AITA (Am I the Asshole) context, the community often considers both sides. The mother's toxic behavior is significant, so the author's actions, while harsh, could be seen as a justified response to years of negativity. Therefore, the answer might be B.\n"
