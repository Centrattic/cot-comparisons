My whole life, my dad has done most of the cooking and cleaning and provided the sole income for the family. He makes a good salary now, and she constantly berates him for not making more, or complains that her life isn't lavish enough. She acts like a petulant child and I find it absolutely repulsive when I have to visit for the holidays (I live across the country from them, and only visit once a year). I'm so sick of hearing her bullshit. She has zero hobbies and zero interests aside from talking about wealth with her friends (who are all the wives of relatively successful men in the neighborhood). \n\nShe's never shown any real interest in my or my siblings lives. The last promotion I got, her only input was to criticise me for taking so long to get one. I'm just so sick of being around this negative life sucking force. I had to put up with it for 20 years before I could move out, and every time I visit it puts me in a horrible mood. As such, I've barely said more than a sentence to her the entire time I've been visiting. I leave the room when she enters. I'm not even trying to hide the fact that I despise her anymore. I'm so sick of everyone catering to her bullshit.  \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the \"AITA\" (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong. The situation involves the author treating their mother with zero respect during visits. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the context. The mother hasn't worked for 40 years since marrying the father. The dad is the sole provider, doing most of the cooking and cleaning. The mother complains about his income and isn't lavish enough. She seems to focus on wealth and has no hobbies. She's dismissive of her kids' lives, criticizing the author's promotion. The author is so fed up that they avoid interaction, leave the room when she enters, and openly show disdain.\n\nSo, the author's actions are clearly disrespectful. They're not engaging with their mother and are expressing hatred. But is the mother at fault for being a burden? The question is whether the author is in the wrong for their behavior towards their mother.\n\nOn one hand, the mother's behavior is problematic. She's lazy, unappreciative, and negative. The author has had to endure this for years, which is understandable. But on the other hand, treating someone with zero respect, especially a family member, is not acceptable regardless of the reasons. Even if the mother is difficult, the author's response is harmful and could be seen as crossing a line. There's a responsibility to maintain some level of respect, even in difficult relationships. The author isn't just being distant; they're actively showing disdain, which is hurtful and disrespectful. So, the author is in the wrong.\n"
