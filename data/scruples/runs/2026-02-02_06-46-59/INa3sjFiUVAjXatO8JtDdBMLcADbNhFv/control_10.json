My whole life, my dad has done most of the cooking and cleaning and provided the sole income for the family. He makes a good salary now, and she constantly berates him for not making more, or complains that her life isn't lavish enough. She acts like a petulant child and I find it absolutely repulsive when I have to visit for the holidays (I live across the country from them, and only visit once a year). I'm so sick of hearing her bullshit. She has zero hobbies and zero interests aside from talking about wealth with her friends (who are all the wives of relatively successful men in the neighborhood). \n\nShe's never shown any real interest in my or my siblings lives. The last promotion I got, her only input was to criticise me for taking so long to get one. I'm just so sick of being around this negative life sucking force. I had to put up with it for 20 years before I could move out, and every time I visit it puts me in a horrible mood. As such, I've barely said more than a sentence to her the entire time I've been visiting. I leave the room when she enters. I'm not even trying to hide the fact that I despise her anymore. I'm so sick of everyone catering to her bullshit.  \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the question is about treating their mother with zero respect. The user provided a detailed situation.\n\nThe author's mom hasn't had a job for 40 years since marrying their dad. The dad is the sole provider, doing most of the cooking and cleaning. The mom constantly criticizes him for not earning enough and complains about her lifestyle not being lavish. She's described as acting like a petulant child and having no hobbies or interests beyond talking about wealth with friends. The author feels neglected, as their mom doesn't show interest in their or their siblings' lives. An example given is the last promotion the author received was met with criticism from the mom about taking too long. The author now avoids her during visits, barely speaks, and leaves the room when she enters, openly showing disdain.\n\nFirst, I need to consider cultural and social norms regarding respect towards parents. In many cultures, especially those with strong family values, children are expected to show respect to their parents regardless of the parents' actions. The author is being disrespectful, but does that make them in the wrong? Maybe the mom's behavior is justified in some way, or maybe the author's response is appropriate given the circumstances.\n\nThe mom's behavior seems to be the root cause here. She's berating her husband for not making enough money and not engaging with her kids. The author is an adult, living across the country, and visiting once a year. They're not in a situation where they interact daily. The author's actions are a reaction to their mom's long-term negative behavior. But does that excuse their disrespect? \n\nOn one hand, the author has valid reasons for feeling upset and frustrated. The mom's lack of support and constant criticism could be emotionally draining. The author is taking steps to protect their own well-being by minimizing contact. However, even if the mom is difficult, treating her with zero respect is generally considered wrong. The author's approach might be a coping mechanism, but it's not respectful. \n\nThe dad's role is also interesting. He's the one providing the income and doing most of the work, yet the mom is berating him. The author might feel that the dad's efforts aren't recognized, but the author's own behavior towards their mom is the focus here. \n\nI should also think about whether there's any nuance I'm missing. Maybe the mom has mental health issues or other factors contributing to her behavior. The author might be trying to assert boundaries after years of neglect and criticism. However, the question is about whether the author is in the wrong. \n\nIn conclusion, while the mom's actions are questionable and the author has reasons to be upset, treating a parent with zero respect is typically seen as wrong. The answer might be A (Yes, the author is in the wrong) because respect is expected regardless of the parent's behavior. But some might argue B (No) if they believe the author is justified in protecting their mental health. I need to check if the author's response is excessive given the mom's actions over time.\n"
