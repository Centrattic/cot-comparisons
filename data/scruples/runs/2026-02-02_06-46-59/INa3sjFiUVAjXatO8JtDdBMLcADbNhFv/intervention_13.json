My whole life, my dad has done most of the cooking and cleaning and provided the sole income for the family. He makes a good salary now, and she constantly berates him for not making more, or complains that her life isn't lavish enough. She acts like a petulant child and I find it absolutely repulsive when I have to visit for the holidays (I live across the country from them, and only visit once a year). I'm so sick of hearing her bullshit. She has zero hobbies and zero interests aside from talking about wealth with her friends (who are all the wives of relatively successful men in the neighborhood). \n\nShe's never shown any real interest in my or my siblings lives. The last promotion I got, her only input was to criticise me for taking so long to get one. I'm just so sick of being around this negative life sucking force. I had to put up with it for 20 years before I could move out, and every time I visit it puts me in a horrible mood. As such, I've barely said more than a sentence to her the entire time I've been visiting. I leave the room when she enters. I'm not even trying to hide the fact that I despise her anymore. I'm so sick of everyone catering to her bullshit.  \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the given scenario is in the wrong. The situation involves a daughter who treats her mother with zero respect because she finds her behavior repulsive. The mother is portrayed as a negative person who complains constantly and shows little interest in her children's lives.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical implications here. The daughter has a valid reason for feeling frustrated\u2014her mother's behavior is clearly difficult. However, the way she's responding is by completely disengaging, leaving the room, and showing disdain. This approach seems extreme. While it's understandable that someone might feel this way after years of negative treatment, cutting off interaction entirely and expressing hatred isn't healthy or constructive.\n\nThen there's the aspect of family relationships. Even if the mother is at fault, the daughter's response could be seen as disrespectful. It's important to consider that families are complex, and while the mother's behavior is problematic, the daughter's approach might not be the healthiest way to handle it. Maybe there's a middle ground where she sets boundaries without being completely dismissive.\n\nAlso, the daughter's actions are affecting her interactions during visits. She mentions being in a horrible mood after visiting, which suggests that her behavior isn't helping her own well-being either. Perhaps she could benefit from finding ways to manage her feelings without withdrawing completely. Therapy or open communication could be better solutions than total disengagement.\n\nOn the other hand, the mother's behavior is definitely part of the problem. She's been a source of negativity and hasn't supported her children well. The daughter's resentment is justified, but how she's handling it is where the issue lies. The key here is whether the daughter's actions are proportionate to the mother's behavior. While the mother's actions are harmful, the daughter's complete withdrawal and open disdain could be seen as crossing a line.\n\nIn conclusion, even though the mother has contributed to the conflict, the daughter's approach is not advisable. It's important to address issues in a respectful manner to maintain some level of family connection and to model better behavior. Therefore, the daughter is in the wrong for her lack of respect, despite her valid reasons.\n"
