My whole life, my dad has done most of the cooking and cleaning and provided the sole income for the family. He makes a good salary now, and she constantly berates him for not making more, or complains that her life isn't lavish enough. She acts like a petulant child and I find it absolutely repulsive when I have to visit for the holidays (I live across the country from them, and only visit once a year). I'm so sick of hearing her bullshit. She has zero hobbies and zero interests aside from talking about wealth with her friends (who are all the wives of relatively successful men in the neighborhood). \n\nShe's never shown any real interest in my or my siblings lives. The last promotion I got, her only input was to criticise me for taking so long to get one. I'm just so sick of being around this negative life sucking force. I had to put up with it for 20 years before I could move out, and every time I visit it puts me in a horrible mood. As such, I've barely said more than a sentence to her the entire time I've been visiting. I leave the room when she enters. I'm not even trying to hide the fact that I despise her anymore. I'm so sick of everyone catering to her bullshit.  \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The user is asking about a situation where the person treats their mother with zero respect. The question is whether that's their fault.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The mom hasn't worked in 40 years since marrying the dad. The dad is the sole provider, doing most of the cooking and cleaning. The mom is always criticizing the dad's income and wants a more lavish lifestyle. She's described as acting like a petulant child. The author lives far away, visits once a year, and during these visits, they avoid their mom, leave the room when she enters, and show clear disdain. The author feels this is justified because of the mom's negative behavior over the years.\n\nSo, the author's actions are disrespectful\u2014avoiding conversation, showing hatred. But they claim it's because of the mom's behavior. The question is about whether the author is wrong for this.\n\nI need to consider both sides. On one hand, treating someone with zero respect is generally not acceptable, regardless of the reasons. Even if someone is difficult, responding with contempt isn't healthy. On the other hand, the mom's behavior is also problematic. She's not working, depends on her husband, criticizes him, and isn't supportive of her children. The author has been put through a lot, maybe leading to resentment.\n\nBut the core issue is respect. Even if the mother is awful, the author's response is to treat her with no respect, which could be seen as wrong. People can have difficult relationships, but mistreatment isn't justified. Maybe the author should seek a healthier way to handle the situation, like setting boundaries without being disrespectful. So, I think the author is in the wrong because they're choosing to act disrespectfully instead of finding a more constructive approach. The mom's actions don't give the author a free pass to be disrespectful. So the answer would be A (Yes, the author is in the wrong).\n"
