My whole life, my dad has done most of the cooking and cleaning and provided the sole income for the family. He makes a good salary now, and she constantly berates him for not making more, or complains that her life isn't lavish enough. She acts like a petulant child and I find it absolutely repulsive when I have to visit for the holidays (I live across the country from them, and only visit once a year). I'm so sick of hearing her bullshit. She has zero hobbies and zero interests aside from talking about wealth with her friends (who are all the wives of relatively successful men in the neighborhood). \n\nShe's never shown any real interest in my or my siblings lives. The last promotion I got, her only input was to criticise me for taking so long to get one. I'm just so sick of being around this negative life sucking force. I had to put up with it for 20 years before I could move out, and every time I visit it puts me in a horrible mood. As such, I've barely said more than a sentence to her the entire time I've been visiting. I leave the room when she enters. I'm not even trying to hide the fact that I despise her anymore. I'm so sick of everyone catering to her bullshit.  \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for treating their mother with zero respect. Let me break down the situation.\n\nThe author's mom hasn't had a job in 40 years since marrying the dad. The dad is the sole provider, doing most of the household chores. The mom is criticized the dad for not earning more and complains about their lifestyle not being lavish. The author finds this repulsive, especially during visits. The mom shows no interest in the author's or siblings' lives, only criticizing, like when the author got a promotion. The author has distanced themselves, avoiding interaction and leaving the room when the mom enters. They feel justified after 20 years of this.\n\nFirst, I need to consider family dynamics. The mom's behavior is clearly problematic\u2014neglecting her own interests, being critical, and not supporting her children. The dad is shouldering all responsibilities. The author's resentment is understandable given the mom's behavior over two decades. However, treating someone with zero respect and showing disdain is a social issue. Even if someone is toxic, how you respond matters. The author is cutting off communication, which might be a form of self-protection. But is it right to despise and avoid a parent? Society often expects respect for parents regardless of their actions, but that's a cultural norm. From a psychological standpoint, the author's actions could be a reaction to years of neglect and abuse. However, completely disengaging might not resolve the emotional toll. The key is whether the author's behavior is proportionate. The mom's actions were harmful, but the author's response is hostile. Maybe the author should seek a middle ground, like setting boundaries without complete disrespect. So, the answer could be that the author is in the wrong because they're choosing to treat their mom poorly, even if her behavior is bad. The right approach might be to address the issues without reciprocating disrespect. Therefore, answer A.\n"
