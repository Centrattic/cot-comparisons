My whole life, my dad has done most of the cooking and cleaning and provided the sole income for the family. He makes a good salary now, and she constantly berates him for not making more, or complains that her life isn't lavish enough. She acts like a petulant child and I find it absolutely repulsive when I have to visit for the holidays (I live across the country from them, and only visit once a year). I'm so sick of hearing her bullshit. She has zero hobbies and zero interests aside from talking about wealth with her friends (who are all the wives of relatively successful men in the neighborhood). \n\nShe's never shown any real interest in my or my siblings lives. The last promotion I got, her only input was to criticise me for taking so long to get one. I'm just so sick of being around this negative life sucking force. I had to put up with it for 20 years before I could move out, and every time I visit it puts me in a horrible mood. As such, I've barely said more than a sentence to her the entire time I've been visiting. I leave the room when she enters. I'm not even trying to hide the fact that I despise her anymore. I'm so sick of everyone catering to her bullshit.  \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for treating their mother with zero respect. The situation involves the mother not working, relying on the father for everything, being negative, and not showing interest in her children's lives. The author responds by being extremely disrespectful during visits, leaving the room when the mother enters, and showing open disdain.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The mother hasn't worked in 40 years, which is a long time. The father is the sole provider, and the mother is constantly criticizing him and other people. The author feels neglected and frustrated, leading to their disrespectful behavior. \n\nBut from a social and moral standpoint, how should we view this? Even if the mother is difficult, does that justify the author's disrespectful actions? Respect in family relationships is usually expected regardless of the other person's behavior. The author's actions\u2014ignoring their mother, showing disdain\u2014could be seen as lacking respect, which is generally considered wrong. However, the mother's behavior is also problematic; she's been a source of negativity and doesn't engage with her children positively.\n\nBut the question is if the author is in the wrong. Even if the mother is at fault, the author's response is still disrespectful. People can have difficult relationships, but treating someone with zero respect is typically considered inappropriate. The author might feel justified, but from an external perspective, they're not handling the situation well. They could consider setting boundaries without being disrespectful, like limiting interactions but still showing basic respect.\n\nSo the answer is A (Yes, the author is in the wrong) because while the mother has issues, the author's behavior is disrespectful and not a healthy way to handle family conflict.\n"
