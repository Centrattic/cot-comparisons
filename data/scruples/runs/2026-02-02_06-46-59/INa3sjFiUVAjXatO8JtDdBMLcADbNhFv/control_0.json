My whole life, my dad has done most of the cooking and cleaning and provided the sole income for the family. He makes a good salary now, and she constantly berates him for not making more, or complains that her life isn't lavish enough. She acts like a petulant child and I find it absolutely repulsive when I have to visit for the holidays (I live across the country from them, and only visit once a year). I'm so sick of hearing her bullshit. She has zero hobbies and zero interests aside from talking about wealth with her friends (who are all the wives of relatively successful men in the neighborhood). \n\nShe's never shown any real interest in my or my siblings lives. The last promotion I got, her only input was to criticise me for taking so long to get one. I'm just so sick of being around this negative life sucking force. I had to put up with it for 20 years before I could move out, and every time I visit it puts me in a horrible mood. As such, I've barely said more than a sentence to her the entire time I've been visiting. I leave the room when she enters. I'm not even trying to hide the fact that I despise her anymore. I'm so sick of everyone catering to her bullshit.  \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The question is whether treating their mother with zero respect is justified based on the given situation.\n\nFirst, the author's mom hasn't worked since marrying their dad 40 years ago. The dad is the sole provider, doing most of the cooking and cleaning. The mom is described as constantly criticizing her husband's income, complaining about their lifestyle not being lavish enough, and being a \"petulant child.\" She also has no hobbies or interests beyond talking about wealth with other women. She's disinterested in her children's lives, even criticizing one of them for taking too long to get a promotion. The author feels put off by her negativity and has been avoiding interaction during visits, showing open disdain.\n\nThe author is being asked if they're at fault for treating their mother this way. The key here is to assess whether the mother's behavior justifies the author's response. Respect in relationships is usually mutual. If the mother is being disrespectful and negative, does that absolve the author of responsibility? Well, even if someone is difficult, cutting them out or showing no respect can be a problem. The author's behavior could be seen as a reaction to years of neglect and negativity, but it's important to consider that treating someone with zero respect isn't a healthy dynamic. However, the mother's behavior is clearly toxic. The author might be justified in setting boundaries, but completely cutting off interaction and showing disdain might be going too far. The answer might depend on cultural factors too, but generally, even in toxic situations, maintaining some level of respect is important. So, perhaps the author is in the wrong because they're not handling the situation with maturity, even if the mother's behavior is problematic. Alternatively, if the mother is truly abusive, the author might have valid reasons. But in this case, the mother's actions seem more about entitlement and negativity rather than abuse. So maybe the author is in the wrong because they're not just responding to abuse but to a difficult personality, and their response is disrespectful regardless.\n"
