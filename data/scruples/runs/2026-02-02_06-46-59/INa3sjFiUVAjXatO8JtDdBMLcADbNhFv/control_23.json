My whole life, my dad has done most of the cooking and cleaning and provided the sole income for the family. He makes a good salary now, and she constantly berates him for not making more, or complains that her life isn't lavish enough. She acts like a petulant child and I find it absolutely repulsive when I have to visit for the holidays (I live across the country from them, and only visit once a year). I'm so sick of hearing her bullshit. She has zero hobbies and zero interests aside from talking about wealth with her friends (who are all the wives of relatively successful men in the neighborhood). \n\nShe's never shown any real interest in my or my siblings lives. The last promotion I got, her only input was to criticise me for taking so long to get one. I'm just so sick of being around this negative life sucking force. I had to put up with it for 20 years before I could move out, and every time I visit it puts me in a horrible mood. As such, I've barely said more than a sentence to her the entire time I've been visiting. I leave the room when she enters. I'm not even trying to hide the fact that I despise her anymore. I'm so sick of everyone catering to her bullshit.  \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole?) post is in the wrong. The situation is about their mom, who hasn't worked for 40 years, relies on the dad's income, and is described as complaining and having a negative attitude. The author treats their mom with zero respect during visits, avoiding interaction and showing disdain.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the cultural context. In many cultures, respect for parents is a key value. Disrespecting a parent, even if they're difficult, might be seen as wrong. The author's mom has her own issues\u2014like not working, complaining, and not engaging with her kids\u2014but the author's response is to completely cut them off and show contempt. That seems extreme, regardless of the mom's behavior. Also, the author mentions leaving the room when the mom enters and not hiding their dislike. This could be seen as disrespectful and not giving the parent proper respect, which is often expected in many societies.\n\nBut then, the mom's behavior is pretty toxic. She's a negative presence, and the author has only visited once a year since moving out. The author's actions might be a reaction to long-term emotional neglect and toxicity. However, disrespecting someone, even if they're difficult, can be considered wrong. The author might be projecting their frustration, but the response is harsh. \n\nOn the other hand, the mom's actions are problematic too. She's a source of negativity and doesn't support her children emotionally. The author's resentment is understandable, but treating someone with zero respect isn't the solution. There's a balance between setting boundaries and showing disrespect. The author could have set boundaries without being disrespectful. So, the answer might lean towards the author being in the wrong because of their disrespectful behavior, even if the mom is at fault in other ways.\n"
