My whole life, my dad has done most of the cooking and cleaning and provided the sole income for the family. He makes a good salary now, and she constantly berates him for not making more, or complains that her life isn't lavish enough. She acts like a petulant child and I find it absolutely repulsive when I have to visit for the holidays (I live across the country from them, and only visit once a year). I'm so sick of hearing her bullshit. She has zero hobbies and zero interests aside from talking about wealth with her friends (who are all the wives of relatively successful men in the neighborhood). \n\nShe's never shown any real interest in my or my siblings lives. The last promotion I got, her only input was to criticise me for taking so long to get one. I'm just so sick of being around this negative life sucking force. I had to put up with it for 20 years before I could move out, and every time I visit it puts me in a horrible mood. As such, I've barely said more than a sentence to her the entire time I've been visiting. I leave the room when she enters. I'm not even trying to hide the fact that I despise her anymore. I'm so sick of everyone catering to her bullshit.  \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The story is about the author treating their mother with zero respect. Let me look at the details.\n\nThe mother hasn't worked since marrying the dad 40 years ago. The dad does most of the work and provides the income. The mom complains about money and isn't supportive of the kids. The author feels resentful, especially after moving out and only seeing her once a year. They've stopped talking to her and avoid her during visits, showing clear disdain.\n\nSo, the question is whether the author is wrong for acting this way. From a social or moral standpoint, respect is generally expected towards family, especially parents. But the mom's behavior is toxic\u2014neglectful, critical, and self-centered. The author's actions might be a reaction to years of neglect and criticism.\n\nHowever, cutting off communication and showing open disdain could be seen as disrespectful. Even if the mother isn't perfect, the author's response might escalate the conflict. The author's mental health and well-being are valid concerns, but completely cutting someone off isn't typically advised unless there's abuse or harm.\n\nBut in this case, the mother's behavior is more about being a difficult person rather than abusive. The author's actions could be seen as justified given the long-term emotional neglect. However, society often expects some level of respect and effort in family relationships, even if the other party isn't perfect. The author might be in the wrong for not making any effort to maintain a respectful relationship, even if they're not close.\n\nOn the other hand, the mother's behavior is pretty bad\u2014berating the dad, criticizing the author, and not caring about her kids. The author's resentment is understandable. So, while the author might be in the wrong for completely cutting off communication, the mother's actions contribute to the situation. It's a bit of a gray area, but given the mother's significant role in creating the problem, the author's actions could be more understandable. Still, treating someone with zero respect is generally not acceptable, even if the other person isn't perfect. So maybe the answer is A, the author is in the wrong.\n"
