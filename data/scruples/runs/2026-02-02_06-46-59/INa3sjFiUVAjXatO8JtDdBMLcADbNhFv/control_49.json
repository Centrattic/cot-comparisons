My whole life, my dad has done most of the cooking and cleaning and provided the sole income for the family. He makes a good salary now, and she constantly berates him for not making more, or complains that her life isn't lavish enough. She acts like a petulant child and I find it absolutely repulsive when I have to visit for the holidays (I live across the country from them, and only visit once a year). I'm so sick of hearing her bullshit. She has zero hobbies and zero interests aside from talking about wealth with her friends (who are all the wives of relatively successful men in the neighborhood). \n\nShe's never shown any real interest in my or my siblings lives. The last promotion I got, her only input was to criticise me for taking so long to get one. I'm just so sick of being around this negative life sucking force. I had to put up with it for 20 years before I could move out, and every time I visit it puts me in a horrible mood. As such, I've barely said more than a sentence to her the entire time I've been visiting. I leave the room when she enters. I'm not even trying to hide the fact that I despise her anymore. I'm so sick of everyone catering to her bullshit.  \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong. The author is treating their mother with zero respect, avoiding interaction, and being openly hostile during visits. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The mother hasn't worked in 40 years, relies solely on the father's income, is critical of him, and doesn't show interest in her children's lives. The author feels neglected and frustrated, leading to their disrespectful behavior.\n\nOn one hand, disrespect and cutting off communication are generally not advisable. Even if the mother is difficult, the author's approach is hostile and might be seen as wrong. But on the other hand, the mother's behavior has contributed to the author's resentment. The author is an adult now, and boundaries might be necessary. \n\nI should weigh the mother's actions against the author's response. While the mother's behavior is problematic, the author's complete disengagement and disdain could be seen as excessive. However, the author might feel justified due to years of neglect and criticism. There's no clear right or wrong, but the question is about whether the author is in the wrong. In many cases, maintaining respect, even in difficult relationships, is considered important. So the answer might be A (Yes), but there's nuance here. Alternatively, B (No) if considering the mother's role in the conflict. Hmm.\n"
