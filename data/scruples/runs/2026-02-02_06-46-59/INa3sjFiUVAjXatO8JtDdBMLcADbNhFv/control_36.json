My whole life, my dad has done most of the cooking and cleaning and provided the sole income for the family. He makes a good salary now, and she constantly berates him for not making more, or complains that her life isn't lavish enough. She acts like a petulant child and I find it absolutely repulsive when I have to visit for the holidays (I live across the country from them, and only visit once a year). I'm so sick of hearing her bullshit. She has zero hobbies and zero interests aside from talking about wealth with her friends (who are all the wives of relatively successful men in the neighborhood). \n\nShe's never shown any real interest in my or my siblings lives. The last promotion I got, her only input was to criticise me for taking so long to get one. I'm just so sick of being around this negative life sucking force. I had to put up with it for 20 years before I could move out, and every time I visit it puts me in a horrible mood. As such, I've barely said more than a sentence to her the entire time I've been visiting. I leave the room when she enters. I'm not even trying to hide the fact that I despise her anymore. I'm so sick of everyone catering to her bullshit.  \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author of the situation described is in the wrong. The question is between A (yes) and B (no). \n\nFirst, I need to understand the scenario. The author is a child who's treating their mother with zero respect. The mother hasn't worked in 40 years since marrying the father. The father is the sole provider and does most of the household work. The mother is described as complaining about the father's income, being petulant, and not interested in her children's lives. The author feels resentful, has a bad experience visiting her, and now avoids interacting, even showing disdain.\n\nSo, the key points here are the mother's behavior. She's not working, putting the father under pressure for money, and being dismissive of the kids. The author's response is to withdraw and show contempt. The user is asking if the author is wrong for doing this.\n\nIn terms of moral judgment, respect towards family members is generally expected. The author is not interacting with their mother and is openly hostile. That's a strong stance. However, the mother's behavior is also problematic. She's been neglectful, critical, and uninterested in her children's lives. The author's resentment is understandable given the years of negative treatment.\n\nBut the question is about whether the author is in the wrong. Even if the mother is behaving badly, the author's response of complete disrespect and avoidance might not be the right approach. While the mother's actions are hurtful, the author's actions could be seen as cutting off a family relationship entirely, which might not be justified. The author could be missing an opportunity to set boundaries respectfully or seek reconciliation, even if the mother isn't a model parent.\n\nOn the other hand, if someone is consistently toxic, it's reasonable to protect one's mental health. The author has valid reasons for feeling upset. The answer might depend on cultural expectations\u2014some cultures emphasize family respect no matter the circumstances, while others prioritize individual well-being.\n\nBut the question is whether the author is in the wrong. The mother's behavior is bad, but the author's response is extreme. Even if the mother is at fault, the author treating her with zero respect might still be the wrong approach. The correct answer might be A (yes), because regardless of the mother's behavior, showing disrespect is not acceptable. However, some might argue B (no), given the mother's toxic behavior.\n\nI need to weigh both sides. The author's actions are disrespectful, but the mother's are harmful. In terms of right and wrong, the act of treating a family member with zero respect is generally considered wrong, regardless of the provocation. So the answer might be A. But I need to be careful not to assume that. Some people might say the author is justified because the mother is toxic. But in most ethical frameworks, even if someone is bad, you don't respond with zero respect. You respond with boundaries but still maintain respect. So maybe the author is in the wrong because they're not showing respect, even if the mother is to blame.\n"
