My whole life, my dad has done most of the cooking and cleaning and provided the sole income for the family. He makes a good salary now, and she constantly berates him for not making more, or complains that her life isn't lavish enough. She acts like a petulant child and I find it absolutely repulsive when I have to visit for the holidays (I live across the country from them, and only visit once a year). I'm so sick of hearing her bullshit. She has zero hobbies and zero interests aside from talking about wealth with her friends (who are all the wives of relatively successful men in the neighborhood). \n\nShe's never shown any real interest in my or my siblings lives. The last promotion I got, her only input was to criticise me for taking so long to get one. I'm just so sick of being around this negative life sucking force. I had to put up with it for 20 years before I could move out, and every time I visit it puts me in a horrible mood. As such, I've barely said more than a sentence to her the entire time I've been visiting. I leave the room when she enters. I'm not even trying to hide the fact that I despise her anymore. I'm so sick of everyone catering to her bullshit.  \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author of the story is in the wrong for treating their mother with zero respect. The author describes their mother as someone who hasn't worked in 40 years, complains a lot about money, and isn't interested in their or their siblings' lives. The author has been cutting their mother out during visits, avoiding conversations, and showing disdain.\n\nFirst, I need to consider family dynamics and respect. While the mother's behavior is clearly problematic\u2014neglectful, complaining, and critical\u2014it's important to evaluate whether the author's response is justified. The author is an adult now, so their responsibility might be different. However, completely cutting off communication and showing contempt could be seen as disrespectful, regardless of the mother's flaws.\n\nThe mother's actions might be harmful, but does that negate the child's responsibility to maintain some level of respect? Even if someone is flawed, treating them with zero respect can lead to further family conflict and emotional harm. The author's approach could be seen as extreme, especially if they're an adult and the mother is elderly. However, the user's initial thought is that the author is in the wrong, but maybe the mother's behavior is so toxic that the author's reaction is understandable.\n\nI need to weigh the harm caused by both parties. The mother's neglect and criticism are hurtful, but the author's complete disengagement might be equally damaging. There's a balance between self-preservation and maintaining familial respect. The author mentions being in a horrible mood after visits, but maybe they could find a middle ground, like setting boundaries without total disrespect. However, the author's actions are a reaction to long-term neglect and disrespect, which complicates things.\n\nIn many cultures, there's an expectation of respect towards parents regardless of their behavior. But there's also the aspect of mental health and not tolerating toxic environments. The author might be prioritizing their well-being over traditional norms. However, completely cutting someone off can have its own consequences. The key here is whether the author's treatment is a reasonable response to the mother's behavior. The mother's actions are clearly harmful, but the author's response might be seen as disproportionate. On the other hand, if the mother has been this way for decades, the author might feel justified in their reaction.\n\nI think the answer hinges on the balance between self-respect and familial duty. The author is in a stressful situation, but their approach might be harmful. However, given the mother's ongoing negative behavior, maybe the author isn't entirely at fault. But the question is about whether the author is in the wrong. Since the user thinks the author is in the wrong, maybe the answer is A. But if the mother's behavior is so bad, maybe the answer is B. It's a tough call, but generally, even if someone is flawed, treating them with zero respect is not acceptable. So probably A.\n"
