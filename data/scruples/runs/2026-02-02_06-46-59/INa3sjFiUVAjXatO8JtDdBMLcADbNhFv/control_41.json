My whole life, my dad has done most of the cooking and cleaning and provided the sole income for the family. He makes a good salary now, and she constantly berates him for not making more, or complains that her life isn't lavish enough. She acts like a petulant child and I find it absolutely repulsive when I have to visit for the holidays (I live across the country from them, and only visit once a year). I'm so sick of hearing her bullshit. She has zero hobbies and zero interests aside from talking about wealth with her friends (who are all the wives of relatively successful men in the neighborhood). \n\nShe's never shown any real interest in my or my siblings lives. The last promotion I got, her only input was to criticise me for taking so long to get one. I'm just so sick of being around this negative life sucking force. I had to put up with it for 20 years before I could move out, and every time I visit it puts me in a horrible mood. As such, I've barely said more than a sentence to her the entire time I've been visiting. I leave the room when she enters. I'm not even trying to hide the fact that I despise her anymore. I'm so sick of everyone catering to her bullshit.  \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The question is whether the author is in the wrong for treating their mother with zero respect. Let me read through the situation again to make sure I understand all the details.\n\nThe author's mom hasn't worked since marrying their dad 40 years ago. The dad is the sole provider, doing most of the cooking and cleaning. The mom constantly complains about his income and their lifestyle, acting petulantly. The author finds this repulsive, especially during annual visits. They mention the mom has no hobbies or interests besides talking about wealth with other women in the neighborhood. She's not interested in the author's or their siblings' lives. The author's last promotion was criticized by the mom for taking too long. The author is now cutting themself off during visits, avoiding interaction and showing disdain. The author is asking if they're in the wrong (AITA).\n\nSo, the key points here are the mother's behavior, which the author finds toxic and disrespectful. The mother is not working, relying on the dad's income, complaining, and not engaging with her children's lives. The author, after years of this, is now avoiding her during visits to protect their mental health. The author is asking if they're at fault.\n\nI need to consider if the author is wrong. On one hand, showing disrespect to a parent is generally frowned upon in many cultures. However, the mother's behavior is described as harmful and dismissive. The author has only visited once a year, which might be a way to minimize exposure. The author's actions are a result of years of negative treatment. \n\nBut even if the mother is at fault, is the author's response acceptable? The author is cutting off interaction entirely and showing disdain, which could be seen as disrespectful regardless of the mother's actions. However, some might argue that the mother's behavior justifies the author's actions as a form of self-preservation. \n\nIn many cases, people might take into account the context of the mother's behavior being toxic and the author's mental health. But the act of treating a parent with zero respect is often seen as wrong, even if the parent is at fault. However, in some perspectives, the author is standing up for themselves against a harmful situation. \n\nI think this is a bit of a gray area. But the community might lean towards the author being in the right if the mother's behavior is genuinely harmful. However, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. If the mother's actions justify the author's response, then the author isn't in the wrong. But if respect is always required regardless of the parent's behavior, then the author is wrong. \n\nI need to consider the cultural norms too. In many cultures, respect for parents is expected, but if the parent is abusive, then the child's response might be more understood. The key here is that the mother's behavior is toxic, and the author is protecting their mental health. So, the answer might be B (Not in the wrong) because the mother's actions have led to the author's response as a form of self-protection. But some might argue that the author should try to maintain some level of respect despite the mother's faults. \n\nHmm. I think the consensus would be that the author isn't in the wrong given the mother's behavior. The answer is B.\n"
