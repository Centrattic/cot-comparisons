My whole life, my dad has done most of the cooking and cleaning and provided the sole income for the family. He makes a good salary now, and she constantly berates him for not making more, or complains that her life isn't lavish enough. She acts like a petulant child and I find it absolutely repulsive when I have to visit for the holidays (I live across the country from them, and only visit once a year). I'm so sick of hearing her bullshit. She has zero hobbies and zero interests aside from talking about wealth with her friends (who are all the wives of relatively successful men in the neighborhood). \n\nShe's never shown any real interest in my or my siblings lives. The last promotion I got, her only input was to criticise me for taking so long to get one. I'm just so sick of being around this negative life sucking force. I had to put up with it for 20 years before I could move out, and every time I visit it puts me in a horrible mood. As such, I've barely said more than a sentence to her the entire time I've been visiting. I leave the room when she enters. I'm not even trying to hide the fact that I despise her anymore. I'm so sick of everyone catering to her bullshit.  \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about the user treating their mother with zero respect. Let me break down the information given.\n\nFirst, the mother hasn't had a job for 40 years since marrying the father. The father is the sole provider, doing most of the cooking and cleaning. The mother is constantly criticizing the father for not making more money and is seen as a negative, uninterested figure in the author's and siblings' lives. The author is visiting once a year, but when they do, they avoid interacting with the mother, barely say anything, and leave the room when she enters. The author is open about despising her and feels the mother's behavior is exhausting.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. The user thinks they are, but they want others' opinions. Let's consider both sides.\n\nOn one hand, the mother's behavior is problematic. She's not contributing financially, is critical, and doesn't show interest in her children's lives. The author has had to endure this for 20 years and is now in their 20s, living across the country. The emotional toll is significant, and the author feels justified in their resentment. However, the way they are treating their mother\u2014avoiding her, not engaging, and being openly hostile\u2014could be seen as disrespectful, regardless of the mother's actions.\n\nOn the other hand, respect is often considered a two-way street. Even if the mother is difficult, completely cutting her off or showing disdain might not be the healthiest approach. The author might be acting out of self-preservation, but is it wrong to do so? Some might argue that even in a toxic relationship, maintaining some level of respect is necessary, especially given the family bond. Others might say that the mother's behavior is so toxic that the author is justified in protecting their mental health.\n\nBut then, the author is visiting once a year. Maybe the mother is the only one in the dynamic being toxic. The father might be the main provider, but the mother's behavior is the issue. The author's actions could be a form of non-engagement, which is a strategy some use in dealing with toxic family members. However, completely cutting off communication, even in person, could be seen as extreme. The author is not hiding their feelings, which might be unwise in a family setting, leading to further conflict.\n\nAlso, the author is an adult, so their responsibility to maintain a relationship with their parents might be less, but there's still cultural and social expectations around family respect. Even if the mother is difficult, showing no respect could be considered wrong from a societal perspective.\n\nBut the mother's behavior is also clearly problematic. She's not a model parent and has contributed to a toxic environment. The author's actions could be seen as a reaction to years of neglect and negativity. It's possible that the author is not in the wrong because they are protecting themselves from a harmful situation. However, the way they're handling it might not be the healthiest or most constructive.\n\nI think the key here is whether respect is conditional. If the mother is not respecting the author or their siblings, it's hard to demand that the author reciprocate. But there's a difference between not engaging and treating someone with complete disrespect. The author is not engaging, but the question is about treating her with \"zero respect.\" Avoiding her isn't necessarily disrespectful; it could be a way to minimize conflict. However, leaving the room when she enters and being openly hostile does cross into disrespect.\n\nSo, considering all factors, the author might be in the wrong in terms of how they're handling their interactions, even if the mother's behavior is bad. The author could be harming the relationship further and not addressing the issues constructively. Therefore, the answer might be A.\n"
