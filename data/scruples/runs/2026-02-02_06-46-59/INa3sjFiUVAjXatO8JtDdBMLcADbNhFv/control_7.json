My whole life, my dad has done most of the cooking and cleaning and provided the sole income for the family. He makes a good salary now, and she constantly berates him for not making more, or complains that her life isn't lavish enough. She acts like a petulant child and I find it absolutely repulsive when I have to visit for the holidays (I live across the country from them, and only visit once a year). I'm so sick of hearing her bullshit. She has zero hobbies and zero interests aside from talking about wealth with her friends (who are all the wives of relatively successful men in the neighborhood). \n\nShe's never shown any real interest in my or my siblings lives. The last promotion I got, her only input was to criticise me for taking so long to get one. I'm just so sick of being around this negative life sucking force. I had to put up with it for 20 years before I could move out, and every time I visit it puts me in a horrible mood. As such, I've barely said more than a sentence to her the entire time I've been visiting. I leave the room when she enters. I'm not even trying to hide the fact that I despise her anymore. I'm so sick of everyone catering to her bullshit.  \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of the given situation is in the wrong. The author is treating their mother with zero respect, avoiding her during visits, and showing open disdain. The mother is described as a source of negativity, not working, complaining about money, and not being supportive of her children. The author feels justified because of the mother's behavior.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The mother hasn't worked in 40 years, relies on the father, and is negative. The author's response is to withhold respect and avoid interaction. But is that acceptable? \n\nOn one hand, the mother's actions are clearly problematic. She's not supportive, is critical, and has no hobbies. The author has had a tough time dealing with this for years. On the other hand, treating someone with zero respect, even if they're a parent, isn't typically seen as the right approach. The author is choosing to cut off communication, which can be hurtful and might not be constructive. \n\nRespect is a two-way street, but it's also about how we handle conflict. The author's response is hostile, which could escalate tensions. Maybe there's a better way to set boundaries without being disrespectful. The author might feel justified, but society often expects children to show respect to parents regardless of the parent's behavior. However, there's also the aspect of mental health and personal well-being. Constant exposure to negativity is harmful, so the author might be trying to protect themselves.\n\nBut the question is whether the author is in the wrong. The mother is definitely at fault for her behavior, but the author's response of complete disrespect and avoidance might be crossing a line. There's a difference between setting boundaries and showing no respect at all. The author could work on managing their interactions differently, perhaps by limiting time spent with the mother without being overtly disrespectful. \n\nIn conclusion, while the mother's actions are inexcusable, the author's approach of total disrespect might not be the right solution. The answer could lean towards the author being in the wrong (A) because of how they're handling the situation, but some might argue they're justified (B). Given societal norms, the expected answer might be A. However, the situation is complex. The user wants a clear A or B. Given that the author is actively disrespecting their mother, which is generally frowned upon, I think the answer is A.\n"
