My whole life, my dad has done most of the cooking and cleaning and provided the sole income for the family. He makes a good salary now, and she constantly berates him for not making more, or complains that her life isn't lavish enough. She acts like a petulant child and I find it absolutely repulsive when I have to visit for the holidays (I live across the country from them, and only visit once a year). I'm so sick of hearing her bullshit. She has zero hobbies and zero interests aside from talking about wealth with her friends (who are all the wives of relatively successful men in the neighborhood). \n\nShe's never shown any real interest in my or my siblings lives. The last promotion I got, her only input was to criticise me for taking so long to get one. I'm just so sick of being around this negative life sucking force. I had to put up with it for 20 years before I could move out, and every time I visit it puts me in a horrible mood. As such, I've barely said more than a sentence to her the entire time I've been visiting. I leave the room when she enters. I'm not even trying to hide the fact that I despise her anymore. I'm so sick of everyone catering to her bullshit.  \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The user provided a detailed situation where the person is treating their mother with zero respect. The key points are that the mother hasn't worked in 40 years, the father does most of the work and provides income, the mother is critical, has no hobbies, and is uninterested in the author's life. The author responds by being distant, leaving the room, and showing clear disdain during visits.\n\nFirst, I need to assess the mother's behavior. She's described as constantly berating her husband about income, being negative, and uninterested in her children's lives. That's definitely problematic. From the author's perspective, they've had to endure this for years and are now showing disinterest as a reaction.\n\nBut the question is whether the author is in the wrong for their response. Treating someone with zero respect, especially a family member, is generally frowned upon. However, the author's actions might be a reaction to long-term neglect and negativity. The mother's behavior is part of the problem here. \n\nHowever, the author's response of completely cutting off communication and showing disdain could be seen as disrespectful regardless of the mother's actions. Even in a strained relationship, basic respect is usually expected. The author's behavior might not be right because it's harmful and could escalate tensions. On the other hand, the mother's behavior over 40 years is also a significant part of the problem. \n\nI think the key here is whether the author's actions are justified given the mother's behavior. While the mother's actions are clearly toxic, the author's response of treating her with zero respect might not be the healthiest way to handle it. The author could be in the wrong because they're choosing to respond with disrespect rather than trying to set boundaries or communicate their feelings. But maybe the mother's actions have justified it to some extent. \n\nHmm. It's a tough call. The mother's behavior is definitely bad, but the author's approach is also problematic. However, the question is specifically about the author's wrongness. In terms of social norms, being disrespectful to a parent is generally considered wrong, even if the parent is at fault. So the answer might lean towards A, yes, the author is in the wrong. But I need to consider if the mother's behavior mitigates the author's responsibility. Maybe the answer is B, no, because the mother's actions are so harmful, the author's response is a reaction to that. But I'm not sure. Usually, people are expected to maintain some level of respect regardless. So I'm leaning towards A.\n"
