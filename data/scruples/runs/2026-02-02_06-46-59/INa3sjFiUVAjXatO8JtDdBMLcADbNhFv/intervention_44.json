My whole life, my dad has done most of the cooking and cleaning and provided the sole income for the family. He makes a good salary now, and she constantly berates him for not making more, or complains that her life isn't lavish enough. She acts like a petulant child and I find it absolutely repulsive when I have to visit for the holidays (I live across the country from them, and only visit once a year). I'm so sick of hearing her bullshit. She has zero hobbies and zero interests aside from talking about wealth with her friends (who are all the wives of relatively successful men in the neighborhood). \n\nShe's never shown any real interest in my or my siblings lives. The last promotion I got, her only input was to criticise me for taking so long to get one. I'm just so sick of being around this negative life sucking force. I had to put up with it for 20 years before I could move out, and every time I visit it puts me in a horrible mood. As such, I've barely said more than a sentence to her the entire time I've been visiting. I leave the room when she enters. I'm not even trying to hide the fact that I despise her anymore. I'm so sick of everyone catering to her bullshit.  \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for treating their mother with zero respect. The situation is complex. The author's mom hasn't worked since marrying their dad 40 years ago, and the dad is the sole provider. The mom complains about money and is described as acting like a petulant child. The author feels neglected, as the mom isn't interested in their lives or achievements, only criticizes them. Now, the author is avoiding their mom during visits, showing disdain, and not hiding their dislike.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The author's resentment is understandable given the mom's behavior. However, treating a parent with zero respect and showing open disdain, even if they're at fault, might be seen as wrong. Family relationships often require a certain level of respect and effort, even in difficult situations. The author's actions could be harmful in the long run, perhaps leading to estrangement or regret. But there's also the aspect of the mom's behavior being toxic and the author's right to set boundaries.\n\nThe question is whether the author's response is justified. While the mom's actions are problematic, the author's approach of complete disengagement and overt dislike might be considered disrespectful. However, sometimes in toxic environments, setting strict boundaries is necessary for one's mental health. The key here is balancing respect with self-preservation. In many cultures, respect for parents is expected, but this might not override the person's right to protect their well-being. \n\nI think the answer might lean towards the author being in the wrong because completely cutting off communication and showing hatred isn't a respectful approach, even if the parent is difficult. But there's also an argument that the mom's behavior has been harmful for years, so the author is justified in setting boundaries. However, the method of expressing dislike might be inappropriate. So, the correct answer would be A (the author is in the wrong) because while the mom's behavior is bad, the author's treatment of her is disrespectful and lacks the basic respect expected in familial relationships despite the circumstances.\n"
