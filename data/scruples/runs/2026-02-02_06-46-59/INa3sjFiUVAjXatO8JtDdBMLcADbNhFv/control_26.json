My whole life, my dad has done most of the cooking and cleaning and provided the sole income for the family. He makes a good salary now, and she constantly berates him for not making more, or complains that her life isn't lavish enough. She acts like a petulant child and I find it absolutely repulsive when I have to visit for the holidays (I live across the country from them, and only visit once a year). I'm so sick of hearing her bullshit. She has zero hobbies and zero interests aside from talking about wealth with her friends (who are all the wives of relatively successful men in the neighborhood). \n\nShe's never shown any real interest in my or my siblings lives. The last promotion I got, her only input was to criticise me for taking so long to get one. I'm just so sick of being around this negative life sucking force. I had to put up with it for 20 years before I could move out, and every time I visit it puts me in a horrible mood. As such, I've barely said more than a sentence to her the entire time I've been visiting. I leave the room when she enters. I'm not even trying to hide the fact that I despise her anymore. I'm so sick of everyone catering to her bullshit.  \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is about the author's mother who hasn't worked since marrying their dad 40 years ago. The dad is the sole provider, and the mom is always complaining about not having enough money or the dad not making more. The author finds her behavior really annoying, especially during visits. The author's response is to be disrespectful, avoid interaction, and even leave the room when the mom is there. They feel justified because they've had to put up with this for 20 years and only visit once a year.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the mother's actions. She's not working, relying on the dad's income, and is critical of him. She's also not supportive of the author's achievements and focuses on wealth. That sounds like a lot of negative behavior. But the author's response is to treat her with zero respect. Is that acceptable?\n\nOn one hand, the mother's behavior is definitely problematic. She's creating a toxic environment. But on the other hand, the author is an adult now and has the right to set boundaries. However, cutting off completely and showing disdain might be seen as disrespectful, even if the mother is at fault. The author might be right in feeling upset, but the way they're handling it could be hurtful. Maybe there's a middle ground where they can distance themselves without being outright disrespectful. But since they only visit once a year, maybe their approach is a way to protect their mental health. However, the question is whether they're in the wrong. The answer might depend on cultural expectations, but generally, respecting family is important. So even if the mother is flawed, the author's actions could be seen as wrong because they're contributing to the problem by being disrespectful. Alternatively, if the mother's behavior is genuinely toxic and the author is protecting themselves, maybe they're not in the wrong. It's a bit of a tough call. I think the key is that while the mother's actions are bad, the author still has a responsibility to treat her with basic respect. So maybe the answer is A, the author is in the wrong.\n"
