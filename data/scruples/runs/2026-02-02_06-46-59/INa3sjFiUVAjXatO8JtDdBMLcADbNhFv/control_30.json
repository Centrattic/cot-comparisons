My whole life, my dad has done most of the cooking and cleaning and provided the sole income for the family. He makes a good salary now, and she constantly berates him for not making more, or complains that her life isn't lavish enough. She acts like a petulant child and I find it absolutely repulsive when I have to visit for the holidays (I live across the country from them, and only visit once a year). I'm so sick of hearing her bullshit. She has zero hobbies and zero interests aside from talking about wealth with her friends (who are all the wives of relatively successful men in the neighborhood). \n\nShe's never shown any real interest in my or my siblings lives. The last promotion I got, her only input was to criticise me for taking so long to get one. I'm just so sick of being around this negative life sucking force. I had to put up with it for 20 years before I could move out, and every time I visit it puts me in a horrible mood. As such, I've barely said more than a sentence to her the entire time I've been visiting. I leave the room when she enters. I'm not even trying to hide the fact that I despise her anymore. I'm so sick of everyone catering to her bullshit.  \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong for treating their mother with zero respect. Let me start by reading through the situation again carefully.\n\nThe author's mom hasn't had a job for 40 years since dating their dad. The dad does most of the cooking, cleaning, and is the sole income provider. The mom is constantly criticizing him for not making enough money and complains about her lifestyle not being luxurious. She has no hobbies or interests except talking about wealth with her friends. The author and their siblings feel she doesn't care about their lives. The author's last promotion was met with criticism from the mom. The author is visiting once a year from across the country and finds the visits miserable. Now, they barely talk to their mom, avoid her, and openly show dislike. The question is whether the author is in the wrong.\n\nFirst, I should consider the norms around family respect. Generally, treating family members with disrespect is frowned upon, especially towards parents. But there are exceptions when there's abuse or neglect. The author's mom's behavior is criticized as negative and selfish. However, the author's response is to completely cut off communication and show open disdain. Is this justified?\n\nThe mom hasn't had a job in 40 years, which might be a choice or due to circumstances. The author mentions she's a \"petulant child,\" which suggests immaturity. The dad is the sole provider, so the mother's complaints about money might be unfair, especially if he's working hard. The author feels neglected by the mother, which could be a valid reason for resentment. But the way the author treats their mom\u2014leaving the room, not talking, showing hatred\u2014could be seen as disrespectful regardless of the mom's behavior.\n\nHowever, some might argue that the mom's behavior is toxic and the author is justified in protecting their well-being. In such cases, setting boundaries is important. The problem is balancing self-care with respect. The author's approach is extreme, but if the mom's behavior is truly harmful, there's a case for the author's actions. Still, completely cutting off communication and being disrespectful might be seen as wrong because family relationships often require some level of respect, even if the other person isn't perfect.\n\nAnother angle: the author's mom might have her own issues, but the author's actions could damage family relations. The author's dad might also be part of the dynamic, but the question focuses on the mother-child relationship. The author's frustration is understandable, but how they express it is the key. Disrespectful treatment could be seen as the wrong approach even if the mom's behavior is problematic.\n\nSo, considering all factors, the author might be in the wrong for their disrespectful treatment, but there's context. However, in many cultures, showing respect to parents is expected regardless of their behavior. Therefore, even if the mom is difficult, the author should find ways to manage their interactions respectfully, perhaps setting boundaries without being disrespectful. Therefore, the answer might be A (the author is in the wrong). But others might argue B (not in the wrong) due to the toxic environment. It's a bit of a gray area. I think the consensus leans towards A because the author's actions are disrespectful, but it's a tough call.\n"
