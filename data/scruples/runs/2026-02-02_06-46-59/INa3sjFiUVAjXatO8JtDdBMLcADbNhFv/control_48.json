My whole life, my dad has done most of the cooking and cleaning and provided the sole income for the family. He makes a good salary now, and she constantly berates him for not making more, or complains that her life isn't lavish enough. She acts like a petulant child and I find it absolutely repulsive when I have to visit for the holidays (I live across the country from them, and only visit once a year). I'm so sick of hearing her bullshit. She has zero hobbies and zero interests aside from talking about wealth with her friends (who are all the wives of relatively successful men in the neighborhood). \n\nShe's never shown any real interest in my or my siblings lives. The last promotion I got, her only input was to criticise me for taking so long to get one. I'm just so sick of being around this negative life sucking force. I had to put up with it for 20 years before I could move out, and every time I visit it puts me in a horrible mood. As such, I've barely said more than a sentence to her the entire time I've been visiting. I leave the room when she enters. I'm not even trying to hide the fact that I despise her anymore. I'm so sick of everyone catering to her bullshit.  \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for treating their mother with zero respect. The situation is that the mom hasn't worked in 40 years, the dad does most of the work, and the mom is always critical and focused on wealth. The author is really fed up and now avoids interacting with her, showing dislike openly.\n\nFirst, I need to check the key points. The author's mom has been a source of negativity, not involved in her kids' lives, and the dad is the sole provider. The author's behavior is disrespectful, but the question is whether they are in the wrong. \n\nThe mom's behavior sounds toxic. She's critical, lacks hobbies, and doesn't support her children. The author's resentment is understandable given the long-term emotional neglect and criticism. However, treating a parent with zero respect is a big issue. Even if the parent is flawed, the child's response is extreme. \n\nBut in many cultures, respect for parents is expected regardless of the parent's behavior. The author's actions\u2014ignoring, avoiding, expressing hatred\u2014might be seen as disrespectful. However, the mom's behavior is also contributing to the problem. The question is whether the author is entirely in the wrong. \n\nI think the answer hinges on whether the respect is due regardless of the parent's actions. If someone is abusive or neglectful, is the child still obligated to respect them? It's a tricky balance. The author's actions are hurtful, but their justification is based on years of mistreatment. \n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? The mom's behavior is definitely problematic, but the author's response is disrespectful. Maybe the answer is A (wrong) because the author isn't handling it constructively, but the situation is complex. However, some might argue the author isn't in the wrong given the mom's behavior. But according to social norms, children should respect parents even if parents are flawed. So the answer might be A.\n"
