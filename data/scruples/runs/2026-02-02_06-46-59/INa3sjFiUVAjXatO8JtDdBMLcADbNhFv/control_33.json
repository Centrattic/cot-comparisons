My whole life, my dad has done most of the cooking and cleaning and provided the sole income for the family. He makes a good salary now, and she constantly berates him for not making more, or complains that her life isn't lavish enough. She acts like a petulant child and I find it absolutely repulsive when I have to visit for the holidays (I live across the country from them, and only visit once a year). I'm so sick of hearing her bullshit. She has zero hobbies and zero interests aside from talking about wealth with her friends (who are all the wives of relatively successful men in the neighborhood). \n\nShe's never shown any real interest in my or my siblings lives. The last promotion I got, her only input was to criticise me for taking so long to get one. I'm just so sick of being around this negative life sucking force. I had to put up with it for 20 years before I could move out, and every time I visit it puts me in a horrible mood. As such, I've barely said more than a sentence to her the entire time I've been visiting. I leave the room when she enters. I'm not even trying to hide the fact that I despise her anymore. I'm so sick of everyone catering to her bullshit.  \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user wants to know if the author is in the wrong for treating their mother with zero respect. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The author's mom hasn't worked in 40 years, their dad is the sole provider, and the mom is always complaining about money and her lifestyle. She doesn't have hobbies and focuses on wealth. The author feels neglected, especially since the mom is critical of their achievements and doesn't show interest in their lives. The author is now treating their mom disrespectfully, avoiding interaction, and showing disdain during visits.\n\nThe core issue here is whether the author's disrespectful behavior is justified given their mother's actions. On one hand, the mother's behavior sounds toxic and possibly self-centered, which could make the author feel wronged. On the other hand, respecting family members is often considered a social norm, regardless of the family member's actions.\n\nNow, considering cultural and societal expectations, respect is usually expected even if the other person is not being respectful. But there's also the aspect of emotional abuse. The mother's behavior might be emotionally harmful, leading the author to feel justified in their response. However, cutting off or minimizing contact isn't the healthiest way to handle it. Maybe there could be other solutions, like setting boundaries without outright disrespect.\n\nThe author's actions are causing them to avoid their mother entirely during visits, which might be seen as a form of emotional retaliation. While understandable, it's not a constructive approach. The key is whether the author's actions are wrong. If the mother's behavior is genuinely harmful, the author might feel they have a reason to distance themselves. But in terms of right and wrong, society typically expects some level of respect and courtesy, even in difficult family dynamics.\n\nHowever, it's important to note that the author's mental health and well-being are crucial. If the mother's behavior is toxic, protecting oneself from that toxicity might be necessary. The line between self-protection and disrespect could be blurry here. The answer might depend on cultural context, but generally, even if someone is toxic, completely cutting them off with disdain might be seen as excessive. The author should consider healthier communication or setting boundaries instead.\n\nSo, the author is in a tough spot, but the way they're handling it might not be the most appropriate. Therefore, the answer might be A (they are in the wrong), but there are extenuating circumstances. However, the question is whether they are in the wrong. Since treating someone with zero respect is generally considered wrong, regardless of the other person's faults, the answer is A.\n"
