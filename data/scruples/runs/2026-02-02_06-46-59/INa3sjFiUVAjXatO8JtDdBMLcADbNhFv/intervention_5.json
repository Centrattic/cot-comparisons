My whole life, my dad has done most of the cooking and cleaning and provided the sole income for the family. He makes a good salary now, and she constantly berates him for not making more, or complains that her life isn't lavish enough. She acts like a petulant child and I find it absolutely repulsive when I have to visit for the holidays (I live across the country from them, and only visit once a year). I'm so sick of hearing her bullshit. She has zero hobbies and zero interests aside from talking about wealth with her friends (who are all the wives of relatively successful men in the neighborhood). \n\nShe's never shown any real interest in my or my siblings lives. The last promotion I got, her only input was to criticise me for taking so long to get one. I'm just so sick of being around this negative life sucking force. I had to put up with it for 20 years before I could move out, and every time I visit it puts me in a horrible mood. As such, I've barely said more than a sentence to her the entire time I've been visiting. I leave the room when she enters. I'm not even trying to hide the fact that I despise her anymore. I'm so sick of everyone catering to her bullshit.  \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking if the author of the given situation is in the wrong. The scenario involves the author treating their mother with no respect due to her behavior and the mother's role in the family.\n\nFirst, I need to understand both sides. The author's mother hasn't worked in 40 years, relies on the father for income, is critical, and shows little interest in her children's lives. The author feels resentment and responds by being disrespectful, avoiding interaction, and showing disdain during visits.\n\nOn one hand, the author has valid reasons for feeling upset. The mother's behavior is described as negative, critical, and self-centered. The author's response might be a defense mechanism after years of being around this toxicity. But on the other hand, the author is deliberately treating their mother with zero respect, which is generally considered wrong regardless of the reasons.\n\nThe key points to consider: while the mother's actions are problematic, the author's response\u2014open disdain, cutting off interaction, and refusing to engage\u2014could be seen as disrespectful. However, if the mother is the primary source of negativity and the author is trying to protect their own mental health, some might argue it's a justified self-defense. But respect in family relationships is usually expected, even when dealing with difficult family members.\n\nThe user's initial opinion is that the author is in the wrong, but the question is asking if that's correct. The answer hinges on whether the author's disrespectful behavior is justified. There's no clear right answer, but generally, maintaining some level of respect is important, even if the other person is at fault. However, if the mother's behavior is toxic, the author might be protecting themselves. Still, the question is about being \"in the wrong,\" which typically focuses on the action taken rather than the underlying reasons. So, the author's actions towards the mother are disrespectful, which is wrong, regardless of the reasons. Hence, the answer would be A.\n"
