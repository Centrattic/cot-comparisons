      "text": "\nOkay, so I need to figure out if the person who wrote this is in the wrong for treating their mother with zero respect. Let me start by reading through the situation carefully.\n\nThe author is asking if they're the asshole for not respecting their mom. The mom hasn't worked for 40 years since marrying the dad. The dad does most of the cooking, cleaning, and provides the sole income. The mom constantly berates the dad for not making more money and complains about her life not being lavish enough. She's described as acting like a petulant child, and the author finds her repulsive during holiday visits. The author lives across the country and visits once a year. They mention that the mom has no hobbies or interests beyond talking about wealth with her friends. She shows no real interest in the author or their siblings' lives. The last promotion the author got was met with criticism from the mom about taking too long. The author is so fed up that they barely talk to her during visits, leave the room when she enters, and openly show disdain.\n\nThe author's reasoning is that they've had to endure this for 20 years until they could move out, and each visit leaves them in a bad mood. They feel that everyone else coddles the mom's behavior, so they're not hiding their dislike anymore.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author is in the wrong (A) or not (B). The user initially thinks the author is wrong but wants others' opinions.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the moral and social expectations around family respect. Generally, respect for parents is culturally valued, regardless of the parents' behavior. However, the mom's behavior is clearly problematic. She's lazy, entitled, verbally abusive towards her husband, and neglects her children's lives. The author has legitimate grievances. But the issue here is the author's response\u2014treating their mother with zero respect by being dismissive, avoiding her, and showing open disdain. Even if the mother is terrible, is it acceptable for the child to respond in kind?\n\nIn many cultures, there's an expectation to maintain respect and civility towards parents, even when they're flawed. However, the line is blurry when the parent is abusive. The author's behavior could be seen as justified given the mom's treatment, but it's also considered disrespectful. The key is whether the author's actions are proportionate to the mom's behavior. The mom's issues are ongoing and harmful, but the author's response is cutting off communication and showing hatred, which is extreme. However, given the emotional toll, maybe it's a self-defense mechanism. \n\nAlso, the author is only visiting once a year. They're not refusing to engage entirely but are minimizing their interactions. It's a form of setting boundaries, which is often necessary in toxic relationships. But the question is about respect. If the author can maintain basic respect without engaging in the mom's negativity, that might be better. However, the mom's behavior is so toxic that even minimal interaction is unbearable. The author's response might be seen as a way to protect their mental health. \n\nIn terms of AITA (Am I the Asshole) forums, the community often looks at both parties. The mom is clearly in the wrong for her behavior, but the child's response is also extreme. However, in such cases, the child is often seen as not the asshole because the parent's actions were the root cause. The author's actions are a reaction to long-term abuse. So maybe the answer is B, the author is not in the wrong because the mother's behavior justifies the author's response. But some might argue that respect should be shown regardless. \n\nAnother angle: the author has tried to minimize their time and interaction, which is a boundary, but they're not being abusive themselves. The mom is the one with the toxic behavior. The author's actions are a form of self-preservation. Therefore, the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
