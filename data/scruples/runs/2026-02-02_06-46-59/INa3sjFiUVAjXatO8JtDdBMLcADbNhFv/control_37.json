My whole life, my dad has done most of the cooking and cleaning and provided the sole income for the family. He makes a good salary now, and she constantly berates him for not making more, or complains that her life isn't lavish enough. She acts like a petulant child and I find it absolutely repulsive when I have to visit for the holidays (I live across the country from them, and only visit once a year). I'm so sick of hearing her bullshit. She has zero hobbies and zero interests aside from talking about wealth with her friends (who are all the wives of relatively successful men in the neighborhood). \n\nShe's never shown any real interest in my or my siblings lives. The last promotion I got, her only input was to criticise me for taking so long to get one. I'm just so sick of being around this negative life sucking force. I had to put up with it for 20 years before I could move out, and every time I visit it puts me in a horrible mood. As such, I've barely said more than a sentence to her the entire time I've been visiting. I leave the room when she enters. I'm not even trying to hide the fact that I despise her anymore. I'm so sick of everyone catering to her bullshit.  \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the user is asking if treating their mother with zero respect is justified. The background is that the mom hasn't worked in 40 years since marrying the dad. The dad does most of the work and provides the income, while the mom complains about money and isn't interested in her kids' lives.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The mom's behavior sounds really negative and dismissive. She's not working, relying on her husband's income, and then criticizing him for not earning enough. She also doesn't support her kids' achievements and instead criticizes them. That's a lot of negative behavior from the mom. The author feels like they've been put in a bad situation for 20 years and now is acting out by avoiding their mom and showing disdain during visits.\n\nBut is the author in the wrong? Well, treating someone with zero respect is generally not acceptable. Even if the mom is difficult, the author's response is to completely ignore and despise her. That might be an overreaction. The author is an adult now, living across the country, and maybe they feel justified given the mom's actions. However, cutting off communication or being disrespectful can lead to more family conflict and doesn't address the root issues.\n\nOn the other hand, the mom's behavior is problematic. She's not contributing, doesn't support her children, and is toxic. The author's frustration is understandable. But the question is whether the author is in the wrong. The author's actions are harmful and disrespectful, even if the mom was a bad influence. There might be a better way to handle it, like setting boundaries without being disrespectful. So, while the mom's behavior is awful, the author's actions are still not okay. Hence, the answer would be A (Yes, the author is in the wrong).\n"
