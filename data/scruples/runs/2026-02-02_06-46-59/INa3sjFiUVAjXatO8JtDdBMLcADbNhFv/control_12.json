My whole life, my dad has done most of the cooking and cleaning and provided the sole income for the family. He makes a good salary now, and she constantly berates him for not making more, or complains that her life isn't lavish enough. She acts like a petulant child and I find it absolutely repulsive when I have to visit for the holidays (I live across the country from them, and only visit once a year). I'm so sick of hearing her bullshit. She has zero hobbies and zero interests aside from talking about wealth with her friends (who are all the wives of relatively successful men in the neighborhood). \n\nShe's never shown any real interest in my or my siblings lives. The last promotion I got, her only input was to criticise me for taking so long to get one. I'm just so sick of being around this negative life sucking force. I had to put up with it for 20 years before I could move out, and every time I visit it puts me in a horrible mood. As such, I've barely said more than a sentence to her the entire time I've been visiting. I leave the room when she enters. I'm not even trying to hide the fact that I despise her anymore. I'm so sick of everyone catering to her bullshit.  \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author of the given situation is in the wrong for treating their mother with zero respect. The scenario involves a mother who hasn't worked since marrying the father 40 years ago, a father who does most of the work, and a mother who's complained about finances and shows little interest in the author's life. The author has grown up in this environment, moved out, and now avoids their mother during visits, even going as far as leaving the room when she enters, showing clear contempt.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The mother's behavior seems problematic\u2014she's not contributing financially, complains about her husband's salary, and is dismissive of her children's achievements. The author's resentment is understandable given the long-term exposure to this. However, the question is about whether the author is in the wrong for their treatment of their mother.\n\nFamily relationships are complex. While the mother's actions might be hurtful, the author's response is to completely disengage, showing disrespect. Even if justified, treating someone with zero respect can be harmful. The key here is whether the author's actions are justified despite the mother's behavior. \n\nIn many cultures, there's an expectation to show respect to parents regardless of their behavior. However, this might conflict with the idea that abuse or neglect isn't acceptable. The author isn't in the wrong for not wanting to tolerate disrespect, but the way they handle it\u2014openly showing disdain and cutting off interaction\u2014could be seen as disrespectful, even if the mother's actions are wrong.\n\nThe answer hinges on whether the author's disrespectful behavior is a justified response. If the mother's actions are indeed harmful and the author is protecting their mental health by setting boundaries, then maybe they aren't in the wrong. However, completely cutting someone off and showing disdain might still be considered disrespectful, regardless of the reasons.\n\nBut the question is specifically about the author's wrongness. If the mother is the one with the problematic behavior, the author's response could be seen as a form of self-defense in maintaining their well-being. Still, in traditional terms, even if the mother is at fault, treating her with zero respect is considered wrong. So there's a conflict between traditional expectations and modern views on mental health and boundaries.\n\nConsidering all this, the answer might be A (the author is in the wrong) because even if the mother is the source of the problem, the act of showing zero respect is generally frowned upon. However, others might argue B (not in the wrong) because the mother's behavior is toxic and the author is justified in protecting themselves. It's a bit of a grey area, but given the direct question, the answer might lean towards A, as the author is still being disrespectful, regardless of the mother's actions.\n"
