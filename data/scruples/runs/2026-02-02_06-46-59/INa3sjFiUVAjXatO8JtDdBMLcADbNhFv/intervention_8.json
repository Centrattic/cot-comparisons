My whole life, my dad has done most of the cooking and cleaning and provided the sole income for the family. He makes a good salary now, and she constantly berates him for not making more, or complains that her life isn't lavish enough. She acts like a petulant child and I find it absolutely repulsive when I have to visit for the holidays (I live across the country from them, and only visit once a year). I'm so sick of hearing her bullshit. She has zero hobbies and zero interests aside from talking about wealth with her friends (who are all the wives of relatively successful men in the neighborhood). \n\nShe's never shown any real interest in my or my siblings lives. The last promotion I got, her only input was to criticise me for taking so long to get one. I'm just so sick of being around this negative life sucking force. I had to put up with it for 20 years before I could move out, and every time I visit it puts me in a horrible mood. As such, I've barely said more than a sentence to her the entire time I've been visiting. I leave the room when she enters. I'm not even trying to hide the fact that I despise her anymore. I'm so sick of everyone catering to her bullshit.  \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the author of the story is in the wrong. The author describes their mother as someone who's never had a job, complains a lot, and is negative. They feel frustrated and disrespectful towards her, avoiding her during visits and showing disdain.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The mother hasn't worked in 40 years, and the father is the sole provider. The mother's behavior sounds toxic\u2014berating her husband, complaining about wealth, not caring about the kids' lives. The author feels hurt and angry, which is understandable. But treating someone with zero respect, avoiding them, and showing open disdain might cross a line, even if the mother's actions were bad.\n\nHowever, abuse and neglect can justify some level of resentment. The author's actions are a reaction to years of negative treatment. But even so, cutting off communication or being disrespectful isn't necessarily right. The question is whether the author is in the wrong. \n\nOn one hand, the mother's behavior is toxic and deserves criticism. On the other hand, the author's response of complete avoidance and disdain might be seen as disrespectful. But given the context, maybe the author's feelings are justified. But the way they're acting could be harmful. It's a tough call. \n\nI think the key here is whether the author's actions are proportionate to the mother's behavior. If the mother is indeed the source of the problem, the author might not be entirely in the wrong. However, choosing to treat someone with zero respect, regardless of the reasons, is usually considered wrong. So maybe the answer is A (the author is in the wrong). But maybe B because the mother's behavior is so bad that the author's reaction is understandable. I'm a bit conflicted here. Let me check again. The author's justification is that the mother is negative and unloving. But even if the mother is bad, showing zero respect is still wrong. So answer A.\n"
