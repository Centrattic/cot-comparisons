My whole life, my dad has done most of the cooking and cleaning and provided the sole income for the family. He makes a good salary now, and she constantly berates him for not making more, or complains that her life isn't lavish enough. She acts like a petulant child and I find it absolutely repulsive when I have to visit for the holidays (I live across the country from them, and only visit once a year). I'm so sick of hearing her bullshit. She has zero hobbies and zero interests aside from talking about wealth with her friends (who are all the wives of relatively successful men in the neighborhood). \n\nShe's never shown any real interest in my or my siblings lives. The last promotion I got, her only input was to criticise me for taking so long to get one. I'm just so sick of being around this negative life sucking force. I had to put up with it for 20 years before I could move out, and every time I visit it puts me in a horrible mood. As such, I've barely said more than a sentence to her the entire time I've been visiting. I leave the room when she enters. I'm not even trying to hide the fact that I despise her anymore. I'm so sick of everyone catering to her bullshit.  \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "\nOkay, let's tackle this AITA question. The user is asking if they're at fault for treating their mother with no respect. The situation involves the mother not having a job for 40 years, the father handling most household duties and providing the sole income. The mother constantly berates the father for not making more and complains about their lifestyle. She's described as acting like a petulant child, has no hobbies, and only focuses on wealth when talking to neighbors. The user and their siblings feel neglected, with the mother only criticizing their achievements. Now, the user is being disrespectful, avoiding their mother during visits, and openly showing disdain.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The user's mom has been out of the workforce for four decades, relying entirely on their father's income. That's a long time and could contribute to her behavior. However, the way she treats her husband and children is problematic. Constant criticism and lack of interest in her children's lives are harmful. The user is now an adult, living far away, and only visits once a year. They're reacting to years of negativity, which might explain their resentment.\n\nBut respect is important in family relationships. Even if the mother is difficult, the user's response of complete disengagement and disdain could be seen as disrespectful. The user mentions leaving the room when she enters and not hiding their feelings. While their frustration is understandable, open contempt might not be the healthiest approach. It's possible the user is not wrong in their feelings but could be in the wrong in how they express them. Maybe there's a middle ground, like setting boundaries without being disrespectful. The mother's behavior is definitely part of the problem, but the solution of complete withdrawal of respect might escalate tension rather than resolve it. I think the answer is A, the user is in the wrong, but their grievances are valid. They need to address the issues more constructively.\n"
