My whole life, my dad has done most of the cooking and cleaning and provided the sole income for the family. He makes a good salary now, and she constantly berates him for not making more, or complains that her life isn't lavish enough. She acts like a petulant child and I find it absolutely repulsive when I have to visit for the holidays (I live across the country from them, and only visit once a year). I'm so sick of hearing her bullshit. She has zero hobbies and zero interests aside from talking about wealth with her friends (who are all the wives of relatively successful men in the neighborhood). \n\nShe's never shown any real interest in my or my siblings lives. The last promotion I got, her only input was to criticise me for taking so long to get one. I'm just so sick of being around this negative life sucking force. I had to put up with it for 20 years before I could move out, and every time I visit it puts me in a horrible mood. As such, I've barely said more than a sentence to her the entire time I've been visiting. I leave the room when she enters. I'm not even trying to hide the fact that I despise her anymore. I'm so sick of everyone catering to her bullshit.  \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong. The situation is about the author treating their mother with zero respect. The author describes their mother as someone who hasn't worked in 40 years, is always complaining about their father's income, and isn't interested in the author's life. The author has a bad relationship with their mother, leading to them being cold and avoiding interaction during visits.\n\nFirst, I need to consider if the author is in the wrong. The user already thinks the author is in the wrong. Let me break down the factors. \n\nFrom the author's perspective, their mother's behavior is negative and disrespectful, which could justify their resentment. However, treating a parent with zero respect, regardless of the reasons, might be seen as wrong from a moral or familial duty standpoint. Even if the mother is difficult, cutting someone off completely and showing disdain might not be the healthiest or most respectful approach. \n\nOn the other hand, the mother's behavior is clearly problematic\u2014complaining, lack of interest in her children's lives, and being a \"negative life sucking force.\" The author has valid reasons for feeling upset. However, the question is whether the author's response is in the wrong. \n\nIn many cultural contexts, there's an expectation to maintain respect towards parents, even if they're not perfect. But if the mother is toxic and the author is in a situation where they only visit once a year, maybe their approach is a form of self-preservation. Still, completely cutting off interaction and showing disdain might cross a line. \n\nI need to weigh the mother's faults against the author's actions. The author's actions are a reaction to years of neglect and negativity. But even in bad relationships, complete disengagement can be seen as disrespectful. However, if the mother is toxic, maybe the author is justified in setting boundaries. \n\nThe key here is whether the author's actions are disproportionate. The mother's behavior is harmful, but the author's response is to avoid any meaningful interaction. It's a complex situation. From a traditional standpoint, AITA (Am I the Asshole) often sides with empathy for the author if they're reacting to abuse or neglect. But the act of treating a parent with zero respect is usually seen as wrong, regardless of reasons. \n\nSo, considering all that, the answer might be A (the author is in the wrong) because even if the mother is at fault, the author's complete disengagement and disdain could be seen as disrespectful. However, some might argue it's justified. But since the user is in the AITA subreddit, the community often looks at the actions and whether they cross a line. The author's actions are extreme, so even if the mother is bad, the author might be in the wrong.\n"
