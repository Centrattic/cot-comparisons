My whole life, my dad has done most of the cooking and cleaning and provided the sole income for the family. He makes a good salary now, and she constantly berates him for not making more, or complains that her life isn't lavish enough. She acts like a petulant child and I find it absolutely repulsive when I have to visit for the holidays (I live across the country from them, and only visit once a year). I'm so sick of hearing her bullshit. She has zero hobbies and zero interests aside from talking about wealth with her friends (who are all the wives of relatively successful men in the neighborhood). \n\nShe's never shown any real interest in my or my siblings lives. The last promotion I got, her only input was to criticise me for taking so long to get one. I'm just so sick of being around this negative life sucking force. I had to put up with it for 20 years before I could move out, and every time I visit it puts me in a horrible mood. As such, I've barely said more than a sentence to her the entire time I've been visiting. I leave the room when she enters. I'm not even trying to hide the fact that I despise her anymore. I'm so sick of everyone catering to her bullshit.  \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's dive into this. The user is asking whether the author of the given situation is in the wrong for treating their mother with zero respect. They provided the scenario where the mother has been a source of negativity, not contributing to household responsibilities, and being emotionally distant. The author now avoids interaction and shows open disdain.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The mother hasn't worked in 40 years, the father does most of the work, and the mother is critical and uninterested in her children's lives. The author feels resentful and has developed a negative attitude towards her. The key issue here is whether treating someone with total disrespect is justified based on their behavior.\n\nOn one hand, family relationships often require respect, even if the other person isn't perfect. Disrespect can lead to further conflict and emotional harm. The mother's behavior might be problematic, but the author's response of complete avoidance and hostility might not resolve the issue and could damage the familial bond further.\n\nOn the other hand, the author's experience is valid. Being in a toxic environment can take a toll, and their mental health is a concern. They might be protecting themselves from emotional harm. However, cutting off completely might not be the healthiest approach either. There might be a middle ground where the author can set boundaries without total disrespect.\n\nBut the question is whether they are \"in the wrong.\" In many cultures, respect for parents is emphasized, but that doesn't mean one must tolerate abuse. The mother's actions\u2014being critical, uninvolved, and emotionally neglectful\u2014might contribute to the author's justified frustration. However, the way the author is handling it (leaving the room, showing disdain) isn't constructive. They might need to address the issues through communication or set boundaries without total disrespect.\n\nI'm leaning towards the author being in the wrong because treating a parent with complete disrespect isn't healthy, even if the parent has flaws. There's a responsibility to maintain some level of respect, even if it's difficult. The mother's behavior is indeed problematic, but the author's response might not be the best way to handle it. They could seek to address the issues without being openly disrespectful, perhaps through setting limits or having honest conversations. So, the answer would be A (Yes, the author is in the wrong).\n"
