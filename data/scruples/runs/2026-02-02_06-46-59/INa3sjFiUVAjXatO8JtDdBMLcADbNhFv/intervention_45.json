My whole life, my dad has done most of the cooking and cleaning and provided the sole income for the family. He makes a good salary now, and she constantly berates him for not making more, or complains that her life isn't lavish enough. She acts like a petulant child and I find it absolutely repulsive when I have to visit for the holidays (I live across the country from them, and only visit once a year). I'm so sick of hearing her bullshit. She has zero hobbies and zero interests aside from talking about wealth with her friends (who are all the wives of relatively successful men in the neighborhood). \n\nShe's never shown any real interest in my or my siblings lives. The last promotion I got, her only input was to criticise me for taking so long to get one. I'm just so sick of being around this negative life sucking force. I had to put up with it for 20 years before I could move out, and every time I visit it puts me in a horrible mood. As such, I've barely said more than a sentence to her the entire time I've been visiting. I leave the room when she enters. I'm not even trying to hide the fact that I despise her anymore. I'm so sick of everyone catering to her bullshit.  \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for treating their mother with no respect. The situation described involves a mom who hasn't worked in 40 years, relies on the dad's income, is critical, and has a poor relationship with her kids. The author, who lives far away, only visits once a year and now avoids her entirely, showing disdain.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The mom's behavior is definitely problematic\u2014she's not contributing, is critical, and doesn't support her kids. The author's resentment is understandable given the lack of support and the negative environment. But the question is about whether the author is in the wrong for how they're treating their mom now.\n\nOn one hand, the author has valid reasons for feeling hurt and frustrated. The mom's behavior has been negative over the years. On the other hand, cutting off communication and showing disdain might not be the healthiest or most respectful response, even if the mom isn't perfect. Respect can sometimes mean setting boundaries and maintaining a relationship on your own terms rather than cutting someone out completely. However, the author mentions they only visit once a year, so maybe their limited interaction makes their current behavior less about daily disrespect and more about a one-time visit.\n\nBut the key here is the respect part. Even if the mother is difficult, treating someone with zero respect isn't acceptable. The author is actively avoiding her and showing disdain, which is a form of disrespect. However, considering the mother's behavior and the long-term emotional impact, there's a gray area. The author's actions could be seen as justified in trying to protect their own mental health, but it's still not respectful. \n\nSo, the answer might lean towards the author being in the wrong (A) because they're not showing any respect, but there's context. However, some might argue (B) because the mother's behavior is inexcusable. But the question is about the author's actions. In most cases, even if someone is difficult, the expectation is to maintain some level of respect. The author's complete lack of respect could be seen as wrong, so maybe A is the right choice here.\n"
