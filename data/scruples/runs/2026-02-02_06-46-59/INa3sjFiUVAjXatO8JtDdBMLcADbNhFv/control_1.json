My whole life, my dad has done most of the cooking and cleaning and provided the sole income for the family. He makes a good salary now, and she constantly berates him for not making more, or complains that her life isn't lavish enough. She acts like a petulant child and I find it absolutely repulsive when I have to visit for the holidays (I live across the country from them, and only visit once a year). I'm so sick of hearing her bullshit. She has zero hobbies and zero interests aside from talking about wealth with her friends (who are all the wives of relatively successful men in the neighborhood). \n\nShe's never shown any real interest in my or my siblings lives. The last promotion I got, her only input was to criticise me for taking so long to get one. I'm just so sick of being around this negative life sucking force. I had to put up with it for 20 years before I could move out, and every time I visit it puts me in a horrible mood. As such, I've barely said more than a sentence to her the entire time I've been visiting. I leave the room when she enters. I'm not even trying to hide the fact that I despise her anymore. I'm so sick of everyone catering to her bullshit.  \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "\nOkay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong for treating their mother with zero respect. Let me start by breaking down the situation. The user's mom hasn't worked since she started dating the dad 40 years ago. The dad has been the sole provider for most of the author's life, handling cooking and cleaning. The mom is always complaining about the dad's income and wants a more lavish lifestyle. She's also described as acting like a petulant child and not showing interest in the author's or their siblings' lives. The author has been avoiding their mom during visits, barely talking, and leaving the room when she enters.\n\nFirst, I should consider the ethical and social norms around family relationships. Respect for parents is often emphasized in many cultures, so treating a mother with zero respect might be seen as wrong. But then, the mom's behavior is also problematic. She's unemployable for 40 years, which could imply she's choosing not to work, and she's constantly negative and critical. The author feels this is a \"negative life-sucking force,\" which shows significant emotional distress.\n\nI need to weigh both sides. The mom's actions: not working, relying on her husband, complaining about money, ignoring her children's lives. The author's response: disengaging, showing disdain, avoiding interaction. The key question is whether the author's disrespectful behavior is justified given their mother's actions. In many cases, people might expect a child to maintain some level of respect and politeness, even if the parent is difficult. However, the author's description of their mother's behavior as repulsive and the emotional impact suggests long-term stress and possible justification for their reaction.\n\nBut is it right to show zero respect? Even if the mother is difficult, completely cutting her out of the interaction could be seen as disrespectful. The author might be reacting out of hurt, but the way they handle it\u2014leaving the room, not engaging\u2014could be causing more harm. The dad's situation is also a factor; he's providing all the income, which might be a point of tension. However, the author's treatment of their mother is the focus here. On the other hand, the mother's lack of support and constant criticism might have eroded the author's patience, leading to a justified emotional response. But in terms of right or wrong, respecting one's parents is generally expected, regardless of the parents' behavior. So while the mother is clearly at fault for her actions, the author's response of complete disengagement and disdain might still be considered wrong because it's harmful to the family relationship and possibly disrespectful. The answer might be A, the author is in the wrong, because no matter the mother's faults, treating her with zero respect is not acceptable. Alternatively, if the mother's behavior is extreme and the author is protecting their mental health, some might argue it's justified, making the answer B. I think the consensus here would be that the author is in the wrong because they should still maintain respect, even if they can't tolerate their mother's behavior. The correct answer is A.\n"
