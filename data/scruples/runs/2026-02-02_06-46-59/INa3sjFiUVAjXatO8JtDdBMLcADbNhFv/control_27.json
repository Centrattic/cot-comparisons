My whole life, my dad has done most of the cooking and cleaning and provided the sole income for the family. He makes a good salary now, and she constantly berates him for not making more, or complains that her life isn't lavish enough. She acts like a petulant child and I find it absolutely repulsive when I have to visit for the holidays (I live across the country from them, and only visit once a year). I'm so sick of hearing her bullshit. She has zero hobbies and zero interests aside from talking about wealth with her friends (who are all the wives of relatively successful men in the neighborhood). \n\nShe's never shown any real interest in my or my siblings lives. The last promotion I got, her only input was to criticise me for taking so long to get one. I'm just so sick of being around this negative life sucking force. I had to put up with it for 20 years before I could move out, and every time I visit it puts me in a horrible mood. As such, I've barely said more than a sentence to her the entire time I've been visiting. I leave the room when she enters. I'm not even trying to hide the fact that I despise her anymore. I'm so sick of everyone catering to her bullshit.  \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The question is about whether treating their mother with zero respect is acceptable based on the situation described.\n\nFirst, the user's mother has been without a job for 40 years since marrying their dad. The dad does all the work, financially and domestically. The mom constantly complains about the dad's income and her lifestyle, and she's described as acting like a \"petulant child.\" The author also mentions that the mother isn't interested in their lives and criticizes them, like commenting on the user's promotion. The user has been visiting once a year and is now giving their mother the cold shoulder, avoiding her, and showing disdain. They feel this is justified after 20 years of putting up with her behavior.\n\nNow, considering respect in family dynamics. Even if someone's behavior is frustrating or toxic, does that justify treating them with zero respect? The user's actions are pretty extreme: leaving the room when she enters, not engaging, showing open dislike. While the mother's actions are clearly problematic\u2014selfish, unappreciative, neglectful\u2014does that give the user the right to respond in such a disrespectful manner?\n\nThere's a balance here. The user might feel justified because of the mother's behavior, but cutting off communication entirely and showing contempt could have its own issues. However, the mother isn't a victim here; she's contributing to the toxic environment. The user's response is a form of self-preservation. But maybe the user could have found a more respectful way to set boundaries without being openly disrespectful. However, given the mother's lack of interest in the user's life and her negative behavior, the user might feel that respect isn't a two-way street anymore. \n\nIn many cases, it's argued that respect should be given regardless of the other person's behavior, but in toxic relationships, self-care is also important. The user is in a position where they can't control the mother's behavior, so setting boundaries is understandable. However, completely cutting off communication might be too harsh, but maybe not entirely wrong given the circumstances. \n\nSo, considering all that, the answer might be B (Not in the wrong) because the mother's behavior is extremely toxic, and the user is trying to protect their own mental health. However, there's a nuance here. While the mother's actions are awful, completely dismissing her without any effort to communicate could be seen as disrespectful. But given the context, the user's actions are a reaction to years of poor treatment. I think the answer leans towards B.\n"
