My whole life, my dad has done most of the cooking and cleaning and provided the sole income for the family. He makes a good salary now, and she constantly berates him for not making more, or complains that her life isn't lavish enough. She acts like a petulant child and I find it absolutely repulsive when I have to visit for the holidays (I live across the country from them, and only visit once a year). I'm so sick of hearing her bullshit. She has zero hobbies and zero interests aside from talking about wealth with her friends (who are all the wives of relatively successful men in the neighborhood). \n\nShe's never shown any real interest in my or my siblings lives. The last promotion I got, her only input was to criticise me for taking so long to get one. I'm just so sick of being around this negative life sucking force. I had to put up with it for 20 years before I could move out, and every time I visit it puts me in a horrible mood. As such, I've barely said more than a sentence to her the entire time I've been visiting. I leave the room when she enters. I'm not even trying to hide the fact that I despise her anymore. I'm so sick of everyone catering to her bullshit.  \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to work through this. The user is asking whether the author of the given situation is in the wrong. The scenario involves a person who treats their mother with zero respect during visits, due to their mom's behavior.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The author's mom hasn't worked since marrying the dad 40 years ago. The dad handles most of the household duties and the income. The mom is described as complaining about money, being a \"petulant child,\" and not interested in the author's or siblings' lives. The author feels frustrated and has been avoiding interaction, even showing dislike openly during visits.\n\nNow, the question is about whether the author is in the wrong. Let's consider the ethical and emotional aspects. The author's actions\u2014talking very little, leaving the room, showing disdain\u2014are clearly disrespectful. From a societal perspective, especially in many cultures, there's an expectation to show respect to parents regardless of their behavior. So, even if the mother is difficult, the son's approach could be seen as wrong because it's hurtful and lacks basic respect.\n\nHowever, the mother's behavior is also problematic. She's been neglecting her family's welfare, not contributing, and being negative. The author might feel justified in their actions because of the emotional harm they've experienced. But in terms of right and wrong, the act of treating someone with zero respect is typically considered wrong, regardless of the reasons. It's more about how to handle the situation constructively rather than lashing out.\n\nAlso, considering the author's age and independence, maybe they have a right to set boundaries. But the method they're using is disrespectful. A more constructive approach would be to distance oneself emotionally without being openly disrespectful. So the author might not be entirely in the wrong in feeling frustrated, but their actions are definitely on the wrong side.\n\nSo, the answer would be A, the author is in the wrong, but there's nuance here. The mother's behavior is terrible, but the son's response is still inappropriate.\n"
