My whole life, my dad has done most of the cooking and cleaning and provided the sole income for the family. He makes a good salary now, and she constantly berates him for not making more, or complains that her life isn't lavish enough. She acts like a petulant child and I find it absolutely repulsive when I have to visit for the holidays (I live across the country from them, and only visit once a year). I'm so sick of hearing her bullshit. She has zero hobbies and zero interests aside from talking about wealth with her friends (who are all the wives of relatively successful men in the neighborhood). \n\nShe's never shown any real interest in my or my siblings lives. The last promotion I got, her only input was to criticise me for taking so long to get one. I'm just so sick of being around this negative life sucking force. I had to put up with it for 20 years before I could move out, and every time I visit it puts me in a horrible mood. As such, I've barely said more than a sentence to her the entire time I've been visiting. I leave the room when she enters. I'm not even trying to hide the fact that I despise her anymore. I'm so sick of everyone catering to her bullshit.  \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for treating their mother with zero respect. The scenario describes a situation where the mother hasn't worked in 40 years, the father is the sole provider, the mother is complained about the finances and is seen as negative and uninterested in her children's lives. The author has moved out but visits once a year and treats their mom poorly, avoiding interaction and showing disdain.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the moral and social expectations around family relationships. Disrespecting a parent, especially a mother, is generally frowned upon in many cultures. The author's behavior\u2014avoiding conversation, showing contempt, and not hiding their disdain\u2014could be seen as disrespectful regardless of the mother's actions.\n\nBut there's also context. The mother's behavior is portrayed as neglectful and negative. She doesn't have hobbies, complains about money, and gives negative comments to her children. The author has had to endure this for 20 years before moving out. The stress and emotional toll might be significant. However, even if someone's actions are hurtful, the response of the child might not excuse their disrespectful behavior. \n\nThe question is whether the author's disrespectful treatment is justified. In some perspectives, everyone deserves basic respect, regardless of their actions. The mother might not be a perfect parent, but the child's complete lack of respect and deliberate avoidance could be seen as wrong. On the other hand, if the mother's actions have caused long-term emotional harm, the child's resentment might be understandable, but doesn't necessarily justify the disrespectful behavior.\n\nIt's a bit of a gray area. Some might argue that the author has every right to set boundaries and protect their mental health, especially after years of negative interactions. Others might say that even in difficult situations, showing respect is important for family dynamics and personal ethics. The answer hinges on whether the author's actions cross the line into disrespect, regardless of their mother's faults. I think the answer leans towards A (the author is in the wrong) because respect is expected in family relationships, even when there are issues. However, the context is important, and some might argue B. But the question is whether the author is in the wrong, and the disrespectful behavior is a key point here.\n"
