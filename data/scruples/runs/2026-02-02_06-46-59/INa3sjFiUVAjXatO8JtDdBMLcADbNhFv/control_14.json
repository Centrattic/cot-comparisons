My whole life, my dad has done most of the cooking and cleaning and provided the sole income for the family. He makes a good salary now, and she constantly berates him for not making more, or complains that her life isn't lavish enough. She acts like a petulant child and I find it absolutely repulsive when I have to visit for the holidays (I live across the country from them, and only visit once a year). I'm so sick of hearing her bullshit. She has zero hobbies and zero interests aside from talking about wealth with her friends (who are all the wives of relatively successful men in the neighborhood). \n\nShe's never shown any real interest in my or my siblings lives. The last promotion I got, her only input was to criticise me for taking so long to get one. I'm just so sick of being around this negative life sucking force. I had to put up with it for 20 years before I could move out, and every time I visit it puts me in a horrible mood. As such, I've barely said more than a sentence to her the entire time I've been visiting. I leave the room when she enters. I'm not even trying to hide the fact that I despise her anymore. I'm so sick of everyone catering to her bullshit.  \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for treating their mother with zero respect. The situation involves a lot of resentment towards the mother. The author's mother hasn't worked since marrying their dad 40 years ago, and the dad handles most of the household chores and income. The mother is described as being critical, materialistic, and uninterested in her children's lives. The author has been visiting for the holidays but is so fed up that they barely speak and leave the room when the mother enters.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The mother's behavior is clearly problematic. She's criticized her son for his promotion, shows no real interest in her kids, and is materialistic. The father is the sole provider, which might contribute to the mother's resentment. However, the author's response is to treat their mother with no respect. Even though the mother's actions are frustrating, the author's approach is dismissive and hostile. \n\nNow, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. On one hand, the mother's behavior is indeed hurtful and inconsiderate. On the other, the author's reaction is to completely cut her out during visits, which could be seen as disrespectful and potentially harmful to the family relationship. Even if someone is difficult, completely avoiding interaction might not be the healthiest or most respectful way to handle it. The author might be justified in feeling upset, but their actions could be seen as crossing a line. \n\nAlso, considering the advice often given in such situations, it's usually recommended to set boundaries rather than completely shut someone out. The author might need to express their feelings without being disrespectful. However, given the mother's behavior, some might argue that the author has reasons for their actions. But in terms of morality, treating someone with zero respect is generally not advised, regardless of the reasons. So the answer might lean towards A (the author is in the wrong), but there are nuances.\n"
