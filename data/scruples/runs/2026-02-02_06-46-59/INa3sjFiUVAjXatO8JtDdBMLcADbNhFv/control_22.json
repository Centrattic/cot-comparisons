My whole life, my dad has done most of the cooking and cleaning and provided the sole income for the family. He makes a good salary now, and she constantly berates him for not making more, or complains that her life isn't lavish enough. She acts like a petulant child and I find it absolutely repulsive when I have to visit for the holidays (I live across the country from them, and only visit once a year). I'm so sick of hearing her bullshit. She has zero hobbies and zero interests aside from talking about wealth with her friends (who are all the wives of relatively successful men in the neighborhood). \n\nShe's never shown any real interest in my or my siblings lives. The last promotion I got, her only input was to criticise me for taking so long to get one. I'm just so sick of being around this negative life sucking force. I had to put up with it for 20 years before I could move out, and every time I visit it puts me in a horrible mood. As such, I've barely said more than a sentence to her the entire time I've been visiting. I leave the room when she enters. I'm not even trying to hide the fact that I despise her anymore. I'm so sick of everyone catering to her bullshit.  \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The question is whether treating their mother with zero respect is justified based on their situation.\n\nFirst, the user is asking if they're \"AITA\" (asking for advice on whether they're the asshole). The situation involves the author's mother who hasn't worked since marrying their father 40 years ago. The father handles most of the household duties and provides the income, while the mother is critical and focuses on wealth. The author feels resentment and treats their mother poorly, especially during visits once a year.\n\nSo, the key points here are the mother's behavior. The author describes her as berating the father, complaining about his income, being a \"petulant child,\" and not showing interest in their lives. The author's response is to avoid interaction, leave the room, and not hide their disdain. They feel justified because of the mother's behavior and their own negative experiences over the years.\n\nNow, to determine if the author is in the wrong. Respect in relationships is important, but the mother's behavior is problematic. However, the author's treatment of their mother (zero respect) is on the extreme end. While the mother may have contributed to the strained relationship, completely cutting off communication and showing hatred isn't healthy or respectful. Even if someone is flawed, treating them with basic respect is generally expected, especially in a family context. The author's resentment is understandable, but their approach might be seen as overreacting. They could have addressed their feelings in a more constructive way instead of completely avoiding and despising their mother. So, the answer might be A (they are in the wrong), but there's nuance because the mother's behavior isn't without fault. However, the question is about the author's actions. Even if the mother is at fault, the author's lack of respect still makes them the asshole. Hence, Answer A.\n"
