My whole life, my dad has done most of the cooking and cleaning and provided the sole income for the family. He makes a good salary now, and she constantly berates him for not making more, or complains that her life isn't lavish enough. She acts like a petulant child and I find it absolutely repulsive when I have to visit for the holidays (I live across the country from them, and only visit once a year). I'm so sick of hearing her bullshit. She has zero hobbies and zero interests aside from talking about wealth with her friends (who are all the wives of relatively successful men in the neighborhood). \n\nShe's never shown any real interest in my or my siblings lives. The last promotion I got, her only input was to criticise me for taking so long to get one. I'm just so sick of being around this negative life sucking force. I had to put up with it for 20 years before I could move out, and every time I visit it puts me in a horrible mood. As such, I've barely said more than a sentence to her the entire time I've been visiting. I leave the room when she enters. I'm not even trying to hide the fact that I despise her anymore. I'm so sick of everyone catering to her bullshit.  \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person in the given situation is in the wrong. The scenario involves the author treating their mother with zero respect due to years of perceived neglect and behavior from the mother.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the key points. The author's mother hasn't worked since marrying the father 40 years ago, the father is the sole provider and does most household chores. The mother complains about his income and isn't lavish enough. She's described as acting petulantly, has no hobbies, and focuses on wealth with her friends. The author feels neglected, especially since the mother doesn't show interest in their life and criticizes them. The author now avoids interaction, leaving rooms when the mother enters, and openly expresses disdain.\n\nThe user initially thinks the author is in the wrong but wants a second opinion. They want a simple answer: A (yes, wrong) or B (no, not wrong).\n\nI need to consider cultural expectations around respect for parents. In many societies, there's an expectation of respect regardless of the parent's behavior. However, the mother's actions\u2014lack of support, constant criticism, and neglect\u2014might justify the author's feelings. The author has valid reasons for resentment. But does that make their treatment of the mother acceptable?\n\nOn one hand, the mother's behavior is harmful and disrespectful. On the other, the author's response is to completely cut off and show contempt, which could be seen as disrespectful regardless of the mother's faults. The author might be right to feel hurt but is it wrong to respond this way?\n\nAlso, the author's actions are affecting their relationship. Avoiding interaction and expressing disdain could lead to further estrangement. However, if the mother hasn't changed her behavior, the author might feel justified in setting boundaries.\n\nIn some perspectives, respect is a two-way street, but when one party is toxic, the other might feel justified in distancing. However, in terms of moral or social expectations, even if the parent is wrong, children are often expected to maintain a level of respect.\n\nBut the author's situation is complex. They've been subjected to years of neglect and criticism. Their actions might be a form of self-preservation. So, is the author in the wrong? It's a tricky balance. The answer might depend on cultural norms and personal beliefs about family dynamics.\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong because their actions are a response to long-term mistreatment. However, the mother's behavior is also problematic. The key is whether the author's disrespect is a justified reaction. Since the mother has contributed to the toxic environment, the author might not be entirely at fault. So, answer B (not in the wrong).\n"
