My whole life, my dad has done most of the cooking and cleaning and provided the sole income for the family. He makes a good salary now, and she constantly berates him for not making more, or complains that her life isn't lavish enough. She acts like a petulant child and I find it absolutely repulsive when I have to visit for the holidays (I live across the country from them, and only visit once a year). I'm so sick of hearing her bullshit. She has zero hobbies and zero interests aside from talking about wealth with her friends (who are all the wives of relatively successful men in the neighborhood). \n\nShe's never shown any real interest in my or my siblings lives. The last promotion I got, her only input was to criticise me for taking so long to get one. I'm just so sick of being around this negative life sucking force. I had to put up with it for 20 years before I could move out, and every time I visit it puts me in a horrible mood. As such, I've barely said more than a sentence to her the entire time I've been visiting. I leave the room when she enters. I'm not even trying to hide the fact that I despise her anymore. I'm so sick of everyone catering to her bullshit.  \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. Let's read through the situation again.\n\nThe author is asking if they're the asshole for treating their mom with zero respect. Their mom hasn't worked in 40 years since marrying their dad. The dad is the sole provider, doing most of the cooking and cleaning. The mom is always complaining about money, not enough wealth, and acts petulantly. The author finds it repulsive, especially during holidays. They live far away, only visit once a year. The author is so fed up that they barely talk to their mom, avoid her when she's around, and openly show dislike. They mention putting up with this for 20 years before moving out, and now they just can't stand being around her anymore.\n\nFirst, the key points here are the mom's behavior: no job, relying on the dad's income, constant complaints about money, lack of hobbies, disinterest in the author's achievements, and being a negative influence. The author's response is complete disengagement during visits, showing disdain, and avoiding interaction.\n\nNow, considering respect in a family context. Respect usually involves treating someone with consideration and courtesy, even if you disagree with them. The author is not doing that\u2014they're avoiding communication, showing disdain, which is disrespectful. But the question is whether the author is in the wrong. \n\nOn the other hand, the mom's behavior is problematic. She's the source of the negative environment. The author's actions could be seen as a reaction to her toxicity. But does that justify the author's disrespectful treatment? Even if someone is a difficult person, is it acceptable to treat them with zero respect?\n\nIn family dynamics, there's often an expectation of some level of respect and effort to maintain relationships, especially with parents. The author is cutting off communication entirely, which is extreme. However, the mom's behavior over 40 years might have justified the author's feelings. But the author's response is causing harm by being disrespectful, which could make them the asshole. But maybe the mom's actions are the root cause here.\n\nSo, the author's actions are disrespectful, but they might have reasons. However, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. In such cases, even if the parent is at fault, the child's disrespectful behavior can still be seen as wrong. The answer might be A (author is in the wrong) because they're choosing to treat their mom with zero respect despite the mom's flaws. Alternatively, B (not in the wrong) if the context of the mom's behavior makes the author's actions understandable.\n\nBut usually, in such questions, the assumption is that even if someone is a bad parent, the child isn't justified in being disrespectful. So the answer might be A. However, the author's situation is extreme, with 20 years of putting up with it and the mom's clear issues. Maybe the community would see that the author is justified, hence B. It's a tough call. But I think the answer is A because the author is choosing to be disrespectful, which is wrong regardless of the mother's behavior.\n"
