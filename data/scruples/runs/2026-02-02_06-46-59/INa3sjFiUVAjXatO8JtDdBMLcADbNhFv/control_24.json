My whole life, my dad has done most of the cooking and cleaning and provided the sole income for the family. He makes a good salary now, and she constantly berates him for not making more, or complains that her life isn't lavish enough. She acts like a petulant child and I find it absolutely repulsive when I have to visit for the holidays (I live across the country from them, and only visit once a year). I'm so sick of hearing her bullshit. She has zero hobbies and zero interests aside from talking about wealth with her friends (who are all the wives of relatively successful men in the neighborhood). \n\nShe's never shown any real interest in my or my siblings lives. The last promotion I got, her only input was to criticise me for taking so long to get one. I'm just so sick of being around this negative life sucking force. I had to put up with it for 20 years before I could move out, and every time I visit it puts me in a horrible mood. As such, I've barely said more than a sentence to her the entire time I've been visiting. I leave the room when she enters. I'm not even trying to hide the fact that I despise her anymore. I'm so sick of everyone catering to her bullshit.  \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for treating their mother with zero respect. Let me break down the situation.\n\nFirst, the author's mother hasn't worked in 40 years since marrying the dad. The dad is the sole provider, doing most of the cooking and cleaning. The mom is always criticizing the dad's income and complaining about her lifestyle not being lavish. She's also described as acting like a petulant child. The author is really put off by this and finds it repulsive during visits. The author mentions their mom doesn't care about their or their siblings' lives, and even criticized the author's promotion. The author has been avoiding interacting with the mom, leaving the room when she enters, and openly showing dislike. They're done with the negative energy and don't want to cater to her anymore.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. On one hand, showing disrespect to a parent is generally frowned upon socially and culturally in many contexts. The author's behavior is pretty extreme\u2014basically ignoring the mother, avoiding interaction, and expressing disdain. That's definitely not respectful. But on the other hand, the mother's behavior is toxic, neglectful, and narcissistic. The author has valid reasons for their frustration, especially given the mother's lack of support and constant criticism. The author's actions might be a defense mechanism against emotional abuse or a toxic environment.\n\nBut even in situations where someone is a terrible parent, the societal expectation is to treat family members with some level of respect, even if you disagree with their actions. The author's approach of complete disengagement and hostility might be seen as inappropriate, even if the mother is at fault. However, the line between standing up for oneself and being disrespectful can be blurry. The author might not be in the wrong if they feel they can't control their emotions in a toxic environment, but the way they're handling it is definitely disrespectful. Maybe they should address the mother's behavior in a healthier way rather than completely cutting her out and showing open disdain. So, I think the answer is A (the author is in the wrong) because their response is disrespectful, even if the mother's behavior is problematic. They could try to set boundaries without being disrespectful.\n"
