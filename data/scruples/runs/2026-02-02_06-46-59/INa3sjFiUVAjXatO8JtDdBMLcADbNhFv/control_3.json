My whole life, my dad has done most of the cooking and cleaning and provided the sole income for the family. He makes a good salary now, and she constantly berates him for not making more, or complains that her life isn't lavish enough. She acts like a petulant child and I find it absolutely repulsive when I have to visit for the holidays (I live across the country from them, and only visit once a year). I'm so sick of hearing her bullshit. She has zero hobbies and zero interests aside from talking about wealth with her friends (who are all the wives of relatively successful men in the neighborhood). \n\nShe's never shown any real interest in my or my siblings lives. The last promotion I got, her only input was to criticise me for taking so long to get one. I'm just so sick of being around this negative life sucking force. I had to put up with it for 20 years before I could move out, and every time I visit it puts me in a horrible mood. As such, I've barely said more than a sentence to her the entire time I've been visiting. I leave the room when she enters. I'm not even trying to hide the fact that I despise her anymore. I'm so sick of everyone catering to her bullshit.  \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person in the scenario is in the wrong. The situation involves a person treating their mother with zero respect because they find her behavior annoying and negative.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the details provided. The mother hasn't had a job in 40 years since marrying the dad. The dad does most of the cooking, cleaning, and is the sole provider. The mother complains about his salary and wants a more lavish lifestyle. The author finds her repulsive and has a negative attitude during visits, even going as far as avoiding interaction and showing disdain.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. From a general perspective, respect in family relationships is important. Even if the mother's behavior is problematic, the way the author is reacting might be considered disrespectful. However, there's a context where the mother's actions might contribute to the author's feelings. The mother isn't supportive, is critical, and lacks interest in her children's lives. The author has a valid reason for feeling hurt and frustrated.\n\nBut the key here is whether the author's actions are wrong. Treating someone with zero respect, avoiding interaction, and showing contempt can be harmful and disrespectful regardless of the reasons. While the mother might have flaws, the author's response could be seen as crossing a line. Family dynamics can be complex, but cutting someone out or treating them poorly without trying to address the issues might not be the right approach.\n\nHowever, some might argue that the mother's behavior is toxic and the author is justified in setting boundaries. The answer might depend on cultural norms and personal values. In many societies, there's an expectation of respect towards parents, but that doesn't mean the mother is blameless. The author's actions might be a form of self-protection, but they still risk damaging the relationship further.\n\nConsidering all angles, the answer might be A (the author is in the wrong) because despite the mother's faults, the author's response is disrespectful. However, there's a case for B (not in the wrong) because the mother's behavior could be seen as contributing to the author's actions. The question is tricky. The correct answer likely depends on whether the focus is on the mother's behavior or the author's response. Since the question is about who is in the wrong, the author's disrespectful treatment is the main issue here. So, A is the answer.\n"
