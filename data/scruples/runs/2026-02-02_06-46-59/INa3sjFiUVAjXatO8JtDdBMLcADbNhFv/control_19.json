My whole life, my dad has done most of the cooking and cleaning and provided the sole income for the family. He makes a good salary now, and she constantly berates him for not making more, or complains that her life isn't lavish enough. She acts like a petulant child and I find it absolutely repulsive when I have to visit for the holidays (I live across the country from them, and only visit once a year). I'm so sick of hearing her bullshit. She has zero hobbies and zero interests aside from talking about wealth with her friends (who are all the wives of relatively successful men in the neighborhood). \n\nShe's never shown any real interest in my or my siblings lives. The last promotion I got, her only input was to criticise me for taking so long to get one. I'm just so sick of being around this negative life sucking force. I had to put up with it for 20 years before I could move out, and every time I visit it puts me in a horrible mood. As such, I've barely said more than a sentence to her the entire time I've been visiting. I leave the room when she enters. I'm not even trying to hide the fact that I despise her anymore. I'm so sick of everyone catering to her bullshit.  \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the author of the situation is in the wrong. The scenario involves a person who treats their mother with zero respect because they're frustrated with her behavior. The mother hasn't worked in 40 years, the dad is the sole provider, and the mom is portrayed as negative and uninterested in her kids' lives.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The author's mom is described as being critical, not contributing financially, and having a negative attitude. The author feels resentful and decides to treat her poorly, even avoiding interaction. The key question is whether the author's actions are justified or if they're in the wrong.\n\nFrom a moral standpoint, respecting family members is generally expected, even if they're difficult. The author's mother may have flaws, but completely cutting her off and showing disdain could be seen as disrespectful. However, the mother's behavior is also problematic\u2014being unappreciative, neglectful, and negative. The author's upbringing in such an environment might contribute to their feelings.\n\nI should also think about the author's actions. They mention barely speaking to their mom and leaving the room when she enters. This could be harmful, especially if the mother is unaware of the reason for the cold treatment. It might lead to emotional distress for the mother, but the author is acting out of their own hurt and frustration.\n\nAnother angle is the concept of accountability. The author has the right to set boundaries to protect their own mental health. However, the way they enforce those boundaries\u2014by treating their mother with zero respect\u2014could be considered excessive. There might be a more constructive approach, like limiting interactions without being openly disrespectful.\n\nAlso, cultural factors could play a role. In some cultures, respecting elders is a strict expectation, which might influence the judgment. The user didn't specify cultural context, so it's hard to account for that.\n\nIn summary, while the mother's behavior is clearly problematic and has caused the author significant distress, the author's response of complete disrespect might be disproportionate. There's a balance between self-preservation and maintaining respect. The author might not be entirely in the wrong, but their approach could be seen as crossing a line, making them at least partially responsible. So, maybe the answer is A (Yes, the author is in the wrong), but I'm a bit conflicted because the mother's behavior is also very negative.\n"
