My whole life, my dad has done most of the cooking and cleaning and provided the sole income for the family. He makes a good salary now, and she constantly berates him for not making more, or complains that her life isn't lavish enough. She acts like a petulant child and I find it absolutely repulsive when I have to visit for the holidays (I live across the country from them, and only visit once a year). I'm so sick of hearing her bullshit. She has zero hobbies and zero interests aside from talking about wealth with her friends (who are all the wives of relatively successful men in the neighborhood). \n\nShe's never shown any real interest in my or my siblings lives. The last promotion I got, her only input was to criticise me for taking so long to get one. I'm just so sick of being around this negative life sucking force. I had to put up with it for 20 years before I could move out, and every time I visit it puts me in a horrible mood. As such, I've barely said more than a sentence to her the entire time I've been visiting. I leave the room when she enters. I'm not even trying to hide the fact that I despise her anymore. I'm so sick of everyone catering to her bullshit.  \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. Let's break down the situation. The person is upset with their mom for not working, relying on their dad's income, and being negative. The mom constantly complains about money, doesn't support her kids, and the author treats her disrespectfully when visiting. The author says they leave the room when she's there and show no interest in interacting.\n\nFirst, I should consider the mom's behavior. If she's not working, maybe there's a reason. But the author mentions she's been with the dad for 40 years, so maybe she chose not to work. However, the dad is the sole provider, and the mom is critical of his income. That's a problem. The mom's lack of interest in the kids' lives and her negativity are definitely issues. The author feels that their entire childhood was affected by this negative environment, which is understandable.\n\nNow, the author's response: treating their mom with zero respect. They avoid interaction, leave the room, and openly show disdain. The question is whether that makes them wrong. On one hand, the mom's behavior is toxic, so the author might feel justified. On the other hand, treating a parent with no respect is generally frowned upon. But is the author in the wrong if the parent is toxic?\n\nI think the key points are the duration of the abuse and the author's actions. The author was subjected to 20 years of this negative behavior, which is a long time. Adult children can have boundaries, and it's not necessarily wrong to set them. However, completely cutting off communication might be seen as extreme. But given the mom's behavior, the author's response is a form of self-preservation. But the question is whether the author is in the wrong. The answer could be A or B. \n\nIf society values filial respect regardless of the parent's behavior, then A. If it's about protecting one's mental health, then B. The author is an adult, so they have the right to make their own choices. The mom's actions are clearly problematic. So maybe the author isn't in the wrong. But the direct answer would be B (not in the wrong) because they're defending against a toxic parent. However, some might argue that even with a toxic parent, showing respect is important. It's a bit of a gray area. But given the context, I think the author's actions are a result of long-term mistreatment, so they're justified.\n"
