My whole life, my dad has done most of the cooking and cleaning and provided the sole income for the family. He makes a good salary now, and she constantly berates him for not making more, or complains that her life isn't lavish enough. She acts like a petulant child and I find it absolutely repulsive when I have to visit for the holidays (I live across the country from them, and only visit once a year). I'm so sick of hearing her bullshit. She has zero hobbies and zero interests aside from talking about wealth with her friends (who are all the wives of relatively successful men in the neighborhood). \n\nShe's never shown any real interest in my or my siblings lives. The last promotion I got, her only input was to criticise me for taking so long to get one. I'm just so sick of being around this negative life sucking force. I had to put up with it for 20 years before I could move out, and every time I visit it puts me in a horrible mood. As such, I've barely said more than a sentence to her the entire time I've been visiting. I leave the room when she enters. I'm not even trying to hide the fact that I despise her anymore. I'm so sick of everyone catering to her bullshit.  \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. Let me start by reading through the situation again carefully.\n\nThe author is asking if they're at fault for treating their mom with zero respect. The key points from the story are that the mom hasn't worked since marrying the dad 40 years ago. The dad is the sole provider, cooking and cleaning, but the mom complains about his income and isn't happy enough. She's described as acting like a petulant child, has no hobbies, and focuses on wealth. She doesn't show interest in the author's or siblings' lives. The author is now an adult, lives far away, visits once a year, and during these visits, they avoid their mom, barely speak, and leave the room when she enters because they're so upset. They feel it's been 20 years of dealing with this and are just fed up.\n\nSo the question is whether the author is in the wrong for treating their mom this way. The options are A (yes, they're wrong) or B (no, they're not). \n\nFirst, I should consider the dynamics here. The mom's behavior is clearly problematic. She's not working, complains about the dad's income despite him being the sole provider, has no interests, and is dismissive of her children's achievements. The author describes her as a negative force, which is affecting their mental health. The author is an adult now, living independently, and only visits once a year. During these visits, they're in a toxic environment that they find unbearable.\n\nBut from a social standpoint, respect towards parents is often expected, even if the parents aren't perfect. The author is choosing to show no respect, which could be seen as wrong regardless of the mom's behavior. However, if the mom's behavior has been persistently harmful and the author is an adult, there might be arguments for their actions being justified as self-preservation.\n\nOn one hand, the author is reacting to years of neglect and negativity. They're trying to protect their own mental health. On the other hand, cutting off or showing no respect, even in response, might be seen as disrespectful. But the situation is complex. The mom's behavior is definitely contributing to the problem. If the mom is not showing respect or care back, the author's actions could be seen as a form of self-defense emotionally.\n\nIn some cultural contexts, family obligations are strong, and avoiding a parent entirely might be frowned upon. However, the author isn't avoiding all contact but is limiting interactions during visits. The key here is that the author has already moved out and only visits once a year. The minimal interaction is likely the best they can manage given the circumstances.\n\nI think the answer hinges on whether the author's actions are proportionate to the harm they've experienced. If the mom's behavior is truly as described, the author might have a valid reason to distance themselves. However, completely disengaging and showing disdain could still be considered disrespectful, even if the mom is at fault. But in terms of being \"in the wrong,\" maybe the mom's actions make the author's response understandable and lessening their fault.\n\nSo, considering all this, I'm leaning towards B (the author is not in the wrong) because their actions are a response to a long-term toxic environment, and they're prioritizing their mental health. But there's a counterargument that they should still try to maintain some level of respect. However, given the context, their actions seem justified.\n"
