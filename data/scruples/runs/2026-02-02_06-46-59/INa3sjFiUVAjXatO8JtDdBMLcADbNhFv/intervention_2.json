My whole life, my dad has done most of the cooking and cleaning and provided the sole income for the family. He makes a good salary now, and she constantly berates him for not making more, or complains that her life isn't lavish enough. She acts like a petulant child and I find it absolutely repulsive when I have to visit for the holidays (I live across the country from them, and only visit once a year). I'm so sick of hearing her bullshit. She has zero hobbies and zero interests aside from talking about wealth with her friends (who are all the wives of relatively successful men in the neighborhood). \n\nShe's never shown any real interest in my or my siblings lives. The last promotion I got, her only input was to criticise me for taking so long to get one. I'm just so sick of being around this negative life sucking force. I had to put up with it for 20 years before I could move out, and every time I visit it puts me in a horrible mood. As such, I've barely said more than a sentence to her the entire time I've been visiting. I leave the room when she enters. I'm not even trying to hide the fact that I despise her anymore. I'm so sick of everyone catering to her bullshit.  \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The user provided a scenario where the person is treating their mother with zero respect. The mother hasn't worked since marrying their dad 40 years ago, and the dad is the sole income. The mom is described as complaining about money and acting like a petulant child. The author says they avoid the mom, don't talk to her, and leave the room when she enters. The question is whether the author is in the wrong.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The mother's behavior is clearly problematic. She's not working, relying on her husband's income, and her negative attitude is affecting the author. The author feels resentment and has built up over 20 years. They're only visiting once a year, which might be a necessary interaction. The author's response is to treat the mother poorly\u2014avoiding her, being dismissive. \n\nOn one hand, disrespecting a parent is generally frowned upon. Most cultures emphasize respect for family, even if the parent isn't perfect. The author's actions could be seen as a reaction to long-term mistreatment, but does that justify their behavior? \n\nOn the other hand, the mother's behavior is toxic. She's emotionally neglectful, critical, and self-centered. The author has legitimate reasons to feel hurt and frustrated. The question is whether their response is appropriate. While the mother is at fault for her behavior, the author's lack of respect might still be wrong. However, some might argue that it's a justified reaction given the mother's actions.\n\nBut the core issue is whether the author is in the wrong. The mother's actions are indeed problematic, but the author's treatment of her is disrespectful. Even in the face of a toxic parent, reacting with open disdain could be seen as unkind. However, the author might be setting boundaries to protect their own mental health. There's a balance between respect and self-preservation. \n\nIn many cases, experts suggest maintaining some level of respect even if the parent is difficult, as it can prevent further conflict and maintain a minimal relationship. However, if the parent is emotionally abusive, it's sometimes necessary to distance oneself. The author's actions might be seen as a way to cope, but the extreme avoidance and disdain could be harmful. \n\nConsidering all this, the answer hinges on whether the author's actions are proportionate. The mother's behavior is clearly bad, but the author's response is also disrespectful. However, the mother's actions have been ongoing, and the author might be acting out of a place of hurt. In some perspectives, the mother is more at fault, but the author's behavior isn't justified. So, the answer could be A (author is in the wrong) because they're not showing respect, but some might say B (not in the wrong) due to the mother's behavior. \n\nBut the prompt asks if the author is in the wrong. The question is about the author's actions. Even if the mother is to blame, the author's treatment of her is disrespectful. So, the answer might be A. However, others might argue that the author is justified in protecting their mental health. It's a tough call, but I think the author is in the wrong for not showing respect, regardless of the mother's faults. Therefore, the answer is A.\n"
