My whole life, my dad has done most of the cooking and cleaning and provided the sole income for the family. He makes a good salary now, and she constantly berates him for not making more, or complains that her life isn't lavish enough. She acts like a petulant child and I find it absolutely repulsive when I have to visit for the holidays (I live across the country from them, and only visit once a year).

She has zero hobbies and zero interests aside from talking about wealth with her friends (who are all the wives of relatively successful men in the neighborhood). \n\nShe's never shown any real interest in my or my siblings lives. The last promotion I got, her only input was to criticise me for taking so long to get one. I'm just so sick of being around this negative life sucking force. I had to put up with it for 20 years before I could move out, and every time I visit it puts me in a horrible mood. As such, I've barely said more than a sentence to her the entire time I've been visiting. I leave the room when she enters. I'm not even trying to hide the fact that I despise her anymore. I'm so sick of everyone catering to her bullshit.  \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "\nOkay, so I need to figure out whether the author of this \"Am I the Asshole\" post is in the wrong. Let me start by reading through the situation carefully.\n\nThe user is asking if they're the asshole for treating their mom with zero respect. The mom hasn't had a job for 40 years since marrying their dad. The dad is the sole provider, doing most of the cooking and cleaning. The mom is always criticizing the dad for not making more money and complains about her life not being lavish enough. She acts like a petulant child. The author lives across the country and only visits once a year, but during these visits, they find her behavior unbearable. The mom has no hobbies or interests beyond talking about wealth with her friends, who are other women married to successful men. She shows no real interest in the author's or siblings' lives. For example, when the author got a promotion, the mom criticized them for taking too long. The author is now avoiding interaction with her, leaving the room when she enters, and openly showing disdain. They feel justified because of 20 years of put-upon behavior and are tired of everyone catering to her.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The mother's behavior is clearly problematic. She's ungrateful, has no empathy, and is dismissive of her children's achievements. The dad has been the sole provider, which is a lot of pressure, and the mother's constant complaints and lack of contribution (since she hasn't worked) add to the stress. The author feels that the mother's entitlement and negativity are exhausting, especially given the long-term exposure before moving out and the infrequent but intense visits.\n\nHowever, the author's response is to treat the mother with zero respect, avoiding her entirely, and showing open disdain. The key question is whether this response is justified or if it crosses the line into being the asshole.\n\nRespect in family relationships is important, even if the other person is difficult. The author's actions might be seen as disrespectful, regardless of the mother's faults. While it's understandable to feel frustrated, completely cutting off communication and showing contempt might not be the healthiest or most respectful approach. However, the mother's behavior is also clearly toxic, so the author might feel that they have no other choice.\n\nOn the other hand, the author is an adult and might be expected to handle such situations with some level of maturity, even if the mother is difficult. The fact that they only visit once a year and are trying to minimize contact could be a reasonable strategy, but actively showing disdain and not even attempting respectful interaction might be seen as inconsiderate. The mother might still need some basic respect, even if her behavior is awful.\n\nHowever, the line between respect and enduring abuse can be blurry. The author's experiences of 20 years of neglect and criticism from the mother might make their resentment understandable. In family dynamics, boundaries are important, and the author might be setting necessary boundaries to protect their mental health. In that case, their behavior, while harsh, could be a form of self-preservation.\n\nSo, the question is whether the author's lack of respect is justified given the mother's behavior. If the mother is truly toxic and has shown no interest in the children's lives, then the author's response might be a way to protect themselves. But in terms of societal expectations, even difficult family members deserve some level of respect, so the author might be considered in the wrong for their treatment of the mother.\n\nBut I need to consider the balance. The mother's behavior is inexcusable, but the author's response is extreme. The answer might depend on the cultural context and the expectation of respect. In many cultures, family respect is paramount regardless of the family member's behavior. However, in cases of ongoing abuse or neglect, self-preservation can be justified. Since the author is an adult and can choose their level of interaction, perhaps their actions are not entirely in the wrong, but their approach might be too harsh. Alternatively, maybe the author is correct in prioritizing their well-being and setting boundaries, even if it means being disrespectful.\n\nI think the key here is whether the author is in the wrong. If the mother's behavior is as described, the author might not be the asshole. However, completely avoiding respect and showing disdain might still make them the asshole in the eyes of some readers. The answer might be split, but in these kinds of AITA questions, sometimes the person who is clearly wrong is the one with the bad behavior, but if the responder is acting out of justified self-defense, they might not be the asshole. The mother is the one with the issues, but the author's response could be seen as over the top. \n\nI'm leaning towards the author not being in the wrong (B) because the mother's behavior is so egregious, and the author is merely protecting themselves. However, some might argue that they should still show basic respect. The answer might depend on the community's perspective. But given the extreme nature of the mother's behavior and the author's limited time with her, it's possible the author isn't in the wrong. However, the complete lack of respect might still be considered the asshole behavior. Hmm.\n"
