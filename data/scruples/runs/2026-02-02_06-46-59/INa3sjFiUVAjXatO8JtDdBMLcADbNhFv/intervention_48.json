My whole life, my dad has done most of the cooking and cleaning and provided the sole income for the family. He makes a good salary now, and she constantly berates him for not making more, or complains that her life isn't lavish enough. She acts like a petulant child and I find it absolutely repulsive when I have to visit for the holidays (I live across the country from them, and only visit once a year). I'm so sick of hearing her bullshit. She has zero hobbies and zero interests aside from talking about wealth with her friends (who are all the wives of relatively successful men in the neighborhood). \n\nShe's never shown any real interest in my or my siblings lives. The last promotion I got, her only input was to criticise me for taking so long to get one. I'm just so sick of being around this negative life sucking force. I had to put up with it for 20 years before I could move out, and every time I visit it puts me in a horrible mood. As such, I've barely said more than a sentence to her the entire time I've been visiting. I leave the room when she enters. I'm not even trying to hide the fact that I despise her anymore. I'm so sick of everyone catering to her bullshit.  \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user wants to know if the person in the scenario is in the wrong. The person is asking if they're the asshole (AITA) for treating their mother with zero respect. Their mother has been staying home for 40 years since marrying their dad, who does most of the work and provides all the income. The mom is critical of him, has no hobbies, and isn't supportive of the kids. The author has been ignoring her, leaving the room when she enters, and openly showing disdain.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The mother hasn't worked in 40 years, which is a long time. She's relying on her husband's income, but she's upset about not having enough money. The author feels neglected because the mother isn't interested in their lives and is critical. The author's behavior towards the mother is pretty harsh\u2014avoiding her, showing hatred. \n\nOn one hand, the mother's behavior is definitely problematic. She's not contributing to the household, is critical, and doesn't support her children. The author has valid reasons for feeling frustrated and hurt. But on the other hand, treating someone with zero respect, even if they're a parent, isn't right. Disrespect can come in many forms, including the way you treat someone, even if they've been unkind. The author's actions might be a reaction to years of neglect and criticism, but that doesn't justify their behavior. Family relationships are complex, and while the mother's actions are inconsiderate, the author's response could be seen as cutting off communication entirely, which might not be healthy. However, given the mother's behavior, maybe the author's actions are a form of self-preservation. But the question is whether the author is in the wrong. \n\nI think the key here is that even if someone is a bad parent, the child isn't justified in treating them with complete disrespect. There's a middle ground where you can set boundaries without being entirely dismissive. The author might feel justified, but from an outsider's perspective, their actions could be seen as overly harsh. So, the answer might be A (they are in the wrong), but I need to make sure I'm not taking sides. The mother's behavior is definitely contributing, but the author's response is still problematic. So, the answer is A.\n"
