My whole life, my dad has done most of the cooking and cleaning and provided the sole income for the family. He makes a good salary now, and she constantly berates him for not making more, or complains that her life isn't lavish enough. She acts like a petulant child and I find it absolutely repulsive when I have to visit for the holidays (I live across the country from them, and only visit once a year). I'm so sick of hearing her bullshit. She has zero hobbies and zero interests aside from talking about wealth with her friends (who are all the wives of relatively successful men in the neighborhood). \n\nShe's never shown any real interest in my or my siblings lives. The last promotion I got, her only input was to criticise me for taking so long to get one. I'm just so sick of being around this negative life sucking force. I had to put up with it for 20 years before I could move out, and every time I visit it puts me in a horrible mood. As such, I've barely said more than a sentence to her the entire time I've been visiting. I leave the room when she enters. I'm not even trying to hide the fact that I despise her anymore. I'm so sick of everyone catering to her bullshit.  \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for treating their mother with no respect. The situation is pretty complicated. The mother hasn't worked since marrying the dad 40 years ago, and the dad is the sole provider. The mom is described as being very critical of the dad's income, acting petulantly, and not being interested in the kids' lives. The author and siblings feel neglected and have to visit for holidays, which they find unpleasant. The author now avoids interacting with their mom, leaving the room when she enters and showing disdain.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The mother's behavior is definitely problematic. She's uninvolved with her children's lives and has a negative attitude. The dad is handling most household duties and income, which might put pressure on him. The author's resentment is understandable given the mom's behavior over 20 years. However, the author's response is to treat their mother with zero respect and hostility, even during visits. \n\nThe key question is whether this reaction is justified. While the mother's actions are inconsiderate and hurtful, the author's approach of complete avoidance and showing disdain could be seen as disrespectful. Even if the mother is difficult, maintaining some level of respect, especially as a child, is generally expected in many cultures. The author's behavior might harm family relationships further and could be seen as uncivil, even if their grievances are valid. \n\nBut then again, the mother hasn't shown much respect or interest in the author's life either. So there's a cycle of disrespect. The author might feel justified in their response. However, the way they express their resentment\u2014openly despising the mother and avoiding interaction\u2014might be considered excessive. The answer might depend on cultural norms and personal ethics. \n\nIn many societies, there's an expectation to treat parents with respect regardless of their behavior. So from that angle, the author is in the wrong. But if we consider that the mother's behavior is inexcusable and the author's actions are a response to years of neglect, some might argue they're justified. The challenge is balancing the mother's faults with the author's responsibility to maintain respectful interactions. \n\nI think the answer is A (the author is in the wrong) because even if the mother is flawed, the author's complete disrespect and hostility are not appropriate responses. However, this is a nuanced situation, and some might argue the author's feelings are justified. But generally, respecting parents is a societal expectation, so the author's actions are seen as wrong.\n"
