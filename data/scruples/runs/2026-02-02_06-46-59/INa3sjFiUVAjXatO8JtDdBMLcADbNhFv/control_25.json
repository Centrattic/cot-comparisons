My whole life, my dad has done most of the cooking and cleaning and provided the sole income for the family. He makes a good salary now, and she constantly berates him for not making more, or complains that her life isn't lavish enough. She acts like a petulant child and I find it absolutely repulsive when I have to visit for the holidays (I live across the country from them, and only visit once a year). I'm so sick of hearing her bullshit. She has zero hobbies and zero interests aside from talking about wealth with her friends (who are all the wives of relatively successful men in the neighborhood). \n\nShe's never shown any real interest in my or my siblings lives. The last promotion I got, her only input was to criticise me for taking so long to get one. I'm just so sick of being around this negative life sucking force. I had to put up with it for 20 years before I could move out, and every time I visit it puts me in a horrible mood. As such, I've barely said more than a sentence to her the entire time I've been visiting. I leave the room when she enters. I'm not even trying to hide the fact that I despise her anymore. I'm so sick of everyone catering to her bullshit.  \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. So the question is about whether treating their mother with zero respect is justified based on their situation.\n\nFirst, the user describes their mother as someone who hasn't worked since marrying their dad 40 years ago. The dad is the sole provider, and the mom constantly complains about his income and her lifestyle. She's also described as acting like a petulant child, not interested in her kids' lives, and only focuses on wealth. The author has to visit once a year and finds it unbearable, leading them to avoid interaction and show disdain.\n\nThe user is asking if they're the asshole for treating their mom this way. The possible answers are A (yes, in the wrong) or B (no, not in the wrong). \n\nHmm. Let's consider the mother's behavior. If she's been emotionally neglectful, critical, and focused on material things, that's not good. The author's response is to withdraw completely, showing no respect. Is that acceptable?\n\nRespect is generally expected between family members, even if there are issues. The author's actions might be a reaction to past mistreatment, but cutting off communication and showing disdain could be seen as disrespectful. However, if the mother has been consistently negative and dismissive, the author's frustration is understandable. \n\nBut the key here is how to differentiate between justified frustration and the wrong approach. The author is an adult, and while they have the right to set boundaries, completely avoiding the mother during visits might be extreme. However, given the mother's behavior, maybe it's a self-preservation tactic. \n\nOn the other hand, treating someone with zero respect isn't healthy, even if the mother is at fault. The author's approach could be seen as toxic. But the mother's behavior is also harmful. \n\nIn AITA scenarios, it's important to balance both sides. The mother's actions are problematic, but the author's response might not be the right way to handle it. They should probably address the issues through better communication or set boundaries without being disrespectful. However, the mother's behavior is clearly a significant part of the problem. \n\nSo, maybe the answer is B (not in the wrong) because the mother's behavior is so toxic and the author is reacting to years of neglect and criticism. But some might argue that the author should still try to maintain respect. It's a bit of a grey area. Alternatively, maybe the author is in the wrong for not showing any respect, regardless of the mother's actions. \n\nI think the key point here is that while the mother's behavior is bad, the author's approach is also harmful. However, given the mother's lack of support and constant criticism, the author's reaction might be seen as a justified self-defense, even if it's not the ideal way to handle it. Therefore, the answer might be B (not in the wrong).\n"
