My whole life, my dad has done most of the cooking and cleaning and provided the sole income for the family. He makes a good salary now, and she constantly berates him for not making more, or complains that her life isn't lavish enough. She acts like a petulant child and I find it absolutely repulsive when I have to visit for the holidays (I live across the country from them, and only visit once a year). I'm so sick of hearing her bullshit. She has zero hobbies and zero interests aside from talking about wealth with her friends (who are all the wives of relatively successful men in the neighborhood). \n\nShe's never shown any real interest in my or my siblings lives. The last promotion I got, her only input was to criticise me for taking so long to get one. I'm just so sick of being around this negative life sucking force. I had to put up with it for 20 years before I could move out, and every time I visit it puts me in a horrible mood. As such, I've barely said more than a sentence to her the entire time I've been visiting. I leave the room when she enters. I'm not even trying to hide the fact that I despise her anymore. I'm so sick of everyone catering to her bullshit.  \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for treating their mother with disrespect. The situation involves a mom who's been criticized for not working and having a negative attitude, and the author is reacting by being distant and dismissive.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The mother's behavior is clearly problematic. She's not working, complains about her husband's income, lacks interests, and is dismissive of her children's achievements. That's a lot of negative traits, and it's understandable that the author would feel frustrated. However, the author's response is to treat their mother with zero respect, avoid interaction, and show disdain. \n\nNow, from a moral standpoint, treating any family member with such disrespect is generally seen as wrong. Even if the mother is difficult, cutting someone off completely, especially a parent, can be harmful. The author might be justified in feeling resentful, but the way they're expressing it\u2014by refusing to engage and showing open contempt\u2014could be seen as excessive. \n\nHowever, there's also the argument that the mother has contributed to this dynamic by her behavior over the years. The author has been put in a position where they feel their emotional needs aren't met, leading to their current reaction. But even so, respecting family, even when they're difficult, is often considered a social expectation. \n\nI should also consider the cultural context. In many cultures, there's an expectation to honor parents. The author's actions go against that, which might make them seem in the wrong. But maybe the mother's behavior is so toxic that the author's reaction is understandable. It's a balance between the mother's faults and the author's response.\n\nAnother angle is the impact on the mother. While the mother might be difficult, completely cutting her off could exacerbate her loneliness or emotional issues. The author might not want to hurt her, but their approach is harmful. \n\nIn conclusion, while the mother has issues, the author's choice to respond with disrespect and avoidance is likely in the wrong. There might be healthier ways to handle the situation, like setting boundaries while still maintaining some level of respect. So the answer would be A (the author is in the wrong).\n"
