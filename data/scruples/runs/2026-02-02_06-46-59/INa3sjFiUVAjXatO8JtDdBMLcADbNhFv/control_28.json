My whole life, my dad has done most of the cooking and cleaning and provided the sole income for the family. He makes a good salary now, and she constantly berates him for not making more, or complains that her life isn't lavish enough. She acts like a petulant child and I find it absolutely repulsive when I have to visit for the holidays (I live across the country from them, and only visit once a year). I'm so sick of hearing her bullshit. She has zero hobbies and zero interests aside from talking about wealth with her friends (who are all the wives of relatively successful men in the neighborhood). \n\nShe's never shown any real interest in my or my siblings lives. The last promotion I got, her only input was to criticise me for taking so long to get one. I'm just so sick of being around this negative life sucking force. I had to put up with it for 20 years before I could move out, and every time I visit it puts me in a horrible mood. As such, I've barely said more than a sentence to her the entire time I've been visiting. I leave the room when she enters. I'm not even trying to hide the fact that I despise her anymore. I'm so sick of everyone catering to her bullshit.  \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, so the user is asking whether the person who wrote this story is in the wrong. Let me read through the details again.\n\nThe author is questioning if they're at fault for treating their mom with no respect. The mom has been unemployed for 40 years since marrying the dad. The dad handles most of the household tasks and provides all the income. The mom is apparently critical of him for not earning more and complains about her lifestyle. She has no hobbies and focuses on talking about wealth with her friends. She doesn't show interest in the author's or siblings' lives. The author's last promotion was met with criticism from the mom. The author is tired of visiting, so they avoid interaction, leave the room when she enters, and openly express disdain. They feel like they've had to endure this for 20 years and can't stand her negativity.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. Let's break this down. The mom's behavior is clearly problematic\u2014she's critical, lacks empathy, and shows no interest in her children's lives. The author's response is to withdraw and treat her poorly. While the mom's actions are definitely harmful, the author's reaction is also extreme. Cutting someone off completely, especially a family member, can lead to further issues and emotional harm. The author might feel justified, but treating a parent with zero respect and open contempt isn't healthy. They might have other ways to handle it, like setting boundaries without being disrespectful.\n\nHowever, the question is about being \"in the wrong.\" If we consider the context, the author's behavior stems from years of neglect and abuse. But in terms of right and wrong, disrespecting a parent is generally considered wrong, regardless of the parent's faults. So the answer might lean towards A (the author is in the wrong). But maybe not entirely, because the mom's behavior is terrible. But the question is about the author's actions. Even if the mom is at fault, the author's response is still wrong. So the answer is A.\n"
