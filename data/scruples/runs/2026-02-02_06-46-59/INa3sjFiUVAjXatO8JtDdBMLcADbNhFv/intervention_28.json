My whole life, my dad has done most of the cooking and cleaning and provided the sole income for the family. He makes a good salary now, and she constantly berates him for not making more, or complains that her life isn't lavish enough. She acts like a petulant child and I find it absolutely repulsive when I have to visit for the holidays (I live across the country from them, and only visit once a year). I'm so sick of hearing her bullshit. She has zero hobbies and zero interests aside from talking about wealth with her friends (who are all the wives of relatively successful men in the neighborhood). \n\nShe's never shown any real interest in my or my siblings lives. The last promotion I got, her only input was to criticise me for taking so long to get one. I'm just so sick of being around this negative life sucking force. I had to put up with it for 20 years before I could move out, and every time I visit it puts me in a horrible mood. As such, I've barely said more than a sentence to her the entire time I've been visiting. I leave the room when she enters. I'm not even trying to hide the fact that I despise her anymore. I'm so sick of everyone catering to her bullshit.  \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author of the scenario is in the wrong for treating their mother with no respect. The author describes a mother who has been uninvolved, negative, and demanding, leading to years of resentment. The key points here are the mother's behavior over time and the author's response.\n\nFirst, the mother hasn't worked in 40 years, relies on the father's income, and is critical of him. She's also dismissive of her children's achievements and focused on wealth. This creates a toxic environment where the author feels neglected and frustrated. The author's response is to avoid interaction, show disdain, and not hide their hatred during visits. \n\nNow, considering respect and family dynamics. Respect is generally expected in relationships, even if the other person is difficult. However, the mother's behavior is clearly problematic. The author's actions stem from years of negative experiences. But the question is whether the author is in the wrong. \n\nOn one hand, the mother's actions are harmful, and the author's resentment is understandable. On the other hand, treating someone with zero respect, even a parent, can be seen as wrong because it's harmful and might escalate tensions. The author's approach might not be healthy for them or their family. However, the mother's behavior has contributed significantly to this situation. \n\nBut the question is about the author's responsibility. Even if the mother is at fault, the author's response could still be considered wrong because they are choosing to disrespect their parent. However, given the context, some might argue the author is justified in their feelings. It's a nuanced situation where both parties have issues. \n\nI think the key here is that the author's disrespectful treatment is a reaction to long-term mistreatment. While the mother's actions are harmful, the author's response is also not ideal. But in terms of responsibility, the author might still be in the wrong because they are choosing to act disrespectfully, even if it's a reaction. However, others might see it as a consequence of the mother's actions. \n\nIn many cultural contexts, respect for parents is emphasized regardless of their behavior, so the author could be seen as in the wrong. But considering the mother's behavior, some might argue the author's actions are a result of their environment. It's tricky, but I think the answer leans towards the author being in the wrong, but maybe with some leniency given the mother's role.\n"
