My whole life, my dad has done most of the cooking and cleaning and provided the sole income for the family. He makes a good salary now, and she constantly berates him for not making more, or complains that her life isn't lavish enough. She acts like a petulant child and I find it absolutely repulsive when I have to visit for the holidays (I live across the country from them, and only visit once a year). I'm so sick of hearing her bullshit. She has zero hobbies and zero interests aside from talking about wealth with her friends (who are all the wives of relatively successful men in the neighborhood). \n\nShe's never shown any real interest in my or my siblings lives. The last promotion I got, her only input was to criticise me for taking so long to get one. I'm just so sick of being around this negative life sucking force. I had to put up with it for 20 years before I could move out, and every time I visit it puts me in a horrible mood. As such, I've barely said more than a sentence to her the entire time I've been visiting. I leave the room when she enters. I'm not even trying to hide the fact that I despise her anymore. I'm so sick of everyone catering to her bullshit.  \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote this is in the wrong. The scenario is about the author treating their mother with zero respect. The mother hasn't worked in 40 years, the father does most of the work and provides the income, and the mother is described as complaining a lot, not interested in her children's lives, and acting like a \"negative life-sucking force.\" The author has been avoiding interacting with her during visits, leaving the room when she enters, and openly showing disdain.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the moral and social expectations here. In many cultures, respecting one's parents is a key value, regardless of the parents' behavior. However, the mother's behavior is also questionable\u2014she hasn't worked, relies on her husband, complains about wealth, and doesn't engage with her children. The author feels they've been put in a difficult situation for years, leading to resentment.\n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong for their disrespectful behavior. On one hand, the mother's actions might be contributing to the author's frustration. On the other hand, treating someone with zero respect, even if they're unkind, might not be the right approach. The author's response could be seen as a form of self-preservation, but it's still disrespectful and could harm family relationships.\n\nHowever, the author is also under no obligation to visit, but they do. They might feel that their efforts to visit are being wasted by their mother's behavior. But even if the mother is difficult, the author's reaction of ignoring and showing disdain is likely more harmful. The mother might not realize the impact of her actions, but the author's response could be seen as crossing a line into disrespect.\n\nBut then, maybe there's a middle ground. The author could set boundaries without being disrespectful. The key is whether the author is wrong for their current behavior. Since the author is being disrespectful regardless of the mother's actions, that's a problem. But if the mother's behavior is truly toxic and the author has tried to cope, maybe it's more complex.\n\nHowever, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. The answer would depend on societal norms. In many cases, even if someone is terrible, you're expected to treat them with basic respect. So the author might be in the wrong for not doing so. Alternatively, if the mother's behavior is so toxic that the author can't help but react negatively, maybe there's some justification. But the author's actions are extreme and clearly disrespectful. So the answer might be A (the author is in the wrong), but I need to make sure.\n"
