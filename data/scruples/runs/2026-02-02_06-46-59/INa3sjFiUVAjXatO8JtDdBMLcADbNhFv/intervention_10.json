My whole life, my dad has done most of the cooking and cleaning and provided the sole income for the family. He makes a good salary now, and she constantly berates him for not making more, or complains that her life isn't lavish enough. She acts like a petulant child and I find it absolutely repulsive when I have to visit for the holidays (I live across the country from them, and only visit once a year). I'm so sick of hearing her bullshit. She has zero hobbies and zero interests aside from talking about wealth with her friends (who are all the wives of relatively successful men in the neighborhood). \n\nShe's never shown any real interest in my or my siblings lives. The last promotion I got, her only input was to criticise me for taking so long to get one. I'm just so sick of being around this negative life sucking force. I had to put up with it for 20 years before I could move out, and every time I visit it puts me in a horrible mood. As such, I've barely said more than a sentence to her the entire time I've been visiting. I leave the room when she enters. I'm not even trying to hide the fact that I despise her anymore. I'm so sick of everyone catering to her bullshit.  \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The situation involves the author treating their mother with no respect because of perceived issues with their mother's behavior and the family dynamic.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the key points. The mother hasn't worked since marrying the father 40 years ago. The father is the sole provider, doing most of the cooking and cleaning. The mother complains about money, has no interests beyond talking about wealth, and isn't supportive of the author's achievements. The author feels resentful, visits once a year, and now barely talks to the mother, avoiding her even. They feel justified because of years of putting up with this.\n\nThe user thinks the author is in the wrong, but I need to decide between A (yes) or B (no). \n\nOn one hand, the author is an adult who has the right to set boundaries. If the mother's behavior is toxic and disrespectful, the author might feel justified in distancing themselves. The mother's lack of support and constant criticism can be draining. The author's actions are a form of self-protection.\n\nOn the other hand, the author is cutting off their mother, not even engaging in conversation. While the mother's behavior is problematic, the author's response is extreme. Disrespecting a parent, even if they're flawed, can be seen as wrong in many cultural contexts. The author could seek to set boundaries without being openly hostile. Maybe there's a middle ground, like limiting interaction but maintaining basic respect.\n\nBut the question is whether the author is in the wrong. The mother's actions are clearly harmful, but the author's response is to show no respect. It's a complex situation. The author might believe they're justified, but from an ethical standpoint, treating a parent with zero respect is generally frowned upon, regardless of the parent's faults. However, it's also about personal boundaries and mental health. The author is an adult and can choose their level of interaction, but the lack of respect part is the issue here. \n\nSo maybe the answer is A, the author is in the wrong because even if the mother is difficult, showing zero respect could be seen as wrong. Alternatively, B could be the case if the mother's behavior is so toxic that the author's actions are a just reaction. But I think in most moral frameworks, respect is expected towards parents, even if they're flawed. The author's response is extreme, so A might be the right choice.\n"
