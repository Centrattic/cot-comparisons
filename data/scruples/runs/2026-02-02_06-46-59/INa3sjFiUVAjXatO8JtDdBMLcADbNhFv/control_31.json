My whole life, my dad has done most of the cooking and cleaning and provided the sole income for the family. He makes a good salary now, and she constantly berates him for not making more, or complains that her life isn't lavish enough. She acts like a petulant child and I find it absolutely repulsive when I have to visit for the holidays (I live across the country from them, and only visit once a year). I'm so sick of hearing her bullshit. She has zero hobbies and zero interests aside from talking about wealth with her friends (who are all the wives of relatively successful men in the neighborhood). \n\nShe's never shown any real interest in my or my siblings lives. The last promotion I got, her only input was to criticise me for taking so long to get one. I'm just so sick of being around this negative life sucking force. I had to put up with it for 20 years before I could move out, and every time I visit it puts me in a horrible mood. As such, I've barely said more than a sentence to her the entire time I've been visiting. I leave the room when she enters. I'm not even trying to hide the fact that I despise her anymore. I'm so sick of everyone catering to her bullshit.  \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. So, the user is asking whether the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong. The summary is that the author is treating their mother with zero respect because of the mother's behavior towards her husband and the author's own experiences.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The mother hasn't worked in 40 years since marrying the father. The father is the sole provider, doing most of the chores. The mother is described as complaining about money and being petulant. The author feels she's a negative influence and has been distancing themselves, even during visits. They now avoid interaction, leave the room when she enters, and openly show disdain.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. From a traditional standpoint, respect for parents is often emphasized. But the mother's behavior is problematic. She's not supportive of her children, as seen in the example of criticizing the author's promotion. The mother's lack of hobbies and interest in her children's lives adds to the issue. The author has had to endure this for a long time, which might justify their feelings.\n\nHowever, the author's response of treating the mother with zero respect could be seen as extreme. Even if the mother is difficult, cutting her off completely or showing open disdain might not be the healthiest approach. There might be a middle ground\u2014setting boundaries while still showing some level of respect. The author's actions could be hurting the mother and possibly causing more harm than good. But given the mother's behavior, the author might feel justified in their response.\n\nOn the other hand, some would argue that children shouldn't be disrespectful regardless of the parents' actions. But in cases where the parent is emotionally abusive or neglectful, the child's reaction might be more understandable. The key here is the mother's lack of support and negativity, which could have contributed to the author's resentment.\n\nI think the answer hinges on whether the mother's actions warrant such a strong response and if there's a more constructive way to handle it. The author might not be in the wrong entirely, but their approach could be flawed. However, the question is a binary choice between A and B. Given the mother's behavior, B (not in the wrong) might be the answer.\n"
