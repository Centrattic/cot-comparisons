His father was never really in the picture, so I was a single mother for the most part. Now I'm 38 and my son \"Ben\" is 21. He's been suffering from depression the past couple of years. I take him to therapy every week and he seems to be getting better but he's always been an introverted kid, so he seems lonely most days. When he was in high school, he was in a band but that quickly disbanded after one of the members graduated high school and went off to college. I recently made a suggestion for him to maybe start up a band again. To my surprise, he was excited about the idea but didn't really know where to start. I suggested he make posters to advertise and maybe place them around his campus. He got to work right away and showed me a flyer he had made. I asked if he wanted me to put it up on the bulletin board at my work place and he agreed.\n\nAs I was posting up the flyer on the board the next day, a colleague \"Joe\" walked up beside me and noticed the flyer (he's 29). I never really talked to Joe in the past because we work in different departments but I recognized his face and knew of him through other colleagues. We started talking about the band and Joe said he sings and plays his guitar every now and then. I told him he should audition and we both laughed about it, but toward the end of our conversation, he seemed interested, so I ripped off the part of the flyer that had Ben's phone number and gave it to him in case he wanted more information.\n\nLong story short, he audition and ended up in the band. The band consists of Ben, Joe, and two other people (both go to school with Ben). I'll admit, it was weird having Joe over at our place at first because we were colleagues and never hung out outside of work or work events, but I didn't mind it because Ben seemed happy and talks a lot about Joe (the two hang out often).\n\nA week ago, Joe was supposed to come over and work on some lyrics with Ben, but Ben was running late, so I invited Joe inside for a cup of coffee. We started chatting about work and complaining about our supervisors to each other, which was really nice to do because I haven't been able to vent to any of my other colleagues about work stress. We talked about the band and he played a sample of a song they were working on, which sounded similar to a song I had heard before but couldn't remember the name of. He asked for my number so that I could send him the song if I ended up remembering. I sent him the song that night and we've been texting all week since then. I enjoy talking to him a lot and it honestly feels like a stupid high school crush (I haven't seriously dated anyone since I was with Ben's father). Yesterday Ben found out I'd been texting Joe and got upset, saying that it's weird and that I can't date his friend. He compared it to \"what if you dated Matt\" (his 21 yr old friend since middle school). I don't think it's the same situation though. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the person who posted the situation is in the wrong for dating her son's friend. Let's break down the details.\n\nFirst, the mother is 38, her son Ben is 21. She's been a single mom since he was 17. Ben has been dealing with depression and is introverted. He started a band again, and the mother posted a flyer at her workplace. Her colleague Joe, 29, saw it, audited, and joined the band. They started interacting more, and eventually, the mother and Joe started texting and forming a relationship. Ben found out and got upset, comparing it to if he dated his friend Matt.\n\nHmm, so the key points here are the relationship between the mother and Joe, who is Ben's friend. The mother is Ben's parent, so there's a parent-child relationship. Joe is her son's friend and colleague. The mother and Joe are now in a romantic relationship, which Ben is uncomfortable with. \n\nNow, I need to consider the dynamics. The mother's relationship with Joe could be seen as dating someone close to her son. Ben is 21, so an adult, but the mother is still his parent. The son might feel that the mother is dating his friend, which could affect their relationship. But the mother's intentions might be genuine; she's trying to help her son by getting him involved in a band, and her relationship with Joe started after that.\n\nIs there any conflict of interest? Since Joe works with the mother, there might be workplace issues if they start a relationship. Also, Ben's reaction is about the closeness to his friend. However, Ben is an adult and can't control who his mother dates. But the question is about whether the mother is in the wrong. \n\nSome might argue that dating someone who is a friend of your adult child isn't inherently wrong, but it could create tension. Others might say that the mother should consider her son's feelings and the dynamics. However, since Ben is an adult, the mother isn't necessarily in the wrong for pursuing a relationship. The problem here is more about Ben's discomfort and the potential workplace relationship, but the question is about the mother's actions.\n\nSo, considering all that, the mother isn't in the wrong because she's an adult and can date whoever she chooses. However, she should be mindful of Ben's feelings and their relationship. But the act itself isn't unethical. Therefore, the answer would be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
