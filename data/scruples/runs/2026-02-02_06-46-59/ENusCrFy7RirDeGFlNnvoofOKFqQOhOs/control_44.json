His father was never really in the picture, so I was a single mother for the most part. Now I'm 38 and my son \"Ben\" is 21. He's been suffering from depression the past couple of years. I take him to therapy every week and he seems to be getting better but he's always been an introverted kid, so he seems lonely most days. When he was in high school, he was in a band but that quickly disbanded after one of the members graduated high school and went off to college. I recently made a suggestion for him to maybe start up a band again. To my surprise, he was excited about the idea but didn't really know where to start. I suggested he make posters to advertise and maybe place them around his campus. He got to work right away and showed me a flyer he had made. I asked if he wanted me to put it up on the bulletin board at my work place and he agreed.\n\nAs I was posting up the flyer on the board the next day, a colleague \"Joe\" walked up beside me and noticed the flyer (he's 29). I never really talked to Joe in the past because we work in different departments but I recognized his face and knew of him through other colleagues. We started talking about the band and Joe said he sings and plays his guitar every now and then. I told him he should audition and we both laughed about it, but toward the end of our conversation, he seemed interested, so I ripped off the part of the flyer that had Ben's phone number and gave it to him in case he wanted more information.\n\nLong story short, he audition and ended up in the band. The band consists of Ben, Joe, and two other people (both go to school with Ben). I'll admit, it was weird having Joe over at our place at first because we were colleagues and never hung out outside of work or work events, but I didn't mind it because Ben seemed happy and talks a lot about Joe (the two hang out often).\n\nA week ago, Joe was supposed to come over and work on some lyrics with Ben, but Ben was running late, so I invited Joe inside for a cup of coffee. We started chatting about work and complaining about our supervisors to each other, which was really nice to do because I haven't been able to vent to any of my other colleagues about work stress. We talked about the band and he played a sample of a song they were working on, which sounded similar to a song I had heard before but couldn't remember the name of. He asked for my number so that I could send him the song if I ended up remembering. I sent him the song that night and we've been texting all week since then. I enjoy talking to him a lot and it honestly feels like a stupid high school crush (I haven't seriously dated anyone since I was with Ben's father). Yesterday Ben found out I'd been texting Joe and got upset, saying that it's weird and that I can't date his friend. He compared it to \"what if you dated Matt\" (his 21 yr old friend since middle school). I don't think it's the same situation though. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user wants to know if the person who wrote the situation is in the wrong. The scenario is that a single mother, who's been raising her son alone since he was 17, is now dating her son's 21-year-old friend. The son found out and is upset, comparing it to dating a middle school friend. The question is whether the mother is in the wrong.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the age differences. The mother is 38, and Joe is 29. The son, Ben, is 21. So the age gap between the mother and Joe is about 9 years, which isn't that huge. But the dynamic here is important. The mother and Joe started interacting because of the son's band. The mother initially met Joe at work, so there's a workplace connection. She gave him Ben's number for the band, and later, when she met him at home, they started talking and texting more.\n\nNow, the main issue here is the relationship between the mother and her son's friend. The son is upset because it's \"weird,\" but the mother feels it's different from the son dating his own friend. The key points to consider are consent, the relationship's nature, and any potential conflicts of interest.\n\nWorkplace relationships can be tricky, especially if they lead to romantic involvement. However, if the mother and Joe aren't in the same department, maybe the workplace isn't a direct conflict. But she gave him Ben's number, so there's a connection through their son's band. The mother might not have realized the implications of getting involved with someone her son is close to, especially since the son is still dependent on her in some ways.\n\nThe son's reaction is about the idea of dating a friend, which is a common issue in parent-child dynamics. The mother might be overstepping if the son feels it invades his social circle. However, the mother is an adult, and if both she and Joe are okay with the relationship, it's a matter of personal choice. But there's a potential for conflict with the son, which is already happening.\n\nAnother angle is the power dynamic. The mother is the parent of the son, and Joe is a friend of the son. If the mother is in a relationship with Joe, there could be complexities when the son is involved with the band. The mother needs to consider if her relationship affects her son's feelings and interactions with Joe. But since the son is 21 and an adult, it's also about respecting the mother's autonomy.\n\nI should also think about societal norms. While the mother is an adult, some might see it as inappropriate because of the familial connection through her son. It's similar to a parent dating a friend of their child, which can be seen as crossing a boundary. However, others might argue that if the son is an adult and the relationship isn't affecting him negatively, it's the mother's choice.\n\nIn conclusion, the mother isn't necessarily in the wrong because she's an adult and can choose her partners. However, she needs to be mindful of her son's feelings and the potential for conflict. The situation is complex, but unless there are legal or ethical violations (like abuse of power, inappropriate influence, etc.), it's more of a personal choice. So the answer would be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
