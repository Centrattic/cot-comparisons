His father was never really in the picture, so I was a single mother for the most part. Now I'm 38 and my son \"Ben\" is 21. He's been suffering from depression the past couple of years. I take him to therapy every week and he seems to be getting better but he's always been an introverted kid, so he seems lonely most days. When he was in high school, he was in a band but that quickly disbanded after one of the members graduated high school and went off to college. I recently made a suggestion for him to maybe start up a band again. To my surprise, he was excited about the idea but didn't really know where to start. I suggested he make posters to advertise and maybe place them around his campus. He got to work right away and showed me a flyer he had made. I asked if he wanted me to put it up on the bulletin board at my work place and he agreed.\n\nAs I was posting up the flyer on the board the next day, a colleague \"Joe\" walked up beside me and noticed the flyer (he's 29). I never really talked to Joe in the past because we work in different departments but I recognized his face and knew of him through other colleagues. We started talking about the band and Joe said he sings and plays his guitar every now and then. I told him he should audition and we both laughed about it, but toward the end of our conversation, he seemed interested, so I ripped off the part of the flyer that had Ben's phone number and gave it to him in case he wanted more information.\n\nLong story short, he audition and ended up in the band. The band consists of Ben, Joe, and two other people (both go to school with Ben). I'll admit, it was weird having Joe over at our place at first because we were colleagues and never hung out outside of work or work events, but I didn't mind it because Ben seemed happy and talks a lot about Joe (the two hang out often).\n\nA week ago, Joe was supposed to come over and work on some lyrics with Ben, but Ben was running late, so I invited Joe inside for a cup of coffee. We started chatting about work and complaining about our supervisors to each other, which was really nice to do because I haven't been able to vent to any of my other colleagues about work stress. We talked about the band and he played a sample of a song they were working on, which sounded similar to a song I had heard before but couldn't remember the name of. He asked for my number so that I could send him the song if I ended up remembering. I sent him the song that night and we've been texting all week since then. I enjoy talking to him a lot and it honestly feels like a stupid high school crush (I haven't seriously dated anyone since I was with Ben's father). Yesterday Ben found out I'd been texting Joe and got upset, saying that it's weird and that I can't date his friend. He compared it to \"what if you dated Matt\" (his 21 yr old friend since middle school). I don't think it's the same situation though. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is that the mother of a 21-year-old son starts dating his friend. The son found out and is upset about it. The mother is asking if she's in the wrong.\n\nFirst, the mother is 38, and her son is 21. She's been a single parent since he was 17. The son has depression and seems lonely. The friend, Joe, becomes part of the son's band, and the mother ends up getting close to him. They start texting, and the son gets upset because he feels it's weird, comparing it to if she dated his friend Matt from middle school.\n\nHmm, the key factors here are the ages and the relationship dynamics. The mother is in a position of authority in her son's life, especially since he's still in his early 20s. Even though he's an adult, the mother has been his primary caregiver for a long time. Dating someone who's part of his social circle could make him uncomfortable, especially if he's still adjusting to her dating again after being single for so long.\n\nAlso, the mother initiated contact with Joe, and they started texting. The son's reaction is about feeling that his mother is dating his friend, which could create tension. But Joe isn't her friend; he's her son's friend. So there's a potential conflict of interest here. The mother's relationship with Joe could affect her son's well-being, especially since he's dealing with depression. If the son feels betrayed or uncomfortable, that's a problem.\n\nHowever, the mother is also an adult and has the right to date. The age difference isn't too extreme (she's 38, Joe is 29). But the fact that Joe is part of her son's social group complicates things. The son is mature enough to handle this, but he might not be emotionally ready yet. The mother might need to consider how her actions impact her son's mental health.\n\nIn some cases, adults can handle their parents dating, but it's situational. If the mother's actions are causing her son distress, even if he's an adult, she might need to step back and think about it. However, she's not in a position to be in a relationship with someone who's closely associated with her son, especially if it's causing him emotional harm.\n\nSo, the mother might be in the wrong because the relationship could be seen as inappropriate given her son's feelings and his current mental state. She should consider stepping back to avoid further conflict and to prioritize her son's well-being.\n"
