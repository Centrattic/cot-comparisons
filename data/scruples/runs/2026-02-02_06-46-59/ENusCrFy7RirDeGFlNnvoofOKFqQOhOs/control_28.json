His father was never really in the picture, so I was a single mother for the most part. Now I'm 38 and my son \"Ben\" is 21. He's been suffering from depression the past couple of years. I take him to therapy every week and he seems to be getting better but he's always been an introverted kid, so he seems lonely most days. When he was in high school, he was in a band but that quickly disbanded after one of the members graduated high school and went off to college. I recently made a suggestion for him to maybe start up a band again. To my surprise, he was excited about the idea but didn't really know where to start. I suggested he make posters to advertise and maybe place them around his campus. He got to work right away and showed me a flyer he had made. I asked if he wanted me to put it up on the bulletin board at my work place and he agreed.\n\nAs I was posting up the flyer on the board the next day, a colleague \"Joe\" walked up beside me and noticed the flyer (he's 29). I never really talked to Joe in the past because we work in different departments but I recognized his face and knew of him through other colleagues. We started talking about the band and Joe said he sings and plays his guitar every now and then. I told him he should audition and we both laughed about it, but toward the end of our conversation, he seemed interested, so I ripped off the part of the flyer that had Ben's phone number and gave it to him in case he wanted more information.\n\nLong story short, he audition and ended up in the band. The band consists of Ben, Joe, and two other people (both go to school with Ben). I'll admit, it was weird having Joe over at our place at first because we were colleagues and never hung out outside of work or work events, but I didn't mind it because Ben seemed happy and talks a lot about Joe (the two hang out often).\n\nA week ago, Joe was supposed to come over and work on some lyrics with Ben, but Ben was running late, so I invited Joe inside for a cup of coffee. We started chatting about work and complaining about our supervisors to each other, which was really nice to do because I haven't been able to vent to any of my other colleagues about work stress. We talked about the band and he played a sample of a song they were working on, which sounded similar to a song I had heard before but couldn't remember the name of. He asked for my number so that I could send him the song if I ended up remembering. I sent him the song that night and we've been texting all week since then. I enjoy talking to him a lot and it honestly feels like a stupid high school crush (I haven't seriously dated anyone since I was with Ben's father). Yesterday Ben found out I'd been texting Joe and got upset, saying that it's weird and that I can't date his friend. He compared it to \"what if you dated Matt\" (his 21 yr old friend since middle school). I don't think it's the same situation though. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for dating her son's friend. The situation is that she met Joe, a colleague, through helping her son Ben start a band. They ended up connecting, and now Ben is upset because she's dating his friend. The key points here are the relationships and the dynamics involved.\n\nFirst, the mother is a single parent who's been raising Ben since he was young. He's dealing with depression and feels lonely. The mother wanted to help him make friends, which led to Joe joining the band. They started interacting more, and eventually, a romantic relationship developed. The son is now upset, comparing it to dating a lifelong friend. \n\nSo, is the mother in the wrong? Well, she didn't intentionally set out to date Joe. The connection happened naturally through her efforts to support her son. However, there's a potential conflict of interest here. Since Joe works at the same place as her, there could be workplace issues if their relationship becomes known. Also, the son's feelings are valid; he might feel like a boundary has been crossed. \n\nBut then again, the mother is an adult and has the right to pursue her own happiness. The question is whether she overstepped by dating someone connected to her son. The comparison to dating a lifelong friend might not be entirely fair. Joe is a friend through the band, not a lifelong friend like Matt. The mother's intentions were to help Ben, so the connection with Joe was initially about supporting her son's well-being.\n\nOn the other hand, the son's discomfort is understandable. He might feel that the relationship could affect his friendship with Joe and create tension. The mother should consider her son's feelings and the potential impact on Ben's mental health, especially since he was already dealing with depression and loneliness. \n\nSo, is the mother in the wrong? It's a bit of a gray area. She's an adult who found a connection, but she needs to be mindful of her son's perspective and any workplace policies regarding relationships with colleagues. If there are no policies against it, maybe it's not her fault, but she should handle it sensitively. However, if the relationship causes her son distress, she might need to navigate that carefully. The answer might not be a clear A or B, but the user wants a decisive answer. Considering all factors, the mother isn't necessarily in the wrong for pursuing her own happiness, but she needs to manage the situation with her son's feelings in mind. So the answer would be B, No.\n"
