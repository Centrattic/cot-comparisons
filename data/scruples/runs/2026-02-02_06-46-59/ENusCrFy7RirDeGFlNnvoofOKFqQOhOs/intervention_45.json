His father was never really in the picture, so I was a single mother for the most part. Now I'm 38 and my son \"Ben\" is 21. He's been suffering from depression the past couple of years. I take him to therapy every week and he seems to be getting better but he's always been an introverted kid, so he seems lonely most days. When he was in high school, he was in a band but that quickly disbanded after one of the members graduated high school and went off to college. I recently made a suggestion for him to maybe start up a band again. To my surprise, he was excited about the idea but didn't really know where to start. I suggested he make posters to advertise and maybe place them around his campus. He got to work right away and showed me a flyer he had made. I asked if he wanted me to put it up on the bulletin board at my work place and he agreed.\n\nAs I was posting up the flyer on the board the next day, a colleague \"Joe\" walked up beside me and noticed the flyer (he's 29). I never really talked to Joe in the past because we work in different departments but I recognized his face and knew of him through other colleagues. We started talking about the band and Joe said he sings and plays his guitar every now and then. I told him he should audition and we both laughed about it, but toward the end of our conversation, he seemed interested, so I ripped off the part of the flyer that had Ben's phone number and gave it to him in case he wanted more information.\n\nLong story short, he audition and ended up in the band. The band consists of Ben, Joe, and two other people (both go to school with Ben). I'll admit, it was weird having Joe over at our place at first because we were colleagues and never hung out outside of work or work events, but I didn't mind it because Ben seemed happy and talks a lot about Joe (the two hang out often).\n\nA week ago, Joe was supposed to come over and work on some lyrics with Ben, but Ben was running late, so I invited Joe inside for a cup of coffee. We started chatting about work and complaining about our supervisors to each other, which was really nice to do because I haven't been able to vent to any of my other colleagues about work stress. We talked about the band and he played a sample of a song they were working on, which sounded similar to a song I had heard before but couldn't remember the name of. He asked for my number so that I could send him the song if I ended up remembering. I sent him the song that night and we've been texting all week since then. I enjoy talking to him a lot and it honestly feels like a stupid high school crush (I haven't seriously dated anyone since I was with Ben's father). Yesterday Ben found out I'd been texting Joe and got upset, saying that it's weird and that I can't date his friend. He compared it to \"what if you dated Matt\" (his 21 yr old friend since middle school). I don't think it's the same situation though. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) scenario is in the wrong. The situation is that a single mother, who's been taking care of her son Ben since he was young, ends up dating Joe, who is Ben's friend and a coworker. The key points here are the age difference (the mother is 38, Joe is 29), Ben's age (21), and the fact that they met through a band Ben started. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics. The mother suggested Ben start a band, which led to meeting Joe. Initially, Joe was a band member, but the relationship now seems to be more personal. Ben is upset because he sees it as similar to his mom dating his friend Matt. The user thinks the author is in the wrong, but I need to evaluate both sides.\n\nAge-wise, 38 and 29 isn't an enormous gap, but the mother is Ben's parent. Ben is 21, so he's an adult. The mother might have a right to her own relationships, but the conflict here is Ben's discomfort. The mother met Joe through her son's project, which could be a point of contention. Also, Joe is a colleague, so there might be workplace policies about personal relationships, though the mother is the one who initiated contact through the flyer. \n\nAnother angle is the mother's personal life. She hasn't dated since Ben's father left, so maybe she's seeking companionship. However, Ben is still her child, and the mother should consider how this affects him. The fact that Ben found out about the texting and is upset is a red flag. The mother might be crossing a boundary, even if they are both adults. The comparison to dating Matt (a middle school friend) is a way Ben is expressing his feelings, but the mother and Joe's relationship developing through the band and her role in connecting them adds another layer. \n\nWorkplace interactions are tricky. The mother gave Joe her contact info, which could lead to complications if their relationship becomes romantic. However, she's the one who reached out to Joe, and Joe might have been a coworker with no prior close relationship. \n\nIn terms of responsibility, the mother might be in the wrong because she's prioritizing her own needs without considering Ben's feelings. Even though Ben is an adult, the fact that they share a home and she's been his primary caregiver could make this situation particularly sensitive. The mother's actions might make Ben feel uncomfortable or even exposed, as if she's treating him like a teenager despite being 21. \n\nOn the other hand, the mother is an adult and has the right to date. But the context of meeting through her son's activities and being a colleague complicates things. The answer might depend on how the relationship is perceived and the impact on Ben. If the mother hadn't involved her son in the band project, maybe it wouldn't be as awkward. But since she did, and Joe is part of that, the son's discomfort is valid. \n\nI think the mother is in the wrong here because she should have considered how her actions would affect her son, especially given their close history and the context of meeting Joe through the band. Even if they are both adults, the relationship's origin in her son's social circle is a significant factor. So, the answer is A.\n"
