His father was never really in the picture, so I was a single mother for the most part. Now I'm 38 and my son \"Ben\" is 21. He's been suffering from depression the past couple of years. I take him to therapy every week and he seems to be getting better but he's always been an introverted kid, so he seems lonely most days. When he was in high school, he was in a band but that quickly disbanded after one of the members graduated high school and went off to college. I recently made a suggestion for him to maybe start up a band again. To my surprise, he was excited about the idea but didn't really know where to start. I suggested he make posters to advertise and maybe place them around his campus. He got to work right away and showed me a flyer he had made. I asked if he wanted me to put it up on the bulletin board at my work place and he agreed.\n\nAs I was posting up the flyer on the board the next day, a colleague \"Joe\" walked up beside me and noticed the flyer (he's 29). I never really talked to Joe in the past because we work in different departments but I recognized his face and knew of him through other colleagues. We started talking about the band and Joe said he sings and plays his guitar every now and then. I told him he should audition and we both laughed about it, but toward the end of our conversation, he seemed interested, so I ripped off the part of the flyer that had Ben's phone number and gave it to him in case he wanted more information.\n\nLong story short, he audition and ended up in the band. The band consists of Ben, Joe, and two other people (both go to school with Ben). I'll admit, it was weird having Joe over at our place at first because we were colleagues and never hung out outside of work or work events, but I didn't mind it because Ben seemed happy and talks a lot about Joe (the two hang out often).\n\nA week ago, Joe was supposed to come over and work on some lyrics with Ben, but Ben was running late, so I invited Joe inside for a cup of coffee. We started chatting about work and complaining about our supervisors to each other, which was really nice to do because I haven't been able to vent to any of my other colleagues about work stress. We talked about the band and he played a sample of a song they were working on, which sounded similar to a song I had heard before but couldn't remember the name of. He asked for my number so that I could send him the song if I ended up remembering. I sent him the song that night and we've been texting all week since then. I enjoy talking to him a lot and it honestly feels like a stupid high school crush (I haven't seriously dated anyone since I was with Ben's father). Yesterday Ben found out I'd been texting Joe and got upset, saying that it's weird and that I can't date his friend. He compared it to \"what if you dated Matt\" (his 21 yr old friend since middle school). I don't think it's the same situation though. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. So, the user is asking whether the person who wrote the \"AITA\" post is in the wrong for dating their son's friend. Let me break down the situation.\n\nFirst, the woman is 38, her son is 21, and he's been dealing with depression. She's been supportive, taking him to therapy. The son started a band again, and the mother posted a flyer at her workplace where she met Joe, a colleague (29 years old). Joe ended up joining the band. Initially, it was just professional, but then they started talking more, bonding over work and music. The mother started texting him a lot, and the son found out and is upset, comparing it to dating a friend from his own age group.\n\nHmm. The key points here are the relationship dynamics. The mother is dating a friend of her son. The son is an adult, 21, so he's of age. The mother is his mother, but they're both adults here. The son is upset about the potential relationship. The mother didn't start the dating, but rather developed a friendship, then a romantic interest. The son might feel uncomfortable because Joe is his friend, but since the mother is an adult and Joe is also an adult, maybe the issue is more about the son's feelings of betrayal or discomfort.\n\nNow, from a traditional perspective, there's a boundary here between mother and son. The mother is in a position of care, even if the son is an adult. But since the son is 21 and independent, maybe the mother isn't in a position of authority over him anymore. However, the son might still see the relationship as crossing a line, especially if Joe is his friend. The mother's actions might be seen as appropriating her son's friend, which could affect their relationship.\n\nOn the other hand, the mother is single, and Joe is an adult. They formed a connection through the band, which the mother facilitated for her son's benefit. The mother might argue that she's not doing anything wrong because it's her choice as an adult to date someone, even if that person is her son's friend. The son's reaction could be jealousy or feeling that the relationship is intrusive. But legally, there's no issue as both are adults. Emotionally, it's a family matter.\n\nSo, the question is whether the mother is in the wrong. If we consider that the son is an adult and capable of handling his own relationships, then the mother isn't necessarily in the wrong. However, the son's feelings are valid, and the mother's actions might complicate their relationship. The mother's role as a parent might conflict with her own personal life. Some might argue that it's not the mother's fault because she's an adult, but others might say she's overstepping by getting involved with someone connected to her son.\n\nI need to weigh these factors. The key is the son's age and the nature of the relationship. Since the son is an adult, the mother isn't in a position to control his relationships. But as a parent, there's a responsibility to consider the impact on the son. The mother didn't start the relationship but developed it. However, since the son is upset, maybe the mother should consider his feelings and perhaps back off to avoid conflict. But is that being in the wrong?\n\nAlternatively, if the mother is acting on her own choice, and the son is an adult, then it's not necessarily her fault. The answer might depend on cultural norms or family dynamics. In some cases, people might say it's not wrong because both are adults, but others might say it's inappropriate due to the parent-son relationship. The son could feel that his privacy or boundaries were crossed, even if it wasn't intentional.\n\nIn conclusion, the mother isn't in the wrong because she's an adult with the right to date someone, even if they are her son's friend. The son's feelings are important, but it's not her fault for pursuing a relationship. However, she should consider his feelings and perhaps address the situation carefully to maintain their relationship. So the answer would be B (No).\n"
