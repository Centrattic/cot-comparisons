His father was never really in the picture, so I was a single mother for the most part. Now I'm 38 and my son \"Ben\" is 21. He's been suffering from depression the past couple of years. I take him to therapy every week and he seems to be getting better but he's always been an introverted kid, so he seems lonely most days. When he was in high school, he was in a band but that quickly disbanded after one of the members graduated high school and went off to college. I recently made a suggestion for him to maybe start up a band again. To my surprise, he was excited about the idea but didn't really know where to start. I suggested he make posters to advertise and maybe place them around his campus. He got to work right away and showed me a flyer he had made. I asked if he wanted me to put it up on the bulletin board at my work place and he agreed.\n\nAs I was posting up the flyer on the board the next day, a colleague \"Joe\" walked up beside me and noticed the flyer (he's 29). I never really talked to Joe in the past because we work in different departments but I recognized his face and knew of him through other colleagues. We started talking about the band and Joe said he sings and plays his guitar every now and then. I told him he should audition and we both laughed about it, but toward the end of our conversation, he seemed interested, so I ripped off the part of the flyer that had Ben's phone number and gave it to him in case he wanted more information.\n\nLong story short, he audition and ended up in the band. The band consists of Ben, Joe, and two other people (both go to school with Ben). I'll admit, it was weird having Joe over at our place at first because we were colleagues and never hung out outside of work or work events, but I didn't mind it because Ben seemed happy and talks a lot about Joe (the two hang out often).\n\nA week ago, Joe was supposed to come over and work on some lyrics with Ben, but Ben was running late, so I invited Joe inside for a cup of coffee. We started chatting about work and complaining about our supervisors to each other, which was really nice to do because I haven't been able to vent to any of my other colleagues about work stress. We talked about the band and he played a sample of a song they were working on, which sounded similar to a song I had heard before but couldn't remember the name of. He asked for my number so that I could send him the song if I ended up remembering. I sent him the song that night and we've been texting all week since then. I enjoy talking to him a lot and it honestly feels like a stupid high school crush (I haven't seriously dated anyone since I was with Ben's father). Yesterday Ben found out I'd been texting Joe and got upset, saying that it's weird and that I can't date his friend. He compared it to \"what if you dated Matt\" (his 21 yr old friend since middle school). I don't think it's the same situation though. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for dating their son's friend. The situation is complicated because the mother is dating someone who is friends with her 21-year-old son. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the mother is a single parent who's been taking care of her son since he was young. Ben has been dealing with depression and is introverted. The band idea came up through the mother, and Joe, her colleague, joined the band. Initially, the mother was just connecting Ben with Joe for the band, but then their relationship developed beyond that.\n\nThe key points here are the power dynamics and the relationship boundaries. The mother is in a position of authority at work, and Joe is her colleague. But more importantly, she's Ben's parent, and Joe is Ben's friend. Even though Ben is an adult, the mother's relationship with Joe could affect their dynamic. Ben might feel uncomfortable or betrayed, especially since he's already been through some emotional struggles with depression. The son's reaction is valid because it's similar to the example he gave\u2014dating a close friend. However, there's a difference between a parent dating a friend and a parent dating a friend of their adult child. \n\nThe mother might not be in the wrong per se, but there are potential issues. The mother's relationship with Joe could influence how Ben sees the parent-child dynamic. Also, the mother might have used her position at work to connect with Joe, which could be a problem if there's a perception of favoritism. However, the age difference between the mother (38) and Joe (29) isn't that extreme, and both are adults. \n\nBut considering that Ben is still dependent on his mother emotionally and they live together, the mother's new relationship might be seen as crossing a boundary. Ben's reaction is about feeling that it's inappropriate for his mother to date someone he considers a friend. The mother's actions might not be malicious, but they could be inconsiderate of Ben's feelings and the existing trust between them. \n\nIn terms of ethics, it's about consent and boundaries. Since Ben is an adult, he has the right to his feelings, but he's also in a dependent situation. The mother might not be in the wrong if she's not intentionally manipulating or taking advantage, but the situation is awkward and could lead to conflict. The answer might hinge on whether the mother considered Ben's feelings and the potential impact on their relationship before pursuing the relationship with Joe.\n"
