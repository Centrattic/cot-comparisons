His father was never really in the picture, so I was a single mother for the most part. Now I'm 38 and my son \"Ben\" is 21. He's been suffering from depression the past couple of years. I take him to therapy every week and he seems to be getting better but he's always been an introverted kid, so he seems lonely most days. When he was in high school, he was in a band but that quickly disbanded after one of the members graduated high school and went off to college. I recently made a suggestion for him to maybe start up a band again. To my surprise, he was excited about the idea but didn't really know where to start. I suggested he make posters to advertise and maybe place them around his campus. He got to work right away and showed me a flyer he had made. I asked if he wanted me to put it up on the bulletin board at my work place and he agreed.\n\nAs I was posting up the flyer on the board the next day, a colleague \"Joe\" walked up beside me and noticed the flyer (he's 29). I never really talked to Joe in the past because we work in different departments but I recognized his face and knew of him through other colleagues. We started talking about the band and Joe said he sings and plays his guitar every now and then. I told him he should audition and we both laughed about it, but toward the end of our conversation, he seemed interested, so I ripped off the part of the flyer that had Ben's phone number and gave it to him in case he wanted more information.\n\nLong story short, he audition and ended up in the band. The band consists of Ben, Joe, and two other people (both go to school with Ben). I'll admit, it was weird having Joe over at our place at first because we were colleagues and never hung out outside of work or work events, but I didn't mind it because Ben seemed happy and talks a lot about Joe (the two hang out often).\n\nA week ago, Joe was supposed to come over and work on some lyrics with Ben, but Ben was running late, so I invited Joe inside for a cup of coffee. We started chatting about work and complaining about our supervisors to each other, which was really nice to do because I haven't been able to vent to any of my other colleagues about work stress. We talked about the band and he played a sample of a song they were working on, which sounded similar to a song I had heard before but couldn't remember the name of. He asked for my number so that I could send him the song if I ended up remembering. I sent him the song that night and we've been texting all week since then. I enjoy talking to him a lot and it honestly feels like a stupid high school crush (I haven't seriously dated anyone since I was with Ben's father). Yesterday Ben found out I'd been texting Joe and got upset, saying that it's weird and that I can't date his friend. He compared it to \"what if you dated Matt\" (his 21 yr old friend since middle school). I don't think it's the same situation though. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The person in question is a 38-year-old single mother who's dating her son's friend, Joe, who is 29. The son, Ben, is 21 and has been dealing with depression. The mother initially wanted to help Ben by suggesting he start a band, which led to Joe joining. Now, she's developed a relationship with Joe, which Ben finds uncomfortable.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The mother is Ben's parent, and Joe is his friend. The mother's actions could be seen as crossing a boundary because she's entering a personal relationship with someone her son is close to. Even though Ben is an adult, the mother's role as a parent might affect how this situation is perceived. The son's reaction is understandable\u2014dating a friend's parent can be awkward, and Ben might feel that his mother is prioritizing her own happiness in a way that could affect their relationship.\n\nBut there's also the aspect of the mother's personal life. She's been single since her son was born and might be seeking companionship. However, the fact that she's in a relationship with someone connected to her adult son introduces potential complications. The age difference between the mother and Joe is 9 years, which isn't extreme, but the key issue is the relationship with Ben.\n\nBen is an adult, so he can handle his own relationships, but the mother's choice here might impact their dynamic. The mother could be in the wrong if her actions make Ben feel uncomfortable or if she's not considering his feelings. On the other hand, she's also entitled to her happiness. The question is whether her actions are truly in the wrong.\n\nAnother angle is the power dynamic between the mother and Joe. She's Joe's colleague, having given him Ben's contact info. If there's any workplace implications or if she's in a position of authority over him, that could add another layer of ethical concern. However, the scenario doesn't mention any such power imbalance.\n\nThe main conflict is the emotional impact on Ben. Even though he's an adult, he's still her son, and she has a responsibility to consider his feelings. The mother's decision to pursue a relationship with Joe might be seen as disregarding the potential discomfort for her son, especially given Ben's history with depression. If the relationship causes him stress or alienates him, that's a valid concern.\n\nHowever, the mother might argue that she's not obligated to avoid dating someone just because they're her son's friend. Since Ben is an adult, he should be able to handle the situation. The key here is whether the mother is being inconsiderate of Ben's feelings or if Ben's reaction is simply his own personal discomfort.\n\nIn conclusion, while the mother is entitled to her personal life, the fact that she's in a relationship with someone her son is close to, potentially causing him distress, suggests she might be in the wrong. The answer would be A (Yes), as she's in the wrong for not fully considering her son's feelings and the potential impact on their relationship.\n"
