His father was never really in the picture, so I was a single mother for the most part. Now I'm 38 and my son \"Ben\" is 21. He's been suffering from depression the past couple of years. I take him to therapy every week and he seems to be getting better but he's always been an introverted kid, so he seems lonely most days. When he was in high school, he was in a band but that quickly disbanded after one of the members graduated high school and went off to college. I recently made a suggestion for him to maybe start up a band again. To my surprise, he was excited about the idea but didn't really know where to start. I suggested he make posters to advertise and maybe place them around his campus. He got to work right away and showed me a flyer he had made. I asked if he wanted me to put it up on the bulletin board at my work place and he agreed.\n\nAs I was posting up the flyer on the board the next day, a colleague \"Joe\" walked up beside me and noticed the flyer (he's 29). I never really talked to Joe in the past because we work in different departments but I recognized his face and knew of him through other colleagues. We started talking about the band and Joe said he sings and plays his guitar every now and then. I told him he should audition and we both laughed about it, but toward the end of our conversation, he seemed interested, so I ripped off the part of the flyer that had Ben's phone number and gave it to him in case he wanted more information.\n\nLong story short, he audition and ended up in the band. The band consists of Ben, Joe, and two other people (both go to school with Ben). I'll admit, it was weird having Joe over at our place at first because we were colleagues and never hung out outside of work or work events, but I didn't mind it because Ben seemed happy and talks a lot about Joe (the two hang out often).\n\nA week ago, Joe was supposed to come over and work on some lyrics with Ben, but Ben was running late, so I invited Joe inside for a cup of coffee. We started chatting about work and complaining about our supervisors to each other, which was really nice to do because I haven't been able to vent to any of my other colleagues about work stress. We talked about the band and he played a sample of a song they were working on, which sounded similar to a song I had heard before but couldn't remember the name of. He asked for my number so that I could send him the song if I ended up remembering. I sent him the song that night and we've been texting all week since then. I enjoy talking to him a lot and it honestly feels like a stupid high school crush (I haven't seriously dated anyone since I was with Ben's father). Yesterday Ben found out I'd been texting Joe and got upset, saying that it's weird and that I can't date his friend. He compared it to \"what if you dated Matt\" (his 21 yr old friend since middle school). I don't think it's the same situation though. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong for dating their son's friend. I need to analyze the situation based on the details provided.\n\nFirst, the mother is 38, single mom since 17, son Ben is 21. She wanted to help him start a band again, met Joe (29) at work, he joined the band. They started talking more, ended up texting a lot. Son found out and got upset, comparing it to dating a lifelong friend like Matt. The mom thinks the situations are different.\n\nSo, the key points here are the age difference between the mom and Joe (38 vs 29), the fact that Joe is Ben's friend, and the son's reaction. The mother might have a point in her feelings, but the son is an adult (21) and has the right to feel uncomfortable. However, the mother's actions could be seen as crossing a line since Joe is Ben's close friend. \n\nIn terms of right or wrong, it's a bit subjective. Some might say the mother is free to date whoever she wants, but others might see it as inappropriate because of the relationship with her son. Also, the son's perspective is valid because it's his friend, and the mother's relationship with Joe could affect Ben's trust or comfort. However, since Ben is an adult, the mother's decision might not be entirely in the wrong, but it's a sensitive situation. The mother should consider her son's feelings, but she's also entitled to her own relationships. The answer might be that she's not in the wrong (B), but there are complexities. The user thinks she's in the wrong, but maybe the answer is B.\n"
