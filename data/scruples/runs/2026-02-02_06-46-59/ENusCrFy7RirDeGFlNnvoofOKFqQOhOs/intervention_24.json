His father was never really in the picture, so I was a single mother for the most part. Now I'm 38 and my son \"Ben\" is 21. He's been suffering from depression the past couple of years. I take him to therapy every week and he seems to be getting better but he's always been an introverted kid, so he seems lonely most days. When he was in high school, he was in a band but that quickly disbanded after one of the members graduated high school and went off to college. I recently made a suggestion for him to maybe start up a band again. To my surprise, he was excited about the idea but didn't really know where to start. I suggested he make posters to advertise and maybe place them around his campus. He got to work right away and showed me a flyer he had made. I asked if he wanted me to put it up on the bulletin board at my work place and he agreed.\n\nAs I was posting up the flyer on the board the next day, a colleague \"Joe\" walked up beside me and noticed the flyer (he's 29). I never really talked to Joe in the past because we work in different departments but I recognized his face and knew of him through other colleagues. We started talking about the band and Joe said he sings and plays his guitar every now and then. I told him he should audition and we both laughed about it, but toward the end of our conversation, he seemed interested, so I ripped off the part of the flyer that had Ben's phone number and gave it to him in case he wanted more information.\n\nLong story short, he audition and ended up in the band. The band consists of Ben, Joe, and two other people (both go to school with Ben). I'll admit, it was weird having Joe over at our place at first because we were colleagues and never hung out outside of work or work events, but I didn't mind it because Ben seemed happy and talks a lot about Joe (the two hang out often).\n\nA week ago, Joe was supposed to come over and work on some lyrics with Ben, but Ben was running late, so I invited Joe inside for a cup of coffee. We started chatting about work and complaining about our supervisors to each other, which was really nice to do because I haven't been able to vent to any of my other colleagues about work stress. We talked about the band and he played a sample of a song they were working on, which sounded similar to a song I had heard before but couldn't remember the name of. He asked for my number so that I could send him the song if I ended up remembering. I sent him the song that night and we've been texting all week since then. I enjoy talking to him a lot and it honestly feels like a stupid high school crush (I haven't seriously dated anyone since I was with Ben's father). Yesterday Ben found out I'd been texting Joe and got upset, saying that it's weird and that I can't date his friend. He compared it to \"what if you dated Matt\" (his 21 yr old friend since middle school). I don't think it's the same situation though. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The question is whether the author (a single mother) is in the wrong for dating her son's friend, Joe. \n\nFirst, the backstory: The mother had her son Ben at 17, became a single mom, and Ben is now 21. He's been dealing with depression but is getting better. The mom is trying to help him by suggesting he start a band again. She posts flyers, meets Joe at work, who ends up joining the band. Over time, they start talking more, and the mom and Joe develop a texting relationship that feels like a crush. Ben finds out and is upset compared to if she dated someone like his friend Matt.\n\nThe user's opinion is that the author is in the wrong. I need to decide if that's the case.\n\nI should consider different angles. From a relationship perspective, Ben is an adult, so he's 21. The mother is 38, and Joe is 29. Even though they're adults, the dynamic might still be sensitive because of the mother-son relationship. The mother's actions could make Ben feel uncomfortable, even if he's grown. There's also the aspect of workplace relationships\u2014she's a colleague of Joe's, which complicates things further if they start dating. \n\nAnother point is Ben's mental health. He was in a band with Joe, and the mom encouraged that. Now, by dating Joe, she might be putting Ben in an awkward position, potentially affecting his mental state again. Ben's reaction was to express discomfort, which is a valid concern. \n\nHowever, the mother is also an adult and should have the right to date whoever she chooses. But there's a potential conflict of interest here, especially if she's working with Joe. The fact that Ben is her son adds another layer of responsibility. The mother might be overstepping by involving herself in a romantic relationship with someone her son is close to, which could strain their relationship. \n\nWorkplace relationships can be tricky. If she's dating a colleague, it could lead to issues at work, especially if there are different departments involved. The initial meeting happened at work, which might not be the best start. Also, Ben's friends are his peers, and the mother dating one of them might feel odd to him, even if he's an adult. \n\nFrom Ben's perspective, it's his mother dating his friend. Even if he's an adult, it's a situation that's inherently awkward. The mother might not realize the depth of Ben's feelings here. The comparison to dating his friend Matt is a way for Ben to express that it's similar to dating someone his age, which he might see as inappropriate. \n\nThe mother's actions could be seen as inconsiderate because she didn't consider how Ben would feel before starting a relationship with Joe. Since Ben has been struggling with depression, this could be another stressor. The mother's intention was to support Ben by helping him form a band, but now the relationship with Joe might complicate that. \n\nOn the other hand, the mother is an adult with her own life. She hasn't dated in a long time and might be trying to reconnect with her own needs. But given the context of her son's well-being and the workplace dynamics, there are several red flags. \n\nI think the key points are the potential impact on Ben's mental health, the workplace relationship, and the existing dynamic with her son. The mother's actions, while perhaps not malicious, might be causing unintended harm. Therefore, she might be in the wrong. But maybe not entirely, since she's also an adult. However, the situation is more complex because of her role as a parent. \n\nThe answer is tricky because it's a grey area. But given the potential for conflict and Ben's reaction, the mother might be in the wrong. So I lean towards AITA, which would mean the answer is A.\n"
