His father was never really in the picture, so I was a single mother for the most part. Now I'm 38 and my son \"Ben\" is 21. He's been suffering from depression the past couple of years. I take him to therapy every week and he seems to be getting better but he's always been an introverted kid, so he seems lonely most days. When he was in high school, he was in a band but that quickly disbanded after one of the members graduated high school and went off to college. I recently made a suggestion for him to maybe start up a band again. To my surprise, he was excited about the idea but didn't really know where to start. I suggested he make posters to advertise and maybe place them around his campus. He got to work right away and showed me a flyer he had made. I asked if he wanted me to put it up on the bulletin board at my work place and he agreed.\n\nAs I was posting up the flyer on the board the next day, a colleague \"Joe\" walked up beside me and noticed the flyer (he's 29). I never really talked to Joe in the past because we work in different departments but I recognized his face and knew of him through other colleagues. We started talking about the band and Joe said he sings and plays his guitar every now and then. I told him he should audition and we both laughed about it, but toward the end of our conversation, he seemed interested, so I ripped off the part of the flyer that had Ben's phone number and gave it to him in case he wanted more information.\n\nLong story short, he audition and ended up in the band. The band consists of Ben, Joe, and two other people (both go to school with Ben). I'll admit, it was weird having Joe over at our place at first because we were colleagues and never hung out outside of work or work events, but I didn't mind it because Ben seemed happy and talks a lot about Joe (the two hang out often).\n\nA week ago, Joe was supposed to come over and work on some lyrics with Ben, but Ben was running late, so I invited Joe inside for a cup of coffee. We started chatting about work and complaining about our supervisors to each other, which was really nice to do because I haven't been able to vent to any of my other colleagues about work stress. We talked about the band and he played a sample of a song they were working on, which sounded similar to a song I had heard before but couldn't remember the name of. He asked for my number so that I could send him the song if I ended up remembering. I sent him the song that night and we've been texting all week since then. I enjoy talking to him a lot and it honestly feels like a stupid high school crush (I haven't seriously dated anyone since I was with Ben's father). Yesterday Ben found out I'd been texting Joe and got upset, saying that it's weird and that I can't date his friend. He compared it to \"what if you dated Matt\" (his 21 yr old friend since middle school). I don't think it's the same situation though. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The question is whether the author is in the wrong for dating her son's friend. Let me break down the situation.\n\nFirst, the author is 38, her son Ben is 21. She's a single mom who had him at 17. Ben has been dealing with depression and is now in a band with Joe, who is 29. Joe started hanging out with them through the band, which was initiated by Ben. The author met Joe at work, they talked about the band, and Joe joined. Then, there was casual interaction, like coffee when Ben was late. They started texting, and now Ben is upset because he found out they're dating.\n\nSo, the key points here: The author and Joe met through her son's band. Joe is a colleague, but they work in different departments. The initial interaction was about the band, which was Ben's idea. The author and Joe's relationship started after work interactions, and Ben is now upset about it. The author is considering whether she's in the wrong.\n\nI need to consider the dynamics here. From the author's perspective, she's a single parent who hasn't dated much since her son was born. She's trying to help Ben by getting him involved in a band. The relationship with Joe seems to have started from work and then moved to more personal. But Ben is now upset because he sees it as similar to dating his friend, which he doesn't like. \n\nIs the author in the wrong? Well, there's a potential conflict of interest here. Joe is Ben's friend and a colleague of the author. If they date, could that affect Ben's relationship with Joe or the author's work? Also, Ben is an adult, so he might have a right to be concerned about his friend. But the author is also an adult and entitled to her own relationships. However, the dynamic of mother-son and the fact that Joe is Ben's friend complicates things.\n\nThe author might not have considered Ben's feelings when pursuing a relationship with someone who's close to him. Even though Ben is an adult, the mother might have a responsibility to be sensitive to his feelings, especially given his history with depression. The author's actions could potentially affect Ben's mental health, which she's been working to improve. \n\nOn the other hand, the author isn't directly interfering with Ben's life; she's forming a relationship with someone who is also Ben's friend. But the fact that she met Joe through Ben and then started dating him might be seen as crossing a boundary. \n\nI think the author is in the wrong here because she didn't consider the potential impact on her son's feelings. Even though she's an adult and entitled to date, the relationship is with someone who is close to her son. The situation could create tension and hurt Ben, who might feel like his friend is being taken by his mother. The author should have thought about this before pursuing the relationship.\n"
