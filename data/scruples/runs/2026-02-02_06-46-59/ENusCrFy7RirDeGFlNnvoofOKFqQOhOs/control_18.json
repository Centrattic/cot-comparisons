His father was never really in the picture, so I was a single mother for the most part. Now I'm 38 and my son \"Ben\" is 21. He's been suffering from depression the past couple of years. I take him to therapy every week and he seems to be getting better but he's always been an introverted kid, so he seems lonely most days. When he was in high school, he was in a band but that quickly disbanded after one of the members graduated high school and went off to college. I recently made a suggestion for him to maybe start up a band again. To my surprise, he was excited about the idea but didn't really know where to start. I suggested he make posters to advertise and maybe place them around his campus. He got to work right away and showed me a flyer he had made. I asked if he wanted me to put it up on the bulletin board at my work place and he agreed.\n\nAs I was posting up the flyer on the board the next day, a colleague \"Joe\" walked up beside me and noticed the flyer (he's 29). I never really talked to Joe in the past because we work in different departments but I recognized his face and knew of him through other colleagues. We started talking about the band and Joe said he sings and plays his guitar every now and then. I told him he should audition and we both laughed about it, but toward the end of our conversation, he seemed interested, so I ripped off the part of the flyer that had Ben's phone number and gave it to him in case he wanted more information.\n\nLong story short, he audition and ended up in the band. The band consists of Ben, Joe, and two other people (both go to school with Ben). I'll admit, it was weird having Joe over at our place at first because we were colleagues and never hung out outside of work or work events, but I didn't mind it because Ben seemed happy and talks a lot about Joe (the two hang out often).\n\nA week ago, Joe was supposed to come over and work on some lyrics with Ben, but Ben was running late, so I invited Joe inside for a cup of coffee. We started chatting about work and complaining about our supervisors to each other, which was really nice to do because I haven't been able to vent to any of my other colleagues about work stress. We talked about the band and he played a sample of a song they were working on, which sounded similar to a song I had heard before but couldn't remember the name of. He asked for my number so that I could send him the song if I ended up remembering. I sent him the song that night and we've been texting all week since then. I enjoy talking to him a lot and it honestly feels like a stupid high school crush (I haven't seriously dated anyone since I was with Ben's father). Yesterday Ben found out I'd been texting Joe and got upset, saying that it's weird and that I can't date his friend. He compared it to \"what if you dated Matt\" (his 21 yr old friend since middle school). I don't think it's the same situation though. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is that the author is a single mom who's dating her son's friend, Joe. The son, Ben, found out and is upset. The question is whether the author is at fault.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the relationships involved. The author is Ben's mother, and Joe is his friend. The author met Joe through Ben's band. Initially, the author's main motivation was to help Ben by connecting him with Joe for the band. But then, the two started talking more, and eventually, they started dating. \n\nI should think about the dynamics here. The author is Ben's mother, so there's an inherent authority and caregiving role. Dating someone who is a friend of her adult son might complicate things. Since Ben is 21, he's an adult, but he's still his mother. The mother might feel a sense of responsibility to protect his interests, but in this case, the mother is the one entering a relationship with his friend. \n\nAnother angle is Ben's feelings. He mentioned feeling it's weird and that he compared the situation to if his mom dated his friend Matt. The mother argues that it's different, but Ben is clearly upset. The mother might not see it the same way, but Ben's perspective is important here. \n\nAlso, considering the age difference. The author is 38, Joe is 29. That's a difference of 9 years. Not too extreme, but still a factor. However, both are adults, so legally, there's no issue. The problem is more about the social and familial implications.\n\nThe mother's history should be considered. She hasn't dated since Ben's father left when she was 17. Now she's finding someone she's connected with. That's understandable, but the relationship development with Joe happened through her son's circle. There's a potential for conflict of interest here. For instance, if there's any romantic tension or jealousy from Ben, or if the mother's relationship with Joe affects her ability to be a neutral figure in Ben's life.\n\nAlso, when the mother invited Joe over for coffee without Ben present, that's when the texting started. It's possible that the mother didn't consider how Ben would feel about it. Even though Ben is an adult, the mother's actions might have overlooked his feelings, especially since they live together or have a close relationship. \n\nAnother point: the mother gave Joe Ben's number on the flyer, which led to Joe joining the band. Then, the mother and Joe started interacting more, leading to the relationship. The mother might not have realized the potential for conflict when she first connected them. But as things progressed, she should have considered Ben's perspective.\n\nIs the mother in the wrong because she's dating someone close to her son? Or is it Ben's reaction that's the issue here? It's a bit of a gray area. On one hand, the mother has the right to date as an adult. On the other hand, the relationship could create tension with her son. Since Ben is an adult, he can handle it, but the mother's responsibility as a parent might mean she should consider his feelings more carefully.\n\nThe key factors here are: \n1. The relationship between the mother and Joe began after they met through Ben's band.\n2. Ben is 21, an adult, but still in a close relationship with his mother.\n3. The mother might not have considered how Ben would feel when initiating contact with Joe beyond the band context.\n4. Ben's reaction is valid as he feels uncomfortable with his mother dating his friend.\n\nSo, the question is whether the mother acted inconsiderately by not foreseeing Ben's discomfort. If the mother didn't consult Ben or consider his feelings before pursuing a relationship with Joe, she might be at fault. However, she is an adult with the right to date, so it's debatable. But since the relationship was initiated through her son's circle and might affect their relationship negatively, she could be seen as in the wrong for not being more mindful of Ben's perspective.\n\nI think the answer is A (Yes, the author is in the wrong) because she didn't consider her son's feelings when entering a relationship with his friend, especially since the friend was connected through their shared activity. Even though both are adults, the mother's role as a parent should take her son's well-being into account, and she might have overlooked that in this case.\n"
