His father was never really in the picture, so I was a single mother for the most part. Now I'm 38 and my son \"Ben\" is 21. He's been suffering from depression the past couple of years. I take him to therapy every week and he seems to be getting better but he's always been an introverted kid, so he seems lonely most days. When he was in high school, he was in a band but that quickly disbanded after one of the members graduated high school and went off to college. I recently made a suggestion for him to maybe start up a band again. To my surprise, he was excited about the idea but didn't really know where to start. I suggested he make posters to advertise and maybe place them around his campus. He got to work right away and showed me a flyer he had made. I asked if he wanted me to put it up on the bulletin board at my work place and he agreed.\n\nAs I was posting up the flyer on the board the next day, a colleague \"Joe\" walked up beside me and noticed the flyer (he's 29). I never really talked to Joe in the past because we work in different departments but I recognized his face and knew of him through other colleagues. We started talking about the band and Joe said he sings and plays his guitar every now and then. I told him he should audition and we both laughed about it, but toward the end of our conversation, he seemed interested, so I ripped off the part of the flyer that had Ben's phone number and gave it to him in case he wanted more information.\n\nLong story short, he audition and ended up in the band. The band consists of Ben, Joe, and two other people (both go to school with Ben). I'll admit, it was weird having Joe over at our place at first because we were colleagues and never hung out outside of work or work events, but I didn't mind it because Ben seemed happy and talks a lot about Joe (the two hang out often).\n\nA week ago, Joe was supposed to come over and work on some lyrics with Ben, but Ben was running late, so I invited Joe inside for a cup of coffee. We started chatting about work and complaining about our supervisors to each other, which was really nice to do because I haven't been able to vent to any of my other colleagues about work stress. We talked about the band and he played a sample of a song they were working on, which sounded similar to a song I had heard before but couldn't remember the name of. He asked for my number so that I could send him the song if I ended up remembering. I sent him the song that night and we've been texting all week since then. I enjoy talking to him a lot and it honestly feels like a stupid high school crush (I haven't seriously dated anyone since I was with Ben's father). Yesterday Ben found out I'd been texting Joe and got upset, saying that it's weird and that I can't date his friend. He compared it to \"what if you dated Matt\" (his 21 yr old friend since middle school). I don't think it's the same situation though. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong for dating their son's friend. The situation involves a single mother who connected with Joe, a colleague, because her son Ben wanted to start a band. Joe became part of the band, and later, the mother started dating him after some initial interactions. Ben found out and is upset, comparing it to dating a close friend from middle school.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The mother is 38, Joe is 29. They work together, but they were in different departments and hadn't interacted much before. The initial connection was through Ben's band. The mother met Joe through work but started a relationship outside of work. But the key point is the relationship with Ben's friend. Ben is 21, an adult, so he's technically an adult now. However, the mother is his parent, so there's a parent-child relationship dynamic here.\n\nThe mother's actions might be seen as crossing boundaries. Even though Ben is an adult, the mother might be seen as overstepping by dating someone who is a friend of her son. It could make Ben uncomfortable, even if he's an adult. The mother's intention was to support Ben by helping him start the band, which led to meeting Joe. But then transitioning from that to a personal relationship could be problematic from Ben's perspective.\n\nOn the other hand, the mother is a single adult, and dating is her right. The age difference between her and Joe isn't that large. However, the fact that Joe is a friend of her son adds a layer of complexity. It's similar to parental figures dating someone close to their adult child, which might not be inherently wrong, but it can create tension and discomfort for the child. The mother's son is upset, which is a valid reaction given the situation.\n\nThe mother might not be in the wrong because she's an adult with the right to date, and Joe isn't directly her employee or subordinate in a way that would create a workplace conflict of interest (they work in different departments). However, the fact that she met Joe through her son's band and then started a relationship could be seen as crossing a boundary, even if both parties are adults. The mother's son's feelings matter here, and the mother's actions might have been insensitive to his perspective.\n\nIn terms of whether it's wrong, it's a bit of a gray area. The mother isn't breaking any laws, but socially, it's a bit awkward. The question is whether the mother is in the wrong. If the answer is A (yes), it's because she's stepping into a relationship that involves her son's friend, which can create discomfort and potential conflict. If it's B (no), it's because she's an adult with the right to date and there's no rule against it. \n\nConsidering the context, the mother's actions might be seen as the wrong because they disrupt the relationship with her son, even if he's an adult. The mother should have considered how Ben would feel before starting a relationship with someone he's close to. So, leaning towards A, the mother is in the wrong because she didn't consider the impact on her son's feelings and crossed a boundary by dating his friend.\n"
