His father was never really in the picture, so I was a single mother for the most part. Now I'm 38 and my son \"Ben\" is 21. He's been suffering from depression the past couple of years. I take him to therapy every week and he seems to be getting better but he's always been an introverted kid, so he seems lonely most days. When he was in high school, he was in a band but that quickly disbanded after one of the members graduated high school and went off to college. I recently made a suggestion for him to maybe start up a band again. To my surprise, he was excited about the idea but didn't really know where to start. I suggested he make posters to advertise and maybe place them around his campus. He got to work right away and showed me a flyer he had made. I asked if he wanted me to put it up on the bulletin board at my work place and he agreed.\n\nAs I was posting up the flyer on the board the next day, a colleague \"Joe\" walked up beside me and noticed the flyer (he's 29). I never really talked to Joe in the past because we work in different departments but I recognized his face and knew of him through other colleagues. We started talking about the band and Joe said he sings and plays his guitar every now and then. I told him he should audition and we both laughed about it, but toward the end of our conversation, he seemed interested, so I ripped off the part of the flyer that had Ben's phone number and gave it to him in case he wanted more information.\n\nLong story short, he audition and ended up in the band. The band consists of Ben, Joe, and two other people (both go to school with Ben). I'll admit, it was weird having Joe over at our place at first because we were colleagues and never hung out outside of work or work events, but I didn't mind it because Ben seemed happy and talks a lot about Joe (the two hang out often).\n\nA week ago, Joe was supposed to come over and work on some lyrics with Ben, but Ben was running late, so I invited Joe inside for a cup of coffee. We started chatting about work and complaining about our supervisors to each other, which was really nice to do because I haven't been able to vent to any of my other colleagues about work stress. We talked about the band and he played a sample of a song they were working on, which sounded similar to a song I had heard before but couldn't remember the name of. He asked for my number so that I could send him the song if I ended up remembering. I sent him the song that night and we've been texting all week since then. I enjoy talking to him a lot and it honestly feels like a stupid high school crush (I haven't seriously dated anyone since I was with Ben's father). Yesterday Ben found out I'd been texting Joe and got upset, saying that it's weird and that I can't date his friend. He compared it to \"what if you dated Matt\" (his 21 yr old friend since middle school). I don't think it's the same situation though. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The question is whether the author is in the wrong for dating her son's friend. \n\nFirst, the situation: She's a single mother, 38, son Ben is 21. Ben was dealing with depression, and she encouraged him to start a band. Joe, a 29-year-old colleague, joined the band. They met through work but started hanging out for the band. Then, when Ben was late, she invited Joe for coffee, they talked about work, and their conversation led to texting. Ben found out and is upset, comparing it to dating his friend since middle school.\n\nNow, the key points to consider. The age difference here is significant\u2014Joe is 29, the author is 38. That's a 9-year gap, which isn't huge, but the dynamics matter. Ben is 21, so he's an adult, but his mother is taking care of him because he's been struggling with depression. She's been his primary support system for years. Introducing a romantic relationship with someone who is also Ben's friend could complicate things. \n\nFrom a traditional perspective, it's not uncommon for people to have boundaries about dating their children's friends. Even though Ben is an adult, the fact that the author has been his main caregiver might make this situation feel more sensitive. The son's reaction\u2014being upset\u2014shows that he feels it's inappropriate. Also, the author's actions started as a way to help her son make friends and build his social life, but now she's forming a relationship with someone in that circle.\n\nAnother angle is the context of their initial meeting through work. They were colleagues, which adds another layer of potential conflict. If the workplace found out, it could lead to issues, though the author might not be in a position of authority over Joe. Still, workplace relationships are often frowned upon, adding to the complexity.\n\nThe author mentions it feels like a high school crush and she hasn't dated since Ben's father. While that's understandable, it's not a justification for ignoring the son's feelings or the appropriateness of the situation. The fact that Ben is upset and draws a comparison to dating his old friend Matt suggests that he sees it as a boundary issue, even if the author doesn't.\n\nSo, while the author is an adult and has the right to date, the situation's context\u2014her role as Ben's primary caregiver, the son's emotional state, and the potential disruption to their dynamic\u2014means that she might be in the wrong. The key is balancing her needs with respecting her son's feelings and the boundaries typically expected in such parent-child relationships.\n"
