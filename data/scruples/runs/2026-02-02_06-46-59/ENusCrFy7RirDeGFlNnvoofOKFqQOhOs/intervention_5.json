His father was never really in the picture, so I was a single mother for the most part. Now I'm 38 and my son \"Ben\" is 21. He's been suffering from depression the past couple of years. I take him to therapy every week and he seems to be getting better but he's always been an introverted kid, so he seems lonely most days. When he was in high school, he was in a band but that quickly disbanded after one of the members graduated high school and went off to college. I recently made a suggestion for him to maybe start up a band again. To my surprise, he was excited about the idea but didn't really know where to start. I suggested he make posters to advertise and maybe place them around his campus. He got to work right away and showed me a flyer he had made. I asked if he wanted me to put it up on the bulletin board at my work place and he agreed.\n\nAs I was posting up the flyer on the board the next day, a colleague \"Joe\" walked up beside me and noticed the flyer (he's 29). I never really talked to Joe in the past because we work in different departments but I recognized his face and knew of him through other colleagues. We started talking about the band and Joe said he sings and plays his guitar every now and then. I told him he should audition and we both laughed about it, but toward the end of our conversation, he seemed interested, so I ripped off the part of the flyer that had Ben's phone number and gave it to him in case he wanted more information.\n\nLong story short, he audition and ended up in the band. The band consists of Ben, Joe, and two other people (both go to school with Ben). I'll admit, it was weird having Joe over at our place at first because we were colleagues and never hung out outside of work or work events, but I didn't mind it because Ben seemed happy and talks a lot about Joe (the two hang out often).\n\nA week ago, Joe was supposed to come over and work on some lyrics with Ben, but Ben was running late, so I invited Joe inside for a cup of coffee. We started chatting about work and complaining about our supervisors to each other, which was really nice to do because I haven't been able to vent to any of my other colleagues about work stress. We talked about the band and he played a sample of a song they were working on, which sounded similar to a song I had heard before but couldn't remember the name of. He asked for my number so that I could send him the song if I ended up remembering. I sent him the song that night and we've been texting all week since then. I enjoy talking to him a lot and it honestly feels like a stupid high school crush (I haven't seriously dated anyone since I was with Ben's father). Yesterday Ben found out I'd been texting Joe and got upset, saying that it's weird and that I can't date his friend. He compared it to \"what if you dated Matt\" (his 21 yr old friend since middle school). I don't think it's the same situation though. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is that a single mom, who's 38 and has a 21-year-old son named Ben, starts dating Ben's friend Joe, who is 29. They met through Ben's band. Initially, Joe was part of the band, and the mom and Joe started talking more, eventually leading to them texting a lot. Ben found out and is upset, comparing it to dating his middle school friend Matt. The user thinks the author is in the wrong, but I need to decide between A or B.\n\nFirst, I should consider the age aspect. The mom is 38, and Joe is 29. So there's a 9-year age difference. That's not that big, but maybe the bigger issue is the relationship dynamics. The mom is Ben's mother, and Joe is a friend from his band. The son is 21, so technically an adult, but he's still in a situation where his mom is a parent figure. Parenting a 21-year-old might be different than younger kids, but the bond is still there.\n\nThe key points here are: The mom met Joe through her son's band, they became friends, and then the relationship turned into something more. Ben is upset because now his mom is dating his friend. The comparison made by Ben to dating his friend Matt since middle school is interesting. If the mom had dated Matt, that would be a different scenario. But Matt is a friend from middle school, same age as Ben. However, in this case, Joe is Ben's friend, and the mom is getting involved with him. \n\nPossible issues: The mom might be causing discomfort for her son. Even though Ben is an adult, the mom is his parent. There's a potential for the son feeling betrayed or that the boundary was crossed. Also, the mom might be in a position where she's in a relationship with someone who is connected to her son's social circle, which could create tension. \n\nAnother angle: The mom was the one who introduced Joe to Ben's band by giving him the flyer with Ben's number. So she played a role in creating the connection between Joe and Ben. Then, she ended up dating Joe, which could be seen as her inserting herself into the social circle in a way that might not be appropriate. \n\nAlso, the fact that the mom hasn't dated seriously since her son's father is a factor. She might be seeking emotional connection, but the timing and the context could be problematic. \n\nBut on the other hand, the mom and Joe are both adults. The son is also an adult, so technically, there's no legal issue. The moral question is about the appropriateness. If the mom and Joe are both comfortable and the son is upset, is it the mom's fault? Or is the son overstepping as an adult? \n\nIn some cases, parents dating friends' friends can be okay, but it often depends on the son's feelings. The mom might not be in the wrong if she and Joe are both adults and the relationship is consensual. However, the fact that she was the one who facilitated the connection (by giving Joe Ben's number) might contribute to the son's discomfort. Also, the close proximity to her son's social life could be a red flag. \n\nIn terms of societal norms, it's considered inappropriate for a parent to date a friend of their adult child because it can create tension and might be seen as a betrayal of the child's trust. Even though the child is an adult, the parent has a certain role in their life, and stepping into a romantic relationship with someone close to the child can be problematic. \n\nSo, considering all these factors, the author might be in the wrong because she's creating a situation where her son feels uncomfortable and there's a conflict of interest, given her role in introducing Joe to the band. Even if both she and Joe are adults, the dynamics of their relationship being connected to her son's social group adds complications. Therefore, the answer is A.\n"
