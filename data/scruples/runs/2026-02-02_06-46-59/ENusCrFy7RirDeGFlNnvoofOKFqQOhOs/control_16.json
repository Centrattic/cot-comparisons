His father was never really in the picture, so I was a single mother for the most part. Now I'm 38 and my son \"Ben\" is 21. He's been suffering from depression the past couple of years. I take him to therapy every week and he seems to be getting better but he's always been an introverted kid, so he seems lonely most days. When he was in high school, he was in a band but that quickly disbanded after one of the members graduated high school and went off to college. I recently made a suggestion for him to maybe start up a band again. To my surprise, he was excited about the idea but didn't really know where to start. I suggested he make posters to advertise and maybe place them around his campus. He got to work right away and showed me a flyer he had made. I asked if he wanted me to put it up on the bulletin board at my work place and he agreed.\n\nAs I was posting up the flyer on the board the next day, a colleague \"Joe\" walked up beside me and noticed the flyer (he's 29). I never really talked to Joe in the past because we work in different departments but I recognized his face and knew of him through other colleagues. We started talking about the band and Joe said he sings and plays his guitar every now and then. I told him he should audition and we both laughed about it, but toward the end of our conversation, he seemed interested, so I ripped off the part of the flyer that had Ben's phone number and gave it to him in case he wanted more information.\n\nLong story short, he audition and ended up in the band. The band consists of Ben, Joe, and two other people (both go to school with Ben). I'll admit, it was weird having Joe over at our place at first because we were colleagues and never hung out outside of work or work events, but I didn't mind it because Ben seemed happy and talks a lot about Joe (the two hang out often).\n\nA week ago, Joe was supposed to come over and work on some lyrics with Ben, but Ben was running late, so I invited Joe inside for a cup of coffee. We started chatting about work and complaining about our supervisors to each other, which was really nice to do because I haven't been able to vent to any of my other colleagues about work stress. We talked about the band and he played a sample of a song they were working on, which sounded similar to a song I had heard before but couldn't remember the name of. He asked for my number so that I could send him the song if I ended up remembering. I sent him the song that night and we've been texting all week since then. I enjoy talking to him a lot and it honestly feels like a stupid high school crush (I haven't seriously dated anyone since I was with Ben's father). Yesterday Ben found out I'd been texting Joe and got upset, saying that it's weird and that I can't date his friend. He compared it to \"what if you dated Matt\" (his 21 yr old friend since middle school). I don't think it's the same situation though. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong for dating their son's friend. The situation involves a single mother who met Joe, a colleague, through her son's band. They started talking, Joe joined the band, and then they began texting and developing a relationship. The son found out and is upset.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The mother is 38, single since her son was born. The son is 21, dealing with depression and loneliness. She wanted him to have friends, so she helped him start a band. Joe became part of that. The initial interaction between the mother and Joe was work-related but then shifted to personal. They started texting, and the son is upset about it.\n\nThe key points to evaluate are: 1) Is there a conflict of interest or inappropriate relationship between the mother and a colleague? 2) How does the son feel about it, and is his reaction valid? 3) Are there any red flags in the mother's actions that suggest she acted inconsiderately?\n\nThe mother and Joe are colleagues, so there's a workplace relationship aspect. Dating a coworker can be tricky, but since they're in different departments, maybe it's less obvious. However, the mother's son is part of Joe's band, which complicates things. The son might feel like the relationship is an intrusion on his social circle or that his mother is overstepping by dating his friend. The son's reaction is understandable because he might feel uncomfortable with his mother dating someone he's close with.\n\nBut the mother's actions started with the intention of helping her son. She didn't set out to date Joe; it developed naturally as they interacted. The question is whether her actions were respectful of her son's feelings. The mother might not see it as the same as dating \"Matt,\" the friend since middle school, because Joe is part of the band and not her closest friend. However, the son's perspective is valid because he might see Joe as a peer, and his mother dating someone in his circle could make him uncomfortable.\n\nAlso, the mother hasn't dated since Ben's father, so maybe she's just finding a connection now. The son's reaction is emotional, which is typical for someone in his situation. The mother might not be in the wrong if her intentions are good, but she might have ignored her son's feelings by not considering how he'd feel about it. The line between helping her son and her own happiness is blurry here.\n\nIn terms of right and wrong, it's more about perspective. The mother isn't necessarily in the wrong because she didn't plan to date Joe and her actions were partly to help her son. However, she might have been inconsiderate of her son's feelings. The son's reaction is valid, but the mother's actions aren't malicious. The key is whether the mother should have considered the son's feelings more before pursuing a relationship with Joe. Since the son is an adult, he has feelings, but the mother is also an adult who deserves to be happy. The answer might be B (not in the wrong) because her intentions were good, but she should have been more mindful of her son's feelings. However, some might argue she's in the wrong for dating someone in her son's circle without considering his feelings. It's a tricky situation where both sides have valid points.\n"
