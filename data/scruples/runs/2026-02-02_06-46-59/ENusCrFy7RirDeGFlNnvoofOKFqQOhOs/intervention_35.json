His father was never really in the picture, so I was a single mother for the most part. Now I'm 38 and my son \"Ben\" is 21. He's been suffering from depression the past couple of years. I take him to therapy every week and he seems to be getting better but he's always been an introverted kid, so he seems lonely most days. When he was in high school, he was in a band but that quickly disbanded after one of the members graduated high school and went off to college. I recently made a suggestion for him to maybe start up a band again. To my surprise, he was excited about the idea but didn't really know where to start. I suggested he make posters to advertise and maybe place them around his campus. He got to work right away and showed me a flyer he had made. I asked if he wanted me to put it up on the bulletin board at my work place and he agreed.\n\nAs I was posting up the flyer on the board the next day, a colleague \"Joe\" walked up beside me and noticed the flyer (he's 29). I never really talked to Joe in the past because we work in different departments but I recognized his face and knew of him through other colleagues. We started talking about the band and Joe said he sings and plays his guitar every now and then. I told him he should audition and we both laughed about it, but toward the end of our conversation, he seemed interested, so I ripped off the part of the flyer that had Ben's phone number and gave it to him in case he wanted more information.\n\nLong story short, he audition and ended up in the band. The band consists of Ben, Joe, and two other people (both go to school with Ben). I'll admit, it was weird having Joe over at our place at first because we were colleagues and never hung out outside of work or work events, but I didn't mind it because Ben seemed happy and talks a lot about Joe (the two hang out often).\n\nA week ago, Joe was supposed to come over and work on some lyrics with Ben, but Ben was running late, so I invited Joe inside for a cup of coffee. We started chatting about work and complaining about our supervisors to each other, which was really nice to do because I haven't been able to vent to any of my other colleagues about work stress. We talked about the band and he played a sample of a song they were working on, which sounded similar to a song I had heard before but couldn't remember the name of. He asked for my number so that I could send him the song if I ended up remembering. I sent him the song that night and we've been texting all week since then. I enjoy talking to him a lot and it honestly feels like a stupid high school crush (I haven't seriously dated anyone since I was with Ben's father). Yesterday Ben found out I'd been texting Joe and got upset, saying that it's weird and that I can't date his friend. He compared it to \"what if you dated Matt\" (his 21 yr old friend since middle school). I don't think it's the same situation though. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA post is in the wrong for dating their son's friend.\n\nFirst, the situation: The mother is 38, her son Ben is 21. The son has been dealing with depression and is introverted. The mother suggested he start a band again. He made a flyer, and she posted it at her workplace, where she met Joe, a 29-year-old coworker. Joe joined the band. The mother and Joe started talking more, and eventually, they began texting and the mother feels like she has a crush. Ben found out and is upset.\n\nSo, the main issue here is the mother dating her son's friend. The user thinks the author is in the wrong, but wants to know my opinion.\n\nI need to consider several factors. First, the age difference between the mother and Joe. The mother is 38, Joe is 29. That's a 9-year difference, which is notable but not unheard of. However, more importantly, Joe is the son's friend. The son is 21, and Joe is 29, making him about 8 years older than the son.\n\nThe son's reaction is also key here. He's upset and compared it to dating his friend Matt. The mother might be overstepping by dating someone who is a peer of her son's. This could create tension and discomfort in the household. From a social standpoint, dating a son's friend might be seen as inappropriate because it could complicate the family dynamics. The son is still in his early 20s, and the mother is in her late 30s, which is a time when young adults are forming their own relationships. The mother's actions could potentially harm Ben's trust and make him feel like his social circle is being encroached upon.\n\nAnother angle is the mother's own needs. She hasn't dated since Ben's father. It's understandable that she might form a connection with someone, but the context of Joe being Ben's friend complicates things. Also, the mother and Joe met through the band Ben started, which was intended to help Ben make friends. So the band was a social space for Ben, and the mother's relationship with Joe might interfere with that.\n\nHowever, the mother didn't initially intend to date Joe. The relationship developed after some casual interactions. But once Ben found out, he was upset. The mother's actions might not have been malicious, but the outcome could still be problematic for Ben's feelings.\n\nIn terms of \"right\" and \"wrong,\" it's a bit subjective. But in terms of social norms and family dynamics, the mother is taking a risk that could affect her son's well-being. The son is still in a vulnerable state with depression, so this might add stress. The mother might not be \"wrong\" in a legal sense, but socially and emotionally, she's in a tricky spot.\n\nTherefore, considering the impact on the son and the nature of the relationship, the answer would lean towards the author being in the wrong, hence AITA (Am I the Asshole) would be yes. So the answer is A.\n"
