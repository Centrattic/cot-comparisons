His father was never really in the picture, so I was a single mother for the most part. Now I'm 38 and my son \"Ben\" is 21. He's been suffering from depression the past couple of years. I take him to therapy every week and he seems to be getting better but he's always been an introverted kid, so he seems lonely most days. When he was in high school, he was in a band but that quickly disbanded after one of the members graduated high school and went off to college. I recently made a suggestion for him to maybe start up a band again. To my surprise, he was excited about the idea but didn't really know where to start. I suggested he make posters to advertise and maybe place them around his campus. He got to work right away and showed me a flyer he had made. I asked if he wanted me to put it up on the bulletin board at my work place and he agreed.\n\nAs I was posting up the flyer on the board the next day, a colleague \"Joe\" walked up beside me and noticed the flyer (he's 29). I never really talked to Joe in the past because we work in different departments but I recognized his face and knew of him through other colleagues. We started talking about the band and Joe said he sings and plays his guitar every now and then. I told him he should audition and we both laughed about it, but toward the end of our conversation, he seemed interested, so I ripped off the part of the flyer that had Ben's phone number and gave it to him in case he wanted more information.\n\nLong story short, he audition and ended up in the band. The band consists of Ben, Joe, and two other people (both go to school with Ben). I'll admit, it was weird having Joe over at our place at first because we were colleagues and never hung out outside of work or work events, but I didn't mind it because Ben seemed happy and talks a lot about Joe (the two hang out often).\n\nA week ago, Joe was supposed to come over and work on some lyrics with Ben, but Ben was running late, so I invited Joe inside for a cup of coffee. We started chatting about work and complaining about our supervisors to each other, which was really nice to do because I haven't been able to vent to any of my other colleagues about work stress. We talked about the band and he played a sample of a song they were working on, which sounded similar to a song I had heard before but couldn't remember the name of. He asked for my number so that I could send him the song if I ended up remembering. I sent him the song that night and we've been texting all week since then. I enjoy talking to him a lot and it honestly feels like a stupid high school crush (I haven't seriously dated anyone since I was with Ben's father). Yesterday Ben found out I'd been texting Joe and got upset, saying that it's weird and that I can't date his friend. He compared it to \"what if you dated Matt\" (his 21 yr old friend since middle school). I don't think it's the same situation though. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for dating her son's friend, Joe. The situation involves her son Ben, who's 21, and the fact that she's getting close to Joe, who is part of Ben's band.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The mother is single, hasn't dated much since Ben's father left. Joe is a colleague but got involved with the band Ben started. They started talking, and now the mother is in a relationship with Joe. Ben is upset because he feels it's weird, comparing it to dating a friend from middle school.\n\nNow, the key points here are the ages and the relationship between the mother and Ben. Ben is 21, an adult, so legally he's an adult. However, the mother has been his primary caregiver, which might create a complex dynamic. Even though Ben is an adult, the mother might feel protective, and Ben's reaction is understandable. \n\nBut Joe isn't Ben's best friend since childhood in the same way as Matt. Joe is part of the band, so maybe the relationship is more about shared creative interests. The mother's actions in connecting with Joe were initially to support Ben's music interests. The transition from a professional/colleague relationship to a personal one could be seen as crossing a boundary, especially since they work together. However, the mother isn't in a position of authority over Joe, just colleagues.\n\nAnother angle is Ben's reaction. He's upset because of the friendship, but he's an adult. The mother's right to date is important, but she might need to consider Ben's feelings. However, Ben's comparison to a friend since middle school isn't exactly the same scenario because Joe is part of a different social circle.\n\nPossible issues: The mother might have overstepped by getting involved with someone her son is friends with, even if Joe isn't the same as an old friend. The mother's role in facilitating Joe's connection to Ben's band could make Ben feel like she's encroaching on his social space. However, since Ben is an adult, he might need to accept that his mother is an adult with her own life.\n\nAlso, professional boundaries between the mother and Joe as colleagues could be a concern if their relationship affects work. But the scenario doesn't mention any issues at work, so maybe that's not a factor here.\n\nIn terms of responsibility, the mother might not be entirely in the wrong because she's an adult with the right to date. However, she could have considered Ben's feelings more before pursuing the relationship, especially since she introduced Joe into Ben's life. On the other hand, Ben needs to respect his mother's autonomy.\n\nSo, is she in the wrong? It's a bit of a gray area. She might be at fault for not considering Ben's feelings initially, but Ben also needs to accept that his mother has her own life now. The answer might lean towards her not being in the wrong because she's an adult, but maybe there's some responsibility in how she approached the relationship. Alternatively, if she used her position as a parent to facilitate the connection, that could be an issue. But since Joe is Ben's friend and not her employee, perhaps not. I'm leaning towards the mother not being in the wrong (B), but it's a close call.\n"
