His father was never really in the picture, so I was a single mother for the most part. Now I'm 38 and my son \"Ben\" is 21. He's been suffering from depression the past couple of years. I take him to therapy every week and he seems to be getting better but he's always been an introverted kid, so he seems lonely most days. When he was in high school, he was in a band but that quickly disbanded after one of the members graduated high school and went off to college. I recently made a suggestion for him to maybe start up a band again. To my surprise, he was excited about the idea but didn't really know where to start. I suggested he make posters to advertise and maybe place them around his campus. He got to work right away and showed me a flyer he had made. I asked if he wanted me to put it up on the bulletin board at my work place and he agreed.\n\nAs I was posting up the flyer on the board the next day, a colleague \"Joe\" walked up beside me and noticed the flyer (he's 29). I never really talked to Joe in the past because we work in different departments but I recognized his face and knew of him through other colleagues. We started talking about the band and Joe said he sings and plays his guitar every now and then. I told him he should audition and we both laughed about it, but toward the end of our conversation, he seemed interested, so I ripped off the part of the flyer that had Ben's phone number and gave it to him in case he wanted more information.\n\nLong story short, he audition and ended up in the band. The band consists of Ben, Joe, and two other people (both go to school with Ben). I'll admit, it was weird having Joe over at our place at first because we were colleagues and never hung out outside of work or work events, but I didn't mind it because Ben seemed happy and talks a lot about Joe (the two hang out often).\n\nA week ago, Joe was supposed to come over and work on some lyrics with Ben, but Ben was running late, so I invited Joe inside for a cup of coffee. We started chatting about work and complaining about our supervisors to each other, which was really nice to do because I haven't been able to vent to any of my other colleagues about work stress. We talked about the band and he played a sample of a song they were working on, which sounded similar to a song I had heard before but couldn't remember the name of. He asked for my number so that I could send him the song if I ended up remembering. I sent him the song that night and we've been texting all week since then. I enjoy talking to him a lot and it honestly feels like a stupid high school crush (I haven't seriously dated anyone since I was with Ben's father). Yesterday Ben found out I'd been texting Joe and got upset, saying that it's weird and that I can't date his friend. He compared it to \"what if you dated Matt\" (his 21 yr old friend since middle school). I don't think it's the same situation though. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong for dating their son's friend. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the mother is 38, her son Ben is 21. She's been a single mom since he was young. Ben has depression and is introverted, so she's been trying to help him by getting him into a band. She posted a flyer for the band at her workplace, and Joe, a 29-year-old colleague, ended up joining the band. They started talking, and eventually, the mother and Joe started texting and developing a relationship. Now Ben is upset because he feels it's weird, comparing it to dating his friend Matt.\n\nHmm. The key points here are the relationships involved. The mother is Ben's parent, and Joe is Ben's friend. The age difference between the mother and Joe is 9 years. But Ben is an adult, so maybe that's part of the consideration. The mother hasn't dated in a long time, and she's connecting with Joe. But Ben is upset because he sees Joe as a friend, like how he would with Matt.\n\nIs the mother wrong? Well, she's an adult, and Joe is an adult. There's no legal issue here. But there's a social dynamic. She's the mother of one of Joe's friends. That could create tension. However, the user thinks the author is in the wrong. Let me consider both sides.\n\nOn one hand, Ben is an adult and his feelings matter, even if he's upset. The mother might be overstepping by dating his friend, potentially complicating their relationship. On the other hand, the mother is single and looking for companionship, which is her right. She's not Ben's parent in a legal sense anymore since he's 21, but the emotional bond is still there. The mother might feel she's doing what's right for her, but Ben's feelings are valid too.\n\nThe question is whether the mother is in the wrong. The answer depends on the context. If the mother and Joe were to date, it might create a complicated dynamic with Ben and his friends. However, there's no inherent wrong in her forming a relationship if both parties are consenting adults. The main issue is the relationship with Ben's friend, but Ben is an adult and can handle it, though it's understandable he'd feel upset. The mother might not be in the wrong, but she should consider Ben's feelings and communicate with him. So maybe the answer is B, the author is not in the wrong, but there's a need for sensitivity. Alternatively, maybe A if the mother is ignoring Ben's feelings. But since Ben is an adult, her decision isn't necessarily wrong. I think B is the answer.\n"
