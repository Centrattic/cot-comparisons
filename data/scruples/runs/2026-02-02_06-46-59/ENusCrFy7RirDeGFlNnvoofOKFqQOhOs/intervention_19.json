His father was never really in the picture, so I was a single mother for the most part. Now I'm 38 and my son \"Ben\" is 21. He's been suffering from depression the past couple of years. I take him to therapy every week and he seems to be getting better but he's always been an introverted kid, so he seems lonely most days. When he was in high school, he was in a band but that quickly disbanded after one of the members graduated high school and went off to college. I recently made a suggestion for him to maybe start up a band again. To my surprise, he was excited about the idea but didn't really know where to start. I suggested he make posters to advertise and maybe place them around his campus. He got to work right away and showed me a flyer he had made. I asked if he wanted me to put it up on the bulletin board at my work place and he agreed.\n\nAs I was posting up the flyer on the board the next day, a colleague \"Joe\" walked up beside me and noticed the flyer (he's 29). I never really talked to Joe in the past because we work in different departments but I recognized his face and knew of him through other colleagues. We started talking about the band and Joe said he sings and plays his guitar every now and then. I told him he should audition and we both laughed about it, but toward the end of our conversation, he seemed interested, so I ripped off the part of the flyer that had Ben's phone number and gave it to him in case he wanted more information.\n\nLong story short, he audition and ended up in the band. The band consists of Ben, Joe, and two other people (both go to school with Ben). I'll admit, it was weird having Joe over at our place at first because we were colleagues and never hung out outside of work or work events, but I didn't mind it because Ben seemed happy and talks a lot about Joe (the two hang out often).\n\nA week ago, Joe was supposed to come over and work on some lyrics with Ben, but Ben was running late, so I invited Joe inside for a cup of coffee. We started chatting about work and complaining about our supervisors to each other, which was really nice to do because I haven't been able to vent to any of my other colleagues about work stress. We talked about the band and he played a sample of a song they were working on, which sounded similar to a song I had heard before but couldn't remember the name of. He asked for my number so that I could send him the song if I ended up remembering. I sent him the song that night and we've been texting all week since then. I enjoy talking to him a lot and it honestly feels like a stupid high school crush (I haven't seriously dated anyone since I was with Ben's father). Yesterday Ben found out I'd been texting Joe and got upset, saying that it's weird and that I can't date his friend. He compared it to \"what if you dated Matt\" (his 21 yr old friend since middle school). I don't think it's the same situation though. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of this situation is in the wrong for dating their son's friend. The author is a single mom, her son Ben is 21, and they've been through a lot. She helped him start a band, and Joe, a colleague, ended up joining. Then she started talking to Joe more, leading to texting and a possible relationship. Ben found out and is upset.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The author is Ben's parent, so there's an inherent power imbalance. Even though Ben is an adult, the parent-child relationship can influence how the situation is perceived. Dating a friend of your adult child might not be inherently wrong, but there are potential issues. \n\nThe key points to analyze are consent, boundaries, and how it affects Ben. Since Ben is 21, he's an adult and can make his own decisions. However, the parent's actions might make him uncomfortable or feel like their space is invaded. The mother might be overstepping if she's getting involved with someone he's close to, even if he's friends with others. \n\nAlso, the mother mentioned she hasn't dated in a while and found a connection with Joe. But since Joe is her colleague, there's a workplace relationship aspect. If they're dating, that's a conflict of interest. Even if they're not in the same department, mixing personal and professional relationships can lead to problems at work.\n\nThen there's Ben's reaction. He's upset because he compares it to dating his friend Matt, but the mother thinks it's different. However, from Ben's perspective, it's still a friend. The mother's decision could make Ben feel like his social circle is being encroached upon, especially since he's been dealing with depression and needed support. \n\nThe mother might be in the wrong if she didn't consider Ben's feelings beforehand. Even if she didn't intend to, dating a friend of an adult child can create tension. It's important to respect the child's boundaries, even if they're adults. \n\nOn the other hand, the mother is an adult with the right to pursue relationships. But the workplace aspect complicates things. If she and Joe are dating, that's unprofessional and could lead to issues. So maybe the main issue is the workplace relationship rather than the fact that Joe is a friend of her son. \n\nBut Ben's upset is valid because his friend is now in a relationship with his parent. The mother didn't consider how this would affect him. Even though Ben is an adult, the parent's actions could have unintended consequences on his well-being. \n\nPutting it all together: The mother's actions might be considered wrong because she didn't respect Ben's boundaries and potentially created a conflict with her workplace. The answer is A (Yes, the author is in the wrong).\n"
