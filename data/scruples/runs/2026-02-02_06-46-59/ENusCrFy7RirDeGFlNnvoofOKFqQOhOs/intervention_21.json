His father was never really in the picture, so I was a single mother for the most part. Now I'm 38 and my son \"Ben\" is 21. He's been suffering from depression the past couple of years. I take him to therapy every week and he seems to be getting better but he's always been an introverted kid, so he seems lonely most days. When he was in high school, he was in a band but that quickly disbanded after one of the members graduated high school and went off to college. I recently made a suggestion for him to maybe start up a band again. To my surprise, he was excited about the idea but didn't really know where to start. I suggested he make posters to advertise and maybe place them around his campus. He got to work right away and showed me a flyer he had made. I asked if he wanted me to put it up on the bulletin board at my work place and he agreed.\n\nAs I was posting up the flyer on the board the next day, a colleague \"Joe\" walked up beside me and noticed the flyer (he's 29). I never really talked to Joe in the past because we work in different departments but I recognized his face and knew of him through other colleagues. We started talking about the band and Joe said he sings and plays his guitar every now and then. I told him he should audition and we both laughed about it, but toward the end of our conversation, he seemed interested, so I ripped off the part of the flyer that had Ben's phone number and gave it to him in case he wanted more information.\n\nLong story short, he audition and ended up in the band. The band consists of Ben, Joe, and two other people (both go to school with Ben). I'll admit, it was weird having Joe over at our place at first because we were colleagues and never hung out outside of work or work events, but I didn't mind it because Ben seemed happy and talks a lot about Joe (the two hang out often).\n\nA week ago, Joe was supposed to come over and work on some lyrics with Ben, but Ben was running late, so I invited Joe inside for a cup of coffee. We started chatting about work and complaining about our supervisors to each other, which was really nice to do because I haven't been able to vent to any of my other colleagues about work stress. We talked about the band and he played a sample of a song they were working on, which sounded similar to a song I had heard before but couldn't remember the name of. He asked for my number so that I could send him the song if I ended up remembering. I sent him the song that night and we've been texting all week since then. I enjoy talking to him a lot and it honestly feels like a stupid high school crush (I haven't seriously dated anyone since I was with Ben's father). Yesterday Ben found out I'd been texting Joe and got upset, saying that it's weird and that I can't date his friend. He compared it to \"what if you dated Matt\" (his 21 yr old friend since middle school). I don't think it's the same situation though. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for dating their son's friend. The situation is a bit complex, so I need to break it down.\n\nFirst, the backstory: the author is a single mom who had her son, Ben, at 17. Now Ben is 21 and has been dealing with depression. The author is trying to support him, and when he suggested forming a band again, she helped by putting up flyers. That's when she met Joe, a colleague. Joe ended up joining Ben's band. The author initially found it weird but didn't mind because Ben was happy. Then, a coffee meeting happened when Ben was late, leading to them chatting and exchanging numbers. Now Ben is upset because he found out they're texting and thinks it's weird, comparing it to dating his friend Matt.\n\nSo, the main question is whether the author is in the wrong. Let me consider the factors here. \n\nFirst, the age difference: the author is 38, and Joe is 29. They're both adults, so legally that's not an issue. But the key point is the relationship dynamics. The author is Ben's mother and is forming a romantic relationship with his friend. This could create tension and possibly make Ben feel uncomfortable. The son is 21, an adult himself, but he's still in a vulnerable situation with depression. The mother's actions might affect his mental health if he feels her attention is shifting to his friend.\n\nAlso, the author is Ben's mother, which makes the relationship with Joe more complicated. Even though Ben is an adult, there's an inherent power dynamic here. The mother is a parent, and Joe is a friend of her adult son. The mother's choice to date the son's friend could be seen as overstepping, especially if it causes Ben emotional distress. \n\nAnother angle is that the author didn't ask Ben's opinion before pursuing the relationship. She might be prioritizing her own needs without considering her son's feelings. Even though Ben is an adult, the mother is still responsible for his well-being, especially given his history of depression. Creating a potentially awkward or uncomfortable situation could hinder his recovery or happiness.\n\nHowever, the author is also an adult who might feel lonely and deserves a relationship. The connection with Joe started as a result of helping Ben, but it's not inherently wrong that she found someone. The issue is more about the impact on Ben and the dynamics of their family. \n\nBut then again, Ben is an adult and should have some independence. However, since the mother has been his primary caregiver and he's been struggling with depression, her actions might interfere with his sense of security. The comparison to dating his friend Matt is a point Ben makes, but the author argues it's different. The difference is that the author is the mother, which adds another layer of complexity not present in a typical friend's dating situation.\n\nIn terms of ethical considerations, the mother's role is to support her son, and dating his friend could create a conflict of interest. If the relationship becomes public, it might affect how Ben interacts with Joe, leading to awkwardness or potential isolation if their relationship changes or ends. \n\nOn the other hand, if the author is genuinely not in the wrong, it would be if she's just forming a normal adult relationship outside her son's immediate circle, without forcing Ben into any position. However, the fact that she's the mother complicates things. Even if Ben is an adult, the mother's relationship with someone close to him can have indirect consequences on their relationship.\n\nSo, considering all these factors, the mother might be in the wrong because she's creating a potentially uncomfortable situation for her son. Even though both she and Joe are adults, the relationship's dynamics involve her son's friend, which can lead to emotional stress for Ben. The mother should have considered Ben's feelings and perhaps discussed it with him before pursuing a relationship. Therefore, the answer might be A (the author is in the wrong).\n"
