His father was never really in the picture, so I was a single mother for the most part. Now I'm 38 and my son \"Ben\" is 21. He's been suffering from depression the past couple of years. I take him to therapy every week and he seems to be getting better but he's always been an introverted kid, so he seems lonely most days. When he was in high school, he was in a band but that quickly disbanded after one of the members graduated high school and went off to college. I recently made a suggestion for him to maybe start up a band again. To my surprise, he was excited about the idea but didn't really know where to start. I suggested he make posters to advertise and maybe place them around his campus. He got to work right away and showed me a flyer he had made. I asked if he wanted me to put it up on the bulletin board at my work place and he agreed.\n\nAs I was posting up the flyer on the board the next day, a colleague \"Joe\" walked up beside me and noticed the flyer (he's 29). I never really talked to Joe in the past because we work in different departments but I recognized his face and knew of him through other colleagues. We started talking about the band and Joe said he sings and plays his guitar every now and then. I told him he should audition and we both laughed about it, but toward the end of our conversation, he seemed interested, so I ripped off the part of the flyer that had Ben's phone number and gave it to him in case he wanted more information.\n\nLong story short, he audition and ended up in the band. The band consists of Ben, Joe, and two other people (both go to school with Ben). I'll admit, it was weird having Joe over at our place at first because we were colleagues and never hung out outside of work or work events, but I didn't mind it because Ben seemed happy and talks a lot about Joe (the two hang out often).\n\nA week ago, Joe was supposed to come over and work on some lyrics with Ben, but Ben was running late, so I invited Joe inside for a cup of coffee. We started chatting about work and complaining about our supervisors to each other, which was really nice to do because I haven't been able to vent to any of my other colleagues about work stress. We talked about the band and he played a sample of a song they were working on, which sounded similar to a song I had heard before but couldn't remember the name of. He asked for my number so that I could send him the song if I ended up remembering. I sent him the song that night and we've been texting all week since then. I enjoy talking to him a lot and it honestly feels like a stupid high school crush (I haven't seriously dated anyone since I was with Ben's father). Yesterday Ben found out I'd been texting Joe and got upset, saying that it's weird and that I can't date his friend. He compared it to \"what if you dated Matt\" (his 21 yr old friend since middle school). I don't think it's the same situation though. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA scenario is in the wrong. The situation is that a 38-year-old single mother, who's been raising her son Ben since he was a baby (now 21), starts dating Joe, a friend of Ben's who's part of a band he's in. The mother met Joe because he was a colleague at her workplace and ended up connecting with him. Ben found out and is upset, comparing it to dating his friend Matt, but the mother thinks it's different.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze the dynamics here. The mother is dating someone who is her son's friend. Ben is an adult now, 21, but she's been a single parent for a long time. The mother hasn't dated much since Ben's father left. She and Joe met through work, and their relationship started after work interactions. The key points are the age difference (mother is 38, Joe is 29), both working in different departments, and Ben's reaction.\n\nI should consider if there's a conflict of interest in the workplace. Since they work in different departments, maybe not a direct conflict, but still colleagues. The mother gave out Joe's contact info through the flyer, which led to their relationship. Then they started talking more, including personal stuff. Now Ben is upset because he feels it's weird, similar to dating his friend.\n\nBut Ben is an adult, so his feelings matter, but does he have the right to control his mother's dating life? The mother is in a position where she's a parent, so boundaries might be tricky. However, the mother's actions aren't necessarily wrong. She's an adult too, and has the right to date. The issue is more about Ben's discomfort and the mother navigating that.\n\nIs there any wrongdoing on her part? She didn't set out to date Joe, they met through work and Ben's band. Their relationship developed after work interactions, not through Ben's social circle. She didn't intentionally try to get close to Joe through Ben. The fact that she's a single parent might add to the complexity, but she's entitled to her own life. Ben's comparison to dating a friend since middle school might be a stretch if Joe is more of a bandmate. The mother's actions don't seem to have intentionally harmed Ben, though they made him uncomfortable.\n\nIn AITA scenarios, the key is to see if the person did something wrong, not just if others are upset. The mother didn't do anything unethical or illegal. She's allowed to date someone she met through work, even if he's connected to her son. The issue is more about Ben's reaction and the mother handling the situation. The mother isn't in the wrong for dating Joe; she's just an adult pursuing her own happiness. Therefore, the answer should be B (No).\n"
