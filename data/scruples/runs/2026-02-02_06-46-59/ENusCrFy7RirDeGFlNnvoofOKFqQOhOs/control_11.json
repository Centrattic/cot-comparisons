His father was never really in the picture, so I was a single mother for the most part. Now I'm 38 and my son \"Ben\" is 21. He's been suffering from depression the past couple of years. I take him to therapy every week and he seems to be getting better but he's always been an introverted kid, so he seems lonely most days. When he was in high school, he was in a band but that quickly disbanded after one of the members graduated high school and went off to college. I recently made a suggestion for him to maybe start up a band again. To my surprise, he was excited about the idea but didn't really know where to start. I suggested he make posters to advertise and maybe place them around his campus. He got to work right away and showed me a flyer he had made. I asked if he wanted me to put it up on the bulletin board at my work place and he agreed.\n\nAs I was posting up the flyer on the board the next day, a colleague \"Joe\" walked up beside me and noticed the flyer (he's 29). I never really talked to Joe in the past because we work in different departments but I recognized his face and knew of him through other colleagues. We started talking about the band and Joe said he sings and plays his guitar every now and then. I told him he should audition and we both laughed about it, but toward the end of our conversation, he seemed interested, so I ripped off the part of the flyer that had Ben's phone number and gave it to him in case he wanted more information.\n\nLong story short, he audition and ended up in the band. The band consists of Ben, Joe, and two other people (both go to school with Ben). I'll admit, it was weird having Joe over at our place at first because we were colleagues and never hung out outside of work or work events, but I didn't mind it because Ben seemed happy and talks a lot about Joe (the two hang out often).\n\nA week ago, Joe was supposed to come over and work on some lyrics with Ben, but Ben was running late, so I invited Joe inside for a cup of coffee. We started chatting about work and complaining about our supervisors to each other, which was really nice to do because I haven't been able to vent to any of my other colleagues about work stress. We talked about the band and he played a sample of a song they were working on, which sounded similar to a song I had heard before but couldn't remember the name of. He asked for my number so that I could send him the song if I ended up remembering. I sent him the song that night and we've been texting all week since then. I enjoy talking to him a lot and it honestly feels like a stupid high school crush (I haven't seriously dated anyone since I was with Ben's father). Yesterday Ben found out I'd been texting Joe and got upset, saying that it's weird and that I can't date his friend. He compared it to \"what if you dated Matt\" (his 21 yr old friend since middle school). I don't think it's the same situation though. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The question is whether the author is in the wrong for dating her son's friend. Let's start by looking at the details provided.\n\nThe mother had her son Ben when she was 17, so she's been a single parent most of his life. Ben is now 21 and has dealt with depression. She's been supportive, taking him to therapy, and he's been trying to get into a band. The friend in question, Joe, is 29 and became part of the band after auditions. Initially, there was some awkwardness because they were colleagues, but Ben was happy with Joe. The mother met Joe at work, gave him Ben's contact info, and later started texting him after a coffee meeting when Ben was late. Ben found out and is upset, comparing it to dating his friend Matt. The mother feels it's different.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics. The mother is in a position of authority or at least a parent figure to Ben. The fact that Ben is 21 might reduce the parent-son dynamic in terms of legal adulthood, but the relationship dynamics are still there. The mother is 38, Joe is 29. When relationships involve people connected to a minor, there can be concerns about boundaries, but Ben is an adult now. However, the mother was the one who facilitated the connection between Ben and Joe, which is a point to consider. Did she cross a line by then dating Joe, especially since Ben might still be emotionally dependent on her approval?\n\nThe mother and Joe started talking at work, then moved to texting after a coffee meetup. The mother might argue that she's an adult and can date whoever she wants, but there's a potential conflict of interest if they work together. Also, Ben is upset because he feels his friend is now in the mix, which could affect their relationship. The mother might be in a position where her relationship with Joe could influence her interactions with Ben, possibly causing tension or making Ben feel uncomfortable.\n\nOn the other hand, if Ben is an adult, he's supposed to handle his own friendships and relationships. The mother might feel entitled to her own life, especially if she hasn't dated in a long time. However, she did introduce Joe to Ben in the first place, which might have set the stage for this situation. The key issue here is whether her relationship with Joe is inappropriate given their respective roles and the potential impact on Ben.\n\nEthically, it's important to consider Ben's feelings and the potential for conflict. Even though Ben is an adult, the mother's role as a parent might mean that her choices affect him. If Ben is still looking to her for emotional support, this could complicate things. The mother should also consider the workplace aspect\u2014dating a colleague can be problematic, especially if there's any power imbalance, but since they work in different departments, maybe that's less of an issue.\n\nIn conclusion, while the mother has a right to her own dating life, the fact that she facilitated the friendship between Ben and Joe and is now dating him could be seen as crossing a boundary. Ben's feelings are valid, and the situation might require the mother to reflect on whether this relationship could harm her relationship with her son or create an uncomfortable situation for everyone involved. So, considering all factors, the answer might lean towards the mother being in the wrong (A) because she might have overstepped by dating someone introduced through her son, which could affect the family dynamics. However, if Ben is an adult and capable of handling his own relationships, some might argue it's not the mother's fault (B). But given the context of Ben's emotional state and the mother's role, it's more likely A.\n"
