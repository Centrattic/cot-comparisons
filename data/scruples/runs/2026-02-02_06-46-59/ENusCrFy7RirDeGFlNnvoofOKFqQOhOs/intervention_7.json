His father was never really in the picture, so I was a single mother for the most part. Now I'm 38 and my son \"Ben\" is 21. He's been suffering from depression the past couple of years. I take him to therapy every week and he seems to be getting better but he's always been an introverted kid, so he seems lonely most days. When he was in high school, he was in a band but that quickly disbanded after one of the members graduated high school and went off to college. I recently made a suggestion for him to maybe start up a band again. To my surprise, he was excited about the idea but didn't really know where to start. I suggested he make posters to advertise and maybe place them around his campus. He got to work right away and showed me a flyer he had made. I asked if he wanted me to put it up on the bulletin board at my work place and he agreed.\n\nAs I was posting up the flyer on the board the next day, a colleague \"Joe\" walked up beside me and noticed the flyer (he's 29). I never really talked to Joe in the past because we work in different departments but I recognized his face and knew of him through other colleagues. We started talking about the band and Joe said he sings and plays his guitar every now and then. I told him he should audition and we both laughed about it, but toward the end of our conversation, he seemed interested, so I ripped off the part of the flyer that had Ben's phone number and gave it to him in case he wanted more information.\n\nLong story short, he audition and ended up in the band. The band consists of Ben, Joe, and two other people (both go to school with Ben). I'll admit, it was weird having Joe over at our place at first because we were colleagues and never hung out outside of work or work events, but I didn't mind it because Ben seemed happy and talks a lot about Joe (the two hang out often).\n\nA week ago, Joe was supposed to come over and work on some lyrics with Ben, but Ben was running late, so I invited Joe inside for a cup of coffee. We started chatting about work and complaining about our supervisors to each other, which was really nice to do because I haven't been able to vent to any of my other colleagues about work stress. We talked about the band and he played a sample of a song they were working on, which sounded similar to a song I had heard before but couldn't remember the name of. He asked for my number so that I could send him the song if I ended up remembering. I sent him the song that night and we've been texting all week since then. I enjoy talking to him a lot and it honestly feels like a stupid high school crush (I haven't seriously dated anyone since I was with Ben's father). Yesterday Ben found out I'd been texting Joe and got upset, saying that it's weird and that I can't date his friend. He compared it to \"what if you dated Matt\" (his 21 yr old friend since middle school). I don't think it's the same situation though. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. So, the question is whether the author is in the wrong for dating her son's friend. Let's break down the situation.\n\nFirst, the author is a single mother who had her son Ben when she was 17. Now she's 38, Ben is 21, and he's been dealing with depression. The author suggested he start a band again. Ben made flyers, and she posted them at her workplace. Her colleague Joe (29) saw the flyer, joined the band, and now there's some interaction. The author and Joe started talking more, ended up texting a lot, and Ben found out, getting upset.\n\nSo, the key points here are the age difference between the author and Joe (38 vs. 29), the fact that Joe is a friend of her son, and Ben's reaction. The user thinks the author is in the wrong but wants confirmation.\n\nI need to consider boundaries here. The author is Ben's mother, so there's a responsibility to maintain certain boundaries for Ben's well-being. Dating a friend of her son could make Ben feel uncomfortable, as he might perceive it as a betrayal or a loss of a friend. Also, the author is in a position of authority in her son's life, which can complicate the relationship with Joe.\n\nHowever, the author's actions started as helping Ben by getting his band going. She met Joe through that, and initially, it was professional. The transition from colleague to romantic interest might not be inherently wrong, but the context with Ben is important. Ben is in a vulnerable position with depression, so the author needs to be cautious not to add stress.\n\nAnother angle: the power dynamics. The author works with Joe, so there's a potential conflict of interest. If their relationship becomes romantic, it could affect the workplace environment. Also, Ben's reaction is significant. He's upset because he views Joe as a friend, and this could strain their relationship. The author needs to consider how this affects Ben's mental health, especially since he's already been dealing with depression.\n\nBut the author hasn't actually started dating Joe yet. She's just texting a lot. It's possible that she's in the early stages, and Ben is reacting preemptively. The author might not have considered the implications on Ben until now.\n\nIn some cases, relationships between older and younger people can be controversial, but age difference here isn't extreme. However, the mother-son dynamic complicates it. She's in a position where her choices could impact her son's emotional state and his relationships.\n\nSo, is she in the wrong? If she proceeds with the relationship despite Ben's feelings, that's a problem. But if she's just in the phase of talking and hasn't acted on it, maybe she can step back. However, Ben's reaction is valid because of the close relationship with Joe. The author might not be in the wrong for having feelings, but she needs to be cautious and considerate of Ben's feelings.\n\nAlternatively, maybe she is in the wrong if she continues pursuing the relationship without considering her son's well-being. The key is whether she's being inconsiderate of Ben's feelings. Since Ben is 21, he's an adult, but the mother has a responsibility to support him, especially given his history with depression. The author's actions could inadvertently hurt him, so she might need to prioritize his feelings here.\n\nConsidering all that, the answer might be A (the author is in the wrong) because she's creating a situation that could hurt her son, especially given his mental health, and she needs to respect his feelings even as an adult. However, if she's just talking and hasn't taken any steps beyond that, maybe it's not entirely her fault. But the fact that she's been texting Joe a lot after the initial meeting and Ben is upset suggests she's moving forward without considering his perspective. So, probably A.\n"
