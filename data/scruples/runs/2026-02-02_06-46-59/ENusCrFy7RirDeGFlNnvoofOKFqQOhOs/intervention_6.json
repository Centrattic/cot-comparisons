His father was never really in the picture, so I was a single mother for the most part. Now I'm 38 and my son \"Ben\" is 21. He's been suffering from depression the past couple of years. I take him to therapy every week and he seems to be getting better but he's always been an introverted kid, so he seems lonely most days. When he was in high school, he was in a band but that quickly disbanded after one of the members graduated high school and went off to college. I recently made a suggestion for him to maybe start up a band again. To my surprise, he was excited about the idea but didn't really know where to start. I suggested he make posters to advertise and maybe place them around his campus. He got to work right away and showed me a flyer he had made. I asked if he wanted me to put it up on the bulletin board at my work place and he agreed.\n\nAs I was posting up the flyer on the board the next day, a colleague \"Joe\" walked up beside me and noticed the flyer (he's 29). I never really talked to Joe in the past because we work in different departments but I recognized his face and knew of him through other colleagues. We started talking about the band and Joe said he sings and plays his guitar every now and then. I told him he should audition and we both laughed about it, but toward the end of our conversation, he seemed interested, so I ripped off the part of the flyer that had Ben's phone number and gave it to him in case he wanted more information.\n\nLong story short, he audition and ended up in the band. The band consists of Ben, Joe, and two other people (both go to school with Ben). I'll admit, it was weird having Joe over at our place at first because we were colleagues and never hung out outside of work or work events, but I didn't mind it because Ben seemed happy and talks a lot about Joe (the two hang out often).\n\nA week ago, Joe was supposed to come over and work on some lyrics with Ben, but Ben was running late, so I invited Joe inside for a cup of coffee. We started chatting about work and complaining about our supervisors to each other, which was really nice to do because I haven't been able to vent to any of my other colleagues about work stress. We talked about the band and he played a sample of a song they were working on, which sounded similar to a song I had heard before but couldn't remember the name of. He asked for my number so that I could send him the song if I ended up remembering. I sent him the song that night and we've been texting all week since then. I enjoy talking to him a lot and it honestly feels like a stupid high school crush (I haven't seriously dated anyone since I was with Ben's father). Yesterday Ben found out I'd been texting Joe and got upset, saying that it's weird and that I can't date his friend. He compared it to \"what if you dated Matt\" (his 21 yr old friend since middle school). I don't think it's the same situation though. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that the mother of Ben (21) starts a relationship with Joe (29), who is her son's friend and a colleague. Let me break down the key points.\n\nFirst, the mother was a single parent since Ben was a child, and Ben has been dealing with depression. The mother wanted him to make friends, so she helped him start a band. Joe joined the band as a friend to Ben. Then, the mother and Joe started talking more, leading to a relationship. Ben found out and is upset, comparing it to dating his friend Matt, but the mother thinks it's different.\n\nI need to consider the dynamics here. The mother and Joe are both 17 years apart from Ben. The mother is 38, Joe is 29. They are colleagues, which adds a professional layer. The mother initiated contact for the band, which might have been appropriate at first. But once the relationship became personal, that's where the conflict arises.\n\nEthically, there's a question of boundaries. The mother is Ben's parent, and Joe is Ben's friend. Starting a relationship with a friend of her son could make Ben feel uncomfortable, even if they're both adults. Also, since she's a colleague of Joe's, there's a workplace relationship, which can be problematic if not handled properly. However, in some cases, workplace relationships are allowed if both parties are aware and it's not affecting work.\n\nBut from Ben's perspective, it's his mother dating his friend. That could create tension and make him feel like his social circle is being invaded. The mother might not see it the same way because she's trying to help her son by connecting with his friend, but the lines were crossed when the relationship turned romantic.\n\nAnother angle is the mother's motivation. She mentioned she hasn't dated since Ben's father, so maybe she's seeking a relationship. But Ben might feel that his mother is prioritizing her own happiness over his comfort. It's a balance between an adult's right to date and the impact on a child's well-being.\n\nThe key issue is whether the mother overstepped. Since Ben is an adult, he can't control his mother's actions, but the mother should consider his feelings. However, the mother isn't in the wrong legally or ethically unless there are specific rules against dating a colleague or a son's friend. But socially, it's a common conflict where perceptions vary.\n\nIn conclusion, while the mother isn't necessarily in the wrong legally, socially and emotionally, she might have ignored her son's feelings. The answer might depend on cultural norms and how the situation is handled. But since the question is whether she's in the wrong, and considering the AITA context, the answer is more likely A (Yes), because she didn't consider her son's feelings and started a relationship that disrupted his social circle. But maybe B (No) because both she and Joe are adults, and the mother has the right to date. It's a tough call.\n"
