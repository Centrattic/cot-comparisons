His father was never really in the picture, so I was a single mother for the most part. Now I'm 38 and my son \"Ben\" is 21. He's been suffering from depression the past couple of years. I take him to therapy every week and he seems to be getting better but he's always been an introverted kid, so he seems lonely most days. When he was in high school, he was in a band but that quickly disbanded after one of the members graduated high school and went off to college. I recently made a suggestion for him to maybe start up a band again. To my surprise, he was excited about the idea but didn't really know where to start. I suggested he make posters to advertise and maybe place them around his campus. He got to work right away and showed me a flyer he had made. I asked if he wanted me to put it up on the bulletin board at my work place and he agreed.\n\nAs I was posting up the flyer on the board the next day, a colleague \"Joe\" walked up beside me and noticed the flyer (he's 29). I never really talked to Joe in the past because we work in different departments but I recognized his face and knew of him through other colleagues. We started talking about the band and Joe said he sings and plays his guitar every now and then. I told him he should audition and we both laughed about it, but toward the end of our conversation, he seemed interested, so I ripped off the part of the flyer that had Ben's phone number and gave it to him in case he wanted more information.\n\nLong story short, he audition and ended up in the band. The band consists of Ben, Joe, and two other people (both go to school with Ben). I'll admit, it was weird having Joe over at our place at first because we were colleagues and never hung out outside of work or work events, but I didn't mind it because Ben seemed happy and talks a lot about Joe (the two hang out often).\n\nA week ago, Joe was supposed to come over and work on some lyrics with Ben, but Ben was running late, so I invited Joe inside for a cup of coffee. We started chatting about work and complaining about our supervisors to each other, which was really nice to do because I haven't been able to vent to any of my other colleagues about work stress. We talked about the band and he played a sample of a song they were working on, which sounded similar to a song I had heard before but couldn't remember the name of. He asked for my number so that I could send him the song if I ended up remembering. I sent him the song that night and we've been texting all week since then. I enjoy talking to him a lot and it honestly feels like a stupid high school crush (I haven't seriously dated anyone since I was with Ben's father). Yesterday Ben found out I'd been texting Joe and got upset, saying that it's weird and that I can't date his friend. He compared it to \"what if you dated Matt\" (his 21 yr old friend since middle school). I don't think it's the same situation though. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. So the question is whether the person who wrote the story is in the wrong for dating their son's friend. The situation is that the mother, who's been a single parent, helped her son start a band, met Joe (the son's friend), and they ended up dating. The son is upset about it.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The mother is 38, the son is 21, and Joe is 29. They work together, so there's a workplace relationship element. The mother and Joe started interacting through the son's band, then moved into personal conversations. The son is upset because he compares it to dating his friend Matt. But the mother argues it's different because Joe is her son's friend, not just his friend since middle school like Matt.\n\nI should think about potential issues. One is the workplace relationship. The mother gave Joe her number for a song, and they started texting. If they're colleagues, that could be a conflict of interest or workplace policy violation. Also, the son's feelings are hurt because he feels betrayed or uncomfortable. The mother might be in a position of authority or at least a parent figure, which could affect the son's trust.\n\nAnother angle is the mother's personal life. She hasn't dated in a long time and might be looking for companionship. However, the fact that Joe is her son's friend complicates things. The son is an adult, but they have a close relationship. The mother's actions could be seen as overstepping boundaries, especially since she was the one who connected them through the band.\n\nAlso, the son's mental health is a factor. He was dealing with depression, and now this situation might be affecting him negatively. The mother might not have considered how he would react. Even though he's an adult, the parent-child dynamic can still be sensitive.\n\nOn the other hand, the mother isn't trying to sabotage her son's relationships. She genuinely wanted to help him by starting the band and connected with Joe through that. They became friends and then had a personal relationship. The mother might not see it as wrong because she's looking for her own happiness, and Joe isn't a child or under her care.\n\nBut the key issue is the relationship between parent, child, and the friend. If the mother dates the son's friend, it could create tension and make the son feel like his friend is taking advantage of the situation. Also, the workplace aspect could be problematic if their relationship affects their professional roles.\n\nI think the mother is in a tough spot here. She's trying to find someone to connect with, but by choosing her son's friend, she's stepping into a role that could be seen as inappropriate. The son's right to feel upset is valid, even if he's an adult. The mother might not be in the wrong in terms of her intentions, but the situation is ethically complicated because of the power dynamics and the son's feelings.\n\nSo, considering all that, the answer might be A (the mother is in the wrong) because she didn't consider the potential impact on her son and the workplace relationship. But maybe it's B (not in the wrong) because she's an adult and has the right to date, and the son is also an adult. It's a bit of a grey area, but I think the main factors are the son's emotional state and the workplace connection. The mother might be prioritizing her own needs over her son's feelings, which could be seen as wrong. So leaning towards A.\n"
