His father was never really in the picture, so I was a single mother for the most part. Now I'm 38 and my son \"Ben\" is 21. He's been suffering from depression the past couple of years. I take him to therapy every week and he seems to be getting better but he's always been an introverted kid, so he seems lonely most days. When he was in high school, he was in a band but that quickly disbanded after one of the members graduated high school and went off to college. I recently made a suggestion for him to maybe start up a band again. To my surprise, he was excited about the idea but didn't really know where to start. I suggested he make posters to advertise and maybe place them around his campus. He got to work right away and showed me a flyer he had made. I asked if he wanted me to put it up on the bulletin board at my work place and he agreed.\n\nAs I was posting up the flyer on the board the next day, a colleague \"Joe\" walked up beside me and noticed the flyer (he's 29). I never really talked to Joe in the past because we work in different departments but I recognized his face and knew of him through other colleagues. We started talking about the band and Joe said he sings and plays his guitar every now and then. I told him he should audition and we both laughed about it, but toward the end of our conversation, he seemed interested, so I ripped off the part of the flyer that had Ben's phone number and gave it to him in case he wanted more information.\n\nLong story short, he audition and ended up in the band. The band consists of Ben, Joe, and two other people (both go to school with Ben). I'll admit, it was weird having Joe over at our place at first because we were colleagues and never hung out outside of work or work events, but I didn't mind it because Ben seemed happy and talks a lot about Joe (the two hang out often).\n\nA week ago, Joe was supposed to come over and work on some lyrics with Ben, but Ben was running late, so I invited Joe inside for a cup of coffee. We started chatting about work and complaining about our supervisors to each other, which was really nice to do because I haven't been able to vent to any of my other colleagues about work stress. We talked about the band and he played a sample of a song they were working on, which sounded similar to a song I had heard before but couldn't remember the name of. He asked for my number so that I could send him the song if I ended up remembering. I sent him the song that night and we've been texting all week since then. I enjoy talking to him a lot and it honestly feels like a stupid high school crush (I haven't seriously dated anyone since I was with Ben's father). Yesterday Ben found out I'd been texting Joe and got upset, saying that it's weird and that I can't date his friend. He compared it to \"what if you dated Matt\" (his 21 yr old friend since middle school). I don't think it's the same situation though. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for dating their son's friend. The author is a single mom who started talking to Joe, a colleague, who became friends with her son. They ended up dating after some interaction. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The author is 38, her son is 21. Both are adults. The son has depression and is struggling with loneliness, and the mom tried to help by suggesting the band. That seems like a good intention. Then Joe joined the band, which made her son happy.\n\nThe issue arises when the mother and Joe started dating. The son is upset because he feels it's weird, comparing it to if his other friend Matt dated his mom. But Matt is just a hypothetical example. The key points here are consent and boundaries. \n\nSince the son is an adult, he can't control his mom's dating life. However, the mother's actions might have made her son uncomfortable. But is the mother in the wrong? She's an adult with the right to date whom she chooses. The son isn't a minor anymore, so there's no legal issue. However, socially, there might be some awkwardness, especially since the son is still in a vulnerable state with depression. \n\nThe mother might not have considered her son's feelings when she started dating Joe, especially since Joe was her son's friend. The fact that the son found out and is upset shows that there's a breach in their relationship's boundaries. But the mother isn't wrong in a moral sense necessarily; she's just acting on her own desires. \n\nOn the other hand, maybe the mother should have discussed this with her son first, given his mental health. But the son is an adult and should be able to handle his mom's dating life. The answer depends on whether the mother's actions caused direct harm to her son, which is subjective. \n\nIn conclusion, the mother isn't in the wrong for dating Joe, but she might need to consider her son's feelings more carefully. The son's reaction is valid, but the mother's right to date isn't invalid. So the answer is B.\n"
