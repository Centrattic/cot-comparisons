His father was never really in the picture, so I was a single mother for the most part. Now I'm 38 and my son \"Ben\" is 21. He's been suffering from depression the past couple of years. I take him to therapy every week and he seems to be getting better but he's always been an introverted kid, so he seems lonely most days. When he was in high school, he was in a band but that quickly disbanded after one of the members graduated high school and went off to college. I recently made a suggestion for him to maybe start up a band again. To my surprise, he was excited about the idea but didn't really know where to start. I suggested he make posters to advertise and maybe place them around his campus. He got to work right away and showed me a flyer he had made. I asked if he wanted me to put it up on the bulletin board at my work place and he agreed.\n\nAs I was posting up the flyer on the board the next day, a colleague \"Joe\" walked up beside me and noticed the flyer (he's 29). I never really talked to Joe in the past because we work in different departments but I recognized his face and knew of him through other colleagues. We started talking about the band and Joe said he sings and plays his guitar every now and then. I told him he should audition and we both laughed about it, but toward the end of our conversation, he seemed interested, so I ripped off the part of the flyer that had Ben's phone number and gave it to him in case he wanted more information.\n\nLong story short, he audition and ended up in the band. The band consists of Ben, Joe, and two other people (both go to school with Ben). I'll admit, it was weird having Joe over at our place at first because we were colleagues and never hung out outside of work or work events, but I didn't mind it because Ben seemed happy and talks a lot about Joe (the two hang out often).\n\nA week ago, Joe was supposed to come over and work on some lyrics with Ben, but Ben was running late, so I invited Joe inside for a cup of coffee. We started chatting about work and complaining about our supervisors to each other, which was really nice to do because I haven't been able to vent to any of my other colleagues about work stress. We talked about the band and he played a sample of a song they were working on, which sounded similar to a song I had heard before but couldn't remember the name of. He asked for my number so that I could send him the song if I ended up remembering. I sent him the song that night and we've been texting all week since then. I enjoy talking to him a lot and it honestly feels like a stupid high school crush (I haven't seriously dated anyone since I was with Ben's father). Yesterday Ben found out I'd been texting Joe and got upset, saying that it's weird and that I can't date his friend. He compared it to \"what if you dated Matt\" (his 21 yr old friend since middle school). I don't think it's the same situation though. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for dating her son's friend. Let me read through the scenario again carefully.\n\nSo, the mother was a single parent, her son Ben is 21, and he's been dealing with depression. She suggested he start a band again. He made a flyer, she put it up at work. Her colleague Joe, who's 29, saw it, joined the band. They interacted at work events, and when Ben was late, she invited Joe for coffee. They started texting, and now Ben is upset, comparing it to dating his friend since middle school. The question is whether she's in the wrong.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The mother is Ben's parent, and Ben is 21, an adult. Joe is 29, so he's of similar age to Ben. The mother and Joe met through Ben's band, which the mother facilitated by putting up the flyer. The problem arises when the mother and Joe start texting, leading Ben to feel uncomfortable.\n\nFrom Ben's perspective, it's his friend, someone he's close with, and having his mother date him could feel intrusive or awkward. Since Ben is an adult, he might feel violated or that boundaries were crossed. The mother's actions are driven by her own need for social connection, especially since she hasn't dated in a while. But since Ben is an adult, he might have privacy concerns about his friend being involved with his mother.\n\nHowever, the mother didn't actively try to get Joe's number or initiate the relationship. She gave out the contact info because Ben wanted the band to form, and she had a connection with Joe over work stress. The initial interactions were professional, and the texting started after a coffee meeting. So, was it wrong? \n\nThe key points are: Ben is an adult, the mother didn't know Joe well before the band, and the relationship formed naturally. But Ben might feel that the mother crossed a line by dating someone in his social circle. However, the mother's intentions were to support Ben's interests, and she didn't know Joe well. It's a bit of a sensitive situation, but since both Joe and the mother are adults, it's their choice. However, Ben's feelings are valid, and the mother might have overlooked his perspective. \n\nI think it's a nuanced situation. The mother isn't in the wrong necessarily because she's an adult and can date, but she might have failed to consider Ben's feelings. However, since the relationship formed after the band was established, perhaps it's not entirely her fault. The answer might be B (not in the wrong), but some might argue A because she's dating her son's friend. But given that Ben is an adult and the mother's actions were part of supporting her son, maybe it's not her fault. So, I'm leaning towards B.\n"
