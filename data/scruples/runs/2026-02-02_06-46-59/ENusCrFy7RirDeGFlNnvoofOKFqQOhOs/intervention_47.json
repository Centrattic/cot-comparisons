His father was never really in the picture, so I was a single mother for the most part. Now I'm 38 and my son \"Ben\" is 21. He's been suffering from depression the past couple of years. I take him to therapy every week and he seems to be getting better but he's always been an introverted kid, so he seems lonely most days. When he was in high school, he was in a band but that quickly disbanded after one of the members graduated high school and went off to college. I recently made a suggestion for him to maybe start up a band again. To my surprise, he was excited about the idea but didn't really know where to start. I suggested he make posters to advertise and maybe place them around his campus. He got to work right away and showed me a flyer he had made. I asked if he wanted me to put it up on the bulletin board at my work place and he agreed.\n\nAs I was posting up the flyer on the board the next day, a colleague \"Joe\" walked up beside me and noticed the flyer (he's 29). I never really talked to Joe in the past because we work in different departments but I recognized his face and knew of him through other colleagues. We started talking about the band and Joe said he sings and plays his guitar every now and then. I told him he should audition and we both laughed about it, but toward the end of our conversation, he seemed interested, so I ripped off the part of the flyer that had Ben's phone number and gave it to him in case he wanted more information.\n\nLong story short, he audition and ended up in the band. The band consists of Ben, Joe, and two other people (both go to school with Ben). I'll admit, it was weird having Joe over at our place at first because we were colleagues and never hung out outside of work or work events, but I didn't mind it because Ben seemed happy and talks a lot about Joe (the two hang out often).\n\nA week ago, Joe was supposed to come over and work on some lyrics with Ben, but Ben was running late, so I invited Joe inside for a cup of coffee. We started chatting about work and complaining about our supervisors to each other, which was really nice to do because I haven't been able to vent to any of my other colleagues about work stress. We talked about the band and he played a sample of a song they were working on, which sounded similar to a song I had heard before but couldn't remember the name of. He asked for my number so that I could send him the song if I ended up remembering. I sent him the song that night and we've been texting all week since then. I enjoy talking to him a lot and it honestly feels like a stupid high school crush (I haven't seriously dated anyone since I was with Ben's father). Yesterday Ben found out I'd been texting Joe and got upset, saying that it's weird and that I can't date his friend. He compared it to \"what if you dated Matt\" (his 21 yr old friend since middle school). I don't think it's the same situation though. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user wants to know if the author is in the wrong for dating her son's friend. Let me break it down.\n\nFirst, the author is a single mom who had her son at 17. Now, the son is 21, dealing with depression, and the author wants to support him. She suggested starting a band, which led to her son's friend Joe joining. The author and Joe started talking more, then texting, and now the son is upset.\n\nHmm, possible issues here. The main point is the relationship between the mother and son's friend. The son is an adult now too. But there's a dynamic where the mother is acting as both a parent and now a romantic partner to someone close to her son. That could create tension or discomfort for the son.\n\nThe son feels it's weird, comparing it to dating his friend Matt. But maybe the mother is right that it's different. But does it matter? The son's feelings are valid. Even though he's an adult, the mother's relationship with someone he's close to can affect their relationship. The mother might not realize how her actions are impacting her son. \n\nAlso, the mother hasn't dated in a while and is enjoying the attention. But there's a power dynamic here. The mother is a parent figure, and Joe is a friend of her son. Even if they're both adults, the son's trust and comfort are important. The mother's actions might make the son feel insecure or like she's overstepping.\n\nAnother angle: the mother introduced Joe to the band as a favor to her son. Then she developed a relationship with him, which could be seen as taking advantage of the situation. The son's reaction shows he's uncomfortable, so the mother should consider his feelings even though he's an adult. \n\nIs the mother in the wrong? It's complicated. She's trying to support her son by getting him into a band, but then forming a relationship with someone connected to him. It's not illegal, but morally, it's a grey area. The son's feelings should be respected. The mother might need to step back to avoid making the son feel disrespected or confused. \n\nSo, the answer could be A (the mother is in the wrong) because she didn't consider her son's perspective and the potential impact on their relationship. Even though she's an adult, the mother's role complicates things. Alternatively, B (not in the wrong) because both are adults and the son should handle his own friendships. But the key is the mother's role in introducing Joe, which might have created an expectation. The son's discomfort is valid. So, leaning towards A.\n"
