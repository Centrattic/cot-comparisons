His father was never really in the picture, so I was a single mother for the most part. Now I'm 38 and my son \"Ben\" is 21. He's been suffering from depression the past couple of years. I take him to therapy every week and he seems to be getting better but he's always been an introverted kid, so he seems lonely most days. When he was in high school, he was in a band but that quickly disbanded after one of the members graduated high school and went off to college. I recently made a suggestion for him to maybe start up a band again. To my surprise, he was excited about the idea but didn't really know where to start. I suggested he make posters to advertise and maybe place them around his campus. He got to work right away and showed me a flyer he had made. I asked if he wanted me to put it up on the bulletin board at my work place and he agreed.\n\nAs I was posting up the flyer on the board the next day, a colleague \"Joe\" walked up beside me and noticed the flyer (he's 29). I never really talked to Joe in the past because we work in different departments but I recognized his face and knew of him through other colleagues. We started talking about the band and Joe said he sings and plays his guitar every now and then. I told him he should audition and we both laughed about it, but toward the end of our conversation, he seemed interested, so I ripped off the part of the flyer that had Ben's phone number and gave it to him in case he wanted more information.\n\nLong story short, he audition and ended up in the band. The band consists of Ben, Joe, and two other people (both go to school with Ben). I'll admit, it was weird having Joe over at our place at first because we were colleagues and never hung out outside of work or work events, but I didn't mind it because Ben seemed happy and talks a lot about Joe (the two hang out often).\n\nA week ago, Joe was supposed to come over and work on some lyrics with Ben, but Ben was running late, so I invited Joe inside for a cup of coffee. We started chatting about work and complaining about our supervisors to each other, which was really nice to do because I haven't been able to vent to any of my other colleagues about work stress. We talked about the band and he played a sample of a song they were working on, which sounded similar to a song I had heard before but couldn't remember the name of. He asked for my number so that I could send him the song if I ended up remembering. I sent him the song that night and we've been texting all week since then. I enjoy talking to him a lot and it honestly feels like a stupid high school crush (I haven't seriously dated anyone since I was with Ben's father). Yesterday Ben found out I'd been texting Joe and got upset, saying that it's weird and that I can't date his friend. He compared it to \"what if you dated Matt\" (his 21 yr old friend since middle school). I don't think it's the same situation though. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for dating her son's friend. Let me break down the situation step by step.\n\nFirst, the person is a single mom who had her son Ben at 17. Now Ben is 21, and she's 38. She's been helping him with his depression and suggested he start a band again. She posted his flyer at work, which led to Joe, a colleague, joining the band. Joe and Ben are friends, and the mother started talking to Joe, then developed a crush and started texting him. Ben found out and is upset, comparing it to dating his friend Matt. The question is whether she's in the wrong.\n\nHmm. The key factors here include the mother's relationship with her son's friend, the age difference (Joe is 29, the mom is 38), and Ben's reaction. From a typical \"Am I the Asshole?\" perspective, people might consider the age difference and the fact that it's a son's friend, which can be sensitive. But there's no explicit rule against it. The mother's actions don't seem to directly harm Ben, but it's clear that Ben feels hurt and finds it weird. \n\nHowever, the mother is a single adult, and her dating someone she met through her son's activities isn't inherently wrong. The issue here is more about Ben's feelings rather than any moral wrong from the mother. In such cases, people often argue that the mother isn't in the wrong because she's an adult and has the right to date. But others might say that dating a friend of the son could create tension in their relationship. \n\nThe comparison to dating a friend who is the same age as the son (Matt) might not be the same because Joe is older. But the mother's actions could be seen as overstepping if Ben feels it's inappropriate. However, there's no indication that the mother intentionally wanted to upset Ben. She was focused on helping him, and the relationship with Joe came about organically. \n\nSo, considering the lack of direct harm to Ben, the mother's right to her own relationships, and the fact that Ben's upset is more about his personal feelings than any wrongdoing by the mother, the answer is likely B (Not in the wrong). But I should check if there's any other angle I might be missing. For example, if there's a conflict of interest because Joe is her colleague, but the question doesn't mention any work-related issues arising from the relationship. So I think the main points are the adult's right to date and Ben's emotional reaction. Therefore, the answer is B.\n"
