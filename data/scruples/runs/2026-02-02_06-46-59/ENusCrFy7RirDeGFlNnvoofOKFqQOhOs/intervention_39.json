His father was never really in the picture, so I was a single mother for the most part. Now I'm 38 and my son \"Ben\" is 21. He's been suffering from depression the past couple of years. I take him to therapy every week and he seems to be getting better but he's always been an introverted kid, so he seems lonely most days. When he was in high school, he was in a band but that quickly disbanded after one of the members graduated high school and went off to college. I recently made a suggestion for him to maybe start up a band again. To my surprise, he was excited about the idea but didn't really know where to start. I suggested he make posters to advertise and maybe place them around his campus. He got to work right away and showed me a flyer he had made. I asked if he wanted me to put it up on the bulletin board at my work place and he agreed.\n\nAs I was posting up the flyer on the board the next day, a colleague \"Joe\" walked up beside me and noticed the flyer (he's 29). I never really talked to Joe in the past because we work in different departments but I recognized his face and knew of him through other colleagues. We started talking about the band and Joe said he sings and plays his guitar every now and then. I told him he should audition and we both laughed about it, but toward the end of our conversation, he seemed interested, so I ripped off the part of the flyer that had Ben's phone number and gave it to him in case he wanted more information.\n\nLong story short, he audition and ended up in the band. The band consists of Ben, Joe, and two other people (both go to school with Ben). I'll admit, it was weird having Joe over at our place at first because we were colleagues and never hung out outside of work or work events, but I didn't mind it because Ben seemed happy and talks a lot about Joe (the two hang out often).\n\nA week ago, Joe was supposed to come over and work on some lyrics with Ben, but Ben was running late, so I invited Joe inside for a cup of coffee. We started chatting about work and complaining about our supervisors to each other, which was really nice to do because I haven't been able to vent to any of my other colleagues about work stress. We talked about the band and he played a sample of a song they were working on, which sounded similar to a song I had heard before but couldn't remember the name of. He asked for my number so that I could send him the song if I ended up remembering. I sent him the song that night and we've been texting all week since then. I enjoy talking to him a lot and it honestly feels like a stupid high school crush (I haven't seriously dated anyone since I was with Ben's father). Yesterday Ben found out I'd been texting Joe and got upset, saying that it's weird and that I can't date his friend. He compared it to \"what if you dated Matt\" (his 21 yr old friend since middle school). I don't think it's the same situation though. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so the user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for dating their son's friend. Let me try to break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, the context: The woman is a single mom of a 21-year-old son named Ben. Ben has been dealing with depression and is introverted. They started a band with Joe, a 29-year-old colleague of the mom. The mom and Joe started talking during a band-related conversation, then developed a relationship. Ben found out and is upset, comparing it to dating his friend Matt. The mom is wondering if she's in the wrong.\n\nNow, the user thinks the author is in the wrong, but wants my opinion. The answer options are A (yes) or B (no). \n\nI need to consider a few things here. First, the age difference between the mom and Joe. The mom is 38, Joe is 29. That's a 9-year gap, which isn't huge, but it's a parent-child dynamic that could complicate things. The son is 21, so legally an adult, but still in a relationship where the parent has a role in his life as a single parent. The mom's actions might be seen as overstepping if it affects Ben's relationships or his sense of security.\n\nAlso, the mom initiated contact by giving Joe Ben's number. Even though it was for the band, it led to Joe becoming part of their social circle. Then, the mom and Joe started a romantic relationship. The son found out and is upset. The question is whether the mom's actions are appropriate.\n\nThere's the aspect of consent and boundaries. The mom didn't consult Ben before dating his friend. While Ben is an adult and has his own opinions, the mom's role as a parent might make her decision seem intrusive. Plus, Ben was relying on her support, and this might create tension in their relationship.\n\nHowever, the mom is also an adult with the right to pursue her own happiness. The user's question is whether she's in the wrong, which is more about social norms and family dynamics rather than legality. In some cases, a parent dating an adult child's friend can be complicated but not inherently wrong. It depends on the circumstances and how it affects the family dynamics.\n\nBut in this case, the mom and Joe's relationship started when the son was part of the band. The mom's involvement in connecting them for the band might have blurred the lines between professional and personal. Plus, Ben's reaction is valid; he might feel that his friend is being used or that his mother is overstepping.\n\nAnother point is that the mom is stepping into a role where she's both supporting her son and then forming a romantic relationship with someone connected to him. This could create a conflict of interest or make Ben feel conflicted between his mother and his friend.\n\nConsidering all these factors, it's a tricky situation. The mom's actions might not be legally wrong, but socially and emotionally, she could be in the wrong if it's causing harm to her son's well-being. Since Ben is still her adult child and they have a history of him being depressed, her decision might exacerbate his emotional state.\n\nOn the other hand, she's an adult too and has the right to date. However, given the dynamics, she might have failed to consider her son's feelings and the potential impact on their relationship. So, the answer might lean towards A (she's in the wrong) because she didn't consider the potential fallout for her son.\n"
