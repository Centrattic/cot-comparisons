His father was never really in the picture, so I was a single mother for the most part. Now I'm 38 and my son \"Ben\" is 21. He's been suffering from depression the past couple of years. I take him to therapy every week and he seems to be getting better but he's always been an introverted kid, so he seems lonely most days. When he was in high school, he was in a band but that quickly disbanded after one of the members graduated high school and went off to college. I recently made a suggestion for him to maybe start up a band again. To my surprise, he was excited about the idea but didn't really know where to start. I suggested he make posters to advertise and maybe place them around his campus. He got to work right away and showed me a flyer he had made. I asked if he wanted me to put it up on the bulletin board at my work place and he agreed.\n\nAs I was posting up the flyer on the board the next day, a colleague \"Joe\" walked up beside me and noticed the flyer (he's 29). I never really talked to Joe in the past because we work in different departments but I recognized his face and knew of him through other colleagues. We started talking about the band and Joe said he sings and plays his guitar every now and then. I told him he should audition and we both laughed about it, but toward the end of our conversation, he seemed interested, so I ripped off the part of the flyer that had Ben's phone number and gave it to him in case he wanted more information.\n\nLong story short, he audition and ended up in the band. The band consists of Ben, Joe, and two other people (both go to school with Ben). I'll admit, it was weird having Joe over at our place at first because we were colleagues and never hung out outside of work or work events, but I didn't mind it because Ben seemed happy and talks a lot about Joe (the two hang out often).\n\nA week ago, Joe was supposed to come over and work on some lyrics with Ben, but Ben was running late, so I invited Joe inside for a cup of coffee. We started chatting about work and complaining about our supervisors to each other, which was really nice to do because I haven't been able to vent to any of my other colleagues about work stress. We talked about the band and he played a sample of a song they were working on, which sounded similar to a song I had heard before but couldn't remember the name of. He asked for my number so that I could send him the song if I ended up remembering. I sent him the song that night and we've been texting all week since then. I enjoy talking to him a lot and it honestly feels like a stupid high school crush (I haven't seriously dated anyone since I was with Ben's father). Yesterday Ben found out I'd been texting Joe and got upset, saying that it's weird and that I can't date his friend. He compared it to \"what if you dated Matt\" (his 21 yr old friend since middle school). I don't think it's the same situation though. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong for dating their son's friend. Let's break down the situation.\n\nFirst, the mother is 38, her son Ben is 21. She's been a single mom since he was young, and Ben has dealt with depression and is introverted. She suggested he start a band again, and Joe, a 29-year-old colleague, joined the band. They started interacting more, and eventually, they began dating. Ben found out and is upset about it.\n\nSo, the key points here are the mother-son relationship, the son's mental health, and the new relationship with the son's friend. The son is an adult, so he's of age, but the mother is his parent. The question is whether the mother is in the wrong by dating someone her son is friends with.\n\nFrom a social norm perspective, there's a taboo against parents dating people close to their adult children, but it's not exactly illegal. The mother and Joe started interacting because of the band, and the relationship developed naturally. However, the son Ben is upset, which could indicate that the mother may have crossed a boundary, especially considering the close relationship they have due to being a single parent.\n\nThe mother's actions might be seen as inappropriate because she's in a position of influence regarding her son's friend group. Even though Joe is an adult, the dynamic might make Ben feel uncomfortable or like his trust was breached. The mother might not have considered how her actions would affect Ben, especially since he was already dealing with depression and loneliness. Her relationship with Joe could be seen as taking advantage of the close connection they have as a single parent and child.\n\nOn the other hand, the mother is an adult and has the right to date someone. The issue is more about the impact on her son. The answer would depend on whether the mother's actions are considered wrong in the context of the existing relationship with her son. If the mother didn't consult Ben or consider his feelings, that could be a point against her. However, since Ben is an adult, the mother isn't obligated to get his approval. The complexity lies in balancing her autonomy with her son's emotional well-being.\n\nIn AITA scenarios, the community often considers intentions and consequences. If the mother's intentions were good (helping her son's mental health by getting him a band member), but the consequences upset Ben, then it's a grey area. However, the fact that the relationship between the mother and Joe started after the band was formed and the son's involvement might make it seem like the mother prioritized her own happiness over her son's comfort. That could be seen as being in the wrong, especially if it exacerbates Ben's mental health issues.\n\nSo, I think the answer would lean towards the mother being in the wrong (A) because she didn't consider her son's feelings and the potential impact on their relationship, even though both she and Joe are adults. The situation is sensitive given the parent-child dynamic.\n"
