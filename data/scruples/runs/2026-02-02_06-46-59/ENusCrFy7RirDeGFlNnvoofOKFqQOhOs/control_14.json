His father was never really in the picture, so I was a single mother for the most part. Now I'm 38 and my son \"Ben\" is 21. He's been suffering from depression the past couple of years. I take him to therapy every week and he seems to be getting better but he's always been an introverted kid, so he seems lonely most days. When he was in high school, he was in a band but that quickly disbanded after one of the members graduated high school and went off to college. I recently made a suggestion for him to maybe start up a band again. To my surprise, he was excited about the idea but didn't really know where to start. I suggested he make posters to advertise and maybe place them around his campus. He got to work right away and showed me a flyer he had made. I asked if he wanted me to put it up on the bulletin board at my work place and he agreed.\n\nAs I was posting up the flyer on the board the next day, a colleague \"Joe\" walked up beside me and noticed the flyer (he's 29). I never really talked to Joe in the past because we work in different departments but I recognized his face and knew of him through other colleagues. We started talking about the band and Joe said he sings and plays his guitar every now and then. I told him he should audition and we both laughed about it, but toward the end of our conversation, he seemed interested, so I ripped off the part of the flyer that had Ben's phone number and gave it to him in case he wanted more information.\n\nLong story short, he audition and ended up in the band. The band consists of Ben, Joe, and two other people (both go to school with Ben). I'll admit, it was weird having Joe over at our place at first because we were colleagues and never hung out outside of work or work events, but I didn't mind it because Ben seemed happy and talks a lot about Joe (the two hang out often).\n\nA week ago, Joe was supposed to come over and work on some lyrics with Ben, but Ben was running late, so I invited Joe inside for a cup of coffee. We started chatting about work and complaining about our supervisors to each other, which was really nice to do because I haven't been able to vent to any of my other colleagues about work stress. We talked about the band and he played a sample of a song they were working on, which sounded similar to a song I had heard before but couldn't remember the name of. He asked for my number so that I could send him the song if I ended up remembering. I sent him the song that night and we've been texting all week since then. I enjoy talking to him a lot and it honestly feels like a stupid high school crush (I haven't seriously dated anyone since I was with Ben's father). Yesterday Ben found out I'd been texting Joe and got upset, saying that it's weird and that I can't date his friend. He compared it to \"what if you dated Matt\" (his 21 yr old friend since middle school). I don't think it's the same situation though. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to work through this. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for dating their son's friend. Let me break down the situation.\n\nFirst, the author is a single mother who had her son Ben at 17. Now Ben is 21, and she's 38. Ben has been dealing with depression and is introverted. She suggested he start a band again. He made a flyer, and she posted it at her workplace. Joe, a 29-year-old colleague from a different department, saw the flyer, joined the band, and started spending time with Ben. Then there was a coffee meeting where they talked about work and the band. They started texting, and Ben found out, which upset him.\n\nThe key points here are the age difference, the nature of the relationship, and Ben's feelings. The author is Ben's mother, and Joe is Ben's friend. The mother hasn't dated in a long time and is now developing a relationship with someone close to her son. Ben is 21, so he's an adult, but the mother-son dynamic is still present. \n\nI need to consider if there's a conflict of interest here. The mother's actions might make Ben feel uncomfortable, as she's dating his friend. Even though Ben is an adult, the mother might be overstepping by getting involved in someone who is her son's friend. Also, there's the potential for Ben to feel like his personal space is invaded, especially since Joe is part of his social circle.\n\nAnother angle is the workplace aspect. The mother and Joe work in the same place, though different departments. They only started interacting more because of Ben's band. If they start a relationship, there could be workplace complications. But the main issue here is Ben's reaction and the mother's responsibility as a parent. \n\nThe mother might not be in the wrong if she's genuinely happy and Joe is a good person. However, the situation could affect Ben's trust and comfort. The mother should consider Ben's feelings and maybe have an open conversation with him to address his concerns. But is she actually in the wrong? Well, if she's being honest and not manipulating the situation, maybe not. However, the act of dating a son's friend can be seen as crossing a boundary, even if unintentionally. \n\nThere's also the question of whether Ben is old enough to handle such a situation. He's an adult, so his feelings matter, but the mother isn't obligated to prioritize his comfort over her own happiness. Still, she should be respectful of his feelings. Since she didn't intentionally set out to date Joe, but the relationship developed naturally, it's a bit of a gray area. \n\nIn terms of ethical responsibility, the mother isn't necessarily wrong if she's not causing harm. However, the potential for discomfort for Ben exists. The answer might depend on cultural or personal values. But given that both are adults and Ben is not a minor anymore, the mother isn't in the wrong. However, she should communicate with Ben to manage the situation sensitively.\n"
