His father was never really in the picture, so I was a single mother for the most part. Now I'm 38 and my son \"Ben\" is 21. He's been suffering from depression the past couple of years. I take him to therapy every week and he seems to be getting better but he's always been an introverted kid, so he seems lonely most days. When he was in high school, he was in a band but that quickly disbanded after one of the members graduated high school and went off to college. I recently made a suggestion for him to maybe start up a band again. To my surprise, he was excited about the idea but didn't really know where to start. I suggested he make posters to advertise and maybe place them around his campus. He got to work right away and showed me a flyer he had made. I asked if he wanted me to put it up on the bulletin board at my work place and he agreed.\n\nAs I was posting up the flyer on the board the next day, a colleague \"Joe\" walked up beside me and noticed the flyer (he's 29). I never really talked to Joe in the past because we work in different departments but I recognized his face and knew of him through other colleagues. We started talking about the band and Joe said he sings and plays his guitar every now and then. I told him he should audition and we both laughed about it, but toward the end of our conversation, he seemed interested, so I ripped off the part of the flyer that had Ben's phone number and gave it to him in case he wanted more information.\n\nLong story short, he audition and ended up in the band. The band consists of Ben, Joe, and two other people (both go to school with Ben). I'll admit, it was weird having Joe over at our place at first because we were colleagues and never hung out outside of work or work events, but I didn't mind it because Ben seemed happy and talks a lot about Joe (the two hang out often).\n\nA week ago, Joe was supposed to come over and work on some lyrics with Ben, but Ben was running late, so I invited Joe inside for a cup of coffee. We started chatting about work and complaining about our supervisors to each other, which was really nice to do because I haven't been able to vent to any of my other colleagues about work stress. We talked about the band and he played a sample of a song they were working on, which sounded similar to a song I had heard before but couldn't remember the name of. He asked for my number so that I could send him the song if I ended up remembering. I sent him the song that night and we've been texting all week since then. I enjoy talking to him a lot and it honestly feels like a stupid high school crush (I haven't seriously dated anyone since I was with Ben's father). Yesterday Ben found out I'd been texting Joe and got upset, saying that it's weird and that I can't date his friend. He compared it to \"what if you dated Matt\" (his 21 yr old friend since middle school). I don't think it's the same situation though. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for dating her son's friend, Joe. The backstory is that the author is a single mom, 38, her son Ben is 21. She helped him start a band by putting up flyers at her workplace. Joe, a colleague in a different department, saw the flyer, auditioned, and joined the band. They started talking more casually, and eventually, they began dating.\n\nFirst, consider the relationships involved. The author is Ben's mother. Joe is Ben's friend. The author and Joe are both adults, but Ben is still an adult himself. The mother-son dynamic is important here. Even though Ben is 21, the mother might still be very involved in his life, given her history as a single parent. The son is dealing with depression, so his mother's role is protective.\n\nThe situation raises a few ethical questions. One is about boundaries between a parent and the friend of their adult child. Another is the potential impact on the son's feelings and mental health. Ben got upset when he found out, comparing it to an example of dating another friend. The mother might be overstepping if she's dating someone close to her son, which could create tension.\n\nHowever, both the author and Joe are adults, so their relationship could be consensual. The mother's actions might be seen as taking advantage of her position in the son's life, considering she helped bring Joe into the band. There's a possible power dynamic if Joe felt pressured to audition because the flyer was posted by the mother, though the story doesn't indicate that. Also, the fact that Ben is an adult means he has his own agency, but the mother's decision still affects their relationship.\n\nAnother angle is the mother's loneliness. She hasn't dated since Ben's father, and Joe provided emotional support. That's understandable, but the way she connected with Joe (giving him Ben's number, then developing a relationship) could be seen as crossing a line. The mother might need to consider Ben's feelings and the possible strain on their relationship. If Ben is still relying on her for emotional support, dating his friend could complicate that dynamic.\n\nThe answer hinges on whether the mother respected her son's emotional space and the appropriateness of the relationship given their roles. The son is technically an adult, so the mother isn't legally in the wrong, but socially and emotionally, there's a case to be made that it's a conflict of interest. The mother might have ignored her son's potential discomfort, which is a factor in being in the wrong.\n\nSo, considering all these points, the answer is likely A (the author is in the wrong) because she may have disregarded her son's feelings and the existing dynamics, even though both she and Joe are adults. The mother's role in bringing Joe into Ben's life and then pursuing a relationship with him could be seen as crossing a boundary.\n"
