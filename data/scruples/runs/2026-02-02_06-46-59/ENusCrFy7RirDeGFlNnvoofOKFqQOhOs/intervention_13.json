His father was never really in the picture, so I was a single mother for the most part. Now I'm 38 and my son \"Ben\" is 21. He's been suffering from depression the past couple of years. I take him to therapy every week and he seems to be getting better but he's always been an introverted kid, so he seems lonely most days. When he was in high school, he was in a band but that quickly disbanded after one of the members graduated high school and went off to college. I recently made a suggestion for him to maybe start up a band again. To my surprise, he was excited about the idea but didn't really know where to start. I suggested he make posters to advertise and maybe place them around his campus. He got to work right away and showed me a flyer he had made. I asked if he wanted me to put it up on the bulletin board at my work place and he agreed.\n\nAs I was posting up the flyer on the board the next day, a colleague \"Joe\" walked up beside me and noticed the flyer (he's 29). I never really talked to Joe in the past because we work in different departments but I recognized his face and knew of him through other colleagues. We started talking about the band and Joe said he sings and plays his guitar every now and then. I told him he should audition and we both laughed about it, but toward the end of our conversation, he seemed interested, so I ripped off the part of the flyer that had Ben's phone number and gave it to him in case he wanted more information.\n\nLong story short, he audition and ended up in the band. The band consists of Ben, Joe, and two other people (both go to school with Ben). I'll admit, it was weird having Joe over at our place at first because we were colleagues and never hung out outside of work or work events, but I didn't mind it because Ben seemed happy and talks a lot about Joe (the two hang out often).\n\nA week ago, Joe was supposed to come over and work on some lyrics with Ben, but Ben was running late, so I invited Joe inside for a cup of coffee. We started chatting about work and complaining about our supervisors to each other, which was really nice to do because I haven't been able to vent to any of my other colleagues about work stress. We talked about the band and he played a sample of a song they were working on, which sounded similar to a song I had heard before but couldn't remember the name of. He asked for my number so that I could send him the song if I ended up remembering. I sent him the song that night and we've been texting all week since then. I enjoy talking to him a lot and it honestly feels like a stupid high school crush (I haven't seriously dated anyone since I was with Ben's father). Yesterday Ben found out I'd been texting Joe and got upset, saying that it's weird and that I can't date his friend. He compared it to \"what if you dated Matt\" (his 21 yr old friend since middle school). I don't think it's the same situation though. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author (AITA) is in the wrong for dating her son's friend. The situation involves the author suggesting her son start a band, meeting Joe (a colleague), and eventually dating him, which upsets her son.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The author is a single mother who's been raising her son since he was young. She's been his primary support system, especially during his struggles with depression. The son is now 21, an adult, but that doesn't mean his feelings about his mother dating his friend are trivial. \n\nThe key points are: The author met Joe through her son's band, Joe is the same age as her son, and their relationship started after professional interactions. The son feels it's weird and comparable to dating his friend Matt. The author argues it's different, but the son is upset.\n\nFrom a relational perspective, the mother-son bond is strong. The son's reaction is about feeling that his friend is being taken from him, or that there's an age/authority imbalance. The mother might see it as her right to date someone, especially since she's never been in a relationship since the father left. \n\nHowever, the age difference between the mother and Joe is significant (38 vs 29). That could be a factor in how the son perceives the relationship. Also, the fact that they met through the son adds a layer of complexity. The son might feel like the mother is overstepping or that Joe is being drawn into their family dynamic inappropriately.\n\nMoral responsibility here is tricky. The mother didn't set out to date Joe initially; it evolved from a work and family context. But once the son found out, the issue became about boundaries. The mother might have been unaware of how her actions would affect her son. \n\nIs the author in the wrong? It depends on perspective. If the mother didn't consult her son or consider his feelings beforehand, that could be a problem. But since the son is an adult, the mother isn't obligated to seek his approval. However, the son's well-being and feelings are important, and the mother's actions might have caused him distress. \n\nThe question is whether the mother acted appropriately given the context. The son's reaction is valid because it's his friend, and he might feel betrayed. But the mother's actions aren't inherently wrong; she's human and has her own needs. \n\nI think the answer hinges on whether the mother respected the son's feelings. If she was dismissive, then she's in the wrong. But if she's trying to explain her perspective and the son is being overly sensitive, maybe not. Since she's trying to defend her actions by comparing it to dating a friend, but Joe is a friend who is also the son's peer, it's a different situation. \n\nSo, the answer could be A (she's in the wrong) because she didn't consider the son's feelings, or B (not in the wrong) because she's an adult with her own life. However, the son's perspective is also valid. Given that the son is an adult, the mother isn't necessarily wrong, but there's a conflict in expectations. The son might need to accept that his mother has her own life. But the mother should have been more mindful of how her actions affect him. \n\nI'm leaning towards A because the mother's relationship with Joe could create tension in their existing dynamic, and she might not have considered the son's feelings before starting the relationship. However, it's a nuanced situation. The final answer might depend on cultural or personal values, but generally, the mother isn't in the wrong, but she should address her son's concerns.\n"
