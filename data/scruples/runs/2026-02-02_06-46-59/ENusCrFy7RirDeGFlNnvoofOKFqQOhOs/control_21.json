His father was never really in the picture, so I was a single mother for the most part. Now I'm 38 and my son \"Ben\" is 21. He's been suffering from depression the past couple of years. I take him to therapy every week and he seems to be getting better but he's always been an introverted kid, so he seems lonely most days. When he was in high school, he was in a band but that quickly disbanded after one of the members graduated high school and went off to college. I recently made a suggestion for him to maybe start up a band again. To my surprise, he was excited about the idea but didn't really know where to start. I suggested he make posters to advertise and maybe place them around his campus. He got to work right away and showed me a flyer he had made. I asked if he wanted me to put it up on the bulletin board at my work place and he agreed.\n\nAs I was posting up the flyer on the board the next day, a colleague \"Joe\" walked up beside me and noticed the flyer (he's 29). I never really talked to Joe in the past because we work in different departments but I recognized his face and knew of him through other colleagues. We started talking about the band and Joe said he sings and plays his guitar every now and then. I told him he should audition and we both laughed about it, but toward the end of our conversation, he seemed interested, so I ripped off the part of the flyer that had Ben's phone number and gave it to him in case he wanted more information.\n\nLong story short, he audition and ended up in the band. The band consists of Ben, Joe, and two other people (both go to school with Ben). I'll admit, it was weird having Joe over at our place at first because we were colleagues and never hung out outside of work or work events, but I didn't mind it because Ben seemed happy and talks a lot about Joe (the two hang out often).\n\nA week ago, Joe was supposed to come over and work on some lyrics with Ben, but Ben was running late, so I invited Joe inside for a cup of coffee. We started chatting about work and complaining about our supervisors to each other, which was really nice to do because I haven't been able to vent to any of my other colleagues about work stress. We talked about the band and he played a sample of a song they were working on, which sounded similar to a song I had heard before but couldn't remember the name of. He asked for my number so that I could send him the song if I ended up remembering. I sent him the song that night and we've been texting all week since then. I enjoy talking to him a lot and it honestly feels like a stupid high school crush (I haven't seriously dated anyone since I was with Ben's father). Yesterday Ben found out I'd been texting Joe and got upset, saying that it's weird and that I can't date his friend. He compared it to \"what if you dated Matt\" (his 21 yr old friend since middle school). I don't think it's the same situation though. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for dating her son's friend. The situation starts with her being a single mom to Ben, who's 21. She helped him start a band, and Joe, a colleague, joined. Initially, they just interacted in the context of the band. Then, when Ben was late, she invited Joe in for coffee, leading to more texting. Ben found out and is upset, comparing it to dating his friend Matt. The key points here are the relationship dynamics and boundaries.\n\nFirst, the author is Ben's mother, so there's an inherent responsibility to consider his feelings. Ben is 21, an adult, but he's dealing with depression and might feel vulnerable. The mother's role in his life might make him feel replaced or neglected if she prioritizes someone else. However, the mother is also an adult with the right to pursue her own happiness. The fact that she hasn't dated in a while and is exploring a connection that seems mutual might be valid. \n\nBut there's a potential conflict of interest here. The mother works with Joe, so there's a workplace dynamic. Although they're both in different departments, dating a colleague can complicate work environments. Also, Ben is close to Joe, so the mother dating him could affect Ben's relationship with both. Ben's reaction is valid because it's a new situation for him, and he's upset about the change in dynamics. \n\nThe mother didn't set boundaries upfront, which might have led to this issue. If she had discussed with Ben first before getting close to Joe, maybe things would be different. However, the mother's actions weren't malicious; she was helping her son and then formed a connection organically. \n\nThere's also the aspect of Ben's mental health. He's been suffering from depression and might be sensitive to changes in his support system. The mother needs to consider how her actions affect him. On the other hand, she's entitled to her own relationships. \n\nIn terms of right or wrong, it's a bit of a gray area. The mother might not be in the wrong if she's acting in good faith, but she needs to navigate the situation carefully, respecting Ben's feelings while also respecting her own. The key is communication and setting boundaries. However, since the question is whether she's in the wrong, the answer depends on perspectives. Some might say she's not in the wrong because it's her life, while others might say she should have considered Ben's feelings more. But given the context, maybe the answer leans towards B, not in the wrong, because she's an adult with the right to date, but she needs to manage the situation sensitively with her son.\n"
