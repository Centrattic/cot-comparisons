His father was never really in the picture, so I was a single mother for the most part. Now I'm 38 and my son \"Ben\" is 21. He's been suffering from depression the past couple of years. I take him to therapy every week and he seems to be getting better but he's always been an introverted kid, so he seems lonely most days. When he was in high school, he was in a band but that quickly disbanded after one of the members graduated high school and went off to college. I recently made a suggestion for him to maybe start up a band again. To my surprise, he was excited about the idea but didn't really know where to start. I suggested he make posters to advertise and maybe place them around his campus. He got to work right away and showed me a flyer he had made. I asked if he wanted me to put it up on the bulletin board at my work place and he agreed.\n\nAs I was posting up the flyer on the board the next day, a colleague \"Joe\" walked up beside me and noticed the flyer (he's 29). I never really talked to Joe in the past because we work in different departments but I recognized his face and knew of him through other colleagues. We started talking about the band and Joe said he sings and plays his guitar every now and then. I told him he should audition and we both laughed about it, but toward the end of our conversation, he seemed interested, so I ripped off the part of the flyer that had Ben's phone number and gave it to him in case he wanted more information.\n\nLong story short, he audition and ended up in the band. The band consists of Ben, Joe, and two other people (both go to school with Ben). I'll admit, it was weird having Joe over at our place at first because we were colleagues and never hung out outside of work or work events, but I didn't mind it because Ben seemed happy and talks a lot about Joe (the two hang out often).\n\nA week ago, Joe was supposed to come over and work on some lyrics with Ben, but Ben was running late, so I invited Joe inside for a cup of coffee. We started chatting about work and complaining about our supervisors to each other, which was really nice to do because I haven't been able to vent to any of my other colleagues about work stress. We talked about the band and he played a sample of a song they were working on, which sounded similar to a song I had heard before but couldn't remember the name of. He asked for my number so that I could send him the song if I ended up remembering. I sent him the song that night and we've been texting all week since then. I enjoy talking to him a lot and it honestly feels like a stupid high school crush (I haven't seriously dated anyone since I was with Ben's father). Yesterday Ben found out I'd been texting Joe and got upset, saying that it's weird and that I can't date his friend. He compared it to \"what if you dated Matt\" (his 21 yr old friend since middle school). I don't think it's the same situation though. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the story (the author) is in the wrong for dating her son's friend, Joe. The user thinks the author is in the wrong but wants confirmation.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The author is a single mother who has been raising her son, Ben, since he was 17. Now Ben is 21 and dealing with depression. The author helped him start a band, which brought Joe into their lives. Joe is 29 and became part of the band. The initial interaction between the author and Joe was work-related, but they started talking more, leading to a romantic connection. Ben found out and is upset, comparing it to dating a friend from his youth.\n\nThe key points here are the age difference, the power dynamic between the mother and her adult son, and the potential impact on Ben's well-being. The author is 38, and Joe is 29. Ben is 21, so Joe is only 8 years older than Ben. But Ben is an adult, so he's capable of forming his own relationships. However, the author is his mother, which complicates things. The question is whether the author overstepped by entering a relationship with a friend of her adult son.\n\nFrom a legal standpoint, there's no issue since both the author and Joe are adults. But socially and emotionally, it's a sensitive situation. Ben might feel that his friend is being taken advantage of, or that the mother is invading his social circle. The author's intentions were to help Ben by bringing Joe into the band, but the relationship evolving into a romantic one could be seen as a conflict of interest, especially if Joe's presence in the band depends on the mother's approval.\n\nAlso, considering Ben's history of depression and loneliness, the author's new relationship might affect his mental health. If Ben feels betrayed or neglected, that could exacerbate his depression. The author might be neglecting her son's emotional needs by pursuing her own, even if she's an adult.\n\nOn the other hand, the author is an adult and has the right to date. She's been isolated in her dating life, and Joe is a colleague she connected with. The relationship isn't between the mother and a minor son's friend, but with an adult friend of her adult son. However, the dynamic of being a parent and forming a relationship with a friend of a child, even an adult one, can create tension and potential for conflict, especially if the son feels his friend's autonomy is being undermined.\n\nIn conclusion, while there's no legal wrongdoing, the ethical and emotional aspects are complicated. The author might be in the wrong because her actions could harm her son's well-being and create an awkward situation with Joe, who is part of the band Ben formed with her help. The mother's role is to support her son, and dating his friend could interfere with that. So, the answer might be A (the author is in the wrong).\n"
