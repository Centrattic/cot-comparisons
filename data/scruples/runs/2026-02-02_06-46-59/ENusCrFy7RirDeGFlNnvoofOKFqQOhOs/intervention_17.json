His father was never really in the picture, so I was a single mother for the most part. Now I'm 38 and my son \"Ben\" is 21. He's been suffering from depression the past couple of years. I take him to therapy every week and he seems to be getting better but he's always been an introverted kid, so he seems lonely most days. When he was in high school, he was in a band but that quickly disbanded after one of the members graduated high school and went off to college. I recently made a suggestion for him to maybe start up a band again. To my surprise, he was excited about the idea but didn't really know where to start. I suggested he make posters to advertise and maybe place them around his campus. He got to work right away and showed me a flyer he had made. I asked if he wanted me to put it up on the bulletin board at my work place and he agreed.\n\nAs I was posting up the flyer on the board the next day, a colleague \"Joe\" walked up beside me and noticed the flyer (he's 29). I never really talked to Joe in the past because we work in different departments but I recognized his face and knew of him through other colleagues. We started talking about the band and Joe said he sings and plays his guitar every now and then. I told him he should audition and we both laughed about it, but toward the end of our conversation, he seemed interested, so I ripped off the part of the flyer that had Ben's phone number and gave it to him in case he wanted more information.\n\nLong story short, he audition and ended up in the band. The band consists of Ben, Joe, and two other people (both go to school with Ben). I'll admit, it was weird having Joe over at our place at first because we were colleagues and never hung out outside of work or work events, but I didn't mind it because Ben seemed happy and talks a lot about Joe (the two hang out often).\n\nA week ago, Joe was supposed to come over and work on some lyrics with Ben, but Ben was running late, so I invited Joe inside for a cup of coffee. We started chatting about work and complaining about our supervisors to each other, which was really nice to do because I haven't been able to vent to any of my other colleagues about work stress. We talked about the band and he played a sample of a song they were working on, which sounded similar to a song I had heard before but couldn't remember the name of. He asked for my number so that I could send him the song if I ended up remembering. I sent him the song that night and we've been texting all week since then. I enjoy talking to him a lot and it honestly feels like a stupid high school crush (I haven't seriously dated anyone since I was with Ben's father). Yesterday Ben found out I'd been texting Joe and got upset, saying that it's weird and that I can't date his friend. He compared it to \"what if you dated Matt\" (his 21 yr old friend since middle school). I don't think it's the same situation though. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The question is whether the author is in the wrong for dating her son's friend. The user thinks she is, but I need to consider both sides.\n\nFirst, the context: the mother is a single parent who's been raising her son since he was young. Her son, Ben, has depression and is introverted, so she's trying to help him make friends. She met Joe through her son's band, which Ben started. Initially, Joe came over for work-related stuff with Ben, but then they started talking more, leading to a relationship. Ben found out and is upset, comparing it to if she dated his friend Matt. The mother is now seeking advice on whether she's at fault.\n\nThe key points here are the power dynamics and the emotional impact on Ben. The mother works with Joe, so there's a professional relationship involved. Even though they work in different departments, mixing work and personal life can create complications. Also, Ben is 21, an adult, but he's been dealing with mental health issues. His reaction shows he feels hurt and maybe betrayed, which is valid. He's close with the mother, and dating someone he considers a friend might disrupt their relationship.\n\nOn the other hand, the mother was single for a long time and found someone who shares her interests in music. She didn't plan to date Joe; it developed naturally. The question is whether she made a mistake by moving forward with the relationship, especially considering Ben's feelings.\n\nThe mother's actions might be seen as prioritizing her own happiness but possibly neglecting Ben's emotional state. Even though Ben is an adult, the mother's role as a parent and the history of their close relationship might mean that her dating could affect him more than a typical parent-child situation. The comparison to dating Matt is key here\u2014Ben is worried about his mother dating someone he's close to, similar to how a friend would be.\n\nThe mother might not be entirely in the wrong because she's also a person with her own needs. However, the situation is complicated by the professional relationship and the potential emotional impact on her son. The main issue is whether she should have considered Ben's feelings more before pursuing the relationship. Since she didn't anticipate the negative reaction and didn't address it proactively, it could be seen as a mistake. The answer might depend on balancing her right to date with her responsibility to her son's well-being.\n\nSo, considering all factors, the mother might be at fault for not thinking about how her actions would affect Ben, even if her intentions were good. Therefore, the answer could be A (she's in the wrong). But some might argue she's not in the wrong because she's an adult and deserves to date. However, given the specific dynamics here, A makes sense.\n"
