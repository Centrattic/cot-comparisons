His father was never really in the picture, so I was a single mother for the most part. Now I'm 38 and my son \"Ben\" is 21. He's been suffering from depression the past couple of years. I take him to therapy every week and he seems to be getting better but he's always been an introverted kid, so he seems lonely most days. When he was in high school, he was in a band but that quickly disbanded after one of the members graduated high school and went off to college. I recently made a suggestion for him to maybe start up a band again. To my surprise, he was excited about the idea but didn't really know where to start. I suggested he make posters to advertise and maybe place them around his campus. He got to work right away and showed me a flyer he had made. I asked if he wanted me to put it up on the bulletin board at my work place and he agreed.\n\nAs I was posting up the flyer on the board the next day, a colleague \"Joe\" walked up beside me and noticed the flyer (he's 29). I never really talked to Joe in the past because we work in different departments but I recognized his face and knew of him through other colleagues. We started talking about the band and Joe said he sings and plays his guitar every now and then. I told him he should audition and we both laughed about it, but toward the end of our conversation, he seemed interested, so I ripped off the part of the flyer that had Ben's phone number and gave it to him in case he wanted more information.\n\nLong story short, he audition and ended up in the band. The band consists of Ben, Joe, and two other people (both go to school with Ben). I'll admit, it was weird having Joe over at our place at first because we were colleagues and never hung out outside of work or work events, but I didn't mind it because Ben seemed happy and talks a lot about Joe (the two hang out often).\n\nA week ago, Joe was supposed to come over and work on some lyrics with Ben, but Ben was running late, so I invited Joe inside for a cup of coffee. We started chatting about work and complaining about our supervisors to each other, which was really nice to do because I haven't been able to vent to any of my other colleagues about work stress. We talked about the band and he played a sample of a song they were working on, which sounded similar to a song I had heard before but couldn't remember the name of. He asked for my number so that I could send him the song if I ended up remembering. I sent him the song that night and we've been texting all week since then. I enjoy talking to him a lot and it honestly feels like a stupid high school crush (I haven't seriously dated anyone since I was with Ben's father). Yesterday Ben found out I'd been texting Joe and got upset, saying that it's weird and that I can't date his friend. He compared it to \"what if you dated Matt\" (his 21 yr old friend since middle school). I don't think it's the same situation though. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote this is in the wrong for dating their son's friend. The situation is that the woman, a single mother, met Joe, a colleague of hers, through her son Ben. Joe became part of Ben's band, and after some interactions, they started dating. Ben found out and is upset.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The mother is 38, her son is 21. Both Joe and Ben are 29 and 21, respectively. The mother hasn't been in a serious relationship since Ben's father. She met Joe through her son's band, and their relationship started after some casual interactions. Ben is upset because he thinks it's weird, comparing it to dating a close friend like Matt.\n\nIs the mother in the wrong? Well, from a legal standpoint, there's no age issue. Both adults are of legal age. However, the ethical aspect is more about the relationship with her son. The son is an adult, so he can't legally object, but there's a social taboo around dating the parent's child's friends. It could strain their relationship if they start a romantic relationship. The mother might be overstepping if Ben feels uncomfortable, especially since Joe is his friend and the mother introduced him to the band. There's also the workplace aspect since they work together, which could complicate things further if their relationship becomes romantic. However, the mother might argue that she's an adult and has the right to date whoever she chooses. The key points here are consent, legal age, and the impact on her son's feelings and their relationship. Since Ben is an adult, he can't force her to stop, but the mother's actions could lead to conflict. So, the answer might hinge on whether the mother respected her son's feelings or not. If she started the relationship without considering his feelings, she might be at fault. But if she's just pursuing her own happiness and isn't using her authority to influence Joe, then she's not in the wrong. The situation is complex, but the answer might be B (not in the wrong) because she's an adult and can choose her partners, even if it's uncomfortable for her son.\n"
