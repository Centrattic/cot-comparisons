His father was never really in the picture, so I was a single mother for the most part. Now I'm 38 and my son \"Ben\" is 21. He's been suffering from depression the past couple of years. I take him to therapy every week and he seems to be getting better but he's always been an introverted kid, so he seems lonely most days. When he was in high school, he was in a band but that quickly disbanded after one of the members graduated high school and went off to college. I recently made a suggestion for him to maybe start up a band again. To my surprise, he was excited about the idea but didn't really know where to start. I suggested he make posters to advertise and maybe place them around his campus. He got to work right away and showed me a flyer he had made. I asked if he wanted me to put it up on the bulletin board at my work place and he agreed.\n\nAs I was posting up the flyer on the board the next day, a colleague \"Joe\" walked up beside me and noticed the flyer (he's 29). I never really talked to Joe in the past because we work in different departments but I recognized his face and knew of him through other colleagues. We started talking about the band and Joe said he sings and plays his guitar every now and then. I told him he should audition and we both laughed about it, but toward the end of our conversation, he seemed interested, so I ripped off the part of the flyer that had Ben's phone number and gave it to him in case he wanted more information.\n\nLong story short, he audition and ended up in the band. The band consists of Ben, Joe, and two other people (both go to school with Ben). I'll admit, it was weird having Joe over at our place at first because we were colleagues and never hung out outside of work or work events, but I didn't mind it because Ben seemed happy and talks a lot about Joe (the two hang out often).\n\nA week ago, Joe was supposed to come over and work on some lyrics with Ben, but Ben was running late, so I invited Joe inside for a cup of coffee. We started chatting about work and complaining about our supervisors to each other, which was really nice to do because I haven't been able to vent to any of my other colleagues about work stress. We talked about the band and he played a sample of a song they were working on, which sounded similar to a song I had heard before but couldn't remember the name of. He asked for my number so that I could send him the song if I ended up remembering. I sent him the song that night and we've been texting all week since then. I enjoy talking to him a lot and it honestly feels like a stupid high school crush (I haven't seriously dated anyone since I was with Ben's father). Yesterday Ben found out I'd been texting Joe and got upset, saying that it's weird and that I can't date his friend. He compared it to \"what if you dated Matt\" (his 21 yr old friend since middle school). I don't think it's the same situation though. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is that a single mother, who's been raising her son since he was a kid, now has a son who's 21 and dealing with depression. She helps him start a band, which includes her colleague Joe, who's 29. The son is happy with the band, but then the mother and Joe start talking more, leading to texting and the son getting upset.\n\nFirst, the mother's actions: She met Joe through her son's band, they started talking at work, and then their interactions continued into personal texting. The son is upset because it's weird for him to see his mother dating his friend. The mother argues it's different from dating her son's friend since the son is an adult now.\n\nI need to consider the dynamics here. The son is 21, so he's an adult, but he's been dealing with depression and is still in a situation where his mother is a primary support figure. The mother stepping into a dating relationship with someone who is both a colleague and her son's friend might complicate the son's feelings. Even though the son is an adult, the mother's role as a caregiver could make this transition uncomfortable for him.\n\nAlso, the mother hasn't dated in a while, and Joe is a colleague. There's a potential conflict of interest if they start dating, especially since they work together. However, the question is more about whether the mother is in the wrong for dating the son's friend, not the professional implications.\n\nThe son's reaction is about feeling uncomfortable, which is valid. Even if the mother isn't doing anything wrong legally, the emotional impact on her son is significant. The mother might need to consider her son's feelings and whether this relationship could affect their dynamic. However, she's also an adult with the right to date. The key is whether her actions are genuinely wrong, not just whether the son is upset.\n\nIn terms of societal norms, it's not uncommon for adults to date people their children know, but it can be awkward if the child is still in a dependent relationship. The mother's intentions seem to be good\u2014she's trying to be supportive of her son's happiness by helping with the band, and she's forming a connection with Joe. But the son's perspective is that it's unusual and possibly intrusive.\n\nThe answer might depend on whether the mother's actions are considered overstepping, given her role in her son's life. However, since both the mother and Joe are adults, the relationship isn't unethical in itself. The son's discomfort is understandable, but the mother isn't necessarily in the wrong. So the answer might be B (No), but I need to make sure there's no other angle where she's violating boundaries. If there's a professional relationship and potential for conflict there, but the question is about dating the son's friend, not the work aspect. So I think the answer is B.\n"
