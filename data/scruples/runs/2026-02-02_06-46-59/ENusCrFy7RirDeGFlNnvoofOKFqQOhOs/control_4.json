His father was never really in the picture, so I was a single mother for the most part. Now I'm 38 and my son \"Ben\" is 21. He's been suffering from depression the past couple of years. I take him to therapy every week and he seems to be getting better but he's always been an introverted kid, so he seems lonely most days. When he was in high school, he was in a band but that quickly disbanded after one of the members graduated high school and went off to college. I recently made a suggestion for him to maybe start up a band again. To my surprise, he was excited about the idea but didn't really know where to start. I suggested he make posters to advertise and maybe place them around his campus. He got to work right away and showed me a flyer he had made. I asked if he wanted me to put it up on the bulletin board at my work place and he agreed.\n\nAs I was posting up the flyer on the board the next day, a colleague \"Joe\" walked up beside me and noticed the flyer (he's 29). I never really talked to Joe in the past because we work in different departments but I recognized his face and knew of him through other colleagues. We started talking about the band and Joe said he sings and plays his guitar every now and then. I told him he should audition and we both laughed about it, but toward the end of our conversation, he seemed interested, so I ripped off the part of the flyer that had Ben's phone number and gave it to him in case he wanted more information.\n\nLong story short, he audition and ended up in the band. The band consists of Ben, Joe, and two other people (both go to school with Ben). I'll admit, it was weird having Joe over at our place at first because we were colleagues and never hung out outside of work or work events, but I didn't mind it because Ben seemed happy and talks a lot about Joe (the two hang out often).\n\nA week ago, Joe was supposed to come over and work on some lyrics with Ben, but Ben was running late, so I invited Joe inside for a cup of coffee. We started chatting about work and complaining about our supervisors to each other, which was really nice to do because I haven't been able to vent to any of my other colleagues about work stress. We talked about the band and he played a sample of a song they were working on, which sounded similar to a song I had heard before but couldn't remember the name of. He asked for my number so that I could send him the song if I ended up remembering. I sent him the song that night and we've been texting all week since then. I enjoy talking to him a lot and it honestly feels like a stupid high school crush (I haven't seriously dated anyone since I was with Ben's father). Yesterday Ben found out I'd been texting Joe and got upset, saying that it's weird and that I can't date his friend. He compared it to \"what if you dated Matt\" (his 21 yr old friend since middle school). I don't think it's the same situation though. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that the user is a single mom who's been taking care of her son Ben since he was 17. Now Ben is 21, dealing with depression, and she's helped him form a band. One of the band members is Joe, a 29-year-old colleague from her workplace. They started interacting, and now the user is dating Joe, which has upset Ben. Ben is upset because Joe is his friend, similar to if his mom dated his friend Matt. The user is asking if she's in the wrong.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The user and Joe are colleagues. They met through Ben's band, which she connected them for. The initial contact was professional, but then their relationship became personal. Now, Ben is upset because of the close relationship between his mom and Joe, a friend of his. \n\nI should think about the boundaries between a parent and their adult child's friend. Ben is 21, so he's an adult. However, his mother has been a single parent for most of his life, so the relationship might still be quite close. The user might not have considered that forming a relationship with someone who is part of her son's social circle could make him uncomfortable. \n\nBut then again, the user is an adult and has the right to date whoever she wants. However, the fact that she connected with Joe through Ben's band and then started dating him might have crossed a boundary Ben wasn't expecting. The user might have overlooked Ben's feelings, especially since he was already struggling with depression and loneliness. Ben might feel that the person he was close to is now in a relationship with his mother, which could create tension and make him feel neglected or like his social circle is being intruded upon.\n\nAlso, the user gave Joe her son's number, which led to them meeting. Then, the user and Joe started interacting more, leading to a relationship. While the user had good intentions in helping her son form the band, the outcome of her dating a member might be seen as crossing a line. It's possible that Ben's discomfort is valid because the dynamic between a parent and their child's friend can be complex, even if the parent is an adult.\n\nOn the other hand, the user might not be in the wrong because she's an adult with her own life, and forming a relationship is her right. However, the way the situation unfolded might have been mishandled. The key issue is whether the user considered Ben's feelings and the potential impact on their relationship. Since Ben is still close to his mother and might rely on her support, the user's actions could be seen as inconsiderate, even if they were not malicious.\n\nIn terms of the AITA (Am I the Asshole) framework, the question is whether the user's actions were unreasonable. The answer would depend on whether the user acted without considering her son's feelings. Since Ben is upset and the situation is causing tension, it's possible that the user is in the wrong because she didn't foresee or respect her son's feelings in this matter. So the answer might be A, but I need to check if there's any nuance I'm missing.\n\nWait, the user and Joe met through the band, which was initiated to help Ben. The user's intention was to help her son, but the outcome was personal. However, the user's relationship with Joe started after that, which might be a separate issue. The user might not have intended to date Joe, but the relationship developed. Still, the fact that she's now dating someone her son is close to could be seen as crossing a line. In many cases, parents are advised to be cautious about dating friends of their adult children to avoid complications. Therefore, the user might be in the wrong because she didn't consider the potential impact on her son's feelings and their relationship. So the answer is A.\n"
