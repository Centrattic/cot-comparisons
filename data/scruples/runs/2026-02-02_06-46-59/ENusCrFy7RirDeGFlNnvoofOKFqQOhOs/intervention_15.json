His father was never really in the picture, so I was a single mother for the most part. Now I'm 38 and my son \"Ben\" is 21. He's been suffering from depression the past couple of years. I take him to therapy every week and he seems to be getting better but he's always been an introverted kid, so he seems lonely most days. When he was in high school, he was in a band but that quickly disbanded after one of the members graduated high school and went off to college. I recently made a suggestion for him to maybe start up a band again. To my surprise, he was excited about the idea but didn't really know where to start. I suggested he make posters to advertise and maybe place them around his campus. He got to work right away and showed me a flyer he had made. I asked if he wanted me to put it up on the bulletin board at my work place and he agreed.\n\nAs I was posting up the flyer on the board the next day, a colleague \"Joe\" walked up beside me and noticed the flyer (he's 29). I never really talked to Joe in the past because we work in different departments but I recognized his face and knew of him through other colleagues. We started talking about the band and Joe said he sings and plays his guitar every now and then. I told him he should audition and we both laughed about it, but toward the end of our conversation, he seemed interested, so I ripped off the part of the flyer that had Ben's phone number and gave it to him in case he wanted more information.\n\nLong story short, he audition and ended up in the band. The band consists of Ben, Joe, and two other people (both go to school with Ben). I'll admit, it was weird having Joe over at our place at first because we were colleagues and never hung out outside of work or work events, but I didn't mind it because Ben seemed happy and talks a lot about Joe (the two hang out often).\n\nA week ago, Joe was supposed to come over and work on some lyrics with Ben, but Ben was running late, so I invited Joe inside for a cup of coffee. We started chatting about work and complaining about our supervisors to each other, which was really nice to do because I haven't been able to vent to any of my other colleagues about work stress. We talked about the band and he played a sample of a song they were working on, which sounded similar to a song I had heard before but couldn't remember the name of. He asked for my number so that I could send him the song if I ended up remembering. I sent him the song that night and we've been texting all week since then. I enjoy talking to him a lot and it honestly feels like a stupid high school crush (I haven't seriously dated anyone since I was with Ben's father). Yesterday Ben found out I'd been texting Joe and got upset, saying that it's weird and that I can't date his friend. He compared it to \"what if you dated Matt\" (his 21 yr old friend since middle school). I don't think it's the same situation though. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for dating her son's friend. The situation involves the mother of Ben, who is 21, and she's 38. She met Joe, a colleague, who became part of Ben's band. Over time, they started chatting more and eventually began dating. Ben found out and is upset.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The mother is in a professional setting with Joe, who works at the same place. She initially connected him with her son for the band, which seems innocent. But then their relationship progressed beyond that. The key points are the professional relationship, the son's friendship with Joe, and the son's emotional reaction.\n\nThe mother might be in the wrong because she formed a romantic relationship with a colleague and the son's friend. This could create a conflict of interest at work, especially if they're in different departments but still interact. It might also affect Ben's feelings, even if he's an adult. The fact that Ben is upset and compared it to dating a long-time friend suggests he feels betrayed or uncomfortable, which the mother should respect.\n\nHowever, Ben is 21 and an adult, so he can't legally control his mother's dating life. But the mother's actions could strain their relationship. Also, there's the aspect of professional boundaries. If they're colleagues, starting a relationship could lead to workplace issues, even if they're not in the same department. It's possible the company has policies against such relationships, which might not be mentioned here.\n\nOn the other hand, the mother was single for a long time, and this might be a genuine connection. But the initial connection was through her son's friend, which complicates things. The mother might not have considered how Ben would feel, especially given his history of depression and loneliness. She might have inadvertently added to his stress by dating someone he's close with.\n\nThe user initially thought the author is in the wrong. I need to weigh the professional and personal aspects. The mother's intentions were to help her son, but her actions led to a situation where she's dating a colleague and the son's friend. The key issue here is the potential impact on Ben's well-being and the professional relationship. The answer might depend on cultural or personal values, but generally, such a relationship could be seen as problematic due to the intertwined roles (mother, colleague, and friend).\n"
