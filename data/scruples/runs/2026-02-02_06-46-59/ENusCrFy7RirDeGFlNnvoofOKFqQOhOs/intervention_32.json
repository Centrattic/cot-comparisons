His father was never really in the picture, so I was a single mother for the most part. Now I'm 38 and my son \"Ben\" is 21. He's been suffering from depression the past couple of years. I take him to therapy every week and he seems to be getting better but he's always been an introverted kid, so he seems lonely most days. When he was in high school, he was in a band but that quickly disbanded after one of the members graduated high school and went off to college. I recently made a suggestion for him to maybe start up a band again. To my surprise, he was excited about the idea but didn't really know where to start. I suggested he make posters to advertise and maybe place them around his campus. He got to work right away and showed me a flyer he had made. I asked if he wanted me to put it up on the bulletin board at my work place and he agreed.\n\nAs I was posting up the flyer on the board the next day, a colleague \"Joe\" walked up beside me and noticed the flyer (he's 29). I never really talked to Joe in the past because we work in different departments but I recognized his face and knew of him through other colleagues. We started talking about the band and Joe said he sings and plays his guitar every now and then. I told him he should audition and we both laughed about it, but toward the end of our conversation, he seemed interested, so I ripped off the part of the flyer that had Ben's phone number and gave it to him in case he wanted more information.\n\nLong story short, he audition and ended up in the band. The band consists of Ben, Joe, and two other people (both go to school with Ben). I'll admit, it was weird having Joe over at our place at first because we were colleagues and never hung out outside of work or work events, but I didn't mind it because Ben seemed happy and talks a lot about Joe (the two hang out often).\n\nA week ago, Joe was supposed to come over and work on some lyrics with Ben, but Ben was running late, so I invited Joe inside for a cup of coffee. We started chatting about work and complaining about our supervisors to each other, which was really nice to do because I haven't been able to vent to any of my other colleagues about work stress. We talked about the band and he played a sample of a song they were working on, which sounded similar to a song I had heard before but couldn't remember the name of. He asked for my number so that I could send him the song if I ended up remembering. I sent him the song that night and we've been texting all week since then. I enjoy talking to him a lot and it honestly feels like a stupid high school crush (I haven't seriously dated anyone since I was with Ben's father). Yesterday Ben found out I'd been texting Joe and got upset, saying that it's weird and that I can't date his friend. He compared it to \"what if you dated Matt\" (his 21 yr old friend since middle school). I don't think it's the same situation though. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of the \"Am I the Asshole\" scenario is in the wrong for dating their son's friend. I need to analyze the situation carefully.\n\nFirst, the key points: The mother is 38, her son Ben is 21. They've had a tough time with depression, and she's been supportive. Ben formed a band with a friend Joe, who works at her workplace. The mother met Joe at work, they connected, and started texting. The son is upset about it. The author is asking if she's in the wrong.\n\nHmm. Well, there are a few angles here. Legally, there's nothing wrong because both are adults. The mother is Ben's parent, and Joe is a friend. But ethically or socially, there might be issues. The son is 21, an adult too. However, the mother has a parental role, so there could be a conflict of interest if Joe is her son's friend. Also, the mother might be in a position of influence if she works with Joe. But she's not dating Ben, but rather someone his age. Wait, Joe is 29, so he's a bit older than Ben. But Ben is 21, so not too much of a gap.\n\nThe main issue here is whether the mother overstepped by entering a relationship with someone her son considers a close friend. The son is upset because he feels his friend is now part of his family dynamic. The mother might not have realized the implications of dating someone connected to her son. Also, the fact that Joe is a colleague adds another layer. There could be workplace issues if their relationship becomes romantic, even if they're both adults. But she didn't start the relationship with that intent; it started from the band connection.\n\nAnother point is the mother's personal life. She hasn't dated since Ben's father, so maybe she's just seeking companionship. But the way she introduced Joe to Ben's life might have been a mistake. Also, Ben is still adjusting to the situation with the band and having friends. The mother's actions might make Ben feel like his space or relationships are being invaded.\n\nBut Ben is an adult too. He can manage his own relationships. The mother's relationship with Joe, while involving her son's friend, is between two adults. The son's reaction is valid, but does that make the mother wrong? Maybe not, because she's also an adult and has the right to pursue her own happiness. However, there's a potential for tension in the family dynamic. The mother should consider her son's feelings, but she's not obligated to avoid the relationship just because of that. It's a complex situation where both the mother and son have valid perspectives.\n\nIn terms of AITA, it's a judgment call. The mother might be in the wrong if she didn't consider the son's feelings and the potential discomfort. On the other hand, she's an adult and can date whom she chooses. The answer might depend on cultural norms or the specific dynamics of their relationship. However, the mother's actions could be seen as respecting her son's autonomy by not keeping him from his friend but also not being overly intrusive. But she did introduce Joe to Ben's life and then took the relationship further. Maybe the author is in the right because it's her life, but some might argue she should be more considerate. Alternatively, she might be in the wrong for not thinking about the impact on her son. Hmm. I'm a bit torn here. The answer probably depends on the perspective taken. But generally, in such cases, the mother might be seen as not in the wrong because she's an adult and can make her own choices, even if it causes some family tension. However, there's a case for her being in the wrong for not respecting her son's boundaries. But since the son is an adult, maybe the mother isn't in the wrong. I think the answer is B (No), as the mother isn't in the wrong, but it's a nuanced situation.\n"
