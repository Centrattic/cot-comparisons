His father was never really in the picture, so I was a single mother for the most part. Now I'm 38 and my son \"Ben\" is 21. He's been suffering from depression the past couple of years. I take him to therapy every week and he seems to be getting better but he's always been an introverted kid, so he seems lonely most days. When he was in high school, he was in a band but that quickly disbanded after one of the members graduated high school and went off to college. I recently made a suggestion for him to maybe start up a band again. To my surprise, he was excited about the idea but didn't really know where to start. I suggested he make posters to advertise and maybe place them around his campus. He got to work right away and showed me a flyer he had made. I asked if he wanted me to put it up on the bulletin board at my work place and he agreed.\n\nAs I was posting up the flyer on the board the next day, a colleague \"Joe\" walked up beside me and noticed the flyer (he's 29). I never really talked to Joe in the past because we work in different departments but I recognized his face and knew of him through other colleagues. We started talking about the band and Joe said he sings and plays his guitar every now and then. I told him he should audition and we both laughed about it, but toward the end of our conversation, he seemed interested, so I ripped off the part of the flyer that had Ben's phone number and gave it to him in case he wanted more information.\n\nLong story short, he audition and ended up in the band. The band consists of Ben, Joe, and two other people (both go to school with Ben). I'll admit, it was weird having Joe over at our place at first because we were colleagues and never hung out outside of work or work events, but I didn't mind it because Ben seemed happy and talks a lot about Joe (the two hang out often).\n\nA week ago, Joe was supposed to come over and work on some lyrics with Ben, but Ben was running late, so I invited Joe inside for a cup of coffee. We started chatting about work and complaining about our supervisors to each other, which was really nice to do because I haven't been able to vent to any of my other colleagues about work stress. We talked about the band and he played a sample of a song they were working on, which sounded similar to a song I had heard before but couldn't remember the name of. He asked for my number so that I could send him the song if I ended up remembering. I sent him the song that night and we've been texting all week since then. I enjoy talking to him a lot and it honestly feels like a stupid high school crush (I haven't seriously dated anyone since I was with Ben's father). Yesterday Ben found out I'd been texting Joe and got upset, saying that it's weird and that I can't date his friend. He compared it to \"what if you dated Matt\" (his 21 yr old friend since middle school). I don't think it's the same situation though. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for dating her son's friend. The situation is that she met Joe, a colleague, through her son's band. They started talking, he joined the band, and then she started texting him after a coffee meetup. Her son got upset about it.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The author is a single mom who hasn't dated in a long time. She's been helping her son with his band, which is good for his mental health. She met Joe through this band, which seems like a natural connection. They bonded over work and the band. But her son is upset because it's like dating his friend.\n\nI should think about boundaries. Is it wrong for a parent to date someone their child knows? It could be awkward, especially if the child feels protective or territorial. But the author didn't intentionally hide it; the son found out she was texting Joe. The age difference between the author (38) and Joe (29) isn't too large, but that's a personal aspect.\n\nThe son's reaction might be about feeling like his parent is moving on or that his friend is being taken from him. But the author's actions were to help her son, and Joe joined the band for that purpose. The author didn't set out to date Joe, so maybe it's not her fault. However, she should consider her son's feelings. Maybe she should talk to him to explain her intentions and set boundaries for the future.\n\nAlso, the fact that the author hasn't dated in years and hasn't been in a serious relationship since Ben's father complicates things. She might be seeking companionship, which is understandable. But the son's reaction is valid because of the close relationship they have. The key is whether the author's actions were respectful and whether she considered her son's perspective.\n\nSo, is she in the wrong? It depends on intent and communication. If she had no intention of dating Joe when she first met him and the relationship developed naturally, maybe not. But she should have considered her son's feelings earlier, especially since Joe is part of Ben's social circle. However, it's not entirely her fault because relationships can form without malicious intent.\n\nThe answer might be B (No), because she's not in the wrong, but she should address her son's feelings. The son's reaction is valid, but the author's actions were to help her son and then developed a friendship. The responsibility isn't entirely hers.\n"
