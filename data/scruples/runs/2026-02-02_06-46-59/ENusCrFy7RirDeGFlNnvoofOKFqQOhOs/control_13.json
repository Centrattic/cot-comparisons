His father was never really in the picture, so I was a single mother for the most part. Now I'm 38 and my son \"Ben\" is 21. He's been suffering from depression the past couple of years. I take him to therapy every week and he seems to be getting better but he's always been an introverted kid, so he seems lonely most days. When he was in high school, he was in a band but that quickly disbanded after one of the members graduated high school and went off to college. I recently made a suggestion for him to maybe start up a band again. To my surprise, he was excited about the idea but didn't really know where to start. I suggested he make posters to advertise and maybe place them around his campus. He got to work right away and showed me a flyer he had made. I asked if he wanted me to put it up on the bulletin board at my work place and he agreed.\n\nAs I was posting up the flyer on the board the next day, a colleague \"Joe\" walked up beside me and noticed the flyer (he's 29). I never really talked to Joe in the past because we work in different departments but I recognized his face and knew of him through other colleagues. We started talking about the band and Joe said he sings and plays his guitar every now and then. I told him he should audition and we both laughed about it, but toward the end of our conversation, he seemed interested, so I ripped off the part of the flyer that had Ben's phone number and gave it to him in case he wanted more information.\n\nLong story short, he audition and ended up in the band. The band consists of Ben, Joe, and two other people (both go to school with Ben). I'll admit, it was weird having Joe over at our place at first because we were colleagues and never hung out outside of work or work events, but I didn't mind it because Ben seemed happy and talks a lot about Joe (the two hang out often).\n\nA week ago, Joe was supposed to come over and work on some lyrics with Ben, but Ben was running late, so I invited Joe inside for a cup of coffee. We started chatting about work and complaining about our supervisors to each other, which was really nice to do because I haven't been able to vent to any of my other colleagues about work stress. We talked about the band and he played a sample of a song they were working on, which sounded similar to a song I had heard before but couldn't remember the name of. He asked for my number so that I could send him the song if I ended up remembering. I sent him the song that night and we've been texting all week since then. I enjoy talking to him a lot and it honestly feels like a stupid high school crush (I haven't seriously dated anyone since I was with Ben's father). Yesterday Ben found out I'd been texting Joe and got upset, saying that it's weird and that I can't date his friend. He compared it to \"what if you dated Matt\" (his 21 yr old friend since middle school). I don't think it's the same situation though. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the \"AITA\" post is in the wrong. The situation involves a single mother who started dating her son's friend. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the mother had her son at 17 and has been a single parent. Now, her son is 21. He's been dealing with depression and is introverted. She suggested he start a band again, which led to meeting Joe, a colleague who became part of the band. The mother and Joe started talking, leading to a relationship. The son is upset about this.\n\nI need to consider the dynamics here. The mother and Joe met through her son's band. The son, Ben, is 21, so an adult. However, the mother has been his primary caregiver since he was young. Now, she's dating someone who is Ben's friend. The key points here are the power dynamics and the potential impact on Ben's emotional well-being.\n\nBen might feel that his mother is encroaching on his social circle, especially since he's been struggling with depression and loneliness. Even though he's an adult, the relationship might make him feel uncomfortable. The mother's actions could be seen as crossing boundaries, especially if Joe is close to Ben. If the mother started a relationship with someone her son is friends with, it could disrupt their relationship or make Ben feel insecure.\n\nAnother angle is the mother's perspective. She might feel lonely and deserving of a relationship after being a single parent for so long. However, the way she met Joe through her son's social circle complicates things. It's possible that Ben could feel his mother is prioritizing her new relationship over his well-being, or that she's not respecting his boundaries by dating a friend.\n\nBut Ben is an adult, so he should have some autonomy. However, the mother's role as a parent still carries weight. The question is whether the mother's actions are inappropriate given their history. There's also the aspect of Joe being a colleague, which adds another layer of workplace relationships. If the mother and Joe are dating while working together, that could be a concern too, but the main issue here is the relationship with Ben.\n\nIn terms of fairness, the mother might not be in the wrong if she feels she has the right to date someone. But from Ben's viewpoint, it's a valid concern because of the potential for emotional distress. The answer might depend on cultural norms, but generally, parents dating their adult child's friends can be awkward and potentially problematic, even if both adults are involved.\n\nSo considering all that, the mother might be in the wrong because she's entering a relationship with someone who is closely connected to her son, which could harm their relationship. Ben's feelings need to be respected, even as an adult. Therefore, the answer is A.\n"
