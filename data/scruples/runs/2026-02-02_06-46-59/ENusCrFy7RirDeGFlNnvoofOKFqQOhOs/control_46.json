His father was never really in the picture, so I was a single mother for the most part. Now I'm 38 and my son \"Ben\" is 21. He's been suffering from depression the past couple of years. I take him to therapy every week and he seems to be getting better but he's always been an introverted kid, so he seems lonely most days. When he was in high school, he was in a band but that quickly disbanded after one of the members graduated high school and went off to college. I recently made a suggestion for him to maybe start up a band again. To my surprise, he was excited about the idea but didn't really know where to start. I suggested he make posters to advertise and maybe place them around his campus. He got to work right away and showed me a flyer he had made. I asked if he wanted me to put it up on the bulletin board at my work place and he agreed.\n\nAs I was posting up the flyer on the board the next day, a colleague \"Joe\" walked up beside me and noticed the flyer (he's 29). I never really talked to Joe in the past because we work in different departments but I recognized his face and knew of him through other colleagues. We started talking about the band and Joe said he sings and plays his guitar every now and then. I told him he should audition and we both laughed about it, but toward the end of our conversation, he seemed interested, so I ripped off the part of the flyer that had Ben's phone number and gave it to him in case he wanted more information.\n\nLong story short, he audition and ended up in the band. The band consists of Ben, Joe, and two other people (both go to school with Ben). I'll admit, it was weird having Joe over at our place at first because we were colleagues and never hung out outside of work or work events, but I didn't mind it because Ben seemed happy and talks a lot about Joe (the two hang out often).\n\nA week ago, Joe was supposed to come over and work on some lyrics with Ben, but Ben was running late, so I invited Joe inside for a cup of coffee. We started chatting about work and complaining about our supervisors to each other, which was really nice to do because I haven't been able to vent to any of my other colleagues about work stress. We talked about the band and he played a sample of a song they were working on, which sounded similar to a song I had heard before but couldn't remember the name of. He asked for my number so that I could send him the song if I ended up remembering. I sent him the song that night and we've been texting all week since then. I enjoy talking to him a lot and it honestly feels like a stupid high school crush (I haven't seriously dated anyone since I was with Ben's father). Yesterday Ben found out I'd been texting Joe and got upset, saying that it's weird and that I can't date his friend. He compared it to \"what if you dated Matt\" (his 21 yr old friend since middle school). I don't think it's the same situation though. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong. The situation involves a 38-year-old single mother who started dating her 21-year-old son's friend, Joe, who is 29. \n\nFirst, the mother and son have a history; she was 17 when he was born, and he's been dealing with depression. She encouraged him to start a band, which led to meeting Joe. They worked together on the band, and eventually, the mother and Joe started texting and developing a relationship. The son found out and is upset because he feels it's weird, comparing it to dating a friend from middle school.\n\nI need to consider a few angles here. Legally, there's nothing wrong with a 38-year-old dating a 29-year-old. Age-wise, it's a 9-year difference, which is generally acceptable. But the main issue here is the mother-son relationship. The mother is Ben's parent, and Joe is Ben's friend. The son is 21, so he's an adult, but the mother is his parent. \n\nThe potential problem is the mother's relationship with someone who is close to her son. Even though Ben is an adult, he might feel that his mother is encroaching on his social circle or that there's a boundary being crossed. However, since Ben is an adult, he should have the autonomy to handle his own relationships. The mother is also an adult, so her choice to pursue a relationship isn't inherently wrong.\n\nAnother point is the dynamic between the mother and the son. The mother took initiative in helping Ben start the band, which led to meeting Joe. But once the relationship between the mother and Joe started, Ben felt upset. The mother might have inadvertently caused discomfort for her son, but unless there's a legal or ethical violation, it's more of a social issue. \n\nThere's also the question of whether the mother considered her son's feelings before starting a relationship with his friend. While Ben is an adult, the mother might have overlooked how this could affect their relationship. However, the mother is also entitled to her own happiness, and there's no law against her dating someone her son is friends with. \n\nThe crux here is about social norms and family boundaries. In many cultures, there's an unspoken rule against parents dating their adult children's friends, even if the child is an adult. But since both the mother and Joe are adults, there's no legal issue. The mother isn't in the wrong legally or ethically unless there's more to the story. \n\nThe son's reaction might be more about his own feelings of being displaced or the situation being awkward. The mother's actions aren't malicious; she formed a bond with Joe through the band, and a relationship developed. The son's upset is valid, but the mother isn't necessarily wrong for pursuing her own relationship. \n\nSo, considering all these factors, the answer would be that the author is not in the wrong. The correct choice is B.\n"
