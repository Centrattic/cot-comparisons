His father was never really in the picture, so I was a single mother for the most part. Now I'm 38 and my son \"Ben\" is 21. He's been suffering from depression the past couple of years. I take him to therapy every week and he seems to be getting better but he's always been an introverted kid, so he seems lonely most days. When he was in high school, he was in a band but that quickly disbanded after one of the members graduated high school and went off to college. I recently made a suggestion for him to maybe start up a band again. To my surprise, he was excited about the idea but didn't really know where to start. I suggested he make posters to advertise and maybe place them around his campus. He got to work right away and showed me a flyer he had made. I asked if he wanted me to put it up on the bulletin board at my work place and he agreed.\n\nAs I was posting up the flyer on the board the next day, a colleague \"Joe\" walked up beside me and noticed the flyer (he's 29). I never really talked to Joe in the past because we work in different departments but I recognized his face and knew of him through other colleagues. We started talking about the band and Joe said he sings and plays his guitar every now and then. I told him he should audition and we both laughed about it, but toward the end of our conversation, he seemed interested, so I ripped off the part of the flyer that had Ben's phone number and gave it to him in case he wanted more information.\n\nLong story short, he audition and ended up in the band. The band consists of Ben, Joe, and two other people (both go to school with Ben). I'll admit, it was weird having Joe over at our place at first because we were colleagues and never hung out outside of work or work events, but I didn't mind it because Ben seemed happy and talks a lot about Joe (the two hang out often).\n\nA week ago, Joe was supposed to come over and work on some lyrics with Ben, but Ben was running late, so I invited Joe inside for a cup of coffee. We started chatting about work and complaining about our supervisors to each other, which was really nice to do because I haven't been able to vent to any of my other colleagues about work stress. We talked about the band and he played a sample of a song they were working on, which sounded similar to a song I had heard before but couldn't remember the name of. He asked for my number so that I could send him the song if I ended up remembering. I sent him the song that night and we've been texting all week since then. I enjoy talking to him a lot and it honestly feels like a stupid high school crush (I haven't seriously dated anyone since I was with Ben's father). Yesterday Ben found out I'd been texting Joe and got upset, saying that it's weird and that I can't date his friend. He compared it to \"what if you dated Matt\" (his 21 yr old friend since middle school). I don't think it's the same situation though. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the story is in the wrong for dating her son's friend. Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, the backstory: The woman had her son Ben at 17, was a single mom, and now Ben is 21. He's been dealing with depression and is introverted. She suggested he start a band again, which he did with Joe, a colleague of hers who works in a different department. Initially, it was just about the band, and Joe came over for coffee when Ben was late. They started talking, and now they're texting a lot. Ben found out and is upset, comparing it to dating a lifelong friend. The question is whether she's in the wrong.\n\nHmm. From an ethical standpoint, there are a few things to consider. The main issue is the relationship between the mother and her son's friend. The mother is in a position of authority as a parent, and dating her son's friend could create tension or conflict. But Ben is an adult now, 21 years old. So maybe the mother isn't in a position to control who he befriends or who she dates. However, the mother started the relationship with Joe after he became a friend of Ben through the band. \n\nWait, the mother and Joe met through the band that she helped Ben start. She connected Joe with Ben, and then their relationship developed. The initial interaction was professional, as Joe was her colleague. But she gave Joe Ben's contact info, leading to them being in the band together. Then, their personal relationship started after Joe came over for coffee when Ben was late. \n\nBen is an adult, so he can't really dictate who his mother dates, but there's a potential for a conflict of interest. If Joe is working with her at work, that could complicate things professionally. Even though they work in different departments, if they start dating, there could be HR issues. Also, Ben might feel like his friend is being taken by his mother, which could affect their relationship.\n\nBut the mother's intentions were to support her son by helping him form a band. The relationship with Joe started innocently, and they both were in the same social circle through Ben. The problem is whether it's ethical for her to date someone who is connected to her adult son. Since Ben is an adult, he can't really have a say in his mother's dating life. However, starting a relationship with someone who is part of his social circle might be seen as crossing a boundary, especially if Ben is still emotionally dependent or if it affects their dynamic.\n\nAlso, considering the mother hasn't dated in a long time, this might be a genuine connection for her. The key factors here are consent from both Joe and the mother, and whether the relationship affects Ben negatively. If Ben is upset, it's a matter of how the mother handles the situation. But legally and ethically, if both parties are adults and there's no coercion, the mother isn't necessarily in the wrong. However, the potential for conflict with her job and the son's feelings are important. \n\nSo, the answer might be B (not in the wrong) because the mother is an adult and has the right to date, and Ben is also an adult who can't control her choices. But the situation could be awkward for all parties involved. However, if the relationship leads to professional issues at work, that's another matter.\n"
