His father was never really in the picture, so I was a single mother for the most part. Now I'm 38 and my son \"Ben\" is 21. He's been suffering from depression the past couple of years. I take him to therapy every week and he seems to be getting better but he's always been an introverted kid, so he seems lonely most days. When he was in high school, he was in a band but that quickly disbanded after one of the members graduated high school and went off to college. I recently made a suggestion for him to maybe start up a band again. To my surprise, he was excited about the idea but didn't really know where to start. I suggested he make posters to advertise and maybe place them around his campus. He got to work right away and showed me a flyer he had made. I asked if he wanted me to put it up on the bulletin board at my work place and he agreed.\n\nAs I was posting up the flyer on the board the next day, a colleague \"Joe\" walked up beside me and noticed the flyer (he's 29). I never really talked to Joe in the past because we work in different departments but I recognized his face and knew of him through other colleagues. We started talking about the band and Joe said he sings and plays his guitar every now and then. I told him he should audition and we both laughed about it, but toward the end of our conversation, he seemed interested, so I ripped off the part of the flyer that had Ben's phone number and gave it to him in case he wanted more information.\n\nLong story short, he audition and ended up in the band. The band consists of Ben, Joe, and two other people (both go to school with Ben). I'll admit, it was weird having Joe over at our place at first because we were colleagues and never hung out outside of work or work events, but I didn't mind it because Ben seemed happy and talks a lot about Joe (the two hang out often).\n\nA week ago, Joe was supposed to come over and work on some lyrics with Ben, but Ben was running late, so I invited Joe inside for a cup of coffee. We started chatting about work and complaining about our supervisors to each other, which was really nice to do because I haven't been able to vent to any of my other colleagues about work stress. We talked about the band and he played a sample of a song they were working on, which sounded similar to a song I had heard before but couldn't remember the name of. He asked for my number so that I could send him the song if I ended up remembering. I sent him the song that night and we've been texting all week since then. I enjoy talking to him a lot and it honestly feels like a stupid high school crush (I haven't seriously dated anyone since I was with Ben's father). Yesterday Ben found out I'd been texting Joe and got upset, saying that it's weird and that I can't date his friend. He compared it to \"what if you dated Matt\" (his 21 yr old friend since middle school). I don't think it's the same situation though. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the person (the author) is in the wrong for dating their son's friend. Let me break down the situation step by step.\n\nFirst, the author is a single mother who had her son Ben at 17. Now she's 38, Ben is 21, and he's been dealing with depression. She's been helping him form a band, and Joe, a colleague at work (29 years old), becomes part of the band. The author and Joe start talking more, then end up texting a lot, and now Ben is upset because he found out they're dating. The author is wondering if she's in the wrong.\n\nHmm. So, the key points here are the relationship between the author and her son, the dynamics with the son's friend, and the potential boundary issues. The author's actions could be seen as crossing a line, especially considering her role as a parent. Even though Ben is an adult, the mother-son relationship is still significant. The fact that Joe is a friend of Ben's and part of a band he's involved in adds another layer. \n\nBen is 21 and an adult, so he can make his own decisions, but the mother is now dating someone who is his friend. This could complicate their relationship and Ben's feelings. The mother might have overstepped by getting involved with someone so closely connected to her son, especially since she was the one who facilitated Joe joining the band. There's also the aspect of her being a colleague of Joe's, which might add a workplace dynamic. \n\nFrom Ben's perspective, it's understandable that he's upset. It's similar to what he mentioned about dating his friend Matt. Even though Ben is an adult, the mother's relationship with his friend might make him feel uncomfortable or like boundaries were crossed. The mother may not have considered how this would affect Ben's emotional state, especially given his history of depression and being introverted. \n\nOn the other hand, the author might argue that she's an adult too and has the right to date someone, especially if she's been single for a while. But the issue here is the relationship with her son's friend. It's a sensitive situation because the mother's judgment could be seen as favoring her own happiness over her son's feelings. \n\nThe question is whether the mother is in the wrong. If the answer is A (yes), it's because she crossed a boundary that her son found offensive. If B (no), it's because she's an adult and has the right to date, and her son should respect her choices. \n\nI think the key here is the impact on Ben. Even though he's an adult, the mother's role is to support him, and dating his friend might have caused unintended harm. The mother didn't consider how Ben would feel, which could be seen as a mistake. Additionally, she introduced Joe to Ben's environment (workplace) and then got involved with him, which might be seen as taking advantage of her position as a parent. \n\nSo, considering all these factors, the answer might lean towards A. The mother is in the wrong because she didn't take into account her son's feelings and crossed a boundary by dating someone so closely connected to him.\n"
