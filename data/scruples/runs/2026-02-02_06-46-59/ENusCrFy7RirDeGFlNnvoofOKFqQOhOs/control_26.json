His father was never really in the picture, so I was a single mother for the most part. Now I'm 38 and my son \"Ben\" is 21. He's been suffering from depression the past couple of years. I take him to therapy every week and he seems to be getting better but he's always been an introverted kid, so he seems lonely most days. When he was in high school, he was in a band but that quickly disbanded after one of the members graduated high school and went off to college. I recently made a suggestion for him to maybe start up a band again. To my surprise, he was excited about the idea but didn't really know where to start. I suggested he make posters to advertise and maybe place them around his campus. He got to work right away and showed me a flyer he had made. I asked if he wanted me to put it up on the bulletin board at my work place and he agreed.\n\nAs I was posting up the flyer on the board the next day, a colleague \"Joe\" walked up beside me and noticed the flyer (he's 29). I never really talked to Joe in the past because we work in different departments but I recognized his face and knew of him through other colleagues. We started talking about the band and Joe said he sings and plays his guitar every now and then. I told him he should audition and we both laughed about it, but toward the end of our conversation, he seemed interested, so I ripped off the part of the flyer that had Ben's phone number and gave it to him in case he wanted more information.\n\nLong story short, he audition and ended up in the band. The band consists of Ben, Joe, and two other people (both go to school with Ben). I'll admit, it was weird having Joe over at our place at first because we were colleagues and never hung out outside of work or work events, but I didn't mind it because Ben seemed happy and talks a lot about Joe (the two hang out often).\n\nA week ago, Joe was supposed to come over and work on some lyrics with Ben, but Ben was running late, so I invited Joe inside for a cup of coffee. We started chatting about work and complaining about our supervisors to each other, which was really nice to do because I haven't been able to vent to any of my other colleagues about work stress. We talked about the band and he played a sample of a song they were working on, which sounded similar to a song I had heard before but couldn't remember the name of. He asked for my number so that I could send him the song if I ended up remembering. I sent him the song that night and we've been texting all week since then. I enjoy talking to him a lot and it honestly feels like a stupid high school crush (I haven't seriously dated anyone since I was with Ben's father). Yesterday Ben found out I'd been texting Joe and got upset, saying that it's weird and that I can't date his friend. He compared it to \"what if you dated Matt\" (his 21 yr old friend since middle school). I don't think it's the same situation though. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The question is whether the person who wrote the story (the mother) is in the wrong for dating her son's friend. Let me break down the details.\n\nFirst, she's a single mom who had her son at 17 and is now 38. Her son, Ben, is 21 and has been dealing with depression. She's been helping him start a band, and through that, she met Joe, a 29-year-old colleague. Joe joined the band, and they started interacting more. Then, when Ben was late, she invited Joe in for coffee. They talked, connected, and started texting. Now Ben is upset because he thinks it's weird and compares it to dating his friend Matt.\n\nSo, the main points here are the age difference between the mother and Ben's friend, the fact that the mother is Ben's parent, and Ben's reaction. The user is asking if she's in the wrong.\n\nI need to consider a few things. First, the mother's intentions: she met Joe through her son's activities, not because of any romantic interest initially. Then, the relationship started to develop after some casual interactions. The key issue here is the dynamic between a parent and their child's friend. Even though the mother is an adult and Joe is 29, Ben is 21, so he's an adult too. However, the mother is Ben's parent, which creates a potential conflict of interest.\n\nAnother angle is Ben's reaction. He's upset because it's his friend. The comparison he makes to dating his friend Matt (since middle school) is a point he's using to express his discomfort. The mother might feel that she's an adult and can date who she wants, but she also has a responsibility towards her son. However, since Ben is an adult, his feelings are still valid, but the mother isn't necessarily in the wrong for pursuing a relationship with someone her son considers a friend.\n\nAlso, the fact that she met Joe through her son's band adds a layer. If Joe was Ben's friend, then the mother dating him could be seen as complicating Ben's social circle. But since Ben is an adult, he should be able to handle that complexity himself. However, the mother might not be in the wrong if she's an adult and Joe is an adult; their relationship isn't directly affecting Ben unless there are specific issues like favoritism or conflict in the household.\n\nBut there's also the aspect of Ben's age. He's 21, so he's legally an adult, but if he's still living at home or is emotionally dependent (due to his depression and loneliness), the situation might be different. The mother's actions could make Ben feel like his privacy or social life is being invaded. However, the mother isn't dating Ben; she's dating someone else, so it's about her right to date versus her son's right to have his friend's relationship boundaries respected.\n\nIn terms of social norms, it's generally considered okay for adults to date unless there's a specific conflict of interest. Since the mother is Ben's parent, and Joe is Ben's friend, there's a potential for tension, but the mother isn't necessarily in the wrong unless she's causing direct harm. The fact that she invited Joe over when Ben was late shows she's trying to be helpful, but the subsequent texting might have crossed a line in Ben's eyes.\n\nSo, considering all these factors, the answer might be B (No) because the mother is an adult with the right to date, but there's a B-side argument that she could be in the wrong if it's causing harm to her son. However, since Ben is an adult and the mother's relationship doesn't directly harm him (unless she's using her position as a parent to influence the relationship), it's more about personal boundaries and Ben's feelings, but not necessarily the mother's wrongdoing.\n"
