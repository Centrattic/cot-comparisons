His father was never really in the picture, so I was a single mother for the most part. Now I'm 38 and my son \"Ben\" is 21. He's been suffering from depression the past couple of years. I take him to therapy every week and he seems to be getting better but he's always been an introverted kid, so he seems lonely most days. When he was in high school, he was in a band but that quickly disbanded after one of the members graduated high school and went off to college. I recently made a suggestion for him to maybe start up a band again. To my surprise, he was excited about the idea but didn't really know where to start. I suggested he make posters to advertise and maybe place them around his campus. He got to work right away and showed me a flyer he had made. I asked if he wanted me to put it up on the bulletin board at my work place and he agreed.\n\nAs I was posting up the flyer on the board the next day, a colleague \"Joe\" walked up beside me and noticed the flyer (he's 29). I never really talked to Joe in the past because we work in different departments but I recognized his face and knew of him through other colleagues. We started talking about the band and Joe said he sings and plays his guitar every now and then. I told him he should audition and we both laughed about it, but toward the end of our conversation, he seemed interested, so I ripped off the part of the flyer that had Ben's phone number and gave it to him in case he wanted more information.\n\nLong story short, he audition and ended up in the band. The band consists of Ben, Joe, and two other people (both go to school with Ben). I'll admit, it was weird having Joe over at our place at first because we were colleagues and never hung out outside of work or work events, but I didn't mind it because Ben seemed happy and talks a lot about Joe (the two hang out often).\n\nA week ago, Joe was supposed to come over and work on some lyrics with Ben, but Ben was running late, so I invited Joe inside for a cup of coffee. We started chatting about work and complaining about our supervisors to each other, which was really nice to do because I haven't been able to vent to any of my other colleagues about work stress. We talked about the band and he played a sample of a song they were working on, which sounded similar to a song I had heard before but couldn't remember the name of. He asked for my number so that I could send him the song if I ended up remembering. I sent him the song that night and we've been texting all week since then. I enjoy talking to him a lot and it honestly feels like a stupid high school crush (I haven't seriously dated anyone since I was with Ben's father). Yesterday Ben found out I'd been texting Joe and got upset, saying that it's weird and that I can't date his friend. He compared it to \"what if you dated Matt\" (his 21 yr old friend since middle school). I don't think it's the same situation though. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is that the mother has a son, Ben, who's 21. She's been a single mom since he was 17. Ben was in a band that broke up, and she suggested he start another one. He put up flyers, and a colleague named Joe (29) saw one and joined the band. They work together, but they weren't close before. The mother ended up dating Joe, and Ben is upset about it, comparing it to dating his friend Matt.\n\nFirst, the age difference: the mother is 38, Joe is 29. That's a 9-year gap. Not huge, but maybe a factor. The mother hasn't dated seriously since Ben's father left when he was 17, so she's been alone for a while. She might be feeling lonely and see Joe as a positive connection. On the other hand, Ben is 21, so he's an adult, but there's a parent-child dynamic here. The mother was the one who connected Joe with Ben for the band, so she introduced him into their lives. Then, she started dating a colleague from work, which could be seen as a conflict of interest if they're in the same workplace. However, they're in different departments and hadn't interacted much before.\n\nBen's reaction is that it's weird and that he can't date his friend. But Joe is part of his band, not a close friend like Matt. The mother's actions were about helping her son find friends and support, which is understandable. But now she's stepped into a relationship with someone connected to her son's circle. The question is if that's inappropriate.\n\nFrom a moral standpoint, some might say the mother is overstepping by dating someone her son is close to, even if it's through a band. Others might argue that the mother is an adult and has the right to date, especially if she's been single for so long. The son is an adult too, and might feel it's a boundary issue, but it's also his choice how he feels. The mother might have been naive in not considering how Ben would feel. However, there's no legal issue here, just a conflict of interest if Joe is her colleague, which could be a workplace policy problem. But the story doesn't mention any company rules against this.\n\nSo, the author's actions might be considered inconsiderate because she didn't think about how Ben would feel. But she's also an adult and has a right to her own life. The key points are the parent-son relationship and the colleague aspect. If Joe is a colleague, there's a potential for workplace issues. But if they're in different departments and not close, maybe it's okay. However, Ben's reaction shows he's upset, so maybe the mother should have considered his feelings before pursuing a relationship with someone connected to his life. So, is she in the wrong? It's a bit of a grey area. Some might say yes because she introduced Joe to her son's circle and then started dating him, which could feel intrusive. Others might say no because it's her life and she deserves some happiness. But given that she's his mother and he's her son, there's an expectation that she should consider his comfort. So maybe the answer is A, yes, she's in the wrong for not considering Ben's feelings first. But I'm not entirely sure. Alternatively, if the workplace policy doesn't prohibit it, then maybe B. Hmm. The main conflict is the relationship between the mother and son. Since Ben is an adult, maybe it's more about his feelings rather than her being wrong. But the mother's actions could be seen as crossing a line by dating someone connected to her son's social life. So I think the answer leans towards A.\n"
