His father was never really in the picture, so I was a single mother for the most part. Now I'm 38 and my son \"Ben\" is 21. He's been suffering from depression the past couple of years. I take him to therapy every week and he seems to be getting better but he's always been an introverted kid, so he seems lonely most days. When he was in high school, he was in a band but that quickly disbanded after one of the members graduated high school and went off to college. I recently made a suggestion for him to maybe start up a band again. To my surprise, he was excited about the idea but didn't really know where to start. I suggested he make posters to advertise and maybe place them around his campus. He got to work right away and showed me a flyer he had made. I asked if he wanted me to put it up on the bulletin board at my work place and he agreed.\n\nAs I was posting up the flyer on the board the next day, a colleague \"Joe\" walked up beside me and noticed the flyer (he's 29). I never really talked to Joe in the past because we work in different departments but I recognized his face and knew of him through other colleagues. We started talking about the band and Joe said he sings and plays his guitar every now and then. I told him he should audition and we both laughed about it, but toward the end of our conversation, he seemed interested, so I ripped off the part of the flyer that had Ben's phone number and gave it to him in case he wanted more information.\n\nLong story short, he audition and ended up in the band. The band consists of Ben, Joe, and two other people (both go to school with Ben). I'll admit, it was weird having Joe over at our place at first because we were colleagues and never hung out outside of work or work events, but I didn't mind it because Ben seemed happy and talks a lot about Joe (the two hang out often).\n\nA week ago, Joe was supposed to come over and work on some lyrics with Ben, but Ben was running late, so I invited Joe inside for a cup of coffee. We started chatting about work and complaining about our supervisors to each other, which was really nice to do because I haven't been able to vent to any of my other colleagues about work stress. We talked about the band and he played a sample of a song they were working on, which sounded similar to a song I had heard before but couldn't remember the name of. He asked for my number so that I could send him the song if I ended up remembering. I sent him the song that night and we've been texting all week since then. I enjoy talking to him a lot and it honestly feels like a stupid high school crush (I haven't seriously dated anyone since I was with Ben's father). Yesterday Ben found out I'd been texting Joe and got upset, saying that it's weird and that I can't date his friend. He compared it to \"what if you dated Matt\" (his 21 yr old friend since middle school). I don't think it's the same situation though. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. So the question is whether the author is in the wrong for dating her son's friend. Let's break down the situation.\n\nFirst, the mother is 38, her son Ben is 21. She's been a single mom since he was 17. Ben has struggled with depression and is introverted. She helped him start a band, which led to Joe joining. Joe is a colleague, 29 years old. They started hanging out because of the band. Then, after a coffee meetup, they started texting and the mother feels a connection. Now Ben is upset because he thinks it's weird and compares it to dating a friend like Matt.\n\nSo, the key points here: the mother's actions, Ben's reaction, and the dynamics between them. The mother didn't start the relationship with the intention of dating Joe; it developed as they interacted more because of the band. The relationship started as professional (through work) but shifted into a personal one. Now Ben is upset because Joe is his friend. But how does that hold up?\n\nLegally, there's nothing wrong about adults dating each other unless there's a specific conflict of interest. However, socially and ethically, there's a question about boundaries. The mother is in a position of influence regarding Ben's social circle, especially since she helped bring Joe into Ben's life through the band. If the mother and Joe start dating, it could affect Ben's comfort and trust. Also, Ben is an adult now, 21, so he might feel his personal boundaries are being invaded.\n\nBut the mother's perspective is that she's been alone for a while and this is a new connection. She didn't intentionally plan to date someone connected to her son. However, by introducing Joe to Ben's band and then developing a relationship with him, she might be crossing a line. The issue is whether her actions are respectful of Ben's feelings and the existing relationship dynamics.\n\nAnother angle: the mother and Joe met through work, but the connection solidified through Ben's band. The mother's role as Ben's parent might make the son feel that the mother shouldn't be involved in his friend's life romantically, even if it's after the fact. It's possible that Ben feels his privacy or autonomy is being disregarded.\n\nOn the other hand, the mother isn't doing anything illegal. She's an adult and has the right to date someone. The problem here is more about social norms and how it affects her relationship with her son. The mother might not be in the wrong legally, but socially, she might be in the wrong if she's not respecting her son's feelings and the potential awkwardness for him.\n\nBut the question is whether the author is in the wrong. The answer depends on whether the mother acted unethically or inconsiderately. Since she didn't plan it, but the relationship developed naturally through mutual interactions, some might argue she isn't in the wrong. Others might say she should have been more cautious given her son's sensitivity. Ben is an adult, so he should handle his own relationships, but the mother's relationship with his friend could still be seen as crossing a boundary she shouldn't have crossed.\n\nI think the key here is that the mother's actions, while not malicious, could be seen as overstepping her role as a parent. By getting involved with someone her son knows, especially in a romantic way, it's possible she's making her son uncomfortable. Even if she didn't intend to, the outcome is that Ben is upset. So whether she's in the wrong might depend on how much weight is given to Ben's feelings versus her right to date. Since the situation is causing conflict in her family, it might be considered that she's in the wrong because she's not respecting the boundaries that would keep her son from feeling uncomfortable. Therefore, the answer might be A (Yes, she's in the wrong), but I'm a bit conflicted because it's a complex situation with both sides having valid points.\n"
