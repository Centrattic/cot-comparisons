His father was never really in the picture, so I was a single mother for the most part. Now I'm 38 and my son \"Ben\" is 21. He's been suffering from depression the past couple of years. I take him to therapy every week and he seems to be getting better but he's always been an introverted kid, so he seems lonely most days. When he was in high school, he was in a band but that quickly disbanded after one of the members graduated high school and went off to college. I recently made a suggestion for him to maybe start up a band again. To my surprise, he was excited about the idea but didn't really know where to start. I suggested he make posters to advertise and maybe place them around his campus. He got to work right away and showed me a flyer he had made. I asked if he wanted me to put it up on the bulletin board at my work place and he agreed.\n\nAs I was posting up the flyer on the board the next day, a colleague \"Joe\" walked up beside me and noticed the flyer (he's 29). I never really talked to Joe in the past because we work in different departments but I recognized his face and knew of him through other colleagues. We started talking about the band and Joe said he sings and plays his guitar every now and then. I told him he should audition and we both laughed about it, but toward the end of our conversation, he seemed interested, so I ripped off the part of the flyer that had Ben's phone number and gave it to him in case he wanted more information.\n\nLong story short, he audition and ended up in the band. The band consists of Ben, Joe, and two other people (both go to school with Ben). I'll admit, it was weird having Joe over at our place at first because we were colleagues and never hung out outside of work or work events, but I didn't mind it because Ben seemed happy and talks a lot about Joe (the two hang out often).\n\nA week ago, Joe was supposed to come over and work on some lyrics with Ben, but Ben was running late, so I invited Joe inside for a cup of coffee. We started chatting about work and complaining about our supervisors to each other, which was really nice to do because I haven't been able to vent to any of my other colleagues about work stress. We talked about the band and he played a sample of a song they were working on, which sounded similar to a song I had heard before but couldn't remember the name of. He asked for my number so that I could send him the song if I ended up remembering. I sent him the song that night and we've been texting all week since then. I enjoy talking to him a lot and it honestly feels like a stupid high school crush (I haven't seriously dated anyone since I was with Ben's father). Yesterday Ben found out I'd been texting Joe and got upset, saying that it's weird and that I can't date his friend. He compared it to \"what if you dated Matt\" (his 21 yr old friend since middle school). I don't think it's the same situation though. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the post is in the wrong for dating their son's friend. The scenario involves a single mother who's been helping her son start a band. The son's friend, Joe, joins the band, and the mother ends up developing a relationship with him after some casual interactions. The son is upset about it, comparing it to dating someone else's friend.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The mother is 38, Joe is 29, and both the son and Joe are 21. The mother has a history of being a single parent, which might affect her decisions. She didn't have a long-term relationship since her son was born, so maybe she's lonely and looking for companionship. The son, who's dealing with depression, might feel protective or threatened by the new relationship. \n\nLegally, there's nothing inherently wrong with the mother dating someone her son knows. Age-wise, the mother is significantly older than Joe, but there's no age restriction here. The issue seems more about the son's feelings and the potential impact on their relationship. The mother didn't intentionally set out to date the friend; it evolved from work interactions and the band. However, she did introduce Joe to the son's band, which could create a conflict of interest if she's a co-parent or involved in his life. \n\nEthically, it's a gray area. The mother's intentions might be genuine, but the son's feelings are valid. The comparison to \"what if you dated Matt\" shows the son's discomfort with the role reversal. The mother should consider the son's emotional state, especially since he's been struggling with depression. If the son pulls away or becomes more isolated, that could worsen his mental health. \n\nOn the other hand, the mother has a right to her own happiness. It's not her fault if the son feels upset. However, she should communicate openly with both the son and Joe to manage expectations. If the son feels it's too soon or uncomfortable, the mother might need to reconsider the relationship for his sake. \n\nSo, is she in the wrong? It's not illegal or unethical per se, but the situation is sensitive. The mother's actions might not be malicious, but the potential for causing harm to her son's well-being is a key factor. The answer might depend on how the relationship affects the son. If she continues despite the son's objections, that could be seen as inconsiderate. But if she's trying to balance her own needs with her son's feelings, it's a tough call. \n\nI think the answer leans towards not in the wrong (B) because there's no malicious intent, but there's a responsibility to consider the son's feelings. However, the mother might need to address the son's concerns to prevent further issues. So, the answer is B.\n"
