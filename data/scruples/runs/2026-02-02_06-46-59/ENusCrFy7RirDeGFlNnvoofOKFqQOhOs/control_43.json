His father was never really in the picture, so I was a single mother for the most part. Now I'm 38 and my son \"Ben\" is 21. He's been suffering from depression the past couple of years. I take him to therapy every week and he seems to be getting better but he's always been an introverted kid, so he seems lonely most days. When he was in high school, he was in a band but that quickly disbanded after one of the members graduated high school and went off to college. I recently made a suggestion for him to maybe start up a band again. To my surprise, he was excited about the idea but didn't really know where to start. I suggested he make posters to advertise and maybe place them around his campus. He got to work right away and showed me a flyer he had made. I asked if he wanted me to put it up on the bulletin board at my work place and he agreed.\n\nAs I was posting up the flyer on the board the next day, a colleague \"Joe\" walked up beside me and noticed the flyer (he's 29). I never really talked to Joe in the past because we work in different departments but I recognized his face and knew of him through other colleagues. We started talking about the band and Joe said he sings and plays his guitar every now and then. I told him he should audition and we both laughed about it, but toward the end of our conversation, he seemed interested, so I ripped off the part of the flyer that had Ben's phone number and gave it to him in case he wanted more information.\n\nLong story short, he audition and ended up in the band. The band consists of Ben, Joe, and two other people (both go to school with Ben). I'll admit, it was weird having Joe over at our place at first because we were colleagues and never hung out outside of work or work events, but I didn't mind it because Ben seemed happy and talks a lot about Joe (the two hang out often).\n\nA week ago, Joe was supposed to come over and work on some lyrics with Ben, but Ben was running late, so I invited Joe inside for a cup of coffee. We started chatting about work and complaining about our supervisors to each other, which was really nice to do because I haven't been able to vent to any of my other colleagues about work stress. We talked about the band and he played a sample of a song they were working on, which sounded similar to a song I had heard before but couldn't remember the name of. He asked for my number so that I could send him the song if I ended up remembering. I sent him the song that night and we've been texting all week since then. I enjoy talking to him a lot and it honestly feels like a stupid high school crush (I haven't seriously dated anyone since I was with Ben's father). Yesterday Ben found out I'd been texting Joe and got upset, saying that it's weird and that I can't date his friend. He compared it to \"what if you dated Matt\" (his 21 yr old friend since middle school). I don't think it's the same situation though. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for dating her son's friend. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the backstory: She's a single mom since she was 17, her son Ben is 21 now. He's been dealing with depression and is introverted. The mom helped him start a band, which led to her connecting with Joe, a colleague who's 29. They met because of the band, and then they started talking more. Eventually, they started texting a lot, and now they're dating. Ben found out and is upset.\n\nHmm. The key points here are the age difference between the mom and Joe (she's 38, he's 29) and the fact that Joe is a friend of her son. But Joe isn't Ben's best friend; he's a bandmate. Also, the mom and Joe met through work, but the connection was facilitated by Ben's band. \n\nThe son is 21, so legally an adult. However, since the mom was his primary caregiver, there might be a power dynamic here. The son is still adjusting to his mom having a life outside of being his sole parent. The mom hasn't dated in a long time, so her finding a partner now might be a new chapter for her. \n\nBut the question is about whether the author is in the wrong. From an ethical standpoint, the son is an adult, so he can't really control who his mom dates. However, the concern is that the mom might be overstepping if the relationship affects Ben's well-being. But since Ben is an adult, it's his choice whether he's comfortable with it or not. The mom's actions were driven by her own need for a relationship, and she didn't force anything. \n\nThe situation is similar to a parent dating someone who is a friend of their adult child. The line is blurry here because the mom was instrumental in connecting Joe with Ben for the band. But since Joe is also a colleague, maybe that complicates things. However, the mom and Joe's relationship is separate from Ben now. \n\nI think the answer would be B (not in the wrong) because the mom has the right to pursue a relationship, especially since she's an adult. The son is also an adult, so he can express his feelings, but he can't make her stop. The main issue is communication between them. The mom isn't wrong for wanting to date, even if it makes Ben uncomfortable. The key is that both the mom and Joe are adults, and the relationship isn't affecting Ben's welfare in a harmful way. The answer is B.\n"
