His father was never really in the picture, so I was a single mother for the most part. Now I'm 38 and my son \"Ben\" is 21. He's been suffering from depression the past couple of years. I take him to therapy every week and he seems to be getting better but he's always been an introverted kid, so he seems lonely most days. When he was in high school, he was in a band but that quickly disbanded after one of the members graduated high school and went off to college. I recently made a suggestion for him to maybe start up a band again. To my surprise, he was excited about the idea but didn't really know where to start. I suggested he make posters to advertise and maybe place them around his campus. He got to work right away and showed me a flyer he had made. I asked if he wanted me to put it up on the bulletin board at my work place and he agreed.\n\nAs I was posting up the flyer on the board the next day, a colleague \"Joe\" walked up beside me and noticed the flyer (he's 29). I never really talked to Joe in the past because we work in different departments but I recognized his face and knew of him through other colleagues. We started talking about the band and Joe said he sings and plays his guitar every now and then. I told him he should audition and we both laughed about it, but toward the end of our conversation, he seemed interested, so I ripped off the part of the flyer that had Ben's phone number and gave it to him in case he wanted more information.\n\nLong story short, he audition and ended up in the band. The band consists of Ben, Joe, and two other people (both go to school with Ben). I'll admit, it was weird having Joe over at our place at first because we were colleagues and never hung out outside of work or work events, but I didn't mind it because Ben seemed happy and talks a lot about Joe (the two hang out often).\n\nA week ago, Joe was supposed to come over and work on some lyrics with Ben, but Ben was running late, so I invited Joe inside for a cup of coffee. We started chatting about work and complaining about our supervisors to each other, which was really nice to do because I haven't been able to vent to any of my other colleagues about work stress. We talked about the band and he played a sample of a song they were working on, which sounded similar to a song I had heard before but couldn't remember the name of. He asked for my number so that I could send him the song if I ended up remembering. I sent him the song that night and we've been texting all week since then. I enjoy talking to him a lot and it honestly feels like a stupid high school crush (I haven't seriously dated anyone since I was with Ben's father). Yesterday Ben found out I'd been texting Joe and got upset, saying that it's weird and that I can't date his friend. He compared it to \"what if you dated Matt\" (his 21 yr old friend since middle school). I don't think it's the same situation though. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong for dating her son's friend. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the backstory: She's a single mom who had her son at 17. Now he's 21, dealing with depression, and she's been helping him start a band. She met Joe, a colleague, who joined the band. They started talking more, and eventually, they began dating. Her son got upset about it.\n\nSo, the main points here are the age difference and the relationship with her son's friend. The mom is 38, and Joe is 29. The son is 21. The son is upset because he compares it to dating his friend Matt, who's the same age as him. But she's older than her son, so the dynamic is different. \n\nIs the mom in the wrong? Well, from a moral standpoint, it's a matter of perspective. Her son might feel uncomfortable because it's his friend, but the mother's actions aren't necessarily unethical. She's an adult, and Joe is older than her son. However, the situation could be seen as crossing a line because she's the parent and the friend is connected to her child. \n\nBut wait, the mother isn't the one who's the parent of Joe; Joe is an adult too. The mother's son is also an adult. The key here is whether there's a conflict of interest or if it's inappropriate for her to date someone her son is friends with. In some cases, people might find it odd because of the parent-son relationship, but legally, there's no wrongdoing unless there's a conflict of interest at work. The user mentioned they work in different departments, so maybe that's not an issue here. \n\nThe son's reaction is valid because he's upset about his friend dating his mom. But the mother's side is that she's just forming a relationship with an adult. There's no explicit rule against it unless there's a specific workplace policy or family taboo. \n\nSo, considering all angles, the answer might hinge on whether society deems this inappropriate. Some might say she's overstepping by dating someone her son considers a friend. Others might argue it's none of her son's business since both she and Joe are adults. The mother hasn't forced anything; the son is just upset. \n\nIn AITA terms, often the answer depends on the community's perspective. Since the mother isn't violating any laws or explicit rules, and the son is an adult who can have his own opinions, the mother might not be in the wrong. However, it's a sensitive situation that could affect her relationship with her son. So the answer could be B, No, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
