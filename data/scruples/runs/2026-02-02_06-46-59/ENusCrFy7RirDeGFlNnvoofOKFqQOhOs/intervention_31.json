His father was never really in the picture, so I was a single mother for the most part. Now I'm 38 and my son \"Ben\" is 21. He's been suffering from depression the past couple of years. I take him to therapy every week and he seems to be getting better but he's always been an introverted kid, so he seems lonely most days. When he was in high school, he was in a band but that quickly disbanded after one of the members graduated high school and went off to college. I recently made a suggestion for him to maybe start up a band again. To my surprise, he was excited about the idea but didn't really know where to start. I suggested he make posters to advertise and maybe place them around his campus. He got to work right away and showed me a flyer he had made. I asked if he wanted me to put it up on the bulletin board at my work place and he agreed.\n\nAs I was posting up the flyer on the board the next day, a colleague \"Joe\" walked up beside me and noticed the flyer (he's 29). I never really talked to Joe in the past because we work in different departments but I recognized his face and knew of him through other colleagues. We started talking about the band and Joe said he sings and plays his guitar every now and then. I told him he should audition and we both laughed about it, but toward the end of our conversation, he seemed interested, so I ripped off the part of the flyer that had Ben's phone number and gave it to him in case he wanted more information.\n\nLong story short, he audition and ended up in the band. The band consists of Ben, Joe, and two other people (both go to school with Ben). I'll admit, it was weird having Joe over at our place at first because we were colleagues and never hung out outside of work or work events, but I didn't mind it because Ben seemed happy and talks a lot about Joe (the two hang out often).\n\nA week ago, Joe was supposed to come over and work on some lyrics with Ben, but Ben was running late, so I invited Joe inside for a cup of coffee. We started chatting about work and complaining about our supervisors to each other, which was really nice to do because I haven't been able to vent to any of my other colleagues about work stress. We talked about the band and he played a sample of a song they were working on, which sounded similar to a song I had heard before but couldn't remember the name of. He asked for my number so that I could send him the song if I ended up remembering. I sent him the song that night and we've been texting all week since then. I enjoy talking to him a lot and it honestly feels like a stupid high school crush (I haven't seriously dated anyone since I was with Ben's father). Yesterday Ben found out I'd been texting Joe and got upset, saying that it's weird and that I can't date his friend. He compared it to \"what if you dated Matt\" (his 21 yr old friend since middle school). I don't think it's the same situation though. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the situation is in the wrong for dating her son's friend. The author is a single mother who has a close relationship with her son, Ben, who's 21. She helped him start a band, and one of the band members is Joe, her colleague. They ended up talking more, and now she's texting him, which Ben found out and is upset about. The user thinks the author is in the wrong but wants my opinion.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The mother is 38, and Joe is 29. They work together, so there's a professional relationship. The mother is involved in her son's life, which is understandable given their history. She helped connect Joe with Ben, so Joe became part of Ben's circle. Now, she's developing a personal relationship with Joe, which Ben is uncomfortable with. \n\nI should think about boundaries. As a parent, she has a responsibility to maintain boundaries that respect her son's feelings. Ben is an adult, so he has his own autonomy, but the mother's actions might affect their relationship. The mother might feel lonely and see Joe as a potential romantic interest, but she's stepping into a role that could be seen as intrusive or inappropriate from Ben's perspective. \n\nAlso, the fact that Joe is Ben's friend complicates things. Even though they're both adults, the mother's relationship with Joe could create tension. Ben might feel that the mother is encroaching on his social circle. Since she's the one who introduced them, maybe there's an expectation that she's not going to form a relationship with someone her son is close to. \n\nAnother angle is the professional aspect. She and Joe work together, so a personal relationship could lead to conflicts in the workplace. Even if they're not in the same department, it could affect how they interact professionally. \n\nBut Ben is an adult, so he can't control his mother's relationships. However, the mother's actions might be causing harm to her relationship with Ben. The question is whether she's in the wrong. On one hand, she's a single adult who might be seeking companionship. On the other, the situation could be awkward for Ben and might not be the best idea given their close bond. \n\nI should also consider cultural or social norms. In some cases, parents dating their adult children's friends might be seen as taboo, even if both parties are adults. The mother might not be \"wrong\" legally or ethically, but socially, it could be frowned upon. \n\nThe key points are: Ben's feelings versus the mother's autonomy. Since Ben is an adult, he's allowed to have opinions, but the mother isn't obligated to change her behavior based on his preferences. However, considering their history and the close relationship they share, the mother might have a responsibility to be more considerate of Ben's feelings. \n\nI think the answer depends on whether the mother respects Ben's feelings while also acting in her own interest. If she's dismissive of Ben's hurt, that could be problematic. But if she's aware and makes an informed choice, maybe it's not her fault. Since Ben is upset and the mother is continuing the relationship, maybe she is in the wrong because she's not considering his perspective enough. Alternatively, she's not in the wrong because she's an adult with her own life. \n\nI'm leaning towards answer A (the author is in the wrong) because even though she's an adult, the situation could be seen as overstepping boundaries with her son, especially since she's the one who brought Joe into Ben's life. The potential for conflict and discomfort in both their relationships (with Ben and at work) suggests that she should have been more cautious. So the answer is A.\n"
