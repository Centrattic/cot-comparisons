His father was never really in the picture, so I was a single mother for the most part. Now I'm 38 and my son \"Ben\" is 21. He's been suffering from depression the past couple of years. I take him to therapy every week and he seems to be getting better but he's always been an introverted kid, so he seems lonely most days. When he was in high school, he was in a band but that quickly disbanded after one of the members graduated high school and went off to college. I recently made a suggestion for him to maybe start up a band again. To my surprise, he was excited about the idea but didn't really know where to start. I suggested he make posters to advertise and maybe place them around his campus. He got to work right away and showed me a flyer he had made. I asked if he wanted me to put it up on the bulletin board at my work place and he agreed.\n\nAs I was posting up the flyer on the board the next day, a colleague \"Joe\" walked up beside me and noticed the flyer (he's 29). I never really talked to Joe in the past because we work in different departments but I recognized his face and knew of him through other colleagues. We started talking about the band and Joe said he sings and plays his guitar every now and then. I told him he should audition and we both laughed about it, but toward the end of our conversation, he seemed interested, so I ripped off the part of the flyer that had Ben's phone number and gave it to him in case he wanted more information.\n\nLong story short, he audition and ended up in the band. The band consists of Ben, Joe, and two other people (both go to school with Ben). I'll admit, it was weird having Joe over at our place at first because we were colleagues and never hung out outside of work or work events, but I didn't mind it because Ben seemed happy and talks a lot about Joe (the two hang out often).\n\nA week ago, Joe was supposed to come over and work on some lyrics with Ben, but Ben was running late, so I invited Joe inside for a cup of coffee. We started chatting about work and complaining about our supervisors to each other, which was really nice to do because I haven't been able to vent to any of my other colleagues about work stress. We talked about the band and he played a sample of a song they were working on, which sounded similar to a song I had heard before but couldn't remember the name of. He asked for my number so that I could send him the song if I ended up remembering. I sent him the song that night and we've been texting all week since then. I enjoy talking to him a lot and it honestly feels like a stupid high school crush (I haven't seriously dated anyone since I was with Ben's father). Yesterday Ben found out I'd been texting Joe and got upset, saying that it's weird and that I can't date his friend. He compared it to \"what if you dated Matt\" (his 21 yr old friend since middle school). I don't think it's the same situation though. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is that a single mom, who's 38, has a 21-year-old son named Ben. Ben had a rough time with depression and is now in a band with a colleague of his mom, Joe, who's 29. The mom and Joe started talking about the band, and then eventually the mom started dating Joe, which made Ben upset.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The mom and Joe are colleagues. They met through Ben's band, so there's a work relationship component. Also, Ben is still living with his mom, given that Joe came over to their place. The mom started a relationship with Joe after just a few interactions, which might be moving quickly. Ben's reaction is about the idea of his mom dating a friend, which he compares to dating a close friend of his own, Matt.\n\nFrom a moral standpoint, there are a few angles. One is the power dynamic between a parent and their adult child. Even though Ben is 21, which is an adult age, the mom is still his parent. The son might feel protective or uncomfortable because Joe is his friend. There's a potential for conflict of interest in the workplace since they are colleagues, which could lead to complications if they start a romantic relationship. Also, the fact that the mom hasn't dated since Ben's father might mean she's not used to dating, so she might not be considering all the implications.\n\nAnother angle is the son's emotional state. He was dealing with depression and loneliness, and the mom's new relationship could be seen as neglecting his needs or not respecting his boundaries. The son might feel that his mom is prioritizing her own needs over his well-being, especially if he feels that Joe is a friend he values.\n\nOn the other hand, the mom might argue that she's an adult and has the right to date, and that the son's comparison to dating a friend is a bit unfair, especially if Joe wasn't that close of a friend to her. Also, the son is an adult and should have some independence, but the fact that they live together and the son is still relying on her for support (like therapy) might complicate things.\n\nWorkplace relationships can be tricky. If the mom and Joe are in different departments, maybe it's less of a problem, but there could still be issues if the relationship affects their work performance or leads to favoritism. The fact that the mom gave Joe Ben's number initially and then the relationship developed through the band might be a point of contention.\n\nIn terms of right or wrong, it's not entirely clear-cut. The mom might have acted without considering how it would affect her son, even if she's an adult. The son's reaction is valid because he's upset about his mom dating someone he's close to. However, the mom is also an adult and entitled to her own life. The key factors are the impact on the son's well-being, the workplace implications, and the respect for each other's boundaries.\n\nI think the answer might be that the author is in the wrong (A) because she didn't consider the potential impact on her son and the workplace situation. However, others might argue that she's not in the wrong since she's an adult and the son should be more independent. But given the context, the relationship with the son's friend and the colleague aspect, it's likely the author is in the wrong.\n"
