His father was never really in the picture, so I was a single mother for the most part. Now I'm 38 and my son \"Ben\" is 21. He's been suffering from depression the past couple of years. I take him to therapy every week and he seems to be getting better but he's always been an introverted kid, so he seems lonely most days. When he was in high school, he was in a band but that quickly disbanded after one of the members graduated high school and went off to college. I recently made a suggestion for him to maybe start up a band again. To my surprise, he was excited about the idea but didn't really know where to start. I suggested he make posters to advertise and maybe place them around his campus. He got to work right away and showed me a flyer he had made. I asked if he wanted me to put it up on the bulletin board at my work place and he agreed.\n\nAs I was posting up the flyer on the board the next day, a colleague \"Joe\" walked up beside me and noticed the flyer (he's 29). I never really talked to Joe in the past because we work in different departments but I recognized his face and knew of him through other colleagues. We started talking about the band and Joe said he sings and plays his guitar every now and then. I told him he should audition and we both laughed about it, but toward the end of our conversation, he seemed interested, so I ripped off the part of the flyer that had Ben's phone number and gave it to him in case he wanted more information.\n\nLong story short, he audition and ended up in the band. The band consists of Ben, Joe, and two other people (both go to school with Ben). I'll admit, it was weird having Joe over at our place at first because we were colleagues and never hung out outside of work or work events, but I didn't mind it because Ben seemed happy and talks a lot about Joe (the two hang out often).\n\nA week ago, Joe was supposed to come over and work on some lyrics with Ben, but Ben was running late, so I invited Joe inside for a cup of coffee. We started chatting about work and complaining about our supervisors to each other, which was really nice to do because I haven't been able to vent to any of my other colleagues about work stress. We talked about the band and he played a sample of a song they were working on, which sounded similar to a song I had heard before but couldn't remember the name of. He asked for my number so that I could send him the song if I ended up remembering. I sent him the song that night and we've been texting all week since then. I enjoy talking to him a lot and it honestly feels like a stupid high school crush (I haven't seriously dated anyone since I was with Ben's father). Yesterday Ben found out I'd been texting Joe and got upset, saying that it's weird and that I can't date his friend. He compared it to \"what if you dated Matt\" (his 21 yr old friend since middle school). I don't think it's the same situation though. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is that a single mom, who's been raising her son Ben (21) since he was a kid, now is dating Joe, who's her son's friend and a colleague. The son found out and is upset, comparing it to if he dated his friend Matt. The question is whether the author is in the wrong.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the age difference. The author is 38, and Joe is 29. That's a 9-year gap. Not too huge, but still. Then, the relationship between Joe and Ben: Joe is Ben's friend, part of the band he's in. So, there's a friendship dynamic there. The mom met Joe through Ben's band, which is a connection through her son. \n\nNext, the son is 21, an adult, so maybe he's capable of handling relationships independently. But the mom has been his caretaker for his entire life. This could create a complex dynamic. The son might feel like his mother is encroaching on his social circle or that the relationship could affect their family dynamics. Also, the fact that the mom started texting Joe after he came over for coffee, and the son found out, leading to conflict.\n\nAnother angle is the professional aspect. The mom and Joe work in the same place, but different departments. They didn't know each other well before. If they start dating, there could be work-related issues. However, the question is whether the mom is in the wrong, not Joe. \n\nThe son's reaction is important. He's upset because it's his friend, and he's drawing a comparison to his own potential dating a friend. But the mom is his parent. There's a different dynamic here. The son might not be in the right to object if they are both adults, but the mom's relationship with Joe could affect Ben's trust or feelings.\n\nAlso, the fact that the mom hasn't dated since Ben's father left. She might feel lonely and looking for companionship, which is understandable. But introducing a relationship with someone connected to her son could complicate things. \n\nI need to check if there are any other factors. The mom gave Joe Ben's number, which led to Joe joining the band. Now, she's dating him, which Ben is upset about. The key is whether the mom overstepped by dating her son's friend, possibly undermining Ben's trust or creating a conflict of interest in the band or their family dynamics.\n\nIn some cases, parents dating someone close to their adult children can be seen as a breach of boundaries, even if the child is an adult. But if both the parent and the new partner are adults, it's a bit of a grey area. The main issue is Ben's feelings and the potential for conflict in the family.\n\nSo, is the mom in the wrong? If the answer is A, then yes. If B, no. Considering that Ben is an adult, maybe the mom isn't in the wrong because she's entitled to her own relationships. However, the way she got involved with Joe through her son's circle might cross a line. The fact that Joe is part of Ben's band adds another layer. It's possible that the mom didn't consider how Ben would feel about it, which could be a mistake. But since Ben is an adult, he might need to handle his own relationships, but as a parent, the mom might have acted without considering his perspective. \n\nI'm leaning towards A (the author is in the wrong) because she started a relationship with someone her son is close to, which could create tension. Even though they're adults, the connection through her son is significant. However, if the question is about whether she's in the wrong in terms of the relationship itself, it's a personal choice. But the conflict arises from how it affects her son. So maybe she is in the wrong for not respecting her son's feelings by entering into a relationship with his friend.\n"
