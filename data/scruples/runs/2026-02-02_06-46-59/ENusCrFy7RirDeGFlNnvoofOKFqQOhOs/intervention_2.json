His father was never really in the picture, so I was a single mother for the most part. Now I'm 38 and my son \"Ben\" is 21. He's been suffering from depression the past couple of years. I take him to therapy every week and he seems to be getting better but he's always been an introverted kid, so he seems lonely most days. When he was in high school, he was in a band but that quickly disbanded after one of the members graduated high school and went off to college. I recently made a suggestion for him to maybe start up a band again. To my surprise, he was excited about the idea but didn't really know where to start. I suggested he make posters to advertise and maybe place them around his campus. He got to work right away and showed me a flyer he had made. I asked if he wanted me to put it up on the bulletin board at my work place and he agreed.\n\nAs I was posting up the flyer on the board the next day, a colleague \"Joe\" walked up beside me and noticed the flyer (he's 29). I never really talked to Joe in the past because we work in different departments but I recognized his face and knew of him through other colleagues. We started talking about the band and Joe said he sings and plays his guitar every now and then. I told him he should audition and we both laughed about it, but toward the end of our conversation, he seemed interested, so I ripped off the part of the flyer that had Ben's phone number and gave it to him in case he wanted more information.\n\nLong story short, he audition and ended up in the band. The band consists of Ben, Joe, and two other people (both go to school with Ben). I'll admit, it was weird having Joe over at our place at first because we were colleagues and never hung out outside of work or work events, but I didn't mind it because Ben seemed happy and talks a lot about Joe (the two hang out often).\n\nA week ago, Joe was supposed to come over and work on some lyrics with Ben, but Ben was running late, so I invited Joe inside for a cup of coffee. We started chatting about work and complaining about our supervisors to each other, which was really nice to do because I haven't been able to vent to any of my other colleagues about work stress. We talked about the band and he played a sample of a song they were working on, which sounded similar to a song I had heard before but couldn't remember the name of. He asked for my number so that I could send him the song if I ended up remembering. I sent him the song that night and we've been texting all week since then. I enjoy talking to him a lot and it honestly feels like a stupid high school crush (I haven't seriously dated anyone since I was with Ben's father). Yesterday Ben found out I'd been texting Joe and got upset, saying that it's weird and that I can't date his friend. He compared it to \"what if you dated Matt\" (his 21 yr old friend since middle school). I don't think it's the same situation though. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the \"Am I the Asshole\" scenario is in the wrong. The situation involves a mother who started dating her son's friend, Joe, after meeting him through her son's band. The son found out and is upset, comparing it to if his mom dated another friend, Matt.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key factors here. The mother is 38, her son is 21, and Joe is 29. They work together but were in different departments. The initial interaction was through the son's band, and they started hanging out for work-related reasons. Then, when her son was late, she invited Joe in for coffee, leading to more casual interactions and eventually texting. The son is upset because he feels it's weird and a conflict of interest.\n\nThe user thinks the author is in the wrong but wants a second opinion. Let me break this down. The mother's actions started with a good intention\u2014helping her son by advertising his band. But when she started dating Joe, who is both her colleague and her son's friend, there's potential for conflict. Workplace relationships can be tricky, especially if they affect the work environment or lead to favoritism. Also, the son's discomfort is valid because it's his friend, which could create tension between him and Joe.\n\nHowever, the mother hasn't acted out of selfishness; she's been supportive of her son's interests. The relationship began after the son was already friends with Joe, and she didn't initiate it solely for herself. But the issue is that she might be overstepping boundaries, both as a mother and a colleague. The son's reaction is about the emotional impact on him, feeling that his friend is now someone his mother is dating. The question is whether she should have considered that before proceeding.\n\nIn terms of wrongdoing, it's a matter of perspective. Legally, there's no law against this, but socially and ethically, there are boundaries. The mother might not be in the wrong if she didn't know about the potential issues beforehand and acted in good faith. However, she should consider her son's feelings and the workplace dynamics. The answer could depend on whether she should have recognized that starting a relationship with a colleague and son's friend could cause problems and taken steps to avoid it.\n\nSo, the mother's actions aren't malicious, but she might have ignored potential consequences. The son's reaction is valid, but does that make the mother in the wrong? It's a bit of a gray area. If the relationship affects her son's friendships or creates a conflict of interest at work, then maybe she is. But if the relationship is genuine and she's not using her position to manipulate, then maybe not. The key factors are intent and the impact on others. Since the mother didn't start the relationship with malicious intent but overlooked the social implications, the answer might be that she's not in the wrong, but she should address the son's concerns.\n"
