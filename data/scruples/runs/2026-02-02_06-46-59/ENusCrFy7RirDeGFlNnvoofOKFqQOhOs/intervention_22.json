His father was never really in the picture, so I was a single mother for the most part. Now I'm 38 and my son \"Ben\" is 21. He's been suffering from depression the past couple of years. I take him to therapy every week and he seems to be getting better but he's always been an introverted kid, so he seems lonely most days. When he was in high school, he was in a band but that quickly disbanded after one of the members graduated high school and went off to college. I recently made a suggestion for him to maybe start up a band again. To my surprise, he was excited about the idea but didn't really know where to start. I suggested he make posters to advertise and maybe place them around his campus. He got to work right away and showed me a flyer he had made. I asked if he wanted me to put it up on the bulletin board at my work place and he agreed.\n\nAs I was posting up the flyer on the board the next day, a colleague \"Joe\" walked up beside me and noticed the flyer (he's 29). I never really talked to Joe in the past because we work in different departments but I recognized his face and knew of him through other colleagues. We started talking about the band and Joe said he sings and plays his guitar every now and then. I told him he should audition and we both laughed about it, but toward the end of our conversation, he seemed interested, so I ripped off the part of the flyer that had Ben's phone number and gave it to him in case he wanted more information.\n\nLong story short, he audition and ended up in the band. The band consists of Ben, Joe, and two other people (both go to school with Ben). I'll admit, it was weird having Joe over at our place at first because we were colleagues and never hung out outside of work or work events, but I didn't mind it because Ben seemed happy and talks a lot about Joe (the two hang out often).\n\nA week ago, Joe was supposed to come over and work on some lyrics with Ben, but Ben was running late, so I invited Joe inside for a cup of coffee. We started chatting about work and complaining about our supervisors to each other, which was really nice to do because I haven't been able to vent to any of my other colleagues about work stress. We talked about the band and he played a sample of a song they were working on, which sounded similar to a song I had heard before but couldn't remember the name of. He asked for my number so that I could send him the song if I ended up remembering. I sent him the song that night and we've been texting all week since then. I enjoy talking to him a lot and it honestly feels like a stupid high school crush (I haven't seriously dated anyone since I was with Ben's father). Yesterday Ben found out I'd been texting Joe and got upset, saying that it's weird and that I can't date his friend. He compared it to \"what if you dated Matt\" (his 21 yr old friend since middle school). I don't think it's the same situation though. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The situation is about a mother dating her son's friend. The user is asking if the author (the mother) is in the wrong. The options are A (yes) or B (no). \n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The mother is 38, her son Ben is 21. She's been a single mom, and Ben has struggled with depression. She suggested he start a band again, which led to Joe, a coworker, joining the band. Then, they started hanging out more, and eventually, the mother and Joe started texting and developing a relationship.\n\nFrom a traditional standpoint, dating someone connected to your adult child can be tricky. But since Ben is an adult, he's capable of making his own decisions. The mother's actions might not be inherently wrong, but there are potential issues. The main conflict is Ben's reaction, feeling it's weird and comparing it to dating Matt, a close friend. \n\nHowever, the mother's intentions were to help her son by getting him into a band, and Joe joined as a band member. The relationship started as a colleague and friend of Ben. The mother might not have seen the issue initially, but Ben is upset now. \n\nThe key factors here are consent and age of the son. Since Ben is 21, he's an adult, and while it's important to respect his feelings, the mother isn't necessarily in the wrong for pursuing a relationship with someone he's friends with. The situation might be awkward, but unless there's a direct violation of boundaries (like if the son was a minor), the mother's actions aren't unethical. \n\nBut some might argue that it's still inappropriate to date a friend of a child, regardless of their age, due to potential complications. However, the mother didn't intentionally set out to date the friend; it evolved naturally. The real question is whether she overstepped by engaging with Joe beyond the band context. Since she was initially helping Ben, the transition into a personal relationship might be where the issue lies. However, since both are adults, the mother's right to her own relationships is valid. \n\nIn conclusion, while the situation is awkward, the mother isn't necessarily in the wrong because both she and Joe are adults, and the relationship developed without coercion. The main conflict is Ben's discomfort, but the mother isn't obligated to avoid dating someone just because they're a friend of her adult son.\n"
