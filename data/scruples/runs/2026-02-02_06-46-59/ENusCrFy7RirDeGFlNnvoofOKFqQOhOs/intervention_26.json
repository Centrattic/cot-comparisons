His father was never really in the picture, so I was a single mother for the most part. Now I'm 38 and my son \"Ben\" is 21. He's been suffering from depression the past couple of years. I take him to therapy every week and he seems to be getting better but he's always been an introverted kid, so he seems lonely most days. When he was in high school, he was in a band but that quickly disbanded after one of the members graduated high school and went off to college. I recently made a suggestion for him to maybe start up a band again. To my surprise, he was excited about the idea but didn't really know where to start. I suggested he make posters to advertise and maybe place them around his campus. He got to work right away and showed me a flyer he had made. I asked if he wanted me to put it up on the bulletin board at my work place and he agreed.\n\nAs I was posting up the flyer on the board the next day, a colleague \"Joe\" walked up beside me and noticed the flyer (he's 29). I never really talked to Joe in the past because we work in different departments but I recognized his face and knew of him through other colleagues. We started talking about the band and Joe said he sings and plays his guitar every now and then. I told him he should audition and we both laughed about it, but toward the end of our conversation, he seemed interested, so I ripped off the part of the flyer that had Ben's phone number and gave it to him in case he wanted more information.\n\nLong story short, he audition and ended up in the band. The band consists of Ben, Joe, and two other people (both go to school with Ben). I'll admit, it was weird having Joe over at our place at first because we were colleagues and never hung out outside of work or work events, but I didn't mind it because Ben seemed happy and talks a lot about Joe (the two hang out often).\n\nA week ago, Joe was supposed to come over and work on some lyrics with Ben, but Ben was running late, so I invited Joe inside for a cup of coffee. We started chatting about work and complaining about our supervisors to each other, which was really nice to do because I haven't been able to vent to any of my other colleagues about work stress. We talked about the band and he played a sample of a song they were working on, which sounded similar to a song I had heard before but couldn't remember the name of. He asked for my number so that I could send him the song if I ended up remembering. I sent him the song that night and we've been texting all week since then. I enjoy talking to him a lot and it honestly feels like a stupid high school crush (I haven't seriously dated anyone since I was with Ben's father). Yesterday Ben found out I'd been texting Joe and got upset, saying that it's weird and that I can't date his friend. He compared it to \"what if you dated Matt\" (his 21 yr old friend since middle school). I don't think it's the same situation though. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for dating their son's friend. The scenario involves a single mom who connected with Joe, a colleague of hers and a friend of her son Ben. They started talking through the band Ben wanted to form, Joe joined, and later the mom and Joe started texting. Ben found out and is upset, comparing it to dating his friend Matt.\n\nFirst, I need to assess if the mom did something wrong. The main points here are the relationship between the mom and Joe, the fact that Joe is Ben's friend, and the age difference. The mom is 38, Joe is 29, and Ben is 21. The mom hasn't dated since Ben's father left when she was 17. \n\nFrom a legal standpoint, there's no issue with the age difference. 38 and 29 is a 9-year gap, which is common and not illegal. However, the social dynamics are more complex. Ben is 21, an adult, and Joe is 29, also an adult. The mom is Ben's parent, so there's a parent-child relationship that could create tension.\n\nThe mom's actions started as helping her son form a band, which is appropriate. She introduced Joe to the band, which was for Ben's benefit. However, the transition from professional/parental role to dating her son's friend might be problematic. Even though both adults are adults, Ben might feel like he's losing a friend. The mom's relationship with Joe could make Ben uncomfortable, especially since she's his parent. \n\nBut Ben is an adult. If he's 21, he's legally an adult and capable of managing his own friendships and relationships. The mom is in a different role as a parent, so her relationship with her son's friend might be seen as crossing boundaries, even if both parties are adults. However, the mom isn't Ben's legal guardian anymore since he's an adult, so her actions are her own. \n\nThe key issue here is whether the mom's actions are in the wrong. From a family dynamics perspective, it's possible that Ben might feel his mom is overstepping by dating his friend, but since both the mom and Joe are adults, they have a right to form relationships. However, the initial connection through Ben's band could be seen as using the son's social circle to build her own relationship. \n\nAnother angle is that the mom might be lonely and seeking emotional support, which is understandable. She found a connection with Joe, who is also Ben's friend. The problem is the perception and the potential for conflict in the family. Ben's reaction is valid because he might feel like his mom is prioritizing her needs over his friendships. \n\nIn terms of ethics, there's no clear legal wrongdoing, but socially, it's a thorny situation. The mom's actions might be considered inappropriate because they involve a parent forming a romantic relationship with a friend of their adult child. Even though Ben is an adult, the parent-child dynamic complicates things. The mom might be in the wrong for not considering Ben's feelings, especially since the relationship could strain the family. However, she's an adult with her own life, and dating is a personal choice. \n\nThe answer depends on whether the focus is on Ben's feelings versus the mom's right to date. If the question is about the mom being in the wrong, it's a judgment call. Since both are adults and the mom isn't Ben's legal guardian anymore, maybe the answer is no. But if the focus is on maintaining appropriate boundaries as a parent, then yes, she's in the wrong. \n\nI think the key is that Ben is an adult, so the mom's relationship isn't inherently wrong. However, the way it was initiated through Ben's band might be problematic. The mom should have considered Ben's feelings. But since both adults are involved, the answer might be no. But if the question is about the mom's actions being in the wrong, then maybe A (yes) or B (no). \n\nHmm. The user initially thought the author is in the wrong but is unsure. I need to decide based on the situation. Since the mom is an adult and Joe is an adult, and Ben is also an adult, the mom's relationship is her choice. The issue is more about Ben's feelings and the family dynamic. However, the mom didn't force the relationship; she and Joe developed it. So, technically, she's not in the wrong. But she might have crossed a boundary by dating a friend of her son. \n\nIn AITA scenarios, the judgment often depends on context. If the mom used her position as a parent to influence the relationship, that's wrong. But here, she didn't. The relationship formed naturally, albeit through Ben's social circle. So, maybe the answer is B (no), she's not in the wrong.\n"
