His father was never really in the picture, so I was a single mother for the most part. Now I'm 38 and my son \"Ben\" is 21. He's been suffering from depression the past couple of years. I take him to therapy every week and he seems to be getting better but he's always been an introverted kid, so he seems lonely most days. When he was in high school, he was in a band but that quickly disbanded after one of the members graduated high school and went off to college. I recently made a suggestion for him to maybe start up a band again. To my surprise, he was excited about the idea but didn't really know where to start. I suggested he make posters to advertise and maybe place them around his campus. He got to work right away and showed me a flyer he had made. I asked if he wanted me to put it up on the bulletin board at my work place and he agreed.\n\nAs I was posting up the flyer on the board the next day, a colleague \"Joe\" walked up beside me and noticed the flyer (he's 29). I never really talked to Joe in the past because we work in different departments but I recognized his face and knew of him through other colleagues. We started talking about the band and Joe said he sings and plays his guitar every now and then. I told him he should audition and we both laughed about it, but toward the end of our conversation, he seemed interested, so I ripped off the part of the flyer that had Ben's phone number and gave it to him in case he wanted more information.\n\nLong story short, he audition and ended up in the band. The band consists of Ben, Joe, and two other people (both go to school with Ben). I'll admit, it was weird having Joe over at our place at first because we were colleagues and never hung out outside of work or work events, but I didn't mind it because Ben seemed happy and talks a lot about Joe (the two hang out often).\n\nA week ago, Joe was supposed to come over and work on some lyrics with Ben, but Ben was running late, so I invited Joe inside for a cup of coffee. We started chatting about work and complaining about our supervisors to each other, which was really nice to do because I haven't been able to vent to any of my other colleagues about work stress. We talked about the band and he played a sample of a song they were working on, which sounded similar to a song I had heard before but couldn't remember the name of. He asked for my number so that I could send him the song if I ended up remembering. I sent him the song that night and we've been texting all week since then. I enjoy talking to him a lot and it honestly feels like a stupid high school crush (I haven't seriously dated anyone since I was with Ben's father). Yesterday Ben found out I'd been texting Joe and got upset, saying that it's weird and that I can't date his friend. He compared it to \"what if you dated Matt\" (his 21 yr old friend since middle school). I don't think it's the same situation though. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for dating their son's friend. The situation involves a single mother who, after her son Ben formed a band with Joe (a colleague of hers who's now part of the band), started a relationship with Joe. Ben found out and is upset, comparing it to if she dated his other friend Matt.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical and social implications here. The mother has a role as a parent, and forming a relationship with someone her son is close to could create tension. Ben is 21, so he's an adult, but the mother is still his parent. The dynamic here is between a parent and a colleague of the son, which might not be as straightforward as a parent and a friend of their child.\n\nThe mother initiated contact by giving Joe Ben's number. Joe auditioned and became part of the band, so he's already connected to Ben through the band. Then, when Ben was running late, she invited Joe for coffee, leading to more personal interaction. The relationship started after that, which might have been a natural progression but could be seen as overstepping if the mother didn't consider Ben's feelings.\n\nEthically, the mother might have a responsibility to consider her son's comfort and emotional well-being. Even though Ben is an adult, the parent-child relationship can still have a significant impact. The mother might not be in the wrong legally or in terms of rules, but socially or morally, there's a question of whether she respected her son's boundaries.\n\nAnother angle is the workplace relationship. She and Joe are colleagues, which could complicate things further if their relationship affects the work environment. However, the main issue here is the relationship with Ben's friend.\n\nThe response options are A (author is wrong) or B (not wrong). The user thinks the author is wrong, but I need to decide based on the situation. If the mother didn't consult with Ben or consider how he'd feel, that could be seen as a mistake. However, the mother might argue that she's an adult and has the right to date who she wants. But since Ben is involved through the band and the friendship, the mother's actions might cross a boundary, making her at least partially at fault.\n\nConsidering all aspects, the answer might be A, as the mother didn't consider her son's feelings, leading to his upset. But there's also a case for B, as she's an adult with her own needs. However, the parent-son dynamic likely makes the answer A more appropriate.\n"
