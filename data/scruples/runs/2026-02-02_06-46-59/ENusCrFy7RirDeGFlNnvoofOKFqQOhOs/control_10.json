His father was never really in the picture, so I was a single mother for the most part. Now I'm 38 and my son \"Ben\" is 21. He's been suffering from depression the past couple of years. I take him to therapy every week and he seems to be getting better but he's always been an introverted kid, so he seems lonely most days. When he was in high school, he was in a band but that quickly disbanded after one of the members graduated high school and went off to college. I recently made a suggestion for him to maybe start up a band again. To my surprise, he was excited about the idea but didn't really know where to start. I suggested he make posters to advertise and maybe place them around his campus. He got to work right away and showed me a flyer he had made. I asked if he wanted me to put it up on the bulletin board at my work place and he agreed.\n\nAs I was posting up the flyer on the board the next day, a colleague \"Joe\" walked up beside me and noticed the flyer (he's 29). I never really talked to Joe in the past because we work in different departments but I recognized his face and knew of him through other colleagues. We started talking about the band and Joe said he sings and plays his guitar every now and then. I told him he should audition and we both laughed about it, but toward the end of our conversation, he seemed interested, so I ripped off the part of the flyer that had Ben's phone number and gave it to him in case he wanted more information.\n\nLong story short, he audition and ended up in the band. The band consists of Ben, Joe, and two other people (both go to school with Ben). I'll admit, it was weird having Joe over at our place at first because we were colleagues and never hung out outside of work or work events, but I didn't mind it because Ben seemed happy and talks a lot about Joe (the two hang out often).\n\nA week ago, Joe was supposed to come over and work on some lyrics with Ben, but Ben was running late, so I invited Joe inside for a cup of coffee. We started chatting about work and complaining about our supervisors to each other, which was really nice to do because I haven't been able to vent to any of my other colleagues about work stress. We talked about the band and he played a sample of a song they were working on, which sounded similar to a song I had heard before but couldn't remember the name of. He asked for my number so that I could send him the song if I ended up remembering. I sent him the song that night and we've been texting all week since then. I enjoy talking to him a lot and it honestly feels like a stupid high school crush (I haven't seriously dated anyone since I was with Ben's father). Yesterday Ben found out I'd been texting Joe and got upset, saying that it's weird and that I can't date his friend. He compared it to \"what if you dated Matt\" (his 21 yr old friend since middle school). I don't think it's the same situation though. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the story is in the wrong for dating her son's friend.\n\nFirst, the mom is 38, her son Ben is 21. She's been a single mom since he was young. Ben has depression and is introverted. She suggested he start a band again. He made a flyer, which she posted at work. Joe, a colleague, saw it, auditioned, and joined the band. Then there's coffee, conversation, texting, and now Ben is upset because he thinks it's weird for his mom to date his friend. He compares it to if he dated his friend Matt.\n\nSo the key points here: The mom and Joe met through her son's band. They started interacting more, leading to a possible romantic relationship. The mom feels it's natural, but Ben is uncomfortable. \n\nI need to consider the dynamics. The mom is Ben's primary caregiver, and now she's involved with someone Ben considers a friend. This could make Ben feel like his space is invaded or his trust is violated. Even though the mom didn't intend for it to happen, she introduced Joe into her son's life through the band, which might have led to a closer relationship. \n\nBut on the other hand, the mom is an adult and has the right to date. However, because Joe is her son's friend, it complicates things. The son's feelings are valid here. The mom might not have intended for this to happen, but by forming a relationship with someone who is part of her son's social circle, it could create tension. \n\nIs the mom in the wrong? Well, she didn't go out of her way to meet Joe; it was a natural progression through Ben's band. However, she didn't consider how Ben would feel about her dating someone close to him. The issue here is more about Ben's reaction and the potential for conflict rather than the mom's actions being inherently wrong. But some might argue that she should have been more cautious, considering her role as a parent and the close relationship with her son. \n\nAlternatively, maybe she's not in the wrong because she's an adult and has the right to pursue a relationship. The problem is Ben's reaction rather than her actions. The answer might depend on cultural perspectives and the importance placed on parental relationships versus romantic autonomy. \n\nSo, the answer is tricky. But in the context of \"Am I the Asshole,\" the question is whether the mom is the asshole for dating her son's friend. Some people might say yes because it could hurt the son's feelings and complicate their relationship. Others might say no because the mom is an adult and should have the freedom to date. However, the fact that Joe is part of the son's social circle and the son is upset makes it more complex. The mom might not be in the wrong, but the situation is delicate. The answer might lean towards B (No), but with the caveat that she needs to consider her son's feelings.\n"
