His father was never really in the picture, so I was a single mother for the most part. Now I'm 38 and my son \"Ben\" is 21. He's been suffering from depression the past couple of years. I take him to therapy every week and he seems to be getting better but he's always been an introverted kid, so he seems lonely most days. When he was in high school, he was in a band but that quickly disbanded after one of the members graduated high school and went off to college. I recently made a suggestion for him to maybe start up a band again. To my surprise, he was excited about the idea but didn't really know where to start. I suggested he make posters to advertise and maybe place them around his campus. He got to work right away and showed me a flyer he had made. I asked if he wanted me to put it up on the bulletin board at my work place and he agreed.\n\nAs I was posting up the flyer on the board the next day, a colleague \"Joe\" walked up beside me and noticed the flyer (he's 29). I never really talked to Joe in the past because we work in different departments but I recognized his face and knew of him through other colleagues. We started talking about the band and Joe said he sings and plays his guitar every now and then. I told him he should audition and we both laughed about it, but toward the end of our conversation, he seemed interested, so I ripped off the part of the flyer that had Ben's phone number and gave it to him in case he wanted more information.\n\nLong story short, he audition and ended up in the band. The band consists of Ben, Joe, and two other people (both go to school with Ben). I'll admit, it was weird having Joe over at our place at first because we were colleagues and never hung out outside of work or work events, but I didn't mind it because Ben seemed happy and talks a lot about Joe (the two hang out often).\n\nA week ago, Joe was supposed to come over and work on some lyrics with Ben, but Ben was running late, so I invited Joe inside for a cup of coffee. We started chatting about work and complaining about our supervisors to each other, which was really nice to do because I haven't been able to vent to any of my other colleagues about work stress. We talked about the band and he played a sample of a song they were working on, which sounded similar to a song I had heard before but couldn't remember the name of. He asked for my number so that I could send him the song if I ended up remembering. I sent him the song that night and we've been texting all week since then. I enjoy talking to him a lot and it honestly feels like a stupid high school crush (I haven't seriously dated anyone since I was with Ben's father). Yesterday Ben found out I'd been texting Joe and got upset, saying that it's weird and that I can't date his friend. He compared it to \"what if you dated Matt\" (his 21 yr old friend since middle school). I don't think it's the same situation though. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong. The situation involves a single mother who started dating her son's friend. Let me break it down.\n\nFirst, the backstory: The mother had her son Ben at 17, became a single mom, and is now 38. Ben is 21, dealing with depression and being introverted. She suggested he start a band again. He made a flyer, and the mother posted it at her workplace. Her colleague Joe, 29, saw it, joined the band, and now they're friends. Initially, Joe was just Ben's friend, but the mother and Joe started talking more, then texting, and now she's dating him. Ben is upset about it.\n\nSo the question is whether the mother is in the wrong. Let's consider the dynamics here. The mother is an adult, 38, and Joe is 29. Ben is 21, so he's an adult too. The mother's actions might be seen as overstepping if she's forming a romantic relationship with someone who is her son's friend, which could potentially affect their relationship and Ben's comfort.\n\nBut Ben is an adult, capable of making his own decisions. The mother might argue that she's not doing anything wrong because adults can date whom they want. However, there's a potential for conflict of interest, especially since Joe works with her (they are colleagues), even if different departments. Also, Ben's reaction is valid because he feels uncomfortable, similar to if he dated the mother's friend. But the mother might see it as a different scenario because she's the parent, and Joe is Ben's friend, not hers.\n\nPossible issues: The mother might be prioritizing her own needs over Ben's feelings. Even though Ben is an adult, the mother's role as a parent means her actions could influence Joe's relationship with Ben. If the mother starts dating Joe, Ben might feel like his friend is now also in a relationship with his parent, which is a different dynamic. There's also the work relationship aspect, which could lead to complications if the workplace hears about it.\n\nOn the other hand, the mother's actions aren't illegal. She's an adult, and if she and Joe are both consenting adults, it's her choice. However, the way she got involved\u2014through Ben's friend\u2014might make Ben uncomfortable, and she should consider his feelings. The mother might not have realized how it could affect Ben or that she's taking a friend from her son. The initial introduction was for Ben's benefit, but then the mother formed a relationship with Joe, which Ben found unexpected and uncomfortable.\n\nSo, is the mother in the wrong? It's a bit of a gray area. If Ben didn't consent or was uncomfortable, but he's an adult and can't control his mother's dating life. However, the mother should respect Ben's feelings and possibly step back if it's causing him distress. The mother might not be in the wrong legally or morally, but she could be seen as insensitive to Ben's situation. The answer might lean towards B (Not in the wrong) because she's an adult and can date whom she wants, but there's also a case for A if the situation is causing her son distress and she didn't consider his feelings enough.\n\nBut the key points are that Ben is an adult, the mother is an adult, and the issue is more about Ben's feelings versus her right to date. The mother might not be in the wrong, but she should address Ben's feelings. The answer might be B, but with the understanding that she should be considerate.\n"
