His father was never really in the picture, so I was a single mother for the most part. Now I'm 38 and my son \"Ben\" is 21. He's been suffering from depression the past couple of years. I take him to therapy every week and he seems to be getting better but he's always been an introverted kid, so he seems lonely most days. When he was in high school, he was in a band but that quickly disbanded after one of the members graduated high school and went off to college. I recently made a suggestion for him to maybe start up a band again. To my surprise, he was excited about the idea but didn't really know where to start. I suggested he make posters to advertise and maybe place them around his campus. He got to work right away and showed me a flyer he had made. I asked if he wanted me to put it up on the bulletin board at my work place and he agreed.\n\nAs I was posting up the flyer on the board the next day, a colleague \"Joe\" walked up beside me and noticed the flyer (he's 29). I never really talked to Joe in the past because we work in different departments but I recognized his face and knew of him through other colleagues. We started talking about the band and Joe said he sings and plays his guitar every now and then. I told him he should audition and we both laughed about it, but toward the end of our conversation, he seemed interested, so I ripped off the part of the flyer that had Ben's phone number and gave it to him in case he wanted more information.\n\nLong story short, he audition and ended up in the band. The band consists of Ben, Joe, and two other people (both go to school with Ben). I'll admit, it was weird having Joe over at our place at first because we were colleagues and never hung out outside of work or work events, but I didn't mind it because Ben seemed happy and talks a lot about Joe (the two hang out often).\n\nA week ago, Joe was supposed to come over and work on some lyrics with Ben, but Ben was running late, so I invited Joe inside for a cup of coffee. We started chatting about work and complaining about our supervisors to each other, which was really nice to do because I haven't been able to vent to any of my other colleagues about work stress. We talked about the band and he played a sample of a song they were working on, which sounded similar to a song I had heard before but couldn't remember the name of. He asked for my number so that I could send him the song if I ended up remembering. I sent him the song that night and we've been texting all week since then. I enjoy talking to him a lot and it honestly feels like a stupid high school crush (I haven't seriously dated anyone since I was with Ben's father). Yesterday Ben found out I'd been texting Joe and got upset, saying that it's weird and that I can't date his friend. He compared it to \"what if you dated Matt\" (his 21 yr old friend since middle school). I don't think it's the same situation though. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The question is whether the author is in the wrong for dating her son's friend. Let's start by breaking down the situation.\n\nFirst, the backstory: She's a single mom since she was 17, raised Ben, who's now 21. He's been struggling with depression and is introverted. She suggested he start a band again, and Joe, a colleague in his 20s, ended up joining. They bonded over work stress, and their conversation led to texting, which Ben found out about and is upset. The user thinks the author is in the wrong, but I need to decide if that's the case.\n\nSo, the key points here are the relationships involved. The author is the mother of Ben, and Joe is his friend. The mother started a romantic relationship with Joe, who is also Ben's friend. The son is not happy about this. The user asks if the author is in the wrong.\n\nI should consider several angles. First, the mother-son bond is crucial. The mother has been raising Ben alone since he was young, so their relationship is close. By dating his friend, she might be invading his social circle, which could make Ben feel like she's encroaching on his space. It could also affect Ben's trust and comfort with his friend Joe. If Ben and Joe were close, this might create tension between them, potentially affecting Ben's mental health, which is a concern given his history with depression.\n\nAnother angle is the professional relationship. The author and Joe work in different departments but interact at work. They met through her son's band, but the initial connection was at work. There might be workplace policies about personal relationships, especially if they start dating. This could lead to complications at their workplace, such as favoritism or conflicts of interest. However, the story doesn't mention any specific policies, so maybe that's not a factor here.\n\nAlso, the mother hasn't dated in a long time, and she feels a connection with Joe. It's valid for her to seek companionship, but the context of her son's friend complicates things. Ben's reaction is about the \"weirdness\" of it, comparing it to dating a friend from a similar age. The mother might argue that it's not the same because Joe isn't as close to Ben as Matt, but Ben perceives it as an issue. The mother's actions could disrupt Ben's social life and his ability to form his own relationships without his mother's influence.\n\nI need to weigh the mother's right to personal happiness against the potential impact on her son. The mother's well-being is important, but so is her son's emotional state. If Ben is already dealing with depression and loneliness, adding this dynamic could exacerbate his feelings. The mother might not have considered how her actions affect Ben, especially since she's been his primary caregiver for so long.\n\nAnother point is consent and transparency. The mother didn't consult Ben before starting the relationship, which might be a breach of trust. Even if she didn't have to ask his permission, keeping it a secret until it was discovered might have been unwise. Open communication could have mitigated some of the conflict.\n\nIn terms of ethics, is the mother in the wrong? It depends on cultural norms and the specific circumstances. Some might see it as a personal choice, while others might view it as a conflict of interest in her son's social life. The fact that she's the parent adds another layer because her actions could influence Ben's ability to navigate his own relationships and trust others.\n\nConsidering all these factors, the mother's decision to date her son's friend could be seen as problematic. It's not inherently wrong, but it's a situation that requires sensitivity towards her son's feelings and the potential consequences. The answer might be that she's not entirely in the wrong, but she needs to be considerate and address Ben's concerns. However, if the user believes she is in the wrong, it's because she didn't consider the impact on her son enough.\n"
