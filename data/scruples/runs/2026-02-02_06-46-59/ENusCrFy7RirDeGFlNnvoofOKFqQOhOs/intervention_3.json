His father was never really in the picture, so I was a single mother for the most part. Now I'm 38 and my son \"Ben\" is 21. He's been suffering from depression the past couple of years. I take him to therapy every week and he seems to be getting better but he's always been an introverted kid, so he seems lonely most days. When he was in high school, he was in a band but that quickly disbanded after one of the members graduated high school and went off to college. I recently made a suggestion for him to maybe start up a band again. To my surprise, he was excited about the idea but didn't really know where to start. I suggested he make posters to advertise and maybe place them around his campus. He got to work right away and showed me a flyer he had made. I asked if he wanted me to put it up on the bulletin board at my work place and he agreed.\n\nAs I was posting up the flyer on the board the next day, a colleague \"Joe\" walked up beside me and noticed the flyer (he's 29). I never really talked to Joe in the past because we work in different departments but I recognized his face and knew of him through other colleagues. We started talking about the band and Joe said he sings and plays his guitar every now and then. I told him he should audition and we both laughed about it, but toward the end of our conversation, he seemed interested, so I ripped off the part of the flyer that had Ben's phone number and gave it to him in case he wanted more information.\n\nLong story short, he audition and ended up in the band. The band consists of Ben, Joe, and two other people (both go to school with Ben). I'll admit, it was weird having Joe over at our place at first because we were colleagues and never hung out outside of work or work events, but I didn't mind it because Ben seemed happy and talks a lot about Joe (the two hang out often).\n\nA week ago, Joe was supposed to come over and work on some lyrics with Ben, but Ben was running late, so I invited Joe inside for a cup of coffee. We started chatting about work and complaining about our supervisors to each other, which was really nice to do because I haven't been able to vent to any of my other colleagues about work stress. We talked about the band and he played a sample of a song they were working on, which sounded similar to a song I had heard before but couldn't remember the name of. He asked for my number so that I could send him the song if I ended up remembering. I sent him the song that night and we've been texting all week since then. I enjoy talking to him a lot and it honestly feels like a stupid high school crush (I haven't seriously dated anyone since I was with Ben's father). Yesterday Ben found out I'd been texting Joe and got upset, saying that it's weird and that I can't date his friend. He compared it to \"what if you dated Matt\" (his 21 yr old friend since middle school). I don't think it's the same situation though. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that a single mom, who's 38, has a 21-year-old son named Ben. Ben's been dealing with depression and loneliness. She helped him start a band again, and they met Joe, a 29-year-old colleague of hers. Joe joined the band, and they started interacting more. The mom ended up talking to Joe during a coffee meeting, and now they're texting. Ben found out and is upset, comparing it to dating his friend. The question is whether the mom is in the wrong.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The mom is Ben's parent, which means there's an inherent authority and responsibility in that relationship. She's been a single parent for a long time, so her role is to support Ben, especially since he's been dealing with mental health issues. Now, she's forming a relationship with someone who is Ben's friend, which could complicate his social dynamics and trust.\n\nBen is 21, so he's an adult. However, the mother might still feel responsible for his well-being. The fact that Ben is upset suggests that her actions might be affecting their relationship. The comparison he made to dating his friend Matt implies that he views this as a conflict of interest, even though Joe is part of his band and a colleague of his mother.\n\nFrom a psychological perspective, forming a relationship with someone who is connected to a close family member can be tricky. The mother might not realize the potential impact on Ben. Even though she and Joe started the relationship through work and the band, the context is important. Joe is both a colleague and Ben's friend, which could create a situation where Ben feels his privacy is invaded or that his mother is inconsiderate of his feelings.\n\nThere's also the aspect of the mother's own life. She hasn't dated since her son's father, which might indicate a long period of loneliness. However, that doesn't necessarily justify forming a relationship that could cause her son distress. The key issue here is whether she considered Ben's feelings and the potential consequences before getting involved with Joe.\n\nAnother angle is the professional boundary. The mother gave Joe Ben's phone number, which might be seen as a breach of privacy. Even if Ben consented to the flyer, allowing a colleague to contact him through his personal information could be problematic. Also, the mother used her position to connect Joe with Ben, and then her personal relationship with Joe could be seen as exploiting that initial professional connection.\n\nBut then again, Ben is an adult and might be capable of handling his own relationships. However, since he's been struggling with depression and loneliness, the mother's actions might inadvertently affect his mental health. The line between being a supportive parent and overstepping into his personal life is blurry here.\n\nIn terms of societal norms, dating someone who is a friend of a child is generally frowned upon, especially if it causes conflict. The mother's role is to prioritize her son's well-being, even as he becomes an adult. She might not have intended to hurt him, but the act of dating his friend could make him feel that his mother doesn't respect his social circle or his autonomy.\n\nSo, considering all these factors, the mother might be in the wrong because she didn't consider how her actions would affect Ben. Even though she and Joe's relationship started through a shared interest in the band, the personal connection and the resulting tension with her son suggest that she acted without regard for his feelings. Therefore, the answer is likely A (the author is in the wrong).\n"
