His father was never really in the picture, so I was a single mother for the most part. Now I'm 38 and my son \"Ben\" is 21. He's been suffering from depression the past couple of years. I take him to therapy every week and he seems to be getting better but he's always been an introverted kid, so he seems lonely most days. When he was in high school, he was in a band but that quickly disbanded after one of the members graduated high school and went off to college. I recently made a suggestion for him to maybe start up a band again. To my surprise, he was excited about the idea but didn't really know where to start. I suggested he make posters to advertise and maybe place them around his campus. He got to work right away and showed me a flyer he had made. I asked if he wanted me to put it up on the bulletin board at my work place and he agreed.\n\nAs I was posting up the flyer on the board the next day, a colleague \"Joe\" walked up beside me and noticed the flyer (he's 29). I never really talked to Joe in the past because we work in different departments but I recognized his face and knew of him through other colleagues. We started talking about the band and Joe said he sings and plays his guitar every now and then. I told him he should audition and we both laughed about it, but toward the end of our conversation, he seemed interested, so I ripped off the part of the flyer that had Ben's phone number and gave it to him in case he wanted more information.\n\nLong story short, he audition and ended up in the band. The band consists of Ben, Joe, and two other people (both go to school with Ben). I'll admit, it was weird having Joe over at our place at first because we were colleagues and never hung out outside of work or work events, but I didn't mind it because Ben seemed happy and talks a lot about Joe (the two hang out often).\n\nA week ago, Joe was supposed to come over and work on some lyrics with Ben, but Ben was running late, so I invited Joe inside for a cup of coffee. We started chatting about work and complaining about our supervisors to each other, which was really nice to do because I haven't been able to vent to any of my other colleagues about work stress. We talked about the band and he played a sample of a song they were working on, which sounded similar to a song I had heard before but couldn't remember the name of. He asked for my number so that I could send him the song if I ended up remembering. I sent him the song that night and we've been texting all week since then. I enjoy talking to him a lot and it honestly feels like a stupid high school crush (I haven't seriously dated anyone since I was with Ben's father). Yesterday Ben found out I'd been texting Joe and got upset, saying that it's weird and that I can't date his friend. He compared it to \"what if you dated Matt\" (his 21 yr old friend since middle school). I don't think it's the same situation though. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong for dating their son's friend. So, the situation is that the mother, who's been a single parent since she was 17, has a 21-year-old son named Ben. Ben has been dealing with depression and is introverted. The mother suggested he start a band again, and he made a flyer. She put it up at her workplace, where her colleague Joe (29) saw it. They talked, Joe joined the band, and later, when Ben was late, the mother invited Joe for coffee. They started texting more, and now Ben is upset about it, comparing it to dating his friend Matt.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical and social implications here. The main issue is the age difference and the fact that the mother is Ben's parent. Even though Ben is 21 and an adult, his mother is 38, which is a 17-year age gap. That's a significant difference, but in some cases, people do date with such gaps, though it can be controversial. However, the key point here is that the mother is Ben's parent, and Joe is Ben's friend. Ben is upset because it's \"weird,\" and he's drawing a parallel to his friend from middle school.\n\nNext, the mother's history as a single parent who hasn't dated since Ben's father left. She might be feeling lonely and looking for connection. But the fact that Joe is her son's friend adds another layer. It's important to think about Ben's feelings. Even though he's an adult, the mother-son relationship is a parent-child dynamic, which can make the situation more sensitive. The mother might not realize that her son could feel uncomfortable or that the mother's actions could affect their relationship. \n\nAlso, there's the aspect of the mother being in a position of authority or influence over Joe, especially since they work together. Even if they're in different departments, there could be a power dynamic. But the mother didn't bring Joe into the band out of favoritism; she did it because Ben wanted the band to form again. However, once the relationship between the mother and Joe becomes romantic, especially after working together in a band, it could create complications, like favoritism or conflict of interest at work.\n\nBut the question is whether the mother is in the wrong. From a legal standpoint, if both are adults and there's no conflict of interest or policy violation at work, maybe it's not illegal. However, ethically, it's a gray area. The mother's intentions might be genuine, but she needs to consider her son's perspective. Ben's feelings about his mother dating his friend are valid, even if he's an adult. The mother should have had an open conversation with Ben before pursuing a relationship with Joe, especially since Joe is Ben's friend. \n\nThe mother might be in a vulnerable position, being alone for a long time and finding a new connection. But the fact remains that the relationship could be seen as inappropriate due to the parent-child relationship and the existing friendship between Ben and Joe. Even though Ben is an adult, the mother's role as a parent could influence Joe's perception of the relationship, especially if they work together. \n\nAnother angle: The mother introduced Joe to the band to help her son, which was a good intention. However, forming a romantic relationship with Joe after that might cross a boundary that Ben didn't expect. The mother's actions could be seen as taking advantage of the situation where she met Joe through her son's project. It's about consent and the son's comfort. Even if the mother didn't intend to date Joe, the son might feel betrayed if she starts a relationship with someone he's close to. \n\nSo, the mother's actions might be considered wrong because she didn't communicate with her son about her feelings for Joe before starting the relationship. The son's reaction is a factor here, and the mother should respect his feelings. Even if the relationship is consensual, the dynamics of the parent-son relationship can make this a complex situation. The answer might lean towards the mother being in the wrong (A) because she didn't consider her son's feelings and the potential for a conflict of interest or emotional impact on him. But I should check if there are other factors. For example, if the mother and Joe's relationship is purely consensual and there's no work-related conflict, maybe it's not wrong. However, given that they met through the son's project and the son is still dependent on the mother in some way (even if he's 21), the mother's role as a parent might make this inappropriate regardless of the son's age.\n"
