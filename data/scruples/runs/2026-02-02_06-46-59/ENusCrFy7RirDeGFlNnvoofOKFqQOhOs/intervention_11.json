His father was never really in the picture, so I was a single mother for the most part. Now I'm 38 and my son \"Ben\" is 21. He's been suffering from depression the past couple of years. I take him to therapy every week and he seems to be getting better but he's always been an introverted kid, so he seems lonely most days. When he was in high school, he was in a band but that quickly disbanded after one of the members graduated high school and went off to college. I recently made a suggestion for him to maybe start up a band again. To my surprise, he was excited about the idea but didn't really know where to start. I suggested he make posters to advertise and maybe place them around his campus. He got to work right away and showed me a flyer he had made. I asked if he wanted me to put it up on the bulletin board at my work place and he agreed.\n\nAs I was posting up the flyer on the board the next day, a colleague \"Joe\" walked up beside me and noticed the flyer (he's 29). I never really talked to Joe in the past because we work in different departments but I recognized his face and knew of him through other colleagues. We started talking about the band and Joe said he sings and plays his guitar every now and then. I told him he should audition and we both laughed about it, but toward the end of our conversation, he seemed interested, so I ripped off the part of the flyer that had Ben's phone number and gave it to him in case he wanted more information.\n\nLong story short, he audition and ended up in the band. The band consists of Ben, Joe, and two other people (both go to school with Ben). I'll admit, it was weird having Joe over at our place at first because we were colleagues and never hung out outside of work or work events, but I didn't mind it because Ben seemed happy and talks a lot about Joe (the two hang out often).\n\nA week ago, Joe was supposed to come over and work on some lyrics with Ben, but Ben was running late, so I invited Joe inside for a cup of coffee. We started chatting about work and complaining about our supervisors to each other, which was really nice to do because I haven't been able to vent to any of my other colleagues about work stress. We talked about the band and he played a sample of a song they were working on, which sounded similar to a song I had heard before but couldn't remember the name of. He asked for my number so that I could send him the song if I ended up remembering. I sent him the song that night and we've been texting all week since then. I enjoy talking to him a lot and it honestly feels like a stupid high school crush (I haven't seriously dated anyone since I was with Ben's father). Yesterday Ben found out I'd been texting Joe and got upset, saying that it's weird and that I can't date his friend. He compared it to \"what if you dated Matt\" (his 21 yr old friend since middle school). I don't think it's the same situation though. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong for dating their son's friend. The situation is a bit complex, so I need to break it down carefully.\n\nFirst, the key facts: The mother is 38, her son Ben is 21. She became a single mom at 17. Ben has been dealing with depression and is introverted, so making friends might be tough for him. The band situation came up when she suggested he start a band again. She posted the flyer at her workplace, where a colleague Joe (29) saw it, audited, and joined the band. Initially, it was just professional, but after some casual interactions, like a coffee meet and texting about a song, the mother started dating Joe. Ben found out and is upset, comparing it to dating his friend Matt, but the mother feels it's different.\n\nNow, considering the dynamics. The mother and Joe work together, in different departments. They didn't have a prior social relationship. The son is 21, so an adult, and the mother isn't the one who initiated the band idea. She facilitated it by posting the flyer. The initial introduction was for her son's benefit, but then Joe and the mother started interacting more personally. The mother sent him a song, and they began texting. Then she started dating him. The son is upset about this relationship because he sees Joe as a friend, and it's uncomfortable for him.\n\nLegal and ethical considerations: There's no age of consent issue here since both are adults. However, workplace relationships can be tricky, especially if there's a power dynamic or if it's not handled discreetly. The mother gave Joe her son's number, and Joe was part of the band where the son was a member. The son might feel that the mother is overstepping by dating someone he's close to, which can be a sensitive topic even between adults and their parents.\n\nFrom the son's perspective, this must feel invasive. The mother was involved in connecting him with a band member, and then she starts dating that person. It can create a conflict of interest or a sense of betrayal, even if the mother's intentions were good. The son is in a vulnerable position with depression and being introverted, so this situation might add to his stress. The mother's actions could be seen as a breach of the son's personal space and boundaries, even though she's not doing it maliciously.\n\nOn the other hand, the mother is an adult and has the right to date whomever she chooses. The relationship between her and Joe started after the band was formed, and it's not clear if there was any prior inappropriate interaction. She might feel lonely and have a genuine connection with Joe. But the way things unfolded\u2014starting from a professional setting and then moving into personal\u2014could be problematic. Also, the fact that she used her son's band flyer to connect with Joe, even if it was just the phone number, could be a point of contention.\n\nThe son's reaction is valid because it's uncomfortable for him. Even if the mother isn't at fault in terms of legality, the emotional impact on her son is significant. She might need to consider his feelings and perhaps take a step back to avoid causing him further distress, especially given his history with depression. But whether she's in the wrong depends on intentions and how the relationship developed. If she genuinely didn't mean to overstep and the relationship was a natural progression, maybe she's not in the wrong. However, the initial action of connecting Joe to her son's band and then developing a relationship with him could be seen as using her role as a mother to get closer to someone her son is involved with, which could be problematic.\n\nI need to weigh the mother's right to date against the potential harm to her son. The answer isn't black and white, but the son's feelings are important here. The mother might be in the wrong if she didn't consider her son's emotional state and the boundaries of their relationship. But if the relationship was consensual and the mother acted without overstepping, maybe she's not. The key here is the son's reaction and the context of their relationship. It's a situation where the mother might need to be more considerate of her son's perspective, but the question is whether she is objectively in the wrong. Since both are adults and the mother isn't in a position of authority over Joe (assuming they are peers at work), maybe she's not in the wrong. However, the way the relationship started through her son's activities could make it feel like a conflict of interest. The answer might be B (No), but I'm not sure. I need to think more about the nuances.\n"
