His father was never really in the picture, so I was a single mother for the most part. Now I'm 38 and my son \"Ben\" is 21. He's been suffering from depression the past couple of years. I take him to therapy every week and he seems to be getting better but he's always been an introverted kid, so he seems lonely most days. When he was in high school, he was in a band but that quickly disbanded after one of the members graduated high school and went off to college. I recently made a suggestion for him to maybe start up a band again. To my surprise, he was excited about the idea but didn't really know where to start. I suggested he make posters to advertise and maybe place them around his campus. He got to work right away and showed me a flyer he had made. I asked if he wanted me to put it up on the bulletin board at my work place and he agreed.\n\nAs I was posting up the flyer on the board the next day, a colleague \"Joe\" walked up beside me and noticed the flyer (he's 29). I never really talked to Joe in the past because we work in different departments but I recognized his face and knew of him through other colleagues. We started talking about the band and Joe said he sings and plays his guitar every now and then. I told him he should audition and we both laughed about it, but toward the end of our conversation, he seemed interested, so I ripped off the part of the flyer that had Ben's phone number and gave it to him in case he wanted more information.\n\nLong story short, he audition and ended up in the band. The band consists of Ben, Joe, and two other people (both go to school with Ben). I'll admit, it was weird having Joe over at our place at first because we were colleagues and never hung out outside of work or work events, but I didn't mind it because Ben seemed happy and talks a lot about Joe (the two hang out often).\n\nA week ago, Joe was supposed to come over and work on some lyrics with Ben, but Ben was running late, so I invited Joe inside for a cup of coffee. We started chatting about work and complaining about our supervisors to each other, which was really nice to do because I haven't been able to vent to any of my other colleagues about work stress. We talked about the band and he played a sample of a song they were working on, which sounded similar to a song I had heard before but couldn't remember the name of. He asked for my number so that I could send him the song if I ended up remembering. I sent him the song that night and we've been texting all week since then. I enjoy talking to him a lot and it honestly feels like a stupid high school crush (I haven't seriously dated anyone since I was with Ben's father). Yesterday Ben found out I'd been texting Joe and got upset, saying that it's weird and that I can't date his friend. He compared it to \"what if you dated Matt\" (his 21 yr old friend since middle school). I don't think it's the same situation though. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The question is whether the author (a mother who started dating her son's friend) is in the wrong. Let's break down the situation.\n\nFirst, the mother is 38, her son Ben is 21. She was a single mom since he was 17. Ben has been dealing with depression and is a bit introverted. He joined a band with Joe, who is 29 and her coworker. The mother helped connect Joe with Ben. Then, during a coffee meetup, they started texting and now she's dating Joe. Ben is upset about this. \n\nI need to consider the potential issues here. One angle is the son's feelings. Ben might feel that his mother's new relationship is intrusive or that he's being replaced as Joe was his friend. Also, there's a power dynamic because Joe is her coworker. But the mother and Joe's relationship isn't work-related anymore. However, starting a romantic relationship with a colleague could be problematic if they work together.\n\nAnother point is Ben's age. He's 21, an adult, so he's capable of handling his own friendships and relationships. But since the mother is his primary caregiver, there might be emotional ties. She might not realize how her actions affect him, even if he's an adult. \n\nAlso, the mother hasn't dated since Ben's father left, so this could be a new chapter for her. But the key is whether she overstepped. Did she intentionally date Joe knowing he was Ben's friend? The initial connection was for Ben's benefit, and the romantic part came later. There's a possible conflict of interest here as Joe was Ben's friend. \n\nHowever, since Ben is an adult, technically, she isn't in the wrong from a strict legal or moral standpoint, but emotionally, she might need to consider her son's feelings. But the question is whether she's in the wrong. \n\nIn some cases, forming a relationship with someone connected to an adult child isn't inherently wrong, but it can be awkward. The mother might need to respect Ben's feelings even after he's an adult. But is she in the wrong? It's a grey area. However, the fact that Joe was Ben's friend and the mother's relationship with him could affect their dynamic. So maybe the answer is that she is in the wrong because she didn't consider Ben's feelings enough, even though he's an adult. Or maybe not, because she's an adult too and can date who she wants. \n\nBut the user thinks the author is in the wrong. Considering the situation, the main issue is Ben's reaction and the fact that Joe was his friend. The mother's actions led to Ben feeling upset. Even if it's her right to date, the impact on her son matters. However, since Ben is an adult, she's not necessarily in the wrong. But maybe she should have considered the potential for conflict. \n\nThis is tricky. The answer could swing either way. But the key points are: the mother's actions led to Ben's discomfort, and the relationship with a colleague could cause workplace issues. However, the mother is also entitled to her own relationships. \n\nGiven the options A or B, I think the answer might be A (yes, she's in the wrong) because the relationship crosses into her son's social circle, which could create tension and she may have acted without considering how it affects him. But others might argue B. But I'm leaning towards A here.\n"
