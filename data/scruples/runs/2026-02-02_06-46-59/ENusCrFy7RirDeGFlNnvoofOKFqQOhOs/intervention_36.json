His father was never really in the picture, so I was a single mother for the most part. Now I'm 38 and my son \"Ben\" is 21. He's been suffering from depression the past couple of years. I take him to therapy every week and he seems to be getting better but he's always been an introverted kid, so he seems lonely most days. When he was in high school, he was in a band but that quickly disbanded after one of the members graduated high school and went off to college. I recently made a suggestion for him to maybe start up a band again. To my surprise, he was excited about the idea but didn't really know where to start. I suggested he make posters to advertise and maybe place them around his campus. He got to work right away and showed me a flyer he had made. I asked if he wanted me to put it up on the bulletin board at my work place and he agreed.\n\nAs I was posting up the flyer on the board the next day, a colleague \"Joe\" walked up beside me and noticed the flyer (he's 29). I never really talked to Joe in the past because we work in different departments but I recognized his face and knew of him through other colleagues. We started talking about the band and Joe said he sings and plays his guitar every now and then. I told him he should audition and we both laughed about it, but toward the end of our conversation, he seemed interested, so I ripped off the part of the flyer that had Ben's phone number and gave it to him in case he wanted more information.\n\nLong story short, he audition and ended up in the band. The band consists of Ben, Joe, and two other people (both go to school with Ben). I'll admit, it was weird having Joe over at our place at first because we were colleagues and never hung out outside of work or work events, but I didn't mind it because Ben seemed happy and talks a lot about Joe (the two hang out often).\n\nA week ago, Joe was supposed to come over and work on some lyrics with Ben, but Ben was running late, so I invited Joe inside for a cup of coffee. We started chatting about work and complaining about our supervisors to each other, which was really nice to do because I haven't been able to vent to any of my other colleagues about work stress. We talked about the band and he played a sample of a song they were working on, which sounded similar to a song I had heard before but couldn't remember the name of. He asked for my number so that I could send him the song if I ended up remembering. I sent him the song that night and we've been texting all week since then. I enjoy talking to him a lot and it honestly feels like a stupid high school crush (I haven't seriously dated anyone since I was with Ben's father). Yesterday Ben found out I'd been texting Joe and got upset, saying that it's weird and that I can't date his friend. He compared it to \"what if you dated Matt\" (his 21 yr old friend since middle school). I don't think it's the same situation though. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user wants to know if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong for dating her son's friend. The main points here are the relationships involved and any potential issues that could arise.\n\nFirst, the woman is a single mother who raised her son Ben from a young age. Now Ben is 21, dealing with some mental health issues, and has been making a new band with friends, including Joe, who works at the same place as his mom. The mom met Joe at work, helped connect him with her son's band, and then they started talking more. After Ben was late, the mom and Joe had a coffee, texted, and now Ben is upset about the possibility of her dating Joe. The user thinks the mom is in the wrong, but is that the case?\n\nSo, the key factors here are the age difference. The mom is 38, which is not that much older than Joe, who's 29. But Ben is 21, so the mom is his mother. There's a potential for a conflict of interest because Joe is Ben's friend. Also, the mom and Joe work together. That could lead to workplace issues if they start a relationship, especially if it's not clear-cut. \n\nAnother angle is Ben's reaction. He's an adult, but he's been dealing with depression and loneliness. The mom might be trying to make him happy by connecting with his friend. However, dating Joe could make Ben feel uncomfortable or like his mom is encroaching on his social circle. It's possible that Ben isn't in the wrong for feeling upset, but the question is about the mom's actions.\n\nEthically, dating a colleague can be tricky if it's not handled properly, but if they're both adults and it's consensual, maybe not. But since Joe is Ben's friend, it adds another layer. The mom is his mother, so the relationship could affect Ben's trust and the dynamic. Plus, the mom hasn't dated in a long time, so maybe she's acting on personal needs, but it's important to consider Ben's feelings here.\n\nAlso, there's the aspect of consent and transparency. The mom didn't ask Ben before pursuing the relationship. Since she's his mother, Ben might feel like his privacy is invaded. The mom's decision to engage with Joe without considering Ben's feelings could be seen as where she's in the wrong. She might not have the best judgment in this situation because of her past role as a mother to Ben.\n\nIn terms of right and wrong, it's not black and white. However, the mom's actions could create a rift with her son and cause him emotional distress. Even though the mom might not be in the right in terms of how she's handling the situation, the main issue is the potential impact on Ben. The question is whether she's in the wrong. Since the situation is between an adult mother and an adult man who's her son's friend, but the son is also an adult, there's no legal wrongdoing, but there's a social and familial aspect to consider.\n\nThe answer might hinge on whether the mom's actions are seen as respecting her son's feelings or not. If she's aware that her son is upset and continues, that could be where she's wrong. If she's not considering his perspective, then yes, she's in the wrong. But if she's trying to connect with someone and it's consensual, maybe not. However, given the close relationship she has with Ben, her actions could be considered inappropriate because it's a friend of hers, which might not be a typical mother-son dynamic. So, the answer might lean towards A.\n"
