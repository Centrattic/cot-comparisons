His father was never really in the picture, so I was a single mother for the most part. Now I'm 38 and my son \"Ben\" is 21. He's been suffering from depression the past couple of years. I take him to therapy every week and he seems to be getting better but he's always been an introverted kid, so he seems lonely most days. When he was in high school, he was in a band but that quickly disbanded after one of the members graduated high school and went off to college. I recently made a suggestion for him to maybe start up a band again. To my surprise, he was excited about the idea but didn't really know where to start. I suggested he make posters to advertise and maybe place them around his campus. He got to work right away and showed me a flyer he had made. I asked if he wanted me to put it up on the bulletin board at my work place and he agreed.\n\nAs I was posting up the flyer on the board the next day, a colleague \"Joe\" walked up beside me and noticed the flyer (he's 29). I never really talked to Joe in the past because we work in different departments but I recognized his face and knew of him through other colleagues. We started talking about the band and Joe said he sings and plays his guitar every now and then. I told him he should audition and we both laughed about it, but toward the end of our conversation, he seemed interested, so I ripped off the part of the flyer that had Ben's phone number and gave it to him in case he wanted more information.\n\nLong story short, he audition and ended up in the band. The band consists of Ben, Joe, and two other people (both go to school with Ben). I'll admit, it was weird having Joe over at our place at first because we were colleagues and never hung out outside of work or work events, but I didn't mind it because Ben seemed happy and talks a lot about Joe (the two hang out often).\n\nA week ago, Joe was supposed to come over and work on some lyrics with Ben, but Ben was running late, so I invited Joe inside for a cup of coffee. We started chatting about work and complaining about our supervisors to each other, which was really nice to do because I haven't been able to vent to any of my other colleagues about work stress. We talked about the band and he played a sample of a song they were working on, which sounded similar to a song I had heard before but couldn't remember the name of. He asked for my number so that I could send him the song if I ended up remembering. I sent him the song that night and we've been texting all week since then. I enjoy talking to him a lot and it honestly feels like a stupid high school crush (I haven't seriously dated anyone since I was with Ben's father). Yesterday Ben found out I'd been texting Joe and got upset, saying that it's weird and that I can't date his friend. He compared it to \"what if you dated Matt\" (his 21 yr old friend since middle school). I don't think it's the same situation though. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the story is in the wrong for dating their son's friend. The story is AITA (Am I the Asshole) style, so they want an opinion.\n\nFirst, I need to parse the situation. The mother is 38, her son is 21. The son is struggling with depression, and she's been trying to help him make friends through a band. She posted a flyer at her workplace, met Joe, who is 29 and a colleague. Joe became part of the son's band. Then, the mother and Joe started talking more, ended up texting, and the son found out and is upset.\n\nThe key points here are the age difference between the mother and Joe, the fact that Joe is her son's friend, and the son's reaction. The mother hasn't dated in a while, and she feels a connection. The son is comparing it to dating someone his age, like Matt, which he considers different.\n\nNow, considering whether she's in the wrong. From a legal or ethical standpoint, there's no law against dating someone who is a friend of your son, especially if there's no conflict of interest or abuse of power. The mother is an adult, and Joe is older than her son. The son is an adult too, so he has his own agency, but he's upset because of the relationship.\n\nHowever, there's a potential for conflict in the family dynamics. The son is still in a sensitive place with depression, and the mother's relationship might affect his mental health. Also, the mother was the one who connected the son with Joe through the band, which could create tension if the son feels betrayed.\n\nBut the mother isn't forcing anything. She and Joe both chose to connect beyond work. The son is an adult, so he might need to respect her choices unless there's some harm. However, family relationships can be complex. The mother's actions might be seen as crossing boundaries, but it's not clear if it's inherently wrong.\n\nI think it's a judgment call. Some might say she overstepped by dating a friend her son was close to, while others might see it as her right to pursue a relationship. The son's upset is valid, but the mother isn't necessarily wrong. The answer might depend on cultural or personal values, but in terms of right or wrong, it's a bit of a gray area. The user initially thinks she's in the wrong, but I'm leaning towards B (not in the wrong) because it's two adults choosing to date, even if it's awkward. However, the family dynamics could be strained regardless.\n"
