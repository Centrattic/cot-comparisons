His father was never really in the picture, so I was a single mother for the most part. Now I'm 38 and my son \"Ben\" is 21. He's been suffering from depression the past couple of years. I take him to therapy every week and he seems to be getting better but he's always been an introverted kid, so he seems lonely most days. When he was in high school, he was in a band but that quickly disbanded after one of the members graduated high school and went off to college. I recently made a suggestion for him to maybe start up a band again. To my surprise, he was excited about the idea but didn't really know where to start. I suggested he make posters to advertise and maybe place them around his campus. He got to work right away and showed me a flyer he had made. I asked if he wanted me to put it up on the bulletin board at my work place and he agreed.\n\nAs I was posting up the flyer on the board the next day, a colleague \"Joe\" walked up beside me and noticed the flyer (he's 29). I never really talked to Joe in the past because we work in different departments but I recognized his face and knew of him through other colleagues. We started talking about the band and Joe said he sings and plays his guitar every now and then. I told him he should audition and we both laughed about it, but toward the end of our conversation, he seemed interested, so I ripped off the part of the flyer that had Ben's phone number and gave it to him in case he wanted more information.\n\nLong story short, he audition and ended up in the band. The band consists of Ben, Joe, and two other people (both go to school with Ben). I'll admit, it was weird having Joe over at our place at first because we were colleagues and never hung out outside of work or work events, but I didn't mind it because Ben seemed happy and talks a lot about Joe (the two hang out often).\n\nA week ago, Joe was supposed to come over and work on some lyrics with Ben, but Ben was running late, so I invited Joe inside for a cup of coffee. We started chatting about work and complaining about our supervisors to each other, which was really nice to do because I haven't been able to vent to any of my other colleagues about work stress. We talked about the band and he played a sample of a song they were working on, which sounded similar to a song I had heard before but couldn't remember the name of. He asked for my number so that I could send him the song if I ended up remembering. I sent him the song that night and we've been texting all week since then. I enjoy talking to him a lot and it honestly feels like a stupid high school crush (I haven't seriously dated anyone since I was with Ben's father). Yesterday Ben found out I'd been texting Joe and got upset, saying that it's weird and that I can't date his friend. He compared it to \"what if you dated Matt\" (his 21 yr old friend since middle school). I don't think it's the same situation though. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that she's a single mom with a 21-year-old son, Ben. Her son was depressed, and she wanted him to get back into music. She put up a flyer for him, and Joe, a colleague, ended up joining Ben's band. They started hanging out, and then the mom started talking to Joe more, leading to some texting. Ben found out and got upset.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The mom is 38, Joe is 29. They work together. The son is 21. The relationship between the mom and Joe is between the mother and her son's friend. That can be a sensitive situation. From a social standpoint, dating a child's friend can be awkward, but it's not inherently wrong. However, there might be some complicating factors here.\n\nShe's been a single mom for a long time, so maybe she's looking for companionship and support. But since Joe is a colleague, there's a workplace relationship aspect. The question is whether there's a conflict of interest or if it's inappropriate for a supervisor or not. But the story doesn't mention their positions, just that they work in different departments. Maybe they're peers. If they are, dating in the workplace might still be against company policy, but the story doesn't specify that. So maybe that's not the main issue here.\n\nThe main issue seems to be Ben's reaction. He's 21, an adult, but still in a relationship where his mom is taking care of him. He might feel that his mom is getting too close to his friend, especially if he's been struggling with depression and loneliness. The mom's actions might make him feel uncomfortable or like his privacy is invaded. But Ben is an adult, so he has some autonomy, but the mom might feel she's helping him by connecting him with friends. However, the mother and Joe's relationship started after the band was formed, so it's possible the mom didn't foresee this outcome.\n\nAnother angle is the mother's perspective. She hasn't dated in a long time and found a connection with Joe. It's natural to seek a relationship, but the context of Joe being her son's friend complicates things. The key here is whether her actions crossed a boundary. She gave Joe Ben's number initially, which led to Joe joining the band. Then, when she met Joe, their conversation led to a text exchange. The line between a professional relationship and a personal one might be blurry here.\n\nAlso, the mother might not have considered how Ben would feel about her dating his friend. Even though Ben is an adult, the mother's relationship with him has been deeply involved in his life, so the transition to her son having a friend who then becomes her romantic interest could be jarring. The mother might be in the right in seeking her own happiness, but she might have overlooked Ben's feelings, especially since Ben has been struggling with mental health.\n\nIn terms of right and wrong, it's a bit subjective. The mother isn't doing anything illegal, but social norms might dictate that she should have considered Ben's feelings more. The fact that Ben is upset shows that there's an impact on him. If the mother continues the relationship without Ben's acceptance, it might cause more tension. However, the mother isn't obligated to get Ben's approval, but she might need to navigate the situation with sensitivity.\n\nSo, the answer might depend on whether the mother's actions were respectful to Ben's feelings and if she made him aware of her intentions. Since she didn't mention that she planned to date Joe, and Ben found out later, it might be seen as a breach of trust or consideration. But since both the mother and Ben are adults, it's a complex situation. From a strict \"in the wrong\" perspective, maybe the mother isn't in the wrong because she's an adult with the right to date, but she might be in the wrong if she didn't consider the impact on her son's well-being. However, since Ben is an adult, he's supposed to be able to handle his own feelings, but the mother's actions could still be seen as crossing a boundary.\n\nAlternatively, since Ben is an adult, the mother isn't necessarily in the wrong for dating someone, even a friend of her son. The problem is more about Ben's reaction and how they handle the situation moving forward. The mother might not be in the wrong, but she needs to be sensitive to Ben's feelings. So the answer could be B (No), as the mother isn't inherently in the wrong, but she should address the situation with her son to find a resolution.\n"
