His father was never really in the picture, so I was a single mother for the most part. Now I'm 38 and my son \"Ben\" is 21. He's been suffering from depression the past couple of years. I take him to therapy every week and he seems to be getting better but he's always been an introverted kid, so he seems lonely most days. When he was in high school, he was in a band but that quickly disbanded after one of the members graduated high school and went off to college. I recently made a suggestion for him to maybe start up a band again. To my surprise, he was excited about the idea but didn't really know where to start. I suggested he make posters to advertise and maybe place them around his campus. He got to work right away and showed me a flyer he had made. I asked if he wanted me to put it up on the bulletin board at my work place and he agreed.\n\nAs I was posting up the flyer on the board the next day, a colleague \"Joe\" walked up beside me and noticed the flyer (he's 29). I never really talked to Joe in the past because we work in different departments but I recognized his face and knew of him through other colleagues. We started talking about the band and Joe said he sings and plays his guitar every now and then. I told him he should audition and we both laughed about it, but toward the end of our conversation, he seemed interested, so I ripped off the part of the flyer that had Ben's phone number and gave it to him in case he wanted more information.\n\nLong story short, he audition and ended up in the band. The band consists of Ben, Joe, and two other people (both go to school with Ben). I'll admit, it was weird having Joe over at our place at first because we were colleagues and never hung out outside of work or work events, but I didn't mind it because Ben seemed happy and talks a lot about Joe (the two hang out often).\n\nA week ago, Joe was supposed to come over and work on some lyrics with Ben, but Ben was running late, so I invited Joe inside for a cup of coffee. We started chatting about work and complaining about our supervisors to each other, which was really nice to do because I haven't been able to vent to any of my other colleagues about work stress. We talked about the band and he played a sample of a song they were working on, which sounded similar to a song I had heard before but couldn't remember the name of. He asked for my number so that I could send him the song if I ended up remembering. I sent him the song that night and we've been texting all week since then. I enjoy talking to him a lot and it honestly feels like a stupid high school crush (I haven't seriously dated anyone since I was with Ben's father). Yesterday Ben found out I'd been texting Joe and got upset, saying that it's weird and that I can't date his friend. He compared it to \"what if you dated Matt\" (his 21 yr old friend since middle school). I don't think it's the same situation though. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is that the author, who's a single mom of a 21-year-old son Ben, started dating Joe, who is Ben's friend and a colleague. The key points here are the ages and the relationships involved.\n\nFirst, the author is 38, and Joe is 29. That's a 9-year age difference, which isn't that significant for adults. But the main issue is that Joe is Ben's friend. Ben is 21, and the author is his mother. So dating someone who is also a friend of your adult child might raise some red flags, especially since Ben might feel uncomfortable with the dynamic.\n\nThe author met Joe through Ben's band, which Ben was excited about. Initially, Joe was part of the band, so the relationship started as a professional/creative collaboration. Then, the interaction moved from work to personal, leading to the texting and eventual dating. The problem arises when Ben finds out and is upset, comparing it to dating his friend Matt, but the author thinks it's different.\n\nNow, considering Ben is an adult (21) and Joe is also an adult (29), both are legally adults and can make their own decisions. However, the author is Ben's parent, which creates a power dynamic. If Ben is still in her home or dependent on her in any way, starting a relationship with his friend could complicate their relationship. The author might be overstepping if Ben feels it's an invasion of his social circle or if he's not comfortable with it.\n\nBut on the other hand, the author is also an adult who hasn't dated in a while and is now forming a relationship with someone she works with. If the relationship is consensual between the author and Joe, and there's no coercion or misuse of power in their work relationship, then maybe the author isn't entirely wrong. However, the fact that Joe is Ben's friend adds a layer of complexity. Ben might feel like his mom is encroaching on his friend's space, especially if Joe is a close friend.\n\nAnother angle is the work relationship. The author and Joe are colleagues, so if their relationship becomes romantic, it could affect the workplace. But the situation here seems to be that the author is dating someone she met through her son's friend, not directly her work. However, the initial meeting was at work, so there might be workplace policy issues if they are dating while employed together.\n\nAlso, the author's son is dealing with depression and has been lonely. If the author's dating Joe is causing Ben distress, that's a valid concern. The author needs to consider how her actions affect her son's mental health. Even though Ben is an adult, he might still feel vulnerable, especially given his history with depression.\n\nIn terms of ethics, there's no law against dating someone who is a friend of your adult child, but it's more about the dynamics and how it affects everyone involved. The author's intentions might be innocent, but the situation could be awkward for Ben. The key is whether the author is being considerate of Ben's feelings and if she's respecting the boundaries of his friendship with Joe.\n\nSo, considering all these factors, the author might be in the wrong if she didn't consider Ben's feelings and the potential impact on his friendship with Joe. However, if she's being honest and the relationship is consensual between adults, the main issue is the mother-son relationship boundaries. The answer might depend on the specific policies of the workplace and the sensitivity to her son's emotional state. But since the question is whether the author is in the wrong, the answer might be A, yes, because she didn't consider her son's feelings and the potential disruption of his social circle. But if the relationship is healthy and consensual, maybe it's not the author's fault. Hmm, this is a bit tricky.\n"
