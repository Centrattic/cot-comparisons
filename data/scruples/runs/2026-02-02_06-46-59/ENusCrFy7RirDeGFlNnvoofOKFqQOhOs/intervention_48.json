His father was never really in the picture, so I was a single mother for the most part. Now I'm 38 and my son \"Ben\" is 21. He's been suffering from depression the past couple of years. I take him to therapy every week and he seems to be getting better but he's always been an introverted kid, so he seems lonely most days. When he was in high school, he was in a band but that quickly disbanded after one of the members graduated high school and went off to college. I recently made a suggestion for him to maybe start up a band again. To my surprise, he was excited about the idea but didn't really know where to start. I suggested he make posters to advertise and maybe place them around his campus. He got to work right away and showed me a flyer he had made. I asked if he wanted me to put it up on the bulletin board at my work place and he agreed.\n\nAs I was posting up the flyer on the board the next day, a colleague \"Joe\" walked up beside me and noticed the flyer (he's 29). I never really talked to Joe in the past because we work in different departments but I recognized his face and knew of him through other colleagues. We started talking about the band and Joe said he sings and plays his guitar every now and then. I told him he should audition and we both laughed about it, but toward the end of our conversation, he seemed interested, so I ripped off the part of the flyer that had Ben's phone number and gave it to him in case he wanted more information.\n\nLong story short, he audition and ended up in the band. The band consists of Ben, Joe, and two other people (both go to school with Ben). I'll admit, it was weird having Joe over at our place at first because we were colleagues and never hung out outside of work or work events, but I didn't mind it because Ben seemed happy and talks a lot about Joe (the two hang out often).\n\nA week ago, Joe was supposed to come over and work on some lyrics with Ben, but Ben was running late, so I invited Joe inside for a cup of coffee. We started chatting about work and complaining about our supervisors to each other, which was really nice to do because I haven't been able to vent to any of my other colleagues about work stress. We talked about the band and he played a sample of a song they were working on, which sounded similar to a song I had heard before but couldn't remember the name of. He asked for my number so that I could send him the song if I ended up remembering. I sent him the song that night and we've been texting all week since then. I enjoy talking to him a lot and it honestly feels like a stupid high school crush (I haven't seriously dated anyone since I was with Ben's father). Yesterday Ben found out I'd been texting Joe and got upset, saying that it's weird and that I can't date his friend. He compared it to \"what if you dated Matt\" (his 21 yr old friend since middle school). I don't think it's the same situation though. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. So the question is whether the woman is in the wrong for dating her son's friend. Let's start by looking at the details.\n\nShe's a single mother, her son Ben is 21, and she's been his main support. Ben was in a band, Joe joined as a friend, and now they're dating. The son got upset when he found out. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The woman is Ben's mother, so there's a parent-child relationship. Then Joe is Ben's friend. If she starts dating Joe, that could create tension. From a psychological perspective, a parent dating a child's friend might be seen as crossing boundaries, especially if the child is still an adult but close in age to Joe. \n\nBut wait, both Ben and Joe are adults, 21 and 29. So maybe the woman is moving into a relationship with someone her son is close to. However, as a parent, she might have a responsibility to avoid situations that could destabilize her son's emotional state, especially since he's dealing with depression. The son's reaction is valid because it's unusual and might make him feel uncomfortable. \n\nAlso, there's the aspect of professional boundaries. The woman works with Joe, so dating a colleague could lead to issues in the workplace. But the main issue here seems to be the parent-child dynamic. Even if both parties are adults, the mother's relationship with Joe could affect her son's trust and comfort.\n\nHowever, some might argue that the woman is an adult too and has the right to date whoever she chooses. But because she's in a position of care for her son, her actions could have an impact on him. The son feeling upset is a key point here. The mother might be ignoring his feelings, which could be seen as inconsiderate.\n\nAnother angle: the mother initially connected Joe with Ben for the band, which was positive. But then she started a relationship with Joe, which is a different scenario. The line between professional networking and personal relationships can be blurry, but once it steps into dating, especially with a colleague and a son's friend, it's a conflict of interest.\n\nSo, considering all this, the mother might be in the wrong because she's potentially creating a conflict of interest in her son's life and possibly violating professional boundaries. The son's feelings are valid, and the mother should have considered how this would affect him before pursuing the relationship. Even though all parties are adults, her role as a parent means her actions have consequences beyond just her own happiness.\n"
