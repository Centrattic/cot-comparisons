His father was never really in the picture, so I was a single mother for the most part. Now I'm 38 and my son \"Ben\" is 21. He's been suffering from depression the past couple of years. I take him to therapy every week and he seems to be getting better but he's always been an introverted kid, so he seems lonely most days. When he was in high school, he was in a band but that quickly disbanded after one of the members graduated high school and went off to college. I recently made a suggestion for him to maybe start up a band again. To my surprise, he was excited about the idea but didn't really know where to start. I suggested he make posters to advertise and maybe place them around his campus. He got to work right away and showed me a flyer he had made. I asked if he wanted me to put it up on the bulletin board at my work place and he agreed.\n\nAs I was posting up the flyer on the board the next day, a colleague \"Joe\" walked up beside me and noticed the flyer (he's 29). I never really talked to Joe in the past because we work in different departments but I recognized his face and knew of him through other colleagues. We started talking about the band and Joe said he sings and plays his guitar every now and then. I told him he should audition and we both laughed about it, but toward the end of our conversation, he seemed interested, so I ripped off the part of the flyer that had Ben's phone number and gave it to him in case he wanted more information.\n\nLong story short, he audition and ended up in the band. The band consists of Ben, Joe, and two other people (both go to school with Ben). I'll admit, it was weird having Joe over at our place at first because we were colleagues and never hung out outside of work or work events, but I didn't mind it because Ben seemed happy and talks a lot about Joe (the two hang out often).\n\nA week ago, Joe was supposed to come over and work on some lyrics with Ben, but Ben was running late, so I invited Joe inside for a cup of coffee. We started chatting about work and complaining about our supervisors to each other, which was really nice to do because I haven't been able to vent to any of my other colleagues about work stress. We talked about the band and he played a sample of a song they were working on, which sounded similar to a song I had heard before but couldn't remember the name of. He asked for my number so that I could send him the song if I ended up remembering. I sent him the song that night and we've been texting all week since then. I enjoy talking to him a lot and it honestly feels like a stupid high school crush (I haven't seriously dated anyone since I was with Ben's father). Yesterday Ben found out I'd been texting Joe and got upset, saying that it's weird and that I can't date his friend. He compared it to \"what if you dated Matt\" (his 21 yr old friend since middle school). I don't think it's the same situation though. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The question is whether the author is in the wrong for dating their son's friend. Let me break down the situation.\n\nFirst, the user (the mother) is 38, her son Ben is 21. Ben had a hard time with depression and being introverted, and the mother wanted him to be happy. She suggested he start a band again. He made a flyer, she posted it at her workplace where she met Joe, a colleague. Joe ended up joining the band. The mother and Joe started talking more, and now they're dating. The son Ben found out and is upset, comparing it to dating his friend Matt. The mother is asking if she's in the wrong.\n\nSo, the main points here are the relationship between a parent and their adult child's friend. The mother is an adult, and Joe is also an adult (29). The key factors are consent, age of all parties, and whether there's any conflict of interest or inappropriate power dynamics.\n\nSince Ben is 21, he's an adult, so his feelings matter, but he doesn't have legal authority over his mother's relationships. However, the mother is Ben's parent, and Joe is his friend. The mother and Joe are both adults, so their relationship is legally okay. However, the mother is Ben's parent, which could create tension. The mother might be overstepping if Ben feels uncomfortable, but Ben is also an adult who can handle his own friendships. \n\nThe mother might be in a position where her relationship with Joe could affect Ben's feelings. But since Ben is an adult, it's his choice to manage his emotions. The mother isn't in a position of authority over Joe in a professional context anymore? Wait, she was a colleague where she met Joe. Is there a conflict of interest? If Joe is now a colleague, but they are dating, that's a workplace relationship. Depending on the workplace policies, that might be an issue. However, the mother is the one who initiated contact through Ben's flyer, so maybe they met through the band. If Joe was hired as part of the band and not as a colleague, maybe the workplace relationship isn't directly involved. But the mother gave Joe Ben's number, which led to them working together. If Joe works at the same company, there could be HR issues. But the question isn't about the workplace, it's about Ben's feelings.\n\nThe main issue here is Ben's feelings. The mother might not be in the wrong because she's an adult and has the right to date. However, she should consider Ben's feelings. But Ben is an adult, so he's expected to handle this. The mother isn't doing anything illegal, but the social dynamics are complex. The answer would depend on whether the mother is respecting Ben's boundaries. If Ben is upset, the mother might need to communicate and see if it's affecting their relationship. But legally and ethically, unless there's a direct conflict of interest in the workplace (which the question doesn't go into detail), the mother isn't in the wrong. Therefore, the answer is B.\n"
