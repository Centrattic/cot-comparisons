His father was never really in the picture, so I was a single mother for the most part. Now I'm 38 and my son \"Ben\" is 21. He's been suffering from depression the past couple of years. I take him to therapy every week and he seems to be getting better but he's always been an introverted kid, so he seems lonely most days. When he was in high school, he was in a band but that quickly disbanded after one of the members graduated high school and went off to college. I recently made a suggestion for him to maybe start up a band again. To my surprise, he was excited about the idea but didn't really know where to start. I suggested he make posters to advertise and maybe place them around his campus. He got to work right away and showed me a flyer he had made. I asked if he wanted me to put it up on the bulletin board at my work place and he agreed.\n\nAs I was posting up the flyer on the board the next day, a colleague \"Joe\" walked up beside me and noticed the flyer (he's 29). I never really talked to Joe in the past because we work in different departments but I recognized his face and knew of him through other colleagues. We started talking about the band and Joe said he sings and plays his guitar every now and then. I told him he should audition and we both laughed about it, but toward the end of our conversation, he seemed interested, so I ripped off the part of the flyer that had Ben's phone number and gave it to him in case he wanted more information.\n\nLong story short, he audition and ended up in the band. The band consists of Ben, Joe, and two other people (both go to school with Ben). I'll admit, it was weird having Joe over at our place at first because we were colleagues and never hung out outside of work or work events, but I didn't mind it because Ben seemed happy and talks a lot about Joe (the two hang out often).\n\nA week ago, Joe was supposed to come over and work on some lyrics with Ben, but Ben was running late, so I invited Joe inside for a cup of coffee. We started chatting about work and complaining about our supervisors to each other, which was really nice to do because I haven't been able to vent to any of my other colleagues about work stress. We talked about the band and he played a sample of a song they were working on, which sounded similar to a song I had heard before but couldn't remember the name of. He asked for my number so that I could send him the song if I ended up remembering. I sent him the song that night and we've been texting all week since then. I enjoy talking to him a lot and it honestly feels like a stupid high school crush (I haven't seriously dated anyone since I was with Ben's father). Yesterday Ben found out I'd been texting Joe and got upset, saying that it's weird and that I can't date his friend. He compared it to \"what if you dated Matt\" (his 21 yr old friend since middle school). I don't think it's the same situation though. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The person is asking if the author is in the wrong for dating their son's friend. The backstory is that the mother is a single parent, her son is 21, and she met his friend Joe through the band. They ended up dating, and the son is upset.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The mother was trying to help her son, which is good. She connected with Joe because of the band, which seems like a natural way to meet people. However, the issue arises when she starts dating Joe, who is also the son's friend. \n\nThe son is 21, an adult, so he might have feelings about his mother dating someone he's close with. The mother might be overstepping, even if unintentionally. But the son is also an adult, and maybe he should have a say in this since he's part of their lives. \n\nThere's also the age difference. The mother is 38, Joe is 29. That's a 9-year gap, which isn't huge, but in some contexts could matter. However, both are adults. The fact that they work together adds another layer. If they start dating while working in different departments, that could be a workplace issue. But since they're not in the same department, maybe it's less of a problem. Still, workplace relationships can be tricky, especially if there's a power dynamic, but the question is about the mother-son relationship rather than the workplace.\n\nThe son is upset because he feels it's weird. He compares it to dating his friend Matt. Since Matt is his friend since middle school, maybe the mother's dating Joe is seen as crossing a boundary. However, the mother might not have considered how the son would feel. The son is also dealing with depression, so maybe this situation is adding stress. \n\nThe key points are: the son is an adult, the mother's actions affect his comfort, and the mother may not have considered his feelings. On the other hand, the mother is single and has a right to her own relationships. The question is whether she's wrong for dating Joe despite the son's feelings.\n\nIn terms of moral wrong, it's not illegal, but it's about respect. If the mother is aware of the son's discomfort, she might need to address it. However, the son is an adult and can't control his mother's dating. The mother isn't necessarily in the wrong for wanting a relationship, but she might need to be more sensitive to the son's perspective. \n\nBut since the question is whether she's in the wrong, and considering the son's feelings, maybe the answer is that she is in the wrong because she didn't consider how her actions would affect her son. However, others might argue that since the son is an adult, he should handle it himself. It's a bit of a gray area. The original answer given was A, but I need to decide based on the situation.\n"
