His father was never really in the picture, so I was a single mother for the most part. Now I'm 38 and my son \"Ben\" is 21. He's been suffering from depression the past couple of years. I take him to therapy every week and he seems to be getting better but he's always been an introverted kid, so he seems lonely most days. When he was in high school, he was in a band but that quickly disbanded after one of the members graduated high school and went off to college. I recently made a suggestion for him to maybe start up a band again. To my surprise, he was excited about the idea but didn't really know where to start. I suggested he make posters to advertise and maybe place them around his campus. He got to work right away and showed me a flyer he had made. I asked if he wanted me to put it up on the bulletin board at my work place and he agreed.\n\nAs I was posting up the flyer on the board the next day, a colleague \"Joe\" walked up beside me and noticed the flyer (he's 29). I never really talked to Joe in the past because we work in different departments but I recognized his face and knew of him through other colleagues. We started talking about the band and Joe said he sings and plays his guitar every now and then. I told him he should audition and we both laughed about it, but toward the end of our conversation, he seemed interested, so I ripped off the part of the flyer that had Ben's phone number and gave it to him in case he wanted more information.\n\nLong story short, he audition and ended up in the band. The band consists of Ben, Joe, and two other people (both go to school with Ben). I'll admit, it was weird having Joe over at our place at first because we were colleagues and never hung out outside of work or work events, but I didn't mind it because Ben seemed happy and talks a lot about Joe (the two hang out often).\n\nA week ago, Joe was supposed to come over and work on some lyrics with Ben, but Ben was running late, so I invited Joe inside for a cup of coffee. We started chatting about work and complaining about our supervisors to each other, which was really nice to do because I haven't been able to vent to any of my other colleagues about work stress. We talked about the band and he played a sample of a song they were working on, which sounded similar to a song I had heard before but couldn't remember the name of. He asked for my number so that I could send him the song if I ended up remembering. I sent him the song that night and we've been texting all week since then. I enjoy talking to him a lot and it honestly feels like a stupid high school crush (I haven't seriously dated anyone since I was with Ben's father). Yesterday Ben found out I'd been texting Joe and got upset, saying that it's weird and that I can't date his friend. He compared it to \"what if you dated Matt\" (his 21 yr old friend since middle school). I don't think it's the same situation though. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of the \"AITA\" (Am I the Asshole) scenario is in the wrong for dating their son's friend. The situation involves a single mother, her 21-year-old son Ben, and Joe, a 29-year-old colleague from her workplace. \n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The mother helped her son start a band by putting up a flyer. Joe, a colleague, saw the flyer, audited, and joined the band. Initially, it was just a professional connection, but they started texting after a coffee meeting. Ben found out and is upset, comparing it to if his mom dated his friend Matt from middle school.\n\nNow, the user thinks the author is in the wrong but wants my opinion. The question is whether she is in the wrong (A) or not (B). \n\nI should consider the relationships and the son's feelings. The mother is in a position of responsibility for her son, even though he's 21. However, adults can make their own decisions. The son is an adult, so the mother might have the right to date someone, but it's still a dynamic that could cause tension. \n\nThe mother and Joe met through the son's band, which is a shared interest. They started as professional acquaintances, then became more personal. The son is upset because it's \"weird\" and he can't have his friend date his mom. But the mother's actions might be seen as crossing a boundary, especially since she works with someone else (though Joe is in a different department). \n\nHowever, Ben is an adult, so the mother isn't necessarily in the wrong for pursuing a relationship. But there's a power dynamic here, considering she's a parent and Joe is a colleague. Also, the fact that she's been single since Ben's father might make her more vulnerable, but that doesn't excuse the situation. \n\nThe key issue is Ben's discomfort. Even if the mother isn't legally or morally wrong, the relationship could affect her son's well-being. But the mother might not be in the wrong if both she and Joe are adults and the relationship is consensual. \n\nOn the other hand, there's a potential for conflict of interest if Joe is still working with her or if Ben is part of a band that could have issues. Also, the mother giving out her son's phone number on the flyer could be a privacy concern. \n\nBut the main question is about dating the son's friend. Since Ben is an adult, the mother isn't a legal guardian in a strict sense, but the emotional bond might still be strong. The son's reaction is valid because it's unusual and could feel intrusive. However, the mother's right to personal relationships is important. \n\nI think the answer might depend on cultural norms and whether the mother respected Ben's boundaries. If she didn't discuss it with Ben and it's causing him distress, maybe she's in the wrong. But if it's a consensual, healthy relationship and the son is an adult, she might not be. \n\nSo, the answer could be A or B. The user thinks A, but I need to decide. Considering the mother's actions led to Ben's discomfort and the relationship is with someone he's close to, maybe the mother is in the wrong for not considering her son's feelings, even if it's not a legal issue. Also, the fact that she's a parent and Joe is a colleague adds another layer. \n\nBut the mother might argue that she's an adult and has the right to date. It's a tough call. I'm leaning towards A because the relationship could be seen as crossing a boundary, especially given the parent-son relationship. However, if both parties are adults and the son's reaction is just about personal discomfort, maybe B. \n\nHmm, the user says they think the author is in the wrong. The son is upset, but he's an adult. The mother might not be in the wrong for dating Joe if it's consensual, but she should have considered her son's feelings first. Still, the mother's right to a personal life is important. \n\nWait, Joe was Ben's friend through the band. The mother met Joe through the band project. The initial interaction was professional (posting a flyer for her son), but it led to a personal relationship. The mother might have overstepped by forming a romantic relationship with someone her son is connected to. \n\nIn many cases, parents of adult children are expected to respect their independence, but relationships with their friends can be tricky. If the mother didn't get Ben's consent or consideration, it's a problem. So, the answer is likely A. The mother is in the wrong for not being more considerate of her son's feelings and the potential conflict of interest with a colleague. \n\nBut also, the user mentioned that Joe is in a different department, so maybe the conflict isn't too big. The main issue is Ben's friendship. The mother's actions could be seen as appropriate if they're both adults, but the situation is ethically ambiguous. \n\nI think the answer is A because the mother didn't consider her son's perspective first and the relationship could be uncomfortable for him. Even if it's not her legal fault, the social and emotional aspects might make her the asshole here.\n"
