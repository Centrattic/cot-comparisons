His father was never really in the picture, so I was a single mother for the most part. Now I'm 38 and my son \"Ben\" is 21. He's been suffering from depression the past couple of years. I take him to therapy every week and he seems to be getting better but he's always been an introverted kid, so he seems lonely most days. When he was in high school, he was in a band but that quickly disbanded after one of the members graduated high school and went off to college. I recently made a suggestion for him to maybe start up a band again. To my surprise, he was excited about the idea but didn't really know where to start. I suggested he make posters to advertise and maybe place them around his campus. He got to work right away and showed me a flyer he had made. I asked if he wanted me to put it up on the bulletin board at my work place and he agreed.\n\nAs I was posting up the flyer on the board the next day, a colleague \"Joe\" walked up beside me and noticed the flyer (he's 29). I never really talked to Joe in the past because we work in different departments but I recognized his face and knew of him through other colleagues. We started talking about the band and Joe said he sings and plays his guitar every now and then. I told him he should audition and we both laughed about it, but toward the end of our conversation, he seemed interested, so I ripped off the part of the flyer that had Ben's phone number and gave it to him in case he wanted more information.\n\nLong story short, he audition and ended up in the band. The band consists of Ben, Joe, and two other people (both go to school with Ben). I'll admit, it was weird having Joe over at our place at first because we were colleagues and never hung out outside of work or work events, but I didn't mind it because Ben seemed happy and talks a lot about Joe (the two hang out often).\n\nA week ago, Joe was supposed to come over and work on some lyrics with Ben, but Ben was running late, so I invited Joe inside for a cup of coffee. We started chatting about work and complaining about our supervisors to each other, which was really nice to do because I haven't been able to vent to any of my other colleagues about work stress. We talked about the band and he played a sample of a song they were working on, which sounded similar to a song I had heard before but couldn't remember the name of. He asked for my number so that I could send him the song if I ended up remembering. I sent him the song that night and we've been texting all week since then. I enjoy talking to him a lot and it honestly feels like a stupid high school crush (I haven't seriously dated anyone since I was with Ben's father). Yesterday Ben found out I'd been texting Joe and got upset, saying that it's weird and that I can't date his friend. He compared it to \"what if you dated Matt\" (his 21 yr old friend since middle school). I don't think it's the same situation though. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong for dating their son's friend. The situation involves a single mother whose son, Ben, is 21, and she's 38. The son had some issues with depression and was encouraged to start a band again. Her colleague, Joe, ended up joining the band. Over time, the mother and Joe started talking more, leading to a relationship forming, which the son found upsetting.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The mother is 38, and Joe is 29. The son is 21. The main issue is the mother dating her son's friend. The son feels it's weird, comparing it to dating a close friend from middle school. The mother argues that the situations aren't the same. \n\nLegally, there's no law against an adult dating someone else's friend, unless there's a conflict of interest or power imbalance. Since they are colleagues, maybe there's a workplace policy to consider, but the question is more about moral wrongdoing. \n\nEthically, the mother is in a position where she's a parent, and dating her son's friend could create tension. The son is an adult, so he has his own autonomy, but the mother's actions might affect their relationship. The son's reaction is about feeling that the friendship is being intruded upon, which is a valid concern for any adult. \n\nFrom the mother's perspective, she's been single since before Ben was born, and this might be a new chapter for her. However, the key point is the potential for conflict with her son. Even though Ben is an adult, the mother's role as a parent could complicate the relationship. \n\nI need to assess whether the mother acted inconsiderately. She introduced Joe to the band, and their relationship developed after that. The initial interaction was professional, but once it moved into personal territory, it's about mutual consent between adults. However, the son's discomfort is valid because it's his friend. The mother might not be in the wrong if both she and Joe are adults, but the son's feelings are important too. \n\nThe answer hinges on whether the mother's actions were inappropriate given the context. Since both are adults, and there's no legal issue, the moral stance is more nuanced. The mother might be in the wrong if she didn't consider her son's feelings and the impact on their relationship. But since the son is an adult, he should have some independence in his friendships. However, the mother might not be at fault if the relationship is consensual and respectful. \n\nIn conclusion, there's a balance between the mother's autonomy and the son's feelings. The mother's actions could be seen as inconsiderate, but not necessarily wrong, especially since they're all adults. However, the mother might be in the wrong if she didn't take her son's perspective into account. But given that the son is an adult, maybe she isn't. It's a bit of a gray area, but I think the mother isn't in the wrong because the relationship is between adults and the son's feelings, while valid, don't override the mother's right to date. So the answer might be B.\n"
