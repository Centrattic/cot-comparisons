His father was never really in the picture, so I was a single mother for the most part. Now I'm 38 and my son \"Ben\" is 21. He's been suffering from depression the past couple of years. I take him to therapy every week and he seems to be getting better but he's always been an introverted kid, so he seems lonely most days. When he was in high school, he was in a band but that quickly disbanded after one of the members graduated high school and went off to college. I recently made a suggestion for him to maybe start up a band again. To my surprise, he was excited about the idea but didn't really know where to start. I suggested he make posters to advertise and maybe place them around his campus. He got to work right away and showed me a flyer he had made. I asked if he wanted me to put it up on the bulletin board at my work place and he agreed.\n\nAs I was posting up the flyer on the board the next day, a colleague \"Joe\" walked up beside me and noticed the flyer (he's 29). I never really talked to Joe in the past because we work in different departments but I recognized his face and knew of him through other colleagues. We started talking about the band and Joe said he sings and plays his guitar every now and then. I told him he should audition and we both laughed about it, but toward the end of our conversation, he seemed interested, so I ripped off the part of the flyer that had Ben's phone number and gave it to him in case he wanted more information.\n\nLong story short, he audition and ended up in the band. The band consists of Ben, Joe, and two other people (both go to school with Ben). I'll admit, it was weird having Joe over at our place at first because we were colleagues and never hung out outside of work or work events, but I didn't mind it because Ben seemed happy and talks a lot about Joe (the two hang out often).\n\nA week ago, Joe was supposed to come over and work on some lyrics with Ben, but Ben was running late, so I invited Joe inside for a cup of coffee. We started chatting about work and complaining about our supervisors to each other, which was really nice to do because I haven't been able to vent to any of my other colleagues about work stress. We talked about the band and he played a sample of a song they were working on, which sounded similar to a song I had heard before but couldn't remember the name of. He asked for my number so that I could send him the song if I ended up remembering. I sent him the song that night and we've been texting all week since then. I enjoy talking to him a lot and it honestly feels like a stupid high school crush (I haven't seriously dated anyone since I was with Ben's father). Yesterday Ben found out I'd been texting Joe and got upset, saying that it's weird and that I can't date his friend. He compared it to \"what if you dated Matt\" (his 21 yr old friend since middle school). I don't think it's the same situation though. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. The situation is that the mother of a 21-year-old son is dating his friend, Joe, who is 29. The son found out and is upset. The user is asking if the mother is at fault.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The mother was a single parent, so maybe she's been more involved in her son's life, especially since he's been dealing with depression. She helped him start a band, which brought Joe into their lives. Initially, Joe was just a bandmate, but then they started dating. \n\nThe son is 21, an adult, so he should be able to handle such situations. However, the mother is getting involved with his friend, which might make him uncomfortable. But the mother's perspective is that she hasn't dated in a while and Joe is a nice person. The son's reaction is similar to if he were dating a friend, which he's not. \n\nIs there any conflict of interest? The mother and Joe work at the same place. If their relationship becomes romantic, there might be workplace issues. But since they are both adults, it's a personal choice. The son's reaction could be based on discomfort but not necessarily a valid reason for the mother to stop. \n\nThe key points are: \n1. The mother is an adult making her own choices.\n2. The son is an adult, so his feelings are valid but not a direct reason for her to be in the wrong.\n3. The relationship could affect the son's friendship with Joe, but again, it's not the mother's fault if the son is uncomfortable.\n\nPossible arguments against the mother: She might have crossed a boundary by dating her son's friend, possibly making him feel like she's taking his friend away. But considering the mother's situation (being single for a long time, supporting her son), it's a personal choice. \n\nWorkplace relationship is a red flag, but maybe they aren't in the same department. The main issue is the son's reaction. Since the son is an adult, his feelings are valid, but the mother isn't necessarily wrong for pursuing a relationship. So the answer might be B (No).\n"
