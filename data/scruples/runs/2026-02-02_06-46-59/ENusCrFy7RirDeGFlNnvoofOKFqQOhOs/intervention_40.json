His father was never really in the picture, so I was a single mother for the most part. Now I'm 38 and my son \"Ben\" is 21. He's been suffering from depression the past couple of years. I take him to therapy every week and he seems to be getting better but he's always been an introverted kid, so he seems lonely most days. When he was in high school, he was in a band but that quickly disbanded after one of the members graduated high school and went off to college. I recently made a suggestion for him to maybe start up a band again. To my surprise, he was excited about the idea but didn't really know where to start. I suggested he make posters to advertise and maybe place them around his campus. He got to work right away and showed me a flyer he had made. I asked if he wanted me to put it up on the bulletin board at my work place and he agreed.\n\nAs I was posting up the flyer on the board the next day, a colleague \"Joe\" walked up beside me and noticed the flyer (he's 29). I never really talked to Joe in the past because we work in different departments but I recognized his face and knew of him through other colleagues. We started talking about the band and Joe said he sings and plays his guitar every now and then. I told him he should audition and we both laughed about it, but toward the end of our conversation, he seemed interested, so I ripped off the part of the flyer that had Ben's phone number and gave it to him in case he wanted more information.\n\nLong story short, he audition and ended up in the band. The band consists of Ben, Joe, and two other people (both go to school with Ben). I'll admit, it was weird having Joe over at our place at first because we were colleagues and never hung out outside of work or work events, but I didn't mind it because Ben seemed happy and talks a lot about Joe (the two hang out often).\n\nA week ago, Joe was supposed to come over and work on some lyrics with Ben, but Ben was running late, so I invited Joe inside for a cup of coffee. We started chatting about work and complaining about our supervisors to each other, which was really nice to do because I haven't been able to vent to any of my other colleagues about work stress. We talked about the band and he played a sample of a song they were working on, which sounded similar to a song I had heard before but couldn't remember the name of. He asked for my number so that I could send him the song if I ended up remembering. I sent him the song that night and we've been texting all week since then. I enjoy talking to him a lot and it honestly feels like a stupid high school crush (I haven't seriously dated anyone since I was with Ben's father). Yesterday Ben found out I'd been texting Joe and got upset, saying that it's weird and that I can't date his friend. He compared it to \"what if you dated Matt\" (his 21 yr old friend since middle school). I don't think it's the same situation though. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for dating her son's friend. The backstory is that she's a single mom who helped her son start a band, which led her to meet Joe, a colleague. They started talking at work, he joined the band, and then they ended up texting a lot, leading to a relationship. The son got upset about it.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The mom is 38, Joe is 29. They work together, but they weren't close before. The son is 21 and has been dealing with depression and loneliness. The mom might have felt lonely too, especially since she hasn't dated in a while. She introduced Joe to her son's band, which was a good idea to help Ben make friends. But then their relationship went from professional to personal, and now the son is upset.\n\nIs the mom in the wrong? Well, there's the aspect of workplace relationships. She and Joe work in different departments, but they started interacting more. If they start dating, it could lead to complications at work, but that's a separate issue. The main question is the relationship with her son's friend.\n\nThe son is an adult, so he has the right to be upset, but he's also 21. The mom is a single parent, and her son's friend is an adult too. The key here is consent and maturity. The mom isn't in a position to control her son's friends, but the son might feel betrayed because his mom is dating someone he's close with. However, the mom didn't do anything wrong per se. She didn't hide the relationship; it's a personal choice. The son's reaction is valid, but does that make the mom in the wrong?\n\nAlso, considering the mom's age and the son's age, they're both adults. The mom is in a position of care for her son, so if she's dating someone he considers a friend, it could create tension. But the mom isn't his guardian anymore since he's an adult. However, she might still be emotionally involved in his life. The question is whether her dating the friend is wrong in terms of boundaries.\n\nIn some cases, parents dating their child's friends can be seen as crossing a line, especially if the child is still dependent or in a vulnerable state. The son has been struggling with depression and loneliness, so this might affect his perception. But since the son is 21, he's an adult and capable of handling his own emotions. The mom's actions might not be wrong, but they could be seen as insensitive depending on the son's feelings.\n\nThe mom's intentions were good in helping her son, and the relationship with Joe started as a professional interaction that evolved. There's no indication she was manipulative or intentionally trying to take the friend. So, maybe the answer is that she's not in the wrong. But some might argue that she should have been more cautious to avoid such a situation, given her role in her son's life.\n"
