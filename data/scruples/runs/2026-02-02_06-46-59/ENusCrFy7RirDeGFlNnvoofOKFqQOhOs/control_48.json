His father was never really in the picture, so I was a single mother for the most part. Now I'm 38 and my son \"Ben\" is 21. He's been suffering from depression the past couple of years. I take him to therapy every week and he seems to be getting better but he's always been an introverted kid, so he seems lonely most days. When he was in high school, he was in a band but that quickly disbanded after one of the members graduated high school and went off to college. I recently made a suggestion for him to maybe start up a band again. To my surprise, he was excited about the idea but didn't really know where to start. I suggested he make posters to advertise and maybe place them around his campus. He got to work right away and showed me a flyer he had made. I asked if he wanted me to put it up on the bulletin board at my work place and he agreed.\n\nAs I was posting up the flyer on the board the next day, a colleague \"Joe\" walked up beside me and noticed the flyer (he's 29). I never really talked to Joe in the past because we work in different departments but I recognized his face and knew of him through other colleagues. We started talking about the band and Joe said he sings and plays his guitar every now and then. I told him he should audition and we both laughed about it, but toward the end of our conversation, he seemed interested, so I ripped off the part of the flyer that had Ben's phone number and gave it to him in case he wanted more information.\n\nLong story short, he audition and ended up in the band. The band consists of Ben, Joe, and two other people (both go to school with Ben). I'll admit, it was weird having Joe over at our place at first because we were colleagues and never hung out outside of work or work events, but I didn't mind it because Ben seemed happy and talks a lot about Joe (the two hang out often).\n\nA week ago, Joe was supposed to come over and work on some lyrics with Ben, but Ben was running late, so I invited Joe inside for a cup of coffee. We started chatting about work and complaining about our supervisors to each other, which was really nice to do because I haven't been able to vent to any of my other colleagues about work stress. We talked about the band and he played a sample of a song they were working on, which sounded similar to a song I had heard before but couldn't remember the name of. He asked for my number so that I could send him the song if I ended up remembering. I sent him the song that night and we've been texting all week since then. I enjoy talking to him a lot and it honestly feels like a stupid high school crush (I haven't seriously dated anyone since I was with Ben's father). Yesterday Ben found out I'd been texting Joe and got upset, saying that it's weird and that I can't date his friend. He compared it to \"what if you dated Matt\" (his 21 yr old friend since middle school). I don't think it's the same situation though. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author (a single mom) is in the wrong for dating her son's friend. The situation involves her son Ben, who is 21 and struggling with depression. She suggested he start a band again, which led to her meeting Joe, a 29-year-old colleague. Joe ended up in Ben's band. They interacted at work, then Joe came over for coffee when Ben was late. They started texting, and Ben found out and got upset, comparing it to dating his friend Matt.\n\nFirst, the ethical angle here. The mom is 38, Joe is 29, so age-wise, there's a gap but not extreme. The key issue is the relationship dynamic. Ben is an adult now (21), so legally he's an adult, but there's a close age gap between him and Joe. The mom is his parent, so there's a power imbalance. Even though Ben is an adult, the mother's relationship with a friend of her adult son could cause tension and discomfort for Ben.\n\nFrom a social perspective, parents dating friends of their adult children can be tricky. It might make the son feel like his social circle is being encroached upon by his parent. The son might feel that the friend's loyalty is now directed towards the parent instead of him. The mom's actions could be seen as overstepping if she didn't consider Ben's feelings before pursuing the relationship.\n\nHowever, the mom's intentions were to help Ben by supporting his band. She didn't necessarily set out to date Joe; the relationship developed naturally after they bonded over work and the band. But once Ben found out, the emotional impact on him is significant. Even though Ben is an adult, the mother has a responsibility to consider how her actions affect him, especially given their close relationship and his past struggles with depression.\n\nIn terms of right or wrong, it's a bit gray. The mom isn't doing anything illegal, but the social and emotional implications matter. If the son feels that his parent is intruding on his friendships, it's a valid concern. The mom might argue that she has the right to date whom she chooses, but the way it affects her son's well-being is a key factor here. The comparison to dating Matt (his friend since middle school) is a red flag because it's about close friendships.\n\nSo, considering the potential emotional impact on the son and the nature of the relationship, the answer might lean towards the author being in the wrong because she didn't consider her son's feelings and the potential disruption to his social circle. However, some might argue that as an adult, the son needs to accept his mother's choices. The key here is whether the mother acted with consideration for her son's feelings. Since she didn't anticipate the emotional impact, she might be at fault.\n"
