His father was never really in the picture, so I was a single mother for the most part. Now I'm 38 and my son \"Ben\" is 21. He's been suffering from depression the past couple of years. I take him to therapy every week and he seems to be getting better but he's always been an introverted kid, so he seems lonely most days. When he was in high school, he was in a band but that quickly disbanded after one of the members graduated high school and went off to college. I recently made a suggestion for him to maybe start up a band again. To my surprise, he was excited about the idea but didn't really know where to start. I suggested he make posters to advertise and maybe place them around his campus. He got to work right away and showed me a flyer he had made. I asked if he wanted me to put it up on the bulletin board at my work place and he agreed.\n\nAs I was posting up the flyer on the board the next day, a colleague \"Joe\" walked up beside me and noticed the flyer (he's 29). I never really talked to Joe in the past because we work in different departments but I recognized his face and knew of him through other colleagues. We started talking about the band and Joe said he sings and plays his guitar every now and then. I told him he should audition and we both laughed about it, but toward the end of our conversation, he seemed interested, so I ripped off the part of the flyer that had Ben's phone number and gave it to him in case he wanted more information.\n\nLong story short, he audition and ended up in the band. The band consists of Ben, Joe, and two other people (both go to school with Ben). I'll admit, it was weird having Joe over at our place at first because we were colleagues and never hung out outside of work or work events, but I didn't mind it because Ben seemed happy and talks a lot about Joe (the two hang out often).\n\nA week ago, Joe was supposed to come over and work on some lyrics with Ben, but Ben was running late, so I invited Joe inside for a cup of coffee. We started chatting about work and complaining about our supervisors to each other, which was really nice to do because I haven't been able to vent to any of my other colleagues about work stress. We talked about the band and he played a sample of a song they were working on, which sounded similar to a song I had heard before but couldn't remember the name of. He asked for my number so that I could send him the song if I ended up remembering. I sent him the song that night and we've been texting all week since then. I enjoy talking to him a lot and it honestly feels like a stupid high school crush (I haven't seriously dated anyone since I was with Ben's father). Yesterday Ben found out I'd been texting Joe and got upset, saying that it's weird and that I can't date his friend. He compared it to \"what if you dated Matt\" (his 21 yr old friend since middle school). I don't think it's the same situation though. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for dating her son's friend. Let me break down the situation.\n\nFirst, the backstory: the author was a single mom to Ben, 21, since she was 17. Ben has dealt with depression and is introverted. She suggested starting a band again, and Ben made flyers. She posted one at work where she met Joe, 29, a colleague. Joe joined the band. They started talking more, then the author began texting him, leading to Ben finding out and getting upset.\n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong. I need to consider the dynamics here. The key points are the relationship between the mother and the son, the son's age, and the nature of the mother's relationship with Joe. \n\nBen is 21, an adult. The mother's decision to date someone who is his friend could be seen as crossing boundaries. However, since Ben is an adult, he might be expected to handle his own relationships and boundaries. But the mother's actions might make Ben feel uncomfortable, especially since she was his primary caregiver. \n\nThere's also the colleague aspect. The mother and Joe work together, so a relationship there could be a conflict of interest. But the main issue here is the son's reaction. The mother didn't date Joe when Ben was younger, so the timeline might matter. Since Ben is an adult, he should have some independence, but the mother-son bond is strong, and her dating a friend could feel intrusive.\n\nHowever, since Ben is 21, he's not a child anymore. The mother's actions aren't illegal, but they could be socially awkward. The answer might depend on whether the mother respected Ben's feelings. She didn't ask for his opinion, but he is an adult. The comparison to dating his middle school friend isn't the same because the mother isn't dating Ben's peer from his past but someone connected through his current social circle.\n\nIn terms of responsibility, the mother might be in the right because she's an adult and can choose her relationships. However, she might not consider how Ben feels. But Ben is also an adult and should handle such situations himself. The mother could be in the right, but the answer isn't straightforward. The key is that Ben is an adult, so the mother isn't necessarily in the wrong, but she should consider his feelings. Therefore, the answer might be B (not in the wrong), but there's a nuance here.\n"
