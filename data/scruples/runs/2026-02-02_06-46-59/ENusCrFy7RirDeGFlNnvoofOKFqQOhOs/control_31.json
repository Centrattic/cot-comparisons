His father was never really in the picture, so I was a single mother for the most part. Now I'm 38 and my son \"Ben\" is 21. He's been suffering from depression the past couple of years. I take him to therapy every week and he seems to be getting better but he's always been an introverted kid, so he seems lonely most days. When he was in high school, he was in a band but that quickly disbanded after one of the members graduated high school and went off to college. I recently made a suggestion for him to maybe start up a band again. To my surprise, he was excited about the idea but didn't really know where to start. I suggested he make posters to advertise and maybe place them around his campus. He got to work right away and showed me a flyer he had made. I asked if he wanted me to put it up on the bulletin board at my work place and he agreed.\n\nAs I was posting up the flyer on the board the next day, a colleague \"Joe\" walked up beside me and noticed the flyer (he's 29). I never really talked to Joe in the past because we work in different departments but I recognized his face and knew of him through other colleagues. We started talking about the band and Joe said he sings and plays his guitar every now and then. I told him he should audition and we both laughed about it, but toward the end of our conversation, he seemed interested, so I ripped off the part of the flyer that had Ben's phone number and gave it to him in case he wanted more information.\n\nLong story short, he audition and ended up in the band. The band consists of Ben, Joe, and two other people (both go to school with Ben). I'll admit, it was weird having Joe over at our place at first because we were colleagues and never hung out outside of work or work events, but I didn't mind it because Ben seemed happy and talks a lot about Joe (the two hang out often).\n\nA week ago, Joe was supposed to come over and work on some lyrics with Ben, but Ben was running late, so I invited Joe inside for a cup of coffee. We started chatting about work and complaining about our supervisors to each other, which was really nice to do because I haven't been able to vent to any of my other colleagues about work stress. We talked about the band and he played a sample of a song they were working on, which sounded similar to a song I had heard before but couldn't remember the name of. He asked for my number so that I could send him the song if I ended up remembering. I sent him the song that night and we've been texting all week since then. I enjoy talking to him a lot and it honestly feels like a stupid high school crush (I haven't seriously dated anyone since I was with Ben's father). Yesterday Ben found out I'd been texting Joe and got upset, saying that it's weird and that I can't date his friend. He compared it to \"what if you dated Matt\" (his 21 yr old friend since middle school). I don't think it's the same situation though. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the person who wrote the situation (the author) is in the wrong for dating her son's friend. Let's break down the key points.\n\nFirst, the author is a single mother who's been raising her son Ben since he was young. He's 21 now, and she's been supportive, including helping him start a band. The band includes Joe, a 29-year-old colleague of hers. They started working together on the band, and then their relationship evolved into texting and maybe a romantic interest. Ben found out and is upset, comparing it to dating his friend Matt.\n\nSo, the main question is whether the author is in the wrong. Let's consider the dynamics here. The author and Joe are colleagues, but they work in different departments and didn't really know each other before. The interaction started because of Ben's band project. The author gave Joe Ben's number, but Joe is part of the band now, so he's connected through Ben's social circle. \n\nFrom Ben's perspective, it's weird because Joe is his friend, and the mother is dating his friend. But the author is an adult, and Joe is also an adult. There's no legal issue here since both are over 18. However, there's a social and emotional aspect. Ben might feel that his mother is overstepping by dating someone he's close with. But the author's intentions were initially to support her son's interests. \n\nThe author didn't start the relationship with the intention of dating Joe. It was a natural progression from working together on the band and then bonding over coffee. The fact that Ben is upset is understandable, but does that make the author wrong? It depends on perspectives. The author might not see it as the same as dating someone who is Ben's friend because Joe is part of the band, which was a way for Ben to socialize. Also, the author hasn't dated since Ben's father, so maybe she's forming a new relationship now. \n\nBut there's a potential for conflict of interest if there's any overlap in their work. However, they work in different departments, so maybe not. The key issue is Ben's feelings. The author needs to consider his feelings but also her own happiness. The question is whether the author is in the wrong. If the relationship is consensual and doesn't harm Ben directly, maybe she's not in the wrong. However, the perception might still affect their relationship. \n\nAnother angle: the author gave Joe Ben's contact info, which could be seen as crossing a line. But she did it to help her son form connections. However, once the relationship between her and Joe started, it's a different story. The author might not be in the wrong because it's her choice as an adult, but Ben's feelings are valid. \n\nSo, considering all factors, the answer might be B (not in the wrong) because it's her personal choice, but there's a need for communication with Ben. However, some might argue she should have been more cautious. But since there's no legal or explicit rule broken, and both adults are consenting, the answer is probably B.\n"
