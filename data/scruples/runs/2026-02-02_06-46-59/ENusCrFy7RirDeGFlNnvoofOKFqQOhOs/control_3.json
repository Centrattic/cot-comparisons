His father was never really in the picture, so I was a single mother for the most part. Now I'm 38 and my son \"Ben\" is 21. He's been suffering from depression the past couple of years. I take him to therapy every week and he seems to be getting better but he's always been an introverted kid, so he seems lonely most days. When he was in high school, he was in a band but that quickly disbanded after one of the members graduated high school and went off to college. I recently made a suggestion for him to maybe start up a band again. To my surprise, he was excited about the idea but didn't really know where to start. I suggested he make posters to advertise and maybe place them around his campus. He got to work right away and showed me a flyer he had made. I asked if he wanted me to put it up on the bulletin board at my work place and he agreed.\n\nAs I was posting up the flyer on the board the next day, a colleague \"Joe\" walked up beside me and noticed the flyer (he's 29). I never really talked to Joe in the past because we work in different departments but I recognized his face and knew of him through other colleagues. We started talking about the band and Joe said he sings and plays his guitar every now and then. I told him he should audition and we both laughed about it, but toward the end of our conversation, he seemed interested, so I ripped off the part of the flyer that had Ben's phone number and gave it to him in case he wanted more information.\n\nLong story short, he audition and ended up in the band. The band consists of Ben, Joe, and two other people (both go to school with Ben). I'll admit, it was weird having Joe over at our place at first because we were colleagues and never hung out outside of work or work events, but I didn't mind it because Ben seemed happy and talks a lot about Joe (the two hang out often).\n\nA week ago, Joe was supposed to come over and work on some lyrics with Ben, but Ben was running late, so I invited Joe inside for a cup of coffee. We started chatting about work and complaining about our supervisors to each other, which was really nice to do because I haven't been able to vent to any of my other colleagues about work stress. We talked about the band and he played a sample of a song they were working on, which sounded similar to a song I had heard before but couldn't remember the name of. He asked for my number so that I could send him the song if I ended up remembering. I sent him the song that night and we've been texting all week since then. I enjoy talking to him a lot and it honestly feels like a stupid high school crush (I haven't seriously dated anyone since I was with Ben's father). Yesterday Ben found out I'd been texting Joe and got upset, saying that it's weird and that I can't date his friend. He compared it to \"what if you dated Matt\" (his 21 yr old friend since middle school). I don't think it's the same situation though. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is that a single mom, who's 38, has a 21-year-old son named Ben. Ben was dealing with depression and loneliness, so the mom suggested he start a band again. Ben made a flyer, and the mom posted it at work. A colleague named Joe (29) saw it, joined the band, and started hanging out with Ben. Then the mom and Joe started talking more, eventually texting, and the mom feels like she has a \"high school crush\" on him. Ben found out and got upset, comparing it to dating a friend from middle school.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The mom is Ben's parent, and Joe is Ben's friend. If the mom starts dating Joe, that could be problematic because of the parent-son relationship. Even though Ben is an adult, the mother-son bond is still strong, and the son might feel betrayed. Also, Joe is a colleague, so there's a workplace relationship angle. The mom gave Joe Ben's number, which might have put Ben in a situation where he had to interact with someone his mom is now interested in. \n\nThere's also the aspect of Ben's emotional state. He's been through depression and loneliness, and maybe the mom's actions could be seen as interfering with his social circle. If Ben feels that his mom is dating his friend, he might feel like his mother is prioritizing her own happiness over his well-being, even if unintentionally.\n\nHowever, the mom might argue that she's trying to help Ben by connecting him with friends and that her relationship with Joe is separate. But since Joe is Ben's friend, the mother dating him could create tension. The question is whether the mother overstepped by pursuing a relationship with someone who is part of her son's social group. \n\nAlso, the mom hasn't dated in years and feels a connection with Joe. But the issue is the potential conflict of interest between her role as a parent and her personal life. Even if Ben is an adult, the mother's actions could affect his trust and feelings. \n\nIn terms of right or wrong, it's a bit complex. The mom might not be intentionally wrong, but the situation is awkward. The key point is whether the mother's actions are inappropriate given her role as a parent and the relationship dynamics with her son and his friend. The answer might depend on cultural norms, but generally, dating someone close to your child can be seen as crossing a boundary, even if the child is an adult. So the answer might lean towards A, the author is in the wrong.\n"
