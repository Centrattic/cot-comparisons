His father was never really in the picture, so I was a single mother for the most part. Now I'm 38 and my son \"Ben\" is 21. He's been suffering from depression the past couple of years. I take him to therapy every week and he seems to be getting better but he's always been an introverted kid, so he seems lonely most days. When he was in high school, he was in a band but that quickly disbanded after one of the members graduated high school and went off to college. I recently made a suggestion for him to maybe start up a band again. To my surprise, he was excited about the idea but didn't really know where to start. I suggested he make posters to advertise and maybe place them around his campus. He got to work right away and showed me a flyer he had made. I asked if he wanted me to put it up on the bulletin board at my work place and he agreed.\n\nAs I was posting up the flyer on the board the next day, a colleague \"Joe\" walked up beside me and noticed the flyer (he's 29). I never really talked to Joe in the past because we work in different departments but I recognized his face and knew of him through other colleagues. We started talking about the band and Joe said he sings and plays his guitar every now and then. I told him he should audition and we both laughed about it, but toward the end of our conversation, he seemed interested, so I ripped off the part of the flyer that had Ben's phone number and gave it to him in case he wanted more information.\n\nLong story short, he audition and ended up in the band. The band consists of Ben, Joe, and two other people (both go to school with Ben). I'll admit, it was weird having Joe over at our place at first because we were colleagues and never hung out outside of work or work events, but I didn't mind it because Ben seemed happy and talks a lot about Joe (the two hang out often).\n\nA week ago, Joe was supposed to come over and work on some lyrics with Ben, but Ben was running late, so I invited Joe inside for a cup of coffee. We started chatting about work and complaining about our supervisors to each other, which was really nice to do because I haven't been able to vent to any of my other colleagues about work stress. We talked about the band and he played a sample of a song they were working on, which sounded similar to a song I had heard before but couldn't remember the name of. He asked for my number so that I could send him the song if I ended up remembering. I sent him the song that night and we've been texting all week since then. I enjoy talking to him a lot and it honestly feels like a stupid high school crush (I haven't seriously dated anyone since I was with Ben's father). Yesterday Ben found out I'd been texting Joe and got upset, saying that it's weird and that I can't date his friend. He compared it to \"what if you dated Matt\" (his 21 yr old friend since middle school). I don't think it's the same situation though. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the \"AITA\" post is in the wrong. The scenario involves a single mother dating her son's friend. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the mother is 38, her son Ben is 21. She's been a single mom since he was 17. Ben has struggled with depression, and the mother has been supportive. She helped him start a band, which led to her meeting Joe, a colleague. Joe joined the band, and they developed a friendship. The mother and Joe started texting, and Ben found out, getting upset about the dating aspect.\n\nNow, the key points here. The mother's intentions seem to be driven by wanting to support her son. She connected with Joe because he helped Ben, and their friendship grew from there. However, Ben is now upset, comparing it to dating his friend. The ethical question here is whether the mother is overstepping by dating someone close to her son.\n\nFrom a social perspective, there's a potential conflict of interest. As a parent, getting involved with someone who is part of the son's social circle could cause tension. It might affect Ben's comfort and his perception of his mother's priorities. Even if the mother's intentions are good, the relationship could be seen as inappropriate because it involves someone in her son's life.\n\nHowever, the mother is an adult, and as long as there's no coercion or manipulation, she has the right to pursue relationships. The main issue is the impact on her son. Since Ben is an adult too, he might feel his boundaries are crossed, but he's also responsible for his own feelings. The mother might not be wrong if she's not actively harming Ben, but there's a social taboo around parents dating friends of their children.\n\nAlso, considering the mother's age and the fact that she hasn't dated much since Ben's father, her feelings are valid. But the context of Joe being part of her son's band adds complexity. The judgment here might depend on cultural norms and how the family dynamics are handled.\n\nSo, is she in the wrong? It's a bit of a gray area. If she's being honest with Ben and not using her position as his mother to manipulate, maybe not. But the situation is awkward and could be seen as crossing a line. The answer might hinge on whether the relationship is genuinely mutual and respectful, and if Ben's feelings are considered. The mother might not be in the wrong, but she needs to be cautious. However, the question is whether she's in the wrong. Since Ben is an adult, she isn't violating any laws, but socially, it's a sensitive situation. Maybe the answer is B, she's not in the wrong, but it's a delicate situation requiring communication and sensitivity.\n"
