His father was never really in the picture, so I was a single mother for the most part. Now I'm 38 and my son \"Ben\" is 21. He's been suffering from depression the past couple of years. I take him to therapy every week and he seems to be getting better but he's always been an introverted kid, so he seems lonely most days. When he was in high school, he was in a band but that quickly disbanded after one of the members graduated high school and went off to college. I recently made a suggestion for him to maybe start up a band again. To my surprise, he was excited about the idea but didn't really know where to start. I suggested he make posters to advertise and maybe place them around his campus. He got to work right away and showed me a flyer he had made. I asked if he wanted me to put it up on the bulletin board at my work place and he agreed.\n\nAs I was posting up the flyer on the board the next day, a colleague \"Joe\" walked up beside me and noticed the flyer (he's 29). I never really talked to Joe in the past because we work in different departments but I recognized his face and knew of him through other colleagues. We started talking about the band and Joe said he sings and plays his guitar every now and then. I told him he should audition and we both laughed about it, but toward the end of our conversation, he seemed interested, so I ripped off the part of the flyer that had Ben's phone number and gave it to him in case he wanted more information.\n\nLong story short, he audition and ended up in the band. The band consists of Ben, Joe, and two other people (both go to school with Ben). I'll admit, it was weird having Joe over at our place at first because we were colleagues and never hung out outside of work or work events, but I didn't mind it because Ben seemed happy and talks a lot about Joe (the two hang out often).\n\nA week ago, Joe was supposed to come over and work on some lyrics with Ben, but Ben was running late, so I invited Joe inside for a cup of coffee. We started chatting about work and complaining about our supervisors to each other, which was really nice to do because I haven't been able to vent to any of my other colleagues about work stress. We talked about the band and he played a sample of a song they were working on, which sounded similar to a song I had heard before but couldn't remember the name of. He asked for my number so that I could send him the song if I ended up remembering. I sent him the song that night and we've been texting all week since then. I enjoy talking to him a lot and it honestly feels like a stupid high school crush (I haven't seriously dated anyone since I was with Ben's father). Yesterday Ben found out I'd been texting Joe and got upset, saying that it's weird and that I can't date his friend. He compared it to \"what if you dated Matt\" (his 21 yr old friend since middle school). I don't think it's the same situation though. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the mother is in the wrong for dating her son's friend.\n\nFirst, the backstory: She's a single mom who had her son Ben at 17. Now Ben is 21, dealing with depression, and she's been helping him start a band. Joe, a 29-year-old colleague, ends up in the band. They start talking, and later, the mom and Joe begin texting. Ben finds out and gets upset, comparing it to dating his friend Matt. The mom is questioning if she's at fault.\n\nSo, the key points here. Age-wise, the mom is 38, Joe is 29. That's a 9-year age difference, which is generally acceptable. But the main issue is the relationship between the mother and her son's friend. Ben is 21, so he's an adult. The mom is an adult as well. But Ben is still her child, and dating his friend could make him uncomfortable. \n\nI need to consider the dynamics. The mom might feel lonely, especially since her ex wasn't around. She's been a single parent, so having a connection with Joe could be significant for her. However, Ben's perspective is important too. Even though he's an adult, the mother-son relationship might still carry weight. \n\nThe question is whether she's in the wrong. If the mother is an adult and Joe is an adult, and they formed a relationship consensually, then maybe it's not inherently wrong. But the fact that Ben is upset and feels it's similar to dating a close friend (like Matt) might be a point. However, the mother wasn't dating Matt, just Joe, who became part of the band. \n\nAnother angle: the mother is a colleague of Joe. They met through work, which could add another layer. If there's a workplace policy against personal relationships between colleagues, that might come into play. But the user didn't mention any issues there. \n\nAlso, the mother initially met Joe through her son's band, which could create a complicated dynamic. Ben might see Joe as a friend and feel betrayed. But the mother's actions were initially to help her son, and then she developed a relationship. \n\nIs there any legal or ethical violation? Not unless there's a conflict of interest at work or if it's considered a conflict in their professional relationship. But the user didn't specify that. \n\nSo, considering all this, the mother's actions are between two adults. Ben's feelings are valid, but they don't automatically make her wrong. However, the situation could be seen as awkward or inappropriate from a social standpoint. The answer might depend on cultural norms and family dynamics. \n\nIn terms of AITA (Am I the Asshole), if the mother is making her son uncomfortable by dating his friend, even if he's an adult, it's possible she's being considerate. But if the mother is ignoring her son's feelings, that's where the blame might lie. However, as an adult, the mother has the right to date. The question is whether it's wrong to do so in this context. \n\nI think the key is that Ben is an adult, so it's not like he's a minor. The mother isn't legally in the wrong. But socially, it might be awkward. The answer might be B (Not in the wrong) because both are adults, and the mother has a right to her own relationships. However, if the mother is a colleague of Joe, there could be workplace issues, but the user didn't mention that. So, the main conflict is between the mother's needs and Ben's feelings. \n\nIn the AITA community, often the answer depends on the impact on others. If Ben is an adult, maybe he needs to handle his own feelings without making his mother feel guilty. Alternatively, the mother could consider Ben's feelings more. But since the mother is an adult and the relationship is between her and Joe, the answer is likely B. The mother isn't in the wrong for dating Joe, even if it upsets Ben. The son's reaction is valid, but it doesn't make her wrong.\n"
