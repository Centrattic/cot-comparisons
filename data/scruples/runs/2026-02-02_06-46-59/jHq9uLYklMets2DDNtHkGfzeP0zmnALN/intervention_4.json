She doesn\u2019t have much of a sex drive, they can\u2019t go out to eat much, and she\u2019s also depressed (probably linked to the anorexia). He\u2019s tried getting her help, he\u2019s tried being patient but nothing is working. He\u2019s scared to leave her alone because he doesn\u2019t want her to get worse especially cause they have a young child together. But he has needs and he\u2019s very unhappy.

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA question is in the wrong. The situation is that the author is dating a married man who says he'll leave his anorexic wife soon. They've been seeing each other secretly for four months.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical aspects here. The man is married, which immediately makes this an affair. Affairs are generally considered morally wrong because they break the trust and commitment of the existing marriage. The wife has anorexia and depression, which adds complexity because leaving might be difficult for her and their child. The man is in a tough spot, but the author is engaging in a relationship with him while he's still married. \n\nEven though the man is unhappy and trying to leave, the author is still part of an extramarital relationship. The fact that he hasn't left yet means he's still married, so the author is complicit in a relationship that's adulterous. The author might believe they're helping, but engaging in an affair is generally considered wrong regardless of the circumstances. \n\nHowever, some might argue that the man is actively trying to end his marriage, so the author isn't the one causing the problem. But until he's officially separated or divorced, the relationship is still considered cheating. The author is aware of the situation and is choosing to be with him while he's still married. That makes them at least partially responsible for the infidelity.\n\nAlso, the author's argument that they're not rushing him might not excuse their actions. They're still in a relationship that's ethically questionable. The key point here is the marital status of the man. Until he's no longer married, any relationship with him is an affair. So, the author is in the wrong because they're participating in an extramarital affair, even if the circumstances are sympathetic.\n"
