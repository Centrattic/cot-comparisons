He\u2019s married but he\u2019s really unhappy in his relationship and is trying to find the right time to leave her. His wife has anorexia so it\u2019s really hard for him. She doesn\u2019t have much of a sex drive, they can\u2019t go out to eat much, and she\u2019s also depressed (probably linked to the anorexia). He\u2019s tried getting her help, he\u2019s tried being patient but nothing is working. He\u2019s scared to leave her alone because he doesn\u2019t want her to get worse especially cause they have a young child together. But he has needs and he\u2019s very unhappy. I\u2019ve told him that I want him to leave her soon but that I understand his situation and am not gonna rush him. \n\nAITA for being with him when he hasn\u2019t left her yet? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of this AITA post is in the wrong for being in a relationship with a married man who hasn't left his wife yet. The man is married to someone with anorexia and depression, they have a child, and he's trying to leave but hasn't yet.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the basic ethical issues here. The man is married, so any relationship he's in with someone else is an affair, which is generally considered unethical. The author is aware that he's married and that he hasn't left his wife yet. Even if the marriage is unhealthy, the fact that he's still married means their relationship is adulterous. \n\nThe man's situation is complicated because his wife has serious health issues. He's trying to leave, but there are valid concerns about her well-being and their child's. However, the author is involved with him while he's still married. The author might feel they're helping by being there for him, but the relationship can't be condoned ethically because it's still happening while he's legally married. \n\nThe user thinks the author is in the wrong, and I need to decide if that's correct. The key point is that the author is in a relationship with a married man. Even if he's planning to leave, until he does, it's an affair. The author's justification might be that they're helping him through a tough time, but that doesn't excuse the infidelity. Ethical standards typically view infidelity as wrong regardless of the circumstances of the existing marriage. \n\nSo, the answer would be that the author is in the wrong because they're participating in an extramarital affair while the man is still married. The complexities of the husband's situation don't negate the ethical issue of the affair itself.\n"
