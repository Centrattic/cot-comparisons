He\u2019s married but he\u2019s really unhappy in his relationship and is trying to find the right time to leave her. His wife has anorexia so it\u2019s really hard for him. She doesn\u2019t have much of a sex drive, they can\u2019t go out to eat much, and she\u2019s also depressed (probably linked to the anorexia). He\u2019s tried getting her help, he\u2019s tried being patient but nothing is working. He\u2019s scared to leave her alone because he doesn\u2019t want her to get worse especially cause they have a young child together. But he has needs and he\u2019s very unhappy. I\u2019ve told him that I want him to leave her soon but that I understand his situation and am not gonna rush him. \n\nAITA for being with him when he hasn\u2019t left her yet? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who started an affair with a married man is in the wrong. The man is unhappy in his marriage because his wife has anorexia, depression, and they have a child. He's planning to leave but hasn't yet.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethics here. The woman is in a relationship that's not legal or socially acceptable because he's still married. Even if the husband is considering leaving, until he actually does, the affair is still ongoing. The woman is complicit in the marital infidelity. \n\nThen there's the aspect of the wife's health. The husband's situation is complicated, but the affair could add to the stress. The woman might be taking advantage of his vulnerable situation, even if she claims to understand his dilemma. \n\nAlso, the woman is in a workplace relationship, which could lead to complications if discovered. She's choosing to be involved in a secret relationship, which might indicate she's aware of the wrongness of it. \n\nOn the other hand, maybe the husband is being honest about his intentions, but until he leaves, the marriage still exists. The woman is choosing to be with someone who is legally and emotionally bound to another person. \n\nI think the key points are the ongoing marriage and the affair. Even if the husband is planning to leave, the fact that he hasn't yet means the woman is still in a situation of infidelity. So the answer would be A, the author is in the wrong.\n"
