      "text": "Okay, so the user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong for being in a relationship with a married man who says he's going to leave his anorexic wife soon. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the man is married. The woman in the story is dating him secretly, and he's been trying to leave his wife but hasn't yet. His wife has anorexia, depression, and they have a young child. He's stuck because he doesn't want to leave her alone, but he's unhappy. The woman in the story is supporting him but isn't pushing him to leave.\n\nSo, the main question is whether the woman is in the wrong by being with him before he's separated. From a moral standpoint, being in a relationship with someone who is still married is generally considered cheating. Adultery is typically seen as wrong because it breaches the marital vows. Even if the married person intends to leave their spouse, as long as they're still legally married, the affair is still considered infidelity.\n\nBut there are nuances. The man is in a difficult situation with a spouse who has serious health issues. He's trying to do the right thing by not abandoning her, which complicates things. However, the woman entering the relationship might be exploiting his vulnerability. She's aware of his situation but is still choosing to be with him while he's not legally separated. Even if she's not pushing him to leave immediately, she's still in a relationship with a married man.\n\nThe woman might argue that she's not at fault because the man is the one who's planning to leave, but the reality is that until he's separated, the relationship is ethically problematic. Also, the fact that they're hiding the relationship suggests that they both know it's wrong in some way. The woman's role in comforting him while he's in this tough spot could be seen as taking advantage of his emotional state.\n\nOn the other hand, some might say that the man is the one who's at fault for not leaving his wife, and the woman is just involved in a situation that's beyond her control. But the question is about the woman's responsibility. Even if she's not the one who initiated the marriage, by continuing the relationship while he's still married, she's complicit in his infidelity.\n\nSo, considering all that, the answer is likely A (the author is in the wrong). The act of engaging in a relationship with a married person is generally considered wrong regardless of the circumstances. The woman's justification that she's not rushing him doesn't negate the fact that the relationship is adulterous. Even if the man is unhappy in his marriage, the woman is still participating in a morally questionable act.\n"
