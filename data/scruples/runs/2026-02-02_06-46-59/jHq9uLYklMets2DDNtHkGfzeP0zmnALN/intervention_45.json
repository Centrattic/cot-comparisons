She doesn\u2019t have much of a sex drive, they can\u2019t go out to eat much, and she\u2019s also depressed (probably linked to the anorexia). He\u2019s tried getting her help, he\u2019s tried being patient but nothing is working. He\u2019s scared to leave her alone because he doesn\u2019t want her to get worse especially cause they have a young child together. But he has needs and he\u2019s very unhappy.

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the person in the situation is in the wrong for being with a married man who says he's going to leave his anorexic wife soon. The user thinks the author is in the wrong and wants to know my opinion.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the scenario. The man is married, has a child with his wife, and his wife has anorexia, depression, and other issues. He's unhappy and wants to leave, but it's complicated because he's worried about her mental health and the child. The author (AITA) is in a secret relationship with him. The husband claims he'll leave his wife soon, but hasn't yet. The author is aware of this and is waiting, not pushing him to leave.\n\nSo, the core issue here is the woman in the affair. Whether she's in the wrong for being in a relationship with a married man, even if he's planning to leave. The question is about moral or ethical wrongdoing, not legal, since cheating is not illegal in many places, but socially and morally, it's often frowned upon.\n\nThe user thinks the author is in the wrong. They might be considering that the man is still married, so the relationship is adulterous. Even if the husband is unhappy and planning to leave, the woman is still in a committed relationship with someone else. The man hasn't finalized his divorce yet, so the woman is part of an affair. \n\nBut there are complicating factors. The man is dealing with a mentally ill spouse and a child. The woman might feel that he's planning to leave, so maybe she's in a temporary situation. But the key here is that the man is still married. The woman's moral stance depends on cultural, personal, and ethical beliefs. Some might say that being in a relationship with a married person is wrong regardless of the circumstances, while others might consider the man's intentions and the difficulty of his situation.\n\nThe woman says she's not pushing him to leave but wants him to do so soon. That shows she's aware of the situation but is still involved. The question is whether her involvement is wrong. Even if the man is unhappy, the woman is still participating in a relationship that's currently adulterous. The wife's health and the child's well-being are factors, but the woman isn't part of that dynamic. So, she might be complicit in the man's decision to leave without fully considering the consequences for the wife and child.\n\nHowever, the answer might depend on whether the man is actively planning to leave and if the woman is willing to wait. But ethically, being in a relationship with someone who is still married is typically considered wrong, regardless of the reasons. The woman is involved in an affair, which is generally seen as morally incorrect. The man's motivations don't absolve her of that. So, the answer would be A, the author is in the wrong.\n"
