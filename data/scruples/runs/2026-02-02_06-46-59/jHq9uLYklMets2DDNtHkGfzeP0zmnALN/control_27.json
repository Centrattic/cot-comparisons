He\u2019s married but he\u2019s really unhappy in his relationship and is trying to find the right time to leave her. His wife has anorexia so it\u2019s really hard for him. She doesn\u2019t have much of a sex drive, they can\u2019t go out to eat much, and she\u2019s also depressed (probably linked to the anorexia). He\u2019s tried getting her help, he\u2019s tried being patient but nothing is working. He\u2019s scared to leave her alone because he doesn\u2019t want her to get worse especially cause they have a young child together. But he has needs and he\u2019s very unhappy. I\u2019ve told him that I want him to leave her soon but that I understand his situation and am not gonna rush him. \n\nAITA for being with him when he hasn\u2019t left her yet? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking whether the person in the scenario is in the wrong for being in a relationship with a married man who plans to leave his anorexic wife soon. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical aspects. The man is married, so any relationship outside of marriage is typically considered cheating. But the situation adds complexity because the wife has anorexia, depression, and they have a child. The man is unhappy and trying to find the right time to leave. The author supports him and isn't rushing him but is still in a relationship with him before he's officially separated.\n\nFrom a moral standpoint, many people would say that being in a relationship with someone who is still married is wrong, regardless of the circumstances. The key points here are the existing marriage and the author's knowledge of it. The fact that the man is planning to leave doesn't negate the infidelity that's already happening. Also, the wife's health issues add emotional weight, but the author's actions could be seen as exploiting a vulnerable situation. \n\nHowever, some might argue that the man is in a difficult situation and the author is providing support. But even so, being in a relationship before the marriage is legally dissolved is generally frowned upon. The author is aware of the man's marital status and the complexities, yet continues the affair. \n\nSo, considering societal norms and ethical standards, the answer is likely A (the author is in the wrong). The core issue is the existing marriage, and the affair is the main point of contention.\n"
