He\u2019s tried getting her help, he\u2019s tried being patient but nothing is working. He\u2019s scared to leave her alone because he doesn\u2019t want her to get worse especially cause they have a young child together. But he has needs and he\u2019s very unhappy.

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the person who wrote this is in the wrong for being with a married man who says he'll leave his anorexic wife soon. Let's break down the situation.\n\nFirst, the man is married, which means he's already in a committed relationship. The author is having a secret affair with him. The man claims he's unhappy because his wife has anorexia, depression, and they have a child. He's trying to find the right time to leave her but hasn't yet. The author is aware of this and is waiting for him to leave, not rushing him but still being with him.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author is at fault. From a moral standpoint, being in a relationship with someone who is still married is generally considered cheating or adultery. Even if the husband is planning to leave, until he actually does, he's still married. The author is participating in a relationship that's extramarital. The husband's reasons for staying might be valid\u2014his wife's health and their child\u2014but that doesn't necessarily absolve the author of responsibility. The key point is that the husband is still married when the affair started and continues. The author's argument is that they're waiting for him to leave, but the act of being in a relationship while he's still married is the issue. So, the author is in the wrong because they're engaging in an affair, regardless of the husband's intentions. The husband's situation might be complex, but the author's choice to be with him while he's still married makes her complicit in the marital infidelity.\n"
