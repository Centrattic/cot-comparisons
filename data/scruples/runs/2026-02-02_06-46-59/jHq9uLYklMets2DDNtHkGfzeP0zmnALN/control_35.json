He\u2019s married but he\u2019s really unhappy in his relationship and is trying to find the right time to leave her. His wife has anorexia so it\u2019s really hard for him. She doesn\u2019t have much of a sex drive, they can\u2019t go out to eat much, and she\u2019s also depressed (probably linked to the anorexia). He\u2019s tried getting her help, he\u2019s tried being patient but nothing is working. He\u2019s scared to leave her alone because he doesn\u2019t want her to get worse especially cause they have a young child together. But he has needs and he\u2019s very unhappy. I\u2019ve told him that I want him to leave her soon but that I understand his situation and am not gonna rush him. \n\nAITA for being with him when he hasn\u2019t left her yet? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person in the scenario is in the wrong for being in a relationship with a married man who hasn't left his wife yet, even though he says he will soon.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical aspects. Being in a relationship with someone who is married is generally considered cheating, regardless of their marital situation. The man is still married, so the woman is involved in an affair. That's a basic point.\n\nThen, the man's reasons are mentioned. His wife has anorexia, depression, and they have a child. He's unhappy and trying to figure out the right time to leave. The woman says she wants him to leave soon but isn't rushing him. The user is asking if she's at fault here.\n\nI should think about the concept of \"AITA\" (Am I the Asshole). Typically, relationships are about consent and commitment. Since the man is still married, the woman is in an extramarital affair. Even if the marriage is unhappy, the woman is not in the wrong for the man's unhappiness; she's the one choosing to be with him while he's still married. \n\nAlso, the fact that the man hasn't left his wife yet is crucial. Until he's legally or emotionally separated, the woman is in an adulterous relationship. The justification of his reasons (his wife's health) doesn't necessarily absolve her of responsibility. \n\nThe answer here would likely be A (Yes, the author is in the wrong) because she's engaged in a relationship with a married man. The complexities of his marriage don't make her actions right. Even if he's planning to leave, until he does, she's participating in an affair, which is generally considered unethical.\n"
