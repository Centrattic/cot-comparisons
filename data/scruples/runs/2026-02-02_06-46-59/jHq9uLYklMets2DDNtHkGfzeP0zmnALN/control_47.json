He\u2019s married but he\u2019s really unhappy in his relationship and is trying to find the right time to leave her. His wife has anorexia so it\u2019s really hard for him. She doesn\u2019t have much of a sex drive, they can\u2019t go out to eat much, and she\u2019s also depressed (probably linked to the anorexia). He\u2019s tried getting her help, he\u2019s tried being patient but nothing is working. He\u2019s scared to leave her alone because he doesn\u2019t want her to get worse especially cause they have a young child together. But he has needs and he\u2019s very unhappy. I\u2019ve told him that I want him to leave her soon but that I understand his situation and am not gonna rush him. \n\nAITA for being with him when he hasn\u2019t left her yet? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for being in a relationship with a married man who hasn't left his wife yet, despite planning to do so. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical aspects. The man is married, so any relationship outside of marriage is technically infidelity. But the situation is more complex because his wife has anorexia and they have a child. The man is unhappy and considering leaving, which adds another layer.\n\nThe author is aware of the wife's anorexia and the challenges the man faces. They're being patient, not pushing him to leave immediately. But the fact remains that the man is still married, so the author is involved in an affair. \n\nNow, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. Some might argue that the man's intentions to leave soon could justify the relationship, but until he actually leaves, he's still married. Others might say that the author is complicit in the man's decision to stay, which could affect the wife's well-being. \n\nAlso, the wife's health is a factor. The man is trying to balance his own needs with his responsibility towards his wife and child. The author might be adding stress to the situation if the wife finds out. \n\nBut the author claims they are not rushing him and understand the difficulty. However, the act of being in a relationship while someone is still married is generally considered wrong, regardless of the circumstances. The woman might be enabling the man's stay by being involved, which could complicate his decision to leave.\n\nSo, considering all angles, the answer is likely A (the author is in the wrong) because the relationship is adulterous and ongoing while the man is still married, even with good intentions.\n"
