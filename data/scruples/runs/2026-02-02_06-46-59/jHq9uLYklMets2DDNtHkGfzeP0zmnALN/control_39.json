She doesn\u2019t have much of a sex drive, they can\u2019t go out to eat much, and she\u2019s also depressed (probably linked to the anorexia). He\u2019s tried getting her help, he\u2019s tried being patient but nothing is working. He\u2019s scared to leave her alone because he doesn\u2019t want her to get worse especially cause they have a young child together. But he has needs and he\u2019s very unhappy.

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA question is in the wrong. The situation is that she's dating a married man who says he's going to leave his anorexic wife soon. They've been seeing each other secretly for 4 months.\n\nFirst, I need to figure out if the author is at fault. The man is married, so the affair is definitely a problem. The wife has anorexia and depression, which complicates things. The author is aware of the situation and supports the man wanting to leave, but hasn't urged him to act quickly. \n\nThe key points here are the infidelity and the man's ongoing commitment to his wife and child. The man hasn't left yet, so he's still married, and the author is involved with him. Even if the man is unhappy, the author is participating in a relationship that's adulterous. The fact that she's supporting him in leaving might not absolve her because the relationship is already cheating. \n\nAlso, the man's hesitation to leave due to his wife's health doesn't justify the affair. The author's role is to support him, but by being in a relationship with him before he leaves, she's complicit in the marital breach. Ethically, many would argue that she's wrong because she's involved in an extramarital affair regardless of the circumstances. So the answer is likely A (Yes, she's in the wrong).\n"
