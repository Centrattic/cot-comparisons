He\u2019s tried getting her help, he\u2019s tried being patient but nothing is working. He\u2019s scared to leave her alone because he doesn\u2019t want her to get worse especially cause they have a young child together. But he has needs and he\u2019s very unhappy.

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who started an affair with a married man is in the wrong, even though the man claims he's going to leave his wife soon.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the moral implications. Cheating is generally frowned upon in most ethical systems because it breaks trust and can harm existing relationships. The man is still married, so even if he's unhappy, he hasn't left his wife yet. The woman knows about his situation and is involved with him while he's still married. That seems like a problem because she's part of an adulterous relationship.\n\nThen there's the aspect of the wife's health. The wife has anorexia and depression, which makes her situation more sensitive. The man is in a tough spot, but the woman entering the picture might be complicating his ability to make the right decisions. If she's encouraging him to leave but he's hesitant because of their child, maybe her involvement is adding pressure.\n\nAlso, the woman says she's not rushing him but still is in a relationship with him. That could be seen as selfish because she's benefiting from his marital issues without addressing the ethical concerns. Even if the man plans to leave, until he does, the relationship is still adulterous.\n\nOn the other hand, maybe the woman isn't entirely at fault because the marriage is already problematic. But regardless of the marriage's state, starting an affair is generally considered wrong. The woman's justification of understanding his situation might not excuse her actions. She's aware of the complexities but still chooses to be with him while he's married. \n\nSo, the answer would be AITA (Am I the Asshole) scenarios often hinge on intent and consequences. The woman's actions directly contribute to the man's marital infidelity. Even if the man is planning to leave, the woman is still in a relationship that's ethically questionable until he's officially separated. Therefore, the author is in the wrong.\n"
