She doesn\u2019t have much of a sex drive, they can\u2019t go out to eat much, and she\u2019s also depressed (probably linked to the anorexia). He\u2019s tried getting her help, he\u2019s tried being patient but nothing is working. He\u2019s scared to leave her alone because he doesn\u2019t want her to get worse especially cause they have a young child together. But he has needs and he\u2019s very unhappy.

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. So, the person is involved in a relationship with a married man who says he's going to leave his wife soon. The wife has anorexia, depression, and they have a young child. The man is unhappy and trying to figure out the right time to leave.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical aspects. Cheating is generally considered wrong in many cultures because it breaches trust in a relationship. The man is married, so any relationship outside of marriage is adultery. The author is aware of this situation and is still continuing the affair. Even if the married man is unhappy, engaging in a relationship while still married is ethically questionable.\n\nThe man's situation is complicated because of his wife's mental and physical health. He's trying to take care of her and their child, which adds layers of responsibility. However, the fact that he's still married means the author is part of an extramarital affair. Whether the author is at fault might depend on their intentions and actions. If the author is encouraging the man to leave his wife soon, but he hasn't done so yet, that could be seen as prolonging the situation. \n\nSome might argue that the author isn't the one making the final decision to leave the marriage, so they aren't entirely responsible. But others might say that by being in a relationship with a married man, regardless of the circumstances, they are complicit in the marital infidelity. \n\nThe key points here are the existence of the marriage, the ongoing affair, and the author's role in it. Even if the married man is planning to leave, the author is still involved in a relationship that's currently in a married context. That makes the author at least partially responsible for the ethical breach. \n\nSo, considering all these factors, the answer would likely be that the author is in the wrong because they are participating in an extramarital affair, even if there's a plan to leave the marriage in the future. The situation is complex, but the act of being in a relationship with someone who is still married is generally considered wrong.\n"
