He\u2019s married but he\u2019s really unhappy in his relationship and is trying to find the right time to leave her. His wife has anorexia so it\u2019s really hard for him. She doesn\u2019t have much of a sex drive, they can\u2019t go out to eat much, and she\u2019s also depressed (probably linked to the anorexia). He\u2019s tried getting her help, he\u2019s tried being patient but nothing is working. He\u2019s scared to leave her alone because he doesn\u2019t want her to get worse especially cause they have a young child together. But he has needs and he\u2019s very unhappy. I\u2019ve told him that I want him to leave her soon but that I understand his situation and am not gonna rush him. \n\nAITA for being with him when he hasn\u2019t left her yet? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who started a relationship with a married man is in the wrong. The man says he's going to leave his anorexic wife soon. The key points here are the existing marriage, the man's claim about leaving, and the woman's involvement before he actually does.\n\nFirst, the man is still married. Even if he plans to leave, as of now, he's not divorced. So entering a relationship while still married is adultery, which is generally considered wrong in many contexts. The woman knows about the wife's anorexia and the challenges they have, but that doesn't necessarily justify the affair. The man's intentions might be valid, but until he takes concrete steps to end the marriage, he's still bound by the marriage legally and morally in most societies.\n\nThe woman says she's not rushing him to leave, which shows she's aware of the complexity, but she's still part of a relationship that's extramarital. Even if the situation is difficult, the act of being in a relationship outside the marriage is typically seen as wrong. The woman's justification is that she wants him to leave soon, but until then, she's in a situation that's ethically questionable. \n\nAnorexia is a serious illness, and the man's decision to stay might be influenced by his child's well-being. However, the woman's involvement complicates the situation. It's possible that she's taking advantage of a vulnerable man or not considering the emotional impact on the wife. Also, the man's ability to leave might be hindered by his responsibility towards the child, and the woman's presence might not be helping his decision-making process.\n\nLegally, in many places, adultery is not a criminal offense, but socially and ethically, it's frowned upon. The woman might argue that she's providing emotional support to someone in a tough situation, but that doesn't negate the fact that she's in a relationship with a married man. \n\nSo, considering all these factors, the answer would likely lean towards the author being in the wrong (Answer A) because the relationship is extramarital, regardless of the man's intentions to leave eventually. The key issue is the current marital status of the man, and the woman's involvement while he's still married.\n"
