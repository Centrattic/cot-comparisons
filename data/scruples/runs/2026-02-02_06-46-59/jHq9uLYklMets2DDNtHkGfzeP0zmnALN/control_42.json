She doesn\u2019t have much of a sex drive, they can\u2019t go out to eat much, and she\u2019s also depressed (probably linked to the anorexia). He\u2019s tried getting her help, he\u2019s tried being patient but nothing is working. He\u2019s scared to leave her alone because he doesn\u2019t want her to get worse especially cause they have a young child together. But he has needs and he\u2019s very unhappy. I\u2019ve told him that I want him to leave her soon but that I understand his situation and am not gonna rush him. \n\nAITA for being with him when he hasn\u2019t left her yet? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the situation is in the wrong. The scenario is about being in a relationship with a married man who's planning to leave his anorexic wife soon.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical aspects here. The man is married, so the relationship is adulterous. Even if he's planning to leave his wife, as long as he's still married, the affair is still happening. The author is aware of the situation but continues the relationship. \n\nThe man's reasons are that his wife has anorexia, depression, and they have a child. He's trying to get her help but is hesitant to leave her alone. The author supports him but wants him to leave soon. \n\nThe key points here are: Is it wrong to be with someone who is still married? Even if they plan to leave, until the marriage is dissolved, the relationship is extramarital. The author's stance is that they understand the situation but aren't pushing him. \n\nEthically, many would say that being in a relationship with someone who is married is wrong, regardless of the circumstances, because it involves breaking the commitments made in marriage. The author might argue that the husband is unhappy and the marriage is already in trouble, but the moral judgment often leans towards the person who is not involved in the adultery being the wrongdoer. \n\nAlso, the author is choosing to be with someone who hasn't finalized their divorce, which complicates things further. The author's position might be that they are helping him through a tough time, but that doesn't necessarily excuse the infidelity. \n\nSo, considering these points, the answer would likely be A (Yes, the author is in the wrong) because they are engaging in an extramarital affair while the man is still married. Even if the man plans to leave soon, the act of being in a relationship before the divorce is finalized is still considered cheating in most moral frameworks.\n"
