He\u2019s married but he\u2019s really unhappy in his relationship and is trying to find the right time to leave her. His wife has anorexia so it\u2019s really hard for him. She doesn\u2019t have much of a sex drive, they can\u2019t go out to eat much, and she\u2019s also depressed (probably linked to the anorexia). He\u2019s tried getting her help, he\u2019s tried being patient but nothing is working. He\u2019s scared to leave her alone because he doesn\u2019t want her to get worse especially cause they have a young child together. But he has needs and he\u2019s very unhappy. I\u2019ve told him that I want him to leave her soon but that I understand his situation and am not gonna rush him. \n\nAITA for being with him when he hasn\u2019t left her yet? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong for being in a relationship with a married man who hasn't left his wife yet, even though he's planning to.\n\nFirst, I need to recall the general principles of infidelity and relationships. Cheating is generally considered wrong because it betrays the trust of the married partner. The man is still married, so any relationship outside of that is adultery. The wife has an eating disorder and other issues, but that doesn't make the affair justified. The woman in the story is aware that he's married and is involved in a secret relationship, which is a key point.\n\nThe man claims he's going to leave his wife soon, but hasn't done so yet. The author of the post says they understand his situation but aren't rushing him. However, until the marriage is legally ended, he's still married. The other person is participating in an affair, which is a breach of the marital vows and can be seen as unethical regardless of the circumstances.\n\nNow, considering the options: A says the author is in the wrong, B says not. The core issue here is whether engaging in a relationship with someone who is still married makes the author at fault. The fact that the marriage is troubled doesn't absolve the affair. So, the answer would likely be A, since the author is participating in an extramarital affair while the man hasn't officially ended his marriage. Even if the man is unhappy, the affair is still ethically problematic. The author is complicit in the adultery, which is typically considered a wrong action.\n"
