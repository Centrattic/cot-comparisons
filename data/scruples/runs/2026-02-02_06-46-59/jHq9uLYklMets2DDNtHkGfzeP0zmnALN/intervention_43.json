He\u2019s tried getting her help, he\u2019s tried being patient but nothing is working. He\u2019s scared to leave her alone because he doesn\u2019t want her to get worse especially cause they have a young child together. But he has needs and he\u2019s very unhappy.

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong for dating a married man who hasn't left his wife yet. The man claims he's going to leave her soon but is hesitating because his wife has anorexia, depression, and they have a young child. He's unhappy and the author supports him but isn't pushing him to leave immediately.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the moral aspects. Being in a relationship with someone who is married is generally considered cheating, which is ethically wrong. The man is still married, so the author is in an affair. Even if the man is planning to leave his wife, the fact that he hasn't done so yet means the marriage is still legally and emotionally active. The author is aware of this situation and is continuing the affair despite knowing the complexities involved.\n\nNext, the man's reasons for staying: his wife has serious health issues, and they have a child. These are valid concerns, but the author is still complicit in the affair. The man hasn't taken action to leave, so the author is engaging in an unethical relationship while the marriage still exists. Even if the man is unhappy, the author's role is to support someone who is married, which can be seen as taking advantage of his vulnerable situation.\n\nThen, there's the aspect of the author's own actions. She claims she's not rushing him but is still in a relationship with him. The key point here is that the man is married, regardless of his intentions. The author is engaging in a romantic relationship that's not legitimate until the marriage is officially dissolved. So, from an ethical standpoint, she's participating in an affair, which is typically considered the wrong thing to do.\n\nHowever, some might argue that the man is in a difficult situation, and the author is providing emotional support. But that doesn't necessarily justify the affair. The woman is still choosing to be with a married man, which is a moral issue regardless of the circumstances. The author's justification that she's not pushing him might not absolve her of responsibility because the affair is happening while he's still married.\n\nIn terms of societal norms and legal perspectives, adultery is often frowned upon, and in some places, it's illegal. Even if it's not illegal, it's socially condemned. The author's actions could be seen as contributing to the man's decision to leave his wife, which might complicate the existing family dynamics and potentially harm the wife and child.\n\nConsidering all these factors, the conclusion is that the author is in the wrong. The relationship is an affair while the man is still married, which is unethical regardless of the reasons behind it. The author's role in supporting someone who is still legally and emotionally committed to another person makes her complicit in the situation. Therefore, the answer is A (the author is in the wrong).\n"
