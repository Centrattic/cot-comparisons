She doesn\u2019t have much of a sex drive, they can\u2019t go out to eat much, and she\u2019s also depressed (probably linked to the anorexia). He\u2019s tried getting her help, he\u2019s tried being patient but nothing is working. He\u2019s scared to leave her alone because he doesn\u2019t want her to get worse especially cause they have a young child together. But he has needs and he\u2019s very unhappy. I\u2019ve told him that I want him to leave her soon but that I understand his situation and am not gonna rush him. \n\nAITA for being with him when he hasn\u2019t left her yet? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is that the person is in a secret relationship with a married man. The man is unhappy because his wife has anorexia, depression, and they have a young child. He's planning to leave her soon but hasn't yet. The author is asking if they're at fault for being with him before he leaves.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethics of being in a relationship with someone who is still married. Even if the married person intends to leave, the relationship is extramarital until the divorce is finalized. So, the author is involved in an affair. That alone might make them at fault, depending on cultural or personal morals.\n\nNext, the man's reasons for staying are that he's concerned about his wife's well-being and their child. He's trying to find the right time to leave. The author supports him but also wants him to leave. The key point here is that the man hasn't left yet, so they're both involved in an ongoing marriage. \n\nFrom a legal standpoint, the marriage is still valid until it's officially dissolved. Emotionally, being in a relationship while a marriage is still intact can cause harm to the spouse and any children involved. The author's relationship might hinder the man's ability to make a clean break, especially if he's using her as a reason to stay.\n\nAlso, the wife's health issues are serious. Anorexia and depression require professional help. The man's responsibility to his wife and child is a significant factor. The author might be complicating his decisions, even if unintentionally.\n\nBut then, the author isn't the one who is married. They might be in a position where they're enabling the man to avoid making a difficult decision. However, they're also seeking support for someone in a tough situation. It's a bit of a gray area. \n\nOn one hand, the author is engaging in an affair, which is generally considered wrong. On the other, the man is in a troubled marriage, and the author is providing emotional support. But the core issue is that the man hasn't ended his marriage yet. Until he does, the relationship is still an affair. \n\nSo, considering all these factors, the author is in the wrong because they are part of an extramarital affair even if the married person is planning to leave. The affair is ongoing while the marriage is still legal and active. The author's involvement may also be complicating the man's decision to leave, which could affect the wife's well-being and the child's stability.\n"
