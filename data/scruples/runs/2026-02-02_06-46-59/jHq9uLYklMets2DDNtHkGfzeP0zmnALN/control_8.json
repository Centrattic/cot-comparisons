He\u2019s married but he\u2019s really unhappy in his relationship and is trying to find the right time to leave her. His wife has anorexia so it\u2019s really hard for him. She doesn\u2019t have much of a sex drive, they can\u2019t go out to eat much, and she\u2019s also depressed (probably linked to the anorexia). He\u2019s tried getting her help, he\u2019s tried being patient but nothing is working. He\u2019s scared to leave her alone because he doesn\u2019t want her to get worse especially cause they have a young child together. But he has needs and he\u2019s very unhappy. I\u2019ve told him that I want him to leave her soon but that I understand his situation and am not gonna rush him. \n\nAITA for being with him when he hasn\u2019t left her yet? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation involves a married man with an anorexic wife and a depressed child, and the author is in a secret relationship with him. The man is unhappy and considering leaving, but hasn't done so yet.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical aspects here. Cheating is generally frowned upon in most societies, so the author is in a romantic relationship with someone who is married. That's a red flag. But the man is also in a difficult situation with his wife's mental health and their child. He hasn't left yet, which means he's still married. \n\nThe author might argue that they're helping him, that he's unhappy, and they're not pushing him to leave immediately. But the fact remains that the relationship is adulterous. The wife has an eating disorder and depression, which complicates things, but the man is still married. The author is choosing to be with someone who is not free to be with them, regardless of the circumstances.\n\nAnother angle: maybe the man is manipulating the author by making them believe he's going to leave soon, but there's no evidence he actually will. The author is in a vulnerable position, being in a secret relationship which might not be healthy. Also, the author is aware of the wife's issues but still proceeds, which could be seen as exploiting the man's situation.\n\nOn the other hand, if the man is genuinely planning to leave, maybe the author is just waiting for that to happen. But until he's officially divorced, the relationship is still cheating. The author could be in a gray area, but from an external perspective, the act of being in a relationship while the other person is married is typically considered wrong. So the answer is likely A, the author is in the wrong.\n"
