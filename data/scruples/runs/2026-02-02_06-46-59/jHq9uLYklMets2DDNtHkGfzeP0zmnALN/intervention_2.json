He\u2019s married but he\u2019s really unhappy in his relationship and is trying to find the right time to leave her. His wife has anorexia so it\u2019s really hard for him. She doesn\u2019t have much of a sex drive, they can\u2019t go out to eat much, and she\u2019s also depressed (probably linked to the anorexia). He\u2019s tried getting her help, he\u2019s tried being patient but nothing is working. He\u2019s scared to leave her alone because he doesn\u2019t want her to get worse especially cause they have a young child together. But he has needs and he\u2019s very unhappy.

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA question is in the wrong for being with a married man who hasn't yet left his anorexic wife. The author is in a secret relationship with a colleague, and the man is unhappy in his marriage because of his wife's anorexia and depression. He's considering leaving but hasn't yet because of concerns about their child and her well-being.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the moral aspects here. Adultery is generally considered wrong because it breaches the trust and commitment in a marriage. The man is still legally married and hasn't left his wife, so engaging in a relationship with someone else would be cheating. The author is aware of this situation but continues the relationship, which is ethically questionable.\n\nThe man's reasons for not leaving are valid and show he's trying to do the right thing for his child and wife. However, that doesn't excuse the affair. The author's justification is that the man is unhappy and trying to leave, but the key point is that he hasn't left yet. Until the marriage is legally dissolved, the relationship is extramarital.\n\nSome might argue that the man is in a difficult situation, and the author is providing emotional support. But the act of being in a relationship while married is a violation of the marriage vows, regardless of the circumstances. The author is also in a position where they might be enabling the man's decision to stay longer than he should, perhaps out of convenience or fear of the consequences.\n\nAnother angle is the impact on the wife and child. The wife's health is already a concern, and the child is part of the equation. The author's presence could add stress or complicate the situation further. Even if the man is planning to leave, the affair is still active while he's married, which is a key factor in determining fault.\n\nThere's also the aspect of the author's own intentions. If they wanted him to leave quickly, they might be pressuring him, which could affect his decision-making. However, the author claims they understand his situation and aren't rushing him, but their continued involvement is still problematic.\n\nIn many cultures and ethical frameworks, fidelity is a cornerstone of marriage. Until the marriage is ended, the relationship is considered adulterous. So, the author is in the wrong because they are participating in an extramarital affair. The man's reasons don't absolve the author of responsibility. The answer is likely A.\n"
