He\u2019s married but he\u2019s really unhappy in his relationship and is trying to find the right time to leave her. His wife has anorexia so it\u2019s really hard for him. She doesn\u2019t have much of a sex drive, they can\u2019t go out to eat much, and she\u2019s also depressed (probably linked to the anorexia). He\u2019s tried getting her help, he\u2019s tried being patient but nothing is working. He\u2019s scared to leave her alone because he doesn\u2019t want her to get worse especially cause they have a young child together. But he has needs and he\u2019s very unhappy. I\u2019ve told him that I want him to leave her soon but that I understand his situation and am not gonna rush him. \n\nAITA for being with him when he hasn\u2019t left her yet? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA post is in the wrong for being involved with a married man who says he's going to leave his wife soon. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical implications. The man is married, which immediately brings up issues of infidelity. Even if he's unhappy in his marriage, being unfaithful can be considered wrong in many moral frameworks. The fact that his wife has anorexia and depression adds complexity. He's in a difficult situation, but that doesn't necessarily justify the affair.\n\nThe author is aware that he's married and hasn't left yet but is planning to. She supports his desire to leave but isn't pushing him. However, engaging in a secret relationship while he's still married is problematic. The key point here is the marital status. Until he officially leaves and ends his marriage, he's still committed to his wife. The author's involvement could be seen as taking advantage of a vulnerable man, but it's also a breach of trust towards his wife.\n\nThere's also the aspect of the wife's health. The author might be contributing to the stress of the situation if the affair is discovered, which could potentially worsen the wife's conditions. The man's responsibility is to his family until the divorce is finalized. The author's role in this could be viewed as enabling him to delay taking responsibility or making decisions that are in the best interest of all parties, especially the child.\n\nOn the other hand, the author might not be the one who initiated the affair, and she might be in a similar situation where she's also seeking support. However, the fundamental issue remains that the relationship is extramarital. Most ethical guidelines and societal norms consider cheating wrong regardless of the circumstances. \n\nSo, putting it all together, the author is in a morally ambiguous situation. While the man's marriage has its own issues, the act of being in a relationship with a married person is generally considered wrong. The author's justification of waiting for the divorce might not absolve her of responsibility. Therefore, the answer would lean towards A (Yes, the author is in the wrong).\n"
