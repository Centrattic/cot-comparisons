He\u2019s married but he\u2019s really unhappy in his relationship and is trying to find the right time to leave her. His wife has anorexia so it\u2019s really hard for him. She doesn\u2019t have much of a sex drive, they can\u2019t go out to eat much, and she\u2019s also depressed (probably linked to the anorexia). He\u2019s tried getting her help, he\u2019s tried being patient but nothing is working. He\u2019s scared to leave her alone because he doesn\u2019t want her to get worse especially cause they have a young child together. But he has needs and he\u2019s very unhappy. I\u2019ve told him that I want him to leave her soon but that I understand his situation and am not gonna rush him. \n\nAITA for being with him when he hasn\u2019t left her yet? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this. So the question is whether the person (AITA) is in the wrong for being in a relationship with a married man who hasn't left his anorexic wife yet. Let's break it down.\n\nFirst, the man is married, so by definition, any relationship outside of that marriage is an affair. That's a big point. The person is in a secret relationship with him, which is already ethically questionable because it's adultery. The man says he's going to leave his wife soon, but hasn't yet. The user is supporting him and wanting him to leave, but they're still in the affair.\n\nNow, the wife has anorexia, depression, and they have a child. The husband is struggling, trying to help her but also feeling trapped. The user's stance is understanding but pushing for him to leave. But the key here is that the man hasn't actually left yet. So the affair is ongoing while he's still married.\n\nEthically, most people would say that being in a relationship with someone who is still married is wrong, regardless of the circumstances. The fact that the husband has issues with his wife doesn't excuse the infidelity. The user is complicit in the affair by continuing the relationship before the divorce. Even if the husband plans to leave, until he does, the user is in an extramarital affair. \n\nAnother angle: the user might think they're helping the husband by providing support, but they're also complicating his situation. The wife's health is a factor, and the user's presence might make it harder for the husband to make a clean break or could pressure him more than he's ready for. Also, the user's own actions could be seen as exploiting the husband's vulnerable state.\n\nSo, putting it all together, even if the husband's marriage is problematic, the user is in the wrong because they're involved in an affair while he's still married. The answer is A.\n"
