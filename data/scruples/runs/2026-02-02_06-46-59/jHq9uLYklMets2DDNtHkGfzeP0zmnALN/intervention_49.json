He\u2019s married but he\u2019s really unhappy in his relationship and is trying to find the right time to leave her. His wife has anorexia so it\u2019s really hard for him. She doesn\u2019t have much of a sex drive, they can\u2019t go out to eat much, and she\u2019s also depressed (probably linked to the anorexia). He\u2019s tried getting her help, he\u2019s tried being patient but nothing is working. He\u2019s scared to leave her alone because he doesn\u2019t want her to get worse especially cause they have a young child together. But he has needs and he\u2019s very unhappy. I\u2019ve told him that I want him to leave her soon but that I understand his situation and am not gonna rush him. \n\nAITA for being with him when he hasn\u2019t left her yet? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA question is in the wrong. The scenario is about being in a secret relationship with a married man who says he's going to leave his anorexic wife soon. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethics here. Cheating is generally considered wrong by many, especially when one person is still married. The man is married, so any relationship outside of marriage is an affair. The woman is in a relationship with a married man, even if he's planning to leave his wife. \n\nBut then there's the context: the husband is unhappy, his wife has anorexia, depression, and they have a child. He's struggling and trying to find the right time to leave. The author says they're in it secretly and she's told him not to rush but she wants him to leave. \n\nSome might argue that the author is supporting someone who's stuck in a difficult situation, maybe even enabling his delay in leaving. Others might say that being in a relationship with someone still married is inherently wrong regardless of the circumstances. \n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong. From a moral standpoint, many people would say yes because it's an affair. But others might empathize with the situation, especially if the married man is planning to leave. However, the key point is that he hasn't left yet. Until he's divorced, she's technically involved with a married man. \n\nAlso, the author might be complicating his decision. If she's in the relationship, maybe he's staying longer because of her. But the author says she's not rushing him. Still, being in a relationship with a married person is a breach of trust and societal norms. \n\nSo, considering all that, the answer would likely be A (Yes, the author is in the wrong). Even if the situation is complex, the act of being in a relationship with someone still married is generally considered unethical.\n"
