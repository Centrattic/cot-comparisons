      "text": "Okay, let's see. The person is asking if they're in the wrong for being in a relationship with a married man who says he'll leave his anorexic wife soon. The man is unhappy, his wife has anorexia and depression, they have a child. He's trying to find the right time to leave. The author says they've been seeing each other secretly for four months.\n\nFirst, the main issue here is that the man is still married. Even if he's planning to leave, he hasn't done so yet. Being in a relationship with someone who's still married is generally considered cheating and morally wrong because it's a violation of the marriage vow. The fact that he's planning to leave might complicate things, but until he actually goes through with it, he's still legally married. The author is aware of this and is still involved with him. \n\nThe man's situation is tough, especially with his wife's health and their child. But the key point is that the author is in a relationship with a married person. Even if the husband intends to leave, the author is still part of an extramarital affair. Some might argue that the author is being selfish by not waiting for the man to leave, while others might empathize with the man's unhappiness. However, from a moral standpoint, being in a relationship with someone who's still married typically makes the person in the affair at fault. \n\nThe author claims they're not rushing him to leave, but they're still involved. The wife's anorexia and the child's well-being are factors, but that doesn't justify the affair. The author is in a position where they're contributing to the man's situation rather than supporting him through the process of leaving legally. The answer would likely be that the author is in the wrong because they are in a relationship with a married man, regardless of his intentions to leave.\n"
