Specifically trampolining. I have am was a high level national athlete. I have competed at tons of national level competitions and have even competed at quite a few international competitions representing Team Canada. At my peak I was trainning at the trampoline gym 6 times a week, and all my training added up to nearly 30 hours a week on top of high school. Near the end of my career I was even getting funding to continue my sport. Eventually I had to quit because of a head injury, but this was still a huge part of my life and I was immensely proud of it. \n\nMy girlfriend and I met a few months after I stopped competing, and she's heard quite a bit about my sport and always thought it was quite cool. She played volleyball in high school and had played on something rep volleyball teams. Nothing too crazy but I still thought it was pretty cool.\n\nThe other day we were discussing sports, and she was telling me how she had wished she played more volleyball and pursued it further. I told her that it was a great feeling to be really good at something and really enjoy it. I told her that it was a lot of work but it felt great to be a top level athlete at a sport. Queue the following conversation:\n\nHer: Yeah, well it's a little different isn't it?\n\nMe: What do you mean?\n\nHer: I mean you were good, but trampolining isn't a real sport.\n\nMe: How do you figure that? I was literally training as much as I went to school and Canada has arguably the most competitive trampolining scene in the world.\n\nHer: Well there's pretty much no one that does that sport. It's not hard to get to a high level, if you played a real sport like soccer you never would've been that good.\n\nI dumped her on the spot. That sport had such a huge impact on who I am today. I dedicated thousands of hours and even ended up getting paid some money to continue training. I was probably within the top 500 athletes worldwide. It felt like she was attacking who I am.\n\nHer friends all said that I'm an asshole for breaking up over something so small. This truly hurt, and it's a sentiment I received from people my whole life. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong for dumping his girlfriend because she made fun of his sport, trampolining.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the context. The author dedicated 12 years to trampolining, was a national athlete, trained extensively, and had funding. That's a significant commitment. When they met, the girlfriend initially thought it was cool and listened to his stories. Then, during a conversation about sports, she dismissed trampolining as not a real sport, implying it's less legitimate than something like soccer. The author took this as an attack on his identity and dumped her immediately. His friends think he's being an asshole over something small.\n\nNow, the key points here are about respect and the value of personal achievements. The girlfriend's comment could be seen as undermining his dedication and accomplishments. If someone dismisses a part of your identity that you've worked hard on, it's understandable to feel hurt. However, is the author justified in breaking up over this? Relationships require mutual respect. If her comment was a one-time joke and not a recurring issue, maybe the author overreacted. But if she consistently devalues his passions, it's a red flag.\n\nThe girlfriend's friends say it's too small an issue, but that's subjective. What's a small comment to one person might be a big issue to another, especially if it targets something central to their identity. The author's reaction is about feeling attacked, which is a valid emotional response. However, breaking up immediately without discussion could be seen as impulsive. A better approach might have been to address the hurt feelings and see if there's a misunderstanding or if it's part of a pattern.\n\nOn the other hand, if her comment reflects a deeper disrespect for his passions, which are a major part of who he is, then ending the relationship isn't entirely unwarranted. The question is whether the comment was a legitimate critique or a personal attack. She made a judgment about the sport's legitimacy, which might be based on her own biases but still hurtful.\n\nIn terms of right and wrong, it's a bit of a gray area. The author's dedication is valid, and feeling disrespected is a real issue. However, reacting by dumping her immediately without attempting to resolve the conflict could be seen as hasty. The girlfriend's friends might not understand the weight of the issue, but in a relationship, respecting each other's passions is crucial. If her comment is part of a pattern of minimizing his achievements, then the author is justified. But as a single incident, maybe he overreacted. \n\nSo, considering all factors, the author might not be entirely in the wrong. His feelings are valid, and the breakup, while abrupt, was in response to a personal attack on a significant aspect of his identity. However, the situation could have been handled more constructively. But since the question is about being in the wrong, and the girlfriend's comment was disrespectful to his achievements, the author's perspective has merit. Therefore, the answer is B (the author is not in the wrong).\n"
