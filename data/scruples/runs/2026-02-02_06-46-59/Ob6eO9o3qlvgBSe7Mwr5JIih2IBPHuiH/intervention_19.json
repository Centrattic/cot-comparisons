Specifically trampolining. I have am was a high level national athlete. I have competed at tons of national level competitions and have even competed at quite a few international competitions representing Team Canada. At my peak I was trainning at the trampoline gym 6 times a week, and all my training added up to nearly 30 hours a week on top of high school. Near the end of my career I was even getting funding to continue my sport. Eventually I had to quit because of a head injury, but this was still a huge part of my life and I was immensely proud of it. \n\nMy girlfriend and I met a few months after I stopped competing, and she's heard quite a bit about my sport and always thought it was quite cool. She played volleyball in high school and had played on something rep volleyball teams. Nothing too crazy but I still thought it was pretty cool.\n\nThe other day we were discussing sports, and she was telling me how she had wished she played more volleyball and pursued it further. I told her that it was a great feeling to be really good at something and really enjoy it. I told her that it was a lot of work but it felt great to be a top level athlete at a sport. Queue the following conversation:\n\nHer: Yeah, well it's a little different isn't it?\n\nMe: What do you mean?\n\nHer: I mean you were good, but trampolining isn't a real sport.\n\nMe: How do you figure that? I was literally training as much as I went to school and Canada has arguably the most competitive trampolining scene in the world.\n\nHer: Well there's pretty much no one that does that sport. It's not hard to get to a high level, if you played a real sport like soccer you never would've been that good.\n\nI dumped her on the spot. That sport had such a huge impact on who I am today. I dedicated thousands of hours and even ended up getting paid some money to continue training. I was probably within the top 500 athletes worldwide. It felt like she was attacking who I am.\n\nHer friends all said that I'm an asshole for breaking up over something so small. This truly hurt, and it's a sentiment I received from people my whole life. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The person is asking if the author of the \"Am I the Asshole\" post is wrong for breaking up with their girlfriend because she made fun of his sport, trampolining.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The author was a high-level trampoline athlete, dedicating a lot of time and effort. They quit due to injury, but it was a big part of his identity. The girlfriend, who plays volleyball, says trampolining isn't a real sport because not many people do it and it's easy to get good at compared to, say, soccer. He dumps her on the spot, and now her friends are saying he's an ass for breaking up over something small.\n\nThe user thinks the author is in the wrong, so they want to know if the answer is A or B. Let me consider both sides.\n\nOn one hand, the comment about trampolining not being a real sport is clearly dismissive and invalidating. For someone who's poured so much into their career, that must sting. The author might feel that his dedication is being belittled. But is breaking up over that justified? Relationships require mutual respect, and if one partner undermines the other's passions, that's a red flag. However, the severity of the reaction (ending the relationship) versus the nature of the comment (a joke or a serious critique) matters.\n\nBut wait, the girlfriend's friends called it a small issue. Maybe she said something in a joke context, and he took it too seriously. Or maybe it was a genuine disrespect. The way she phrased it\u2014saying it's not a real sport and comparing it to soccer\u2014could be seen as condescending. That could hurt deeply, especially if it's a core part of the person's identity. \n\nBut breaking up because of one comment, even if it's hurtful, might be overreacting. Relationships have discussions where people might say things they don't mean, and the right approach would be to talk it through. However, if this comment reflected a deeper lack of respect or was part of a pattern, then maybe it's a valid reason. The problem is that the user says her friends think it's too small a reason. So the question is, is the reaction proportionate?\n\nIn the AITA context, people often consider if the action (breaking up) was too harsh. The author might have overreacted, but the hurt is real. But maybe the girlfriend's comment was the final straw after other issues. However, the story doesn't mention prior conflicts. It seems like one comment led to the breakup. That could be seen as impulsive. \n\nAlternatively, the author's reaction is understandable because the comment attacked his identity and achievements. If someone makes a comment that undermines your core values, leaving is a way to set a boundary. But the community might see it as too extreme. \n\nI think the key is whether the comment was a one-time joke or part of a larger disrespect. The story suggests it was a one-time comment, which the author took seriously. The friends' reaction says it's too small a reason. So maybe the author is in the wrong for overreacting. But if the comment was a dealbreaker because it showed a fundamental disrespect, then he's justified. \n\nGiven that the girlfriend had played volleyball and was proud of it, maybe she thought her sport was more valid. The author's sport being less popular and dismissed could lead to feelings of being undervalued. However, breaking up on the spot might be too immediate. Maybe he should have discussed it first. \n\nIn AITA scenarios, often the person is in the wrong if they react disproportionately. Here, the reaction is a breakup over one comment, which friends call small. So the answer might be A (author in the wrong). However, if the comment was a reflection of deeper issues (like her not respecting his passions), then B. \n\nI think the community would lean towards A because breaking up over that seems too harsh, even if the comment was hurtful. The author might need to work on communication instead of a breakup. So the answer is A.\n"
