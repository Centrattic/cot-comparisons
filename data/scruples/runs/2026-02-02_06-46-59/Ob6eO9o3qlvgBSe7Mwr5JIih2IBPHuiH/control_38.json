Specifically trampolining. I have am was a high level national athlete. I have competed at tons of national level competitions and have even competed at quite a few international competitions representing Team Canada. At my peak I was trainning at the trampoline gym 6 times a week, and all my training added up to nearly 30 hours a week on top of high school. Near the end of my career I was even getting funding to continue my sport. Eventually I had to quit because of a head injury, but this was still a huge part of my life and I was immensely proud of it. \n\nMy girlfriend and I met a few months after I stopped competing, and she's heard quite a bit about my sport and always thought it was quite cool. She played volleyball in high school and had played on something rep volleyball teams. Nothing too crazy but I still thought it was pretty cool.\n\nThe other day we were discussing sports, and she was telling me how she had wished she played more volleyball and pursued it further. I told her that it was a great feeling to be really good at something and really enjoy it. I told her that it was a lot of work but it felt great to be a top level athlete at a sport. Queue the following conversation:\n\nHer: Yeah, well it's a little different isn't it?\n\nMe: What do you mean?\n\nHer: I mean you were good, but trampolining isn't a real sport.\n\nMe: How do you figure that? I was literally training as much as I went to school and Canada has arguably the most competitive trampolining scene in the world.\n\nHer: Well there's pretty much no one that does that sport. It's not hard to get to a high level, if you played a real sport like soccer you never would've been that good.\n\nI dumped her on the spot. That sport had such a huge impact on who I am today. I dedicated thousands of hours and even ended up getting paid some money to continue training. I was probably within the top 500 athletes worldwide. It felt like she was attacking who I am.\n\nHer friends all said that I'm an asshole for breaking up over something so small. This truly hurt, and it's a sentiment I received from people my whole life. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong for breaking up with his girlfriend because she called trampolining not a real sport. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The guy put in a lot of time and dedication into trampolining, which is a serious sport. He was competing nationally and internationally, even getting funding. His girlfriend, who played volleyball, made a comment that trampolining isn't a real sport and that it's easier than soccer. The guy took it really hard and broke up with her immediately. \n\nNow, considering the context. The comment about trampolining not being a real sport could be seen as dismissive or belittling. The guy's sport is important to his identity. He dedicated 12 years and had significant achievements. So, being told that his sport isn't valid could feel like an attack on his hard work and identity.\n\nBut is breaking up over that too much? Some people might say yes, because it's a big reaction to a casual comment. Others might say that if this comment hit a nerve because of the importance of the sport to him, then the breakup isn't unwarranted. The girlfriend's friends called him an asshole, implying that the issue is trivial. However, the emotional impact on the guy was significant.\n\nI should consider whether the girlfriend's comments were meant to be harmful or just a joke. The guy might have taken it the wrong way, but the girlfriend might not have realized how much it meant to him. Alternatively, maybe the girlfriend's comment was a bit snobbish, implying that only sports like soccer are real or hard. \n\nThe key here is the emotional response. If the guy felt that his identity was being attacked, then maybe the breakup is justified. But if the comment was a minor issue that doesn't reflect the overall relationship, then maybe he overreacted. It's a tricky balance between personal values and relationship health. \n\nIn the AITA (Am I the Asshole?) questions, the community often looks at intent and impact. Even if the girlfriend didn't mean to hurt, the impact was real. So, the guy's reaction might not be wrong if the comment deeply hurt him and he felt disrespected. On the other hand, breaking up immediately without discussion could be seen as impulsive. \n\nBut given the context of his dedication and the emotional weight of the comment, the community might side with him. So the answer would be B (Not in the wrong). However, some might argue that it's a small issue to break up over, hence A. But considering the personal significance, B is more likely.\n"
