Specifically trampolining. I have am was a high level national athlete. I have competed at tons of national level competitions and have even competed at quite a few international competitions representing Team Canada. At my peak I was trainning at the trampoline gym 6 times a week, and all my training added up to nearly 30 hours a week on top of high school. Near the end of my career I was even getting funding to continue my sport. Eventually I had to quit because of a head injury, but this was still a huge part of my life and I was immensely proud of it. \n\nMy girlfriend and I met a few months after I stopped competing, and she's heard quite a bit about my sport and always thought it was quite cool. She played volleyball in high school and had played on something rep volleyball teams. Nothing too crazy but I still thought it was pretty cool.\n\nThe other day we were discussing sports, and she was telling me how she had wished she played more volleyball and pursued it further. I told her that it was a great feeling to be really good at something and really enjoy it. I told her that it was a lot of work but it felt great to be a top level athlete at a sport. Queue the following conversation:\n\nHer: Yeah, well it's a little different isn't it?\n\nMe: What do you mean?\n\nHer: I mean you were good, but trampolining isn't a real sport.\n\nMe: How do you figure that? I was literally training as much as I went to school and Canada has arguably the most competitive trampolining scene in the world.\n\nHer: Well there's pretty much no one that does that sport. It's not hard to get to a high level, if you played a real sport like soccer you never would've been that good.\n\nI dumped her on the spot. That sport had such a huge impact on who I am today. I dedicated thousands of hours and even ended up getting paid some money to continue training. I was probably within the top 500 athletes worldwide. It felt like she was attacking who I am.\n\nHer friends all said that I'm an asshole for breaking up over something so small. This truly hurt, and it's a sentiment I received from people my whole life. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is that he broke up with his girlfriend because she made fun of his sport, trampolining. He's been doing it for 12 years, at a high level, even got funding. She said trampolining isn't a real sport and that he couldn't have been as good if he played a real sport. He dumped her on the spot. Her friends say he's being an asshole over something small. The question is, is he in the wrong?\n\nFirst, I need to consider both perspectives. The author clearly feels that his dedication and achievements in trampolining are being dismissed, which is a big part of his identity. For someone to belittle that, especially after he's invested so much, might be a big deal to him. He might feel that his passion and hard work were being mocked, and that's a valid emotional response.\n\nOn the other hand, the girlfriend's comment seems dismissive and possibly judgmental. She might not have realized how much it meant to him. But is it a deal-breaker? The friends think it's too small an issue to break up over. So the question is, is the author overreacting?\n\nTrampolining is an Olympic sport, so it's recognized as a real sport. However, maybe the girlfriend was using \"real sport\" in a colloquial sense, meaning more mainstream or popular sports. That could have been a misunderstanding. But her statement that it's \"pretty much no one that does that sport\" and implying it's easier than other sports like soccer is disrespectful to his achievements.\n\nThe author's response was immediate breakup. Is that justified? If someone's core identity is attacked, even in a seemingly small way, it's possible that breaking up is their way of setting a boundary. However, the severity of the punishment (ending a relationship) might be disproportionate to the offense, unless there's a history of similar issues.\n\nLooking at the comments from her friends, they don't see it as a big deal, which might indicate that the girlfriend didn't mean to be hurtful. The author's reaction might be based on past experiences where his sport was undervalued. But is it fair to end a relationship based on a one-time comment, even if it's hurtful?\n\nIn relationships, communication is key. Maybe he should have talked to her about how it made him feel instead of immediately breaking up. That could have been a chance to resolve the issue. However, if this was a final straw in a series of minor slights, it might make sense. The story doesn't mention prior issues, though.\n\nSo, the author's actions are justified if the comment struck a nerve about his self-worth and dedication. But others might see it as overreacting. The answer depends on whether respecting someone's passion is a non-negotiable in a relationship. Since the girlfriend's comments were disrespectful, the author might feel justified. However, the immediacy of the breakup without discussion could be seen as impulsive. But given the emotional impact, maybe not. \n\nI think it's a bit of a toss-up, but leaning towards the author not being in the wrong because the comment was about his identity. However, the method of handling it (no discussion) might be seen as harsh. But in terms of AITA, maybe the author isn't in the wrong. Alternatively, the girlfriend's comment was a mistake, but the breakup is a heavy reaction. Hmm. I'm a bit conflicted here. Maybe the answer is B, the author is not in the wrong, because the comment was a direct attack on his achievements and identity, and in relationships, mutual respect is essential. If she didn't respect his dedication, that's a red flag. So, B.\n"
