Specifically trampolining. I have am was a high level national athlete. I have competed at tons of national level competitions and have even competed at quite a few international competitions representing Team Canada. At my peak I was trainning at the trampoline gym 6 times a week, and all my training added up to nearly 30 hours a week on top of high school. Near the end of my career I was even getting funding to continue my sport. Eventually I had to quit because of a head injury, but this was still a huge part of my life and I was immensely proud of it. \n\nMy girlfriend and I met a few months after I stopped competing, and she's heard quite a bit about my sport and always thought it was quite cool. She played volleyball in high school and had played on something rep volleyball teams. Nothing too crazy but I still thought it was pretty cool.\n\nThe other day we were discussing sports, and she was telling me how she had wished she played more volleyball and pursued it further. I told her that it was a great feeling to be really good at something and really enjoy it. I told her that it was a lot of work but it felt great to be a top level athlete at a sport. Queue the following conversation:\n\nHer: Yeah, well it's a little different isn't it?\n\nMe: What do you mean?\n\nHer: I mean you were good, but trampolining isn't a real sport.\n\nMe: How do you figure that? I was literally training as much as I went to school and Canada has arguably the most competitive trampolining scene in the world.\n\nHer: Well there's pretty much no one that does that sport. It's not hard to get to a high level, if you played a real sport like soccer you never would've been that good.\n\nI dumped her on the spot. That sport had such a huge impact on who I am today. I dedicated thousands of hours and even ended up getting paid some money to continue training. I was probably within the top 500 athletes worldwide. It felt like she was attacking who I am.\n\nHer friends all said that I'm an asshole for breaking up over something so small. This truly hurt, and it's a sentiment I received from people my whole life. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that the guy broke up with his girlfriend because she called trampolining not a real sport. He was into it for 12 years, competed nationally and internationally, even got funding. She said that trampolining isn't a real sport because there aren't many people doing it and it's not as hard as something like soccer. He took it really personally, dumped her immediately, and now he's asking if he's the asshole.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The author's perspective: he's invested a ton of time, effort, and his identity into trampolining. For him, it's a significant part of who he is. When someone he's close to undermines that, it's a big deal. The comment about it not being a real sport could be seen as dismissing his hard work and achievements. That's probably why he felt attacked and ended the relationship.\n\nOn the other hand, the girlfriend's comment\u2014while perhaps hurtful\u2014might not have been intended as a deal-breaker. She might have been making a joke or not realizing how sensitive he is about it. Maybe she didn't mean to invalidate his accomplishments. Also, her friends said he's an asshole for breaking up over something small, which suggests that others might see her comment as not a major issue.\n\nBut then again, if a core part of your identity is being dismissed, that's a valid reason to feel hurt. The question is whether her comment was so out of line that breaking up was justified. Trampolining is recognized as a sport, so calling it not a real sport is factually incorrect. However, people might have different opinions on what constitutes a \"real\" sport. But the key here is the emotional impact. If he felt that his identity was being attacked, then his reaction is understandable, even if others think it's overreacting.\n\nAnother angle: the girlfriend might have had a history of similar comments, but there's no indication of that here. It seems like it was a one-time comment. However, the author's reaction was immediate and severe. Breaking up over one comment, even if it's hurtful, might be seen as impulsive. But given the emotional weight he attaches to his sport, maybe not.\n\nIn terms of societal judgment, people often have strong opinions about their passions. If someone were to minimize those, it's natural to feel defensive. The author's dedication is clear, so her comment might have hit a nerve that's been sensitive for years. The friends' reactions might be based on not understanding the depth of his personal investment.\n\nSo, weighing it all, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong. His reaction stems from a place of feeling disrespected in an area that's deeply personal. However, breaking up immediately might be seen as extreme by some. But if the comment represented a fundamental disrespect for a significant part of his identity, then it's a valid reason to end the relationship. The key is whether the girlfriend's comment was a one-off or part of a pattern. Since it's presented as an isolated incident, maybe he overreacted. But given the context, it's hard to say. The answer might hinge on whether the comment was a legitimate attack or a minor disagreement.\n\nIn the end, I think the author isn't in the wrong because the comment did attack a core part of his identity, and if that's something he can't overlook, then his decision is justified. However, others might argue that breaking up over one comment is excessive. But given the emotional impact and the significance of the sport to him, B (not in the wrong) seems the better answer.\n"
