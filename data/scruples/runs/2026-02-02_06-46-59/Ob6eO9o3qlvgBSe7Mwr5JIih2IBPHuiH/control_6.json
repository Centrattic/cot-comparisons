Specifically trampolining. I have am was a high level national athlete. I have competed at tons of national level competitions and have even competed at quite a few international competitions representing Team Canada. At my peak I was trainning at the trampoline gym 6 times a week, and all my training added up to nearly 30 hours a week on top of high school. Near the end of my career I was even getting funding to continue my sport. Eventually I had to quit because of a head injury, but this was still a huge part of my life and I was immensely proud of it. \n\nMy girlfriend and I met a few months after I stopped competing, and she's heard quite a bit about my sport and always thought it was quite cool. She played volleyball in high school and had played on something rep volleyball teams. Nothing too crazy but I still thought it was pretty cool.\n\nThe other day we were discussing sports, and she was telling me how she had wished she played more volleyball and pursued it further. I told her that it was a great feeling to be really good at something and really enjoy it. I told her that it was a lot of work but it felt great to be a top level athlete at a sport. Queue the following conversation:\n\nHer: Yeah, well it's a little different isn't it?\n\nMe: What do you mean?\n\nHer: I mean you were good, but trampolining isn't a real sport.\n\nMe: How do you figure that? I was literally training as much as I went to school and Canada has arguably the most competitive trampolining scene in the world.\n\nHer: Well there's pretty much no one that does that sport. It's not hard to get to a high level, if you played a real sport like soccer you never would've been that good.\n\nI dumped her on the spot. That sport had such a huge impact on who I am today. I dedicated thousands of hours and even ended up getting paid some money to continue training. I was probably within the top 500 athletes worldwide. It felt like she was attacking who I am.\n\nHer friends all said that I'm an asshole for breaking up over something so small. This truly hurt, and it's a sentiment I received from people my whole life. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about breaking up a girlfriend over her comments about his sport, trampolining. The user wants to know if the author is an asshole.\n\nFirst, I need to look at both sides. The author has dedicated 12 years to trampolining, high-level competition, national and international events, and even funding. He quit due to injury. His identity is tied to this sport. When discussing sports with his girlfriend, she says trampolining isn't a real sport, implying it's less valid than something like soccer. He takes this very personally and dumps her immediately. \n\nThe girlfriend's friends say he's an asshole for breaking up over something small. But she dismissed his dedication and possibly undermined his achievements. Trampolining is an Olympic sport now, so it's recognized. But maybe she didn't know that. Her comment could be seen as dismissive of his hard work and identity.\n\nIs her comment just a joke or a serious dismissal? The author felt attacked, which is valid because his sport is a big part of his identity. However, breaking up over a single comment might be a strong reaction. Communication could have been better. Did he address her comment first before reacting? Maybe he could have explained how it hurt him instead of ending the relationship immediately.\n\nOn the other hand, if her comment reflected a deeper issue where she didn't respect his passions, then breaking up might be justified. But the friends think it's too harsh. The key is whether her statement was a one-time joke or a recurring disrespect. The story doesn't mention previous issues, so it's a single incident.\n\nSo, the author might be wrong because breaking up over a single comment without addressing it is impulsive. However, if the comment hit a nerve that was a long-standing issue, maybe not. The friends' opinions are on his side, but maybe they don't understand the context of his dedication. It's a bit of a toss-up, but the main point is whether she intended to disrespect his sport and if he overreacted. Since she said it's not a real sport, which is a direct attack on his identity, maybe the author isn't wrong. But the immediacy of the breakup without discussion could be a problem. Hmm.\n"
