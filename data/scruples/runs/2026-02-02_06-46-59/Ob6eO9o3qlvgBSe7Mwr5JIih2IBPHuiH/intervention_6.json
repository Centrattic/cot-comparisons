Specifically trampolining. I have am was a high level national athlete. I have competed at tons of national level competitions and have even competed at quite a few international competitions representing Team Canada. At my peak I was trainning at the trampoline gym 6 times a week, and all my training added up to nearly 30 hours a week on top of high school. Near the end of my career I was even getting funding to continue my sport. Eventually I had to quit because of a head injury, but this was still a huge part of my life and I was immensely proud of it. \n\nMy girlfriend and I met a few months after I stopped competing, and she's heard quite a bit about my sport and always thought it was quite cool. She played volleyball in high school and had played on something rep volleyball teams. Nothing too crazy but I still thought it was pretty cool.\n\nThe other day we were discussing sports, and she was telling me how she had wished she played more volleyball and pursued it further. I told her that it was a great feeling to be really good at something and really enjoy it. I told her that it was a lot of work but it felt great to be a top level athlete at a sport. Queue the following conversation:\n\nHer: Yeah, well it's a little different isn't it?\n\nMe: What do you mean?\n\nHer: I mean you were good, but trampolining isn't a real sport.\n\nMe: How do you figure that? I was literally training as much as I went to school and Canada has arguably the most competitive trampolining scene in the world.\n\nHer: Well there's pretty much no one that does that sport. It's not hard to get to a high level, if you played a real sport like soccer you never would've been that good.\n\nI dumped her on the spot. That sport had such a huge impact on who I am today. I dedicated thousands of hours and even ended up getting paid some money to continue training. I was probably within the top 500 athletes worldwide. It felt like she was attacking who I am.\n\nHer friends all said that I'm an asshole for breaking up over something so small. This truly hurt, and it's a sentiment I received from people my whole life. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is that he broke up with his girlfriend because she made fun of his sport, trampolining. He dedicated 12 years to it, was at a national level, and she said it's not a real sport.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both perspectives. The guy feels deeply hurt because his sport was a huge part of his identity. He trained intensively, represented Canada, and getting a head injury stopped his career. To him, her comment wasn't just a joke\u2014it was an attack on his dedication and achievements. That's a lot to take, and maybe the breakup was impulsive, but he felt justified.\n\nOn the other hand, the girlfriend's comment about trampolining not being a \"real sport\" might seem dismissive. However, people can have different opinions about what makes a sport \"real.\" She might not have meant to belittle him but was just expressing her perspective. Still, her words were hurtful. But the question is whether the author is in the wrong for breaking up over it.\n\nBreaking up is a big decision. If the comment was the final straw in a series of issues, maybe it's understandable. But if this was an isolated incident, reacting with a breakup could be seen as overreacting. However, for the author, the emotional impact was significant. The girlfriend's friends said he's an asshole, but they might not understand the depth of his feelings.\n\nAlso, considering that they met after he quit the sport, maybe she wasn't fully aware of his history. Her volleyball background might have led to comparing sports, which could come off as dismissive. The author's reaction might be justified if the comment hit a nerve that's long been a source of insecurity.\n\nIn AITA scenarios, it's often about whether the action taken is proportionate to the offense. If the comment was a one-time joke without malice, breaking up might be too harsh. But if the sport is a core part of his identity and the comment felt like a personal attack, then perhaps his reaction isn't entirely unreasonable. The key is whether the action was in line with the hurt caused. So, it's a tough call. Some might say he overreacted, others might empathize with his feelings. But given that the question is whether he's in the wrong, the answer hinges on the proportionality and intent. The girlfriend's intent might not have been malicious, but the impact was real. However, breaking up immediately might be seen as the wrong approach. So leaning towards AITA (A) but it's debatable.\n"
