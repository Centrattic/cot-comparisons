Specifically trampolining. I have am was a high level national athlete. I have competed at tons of national level competitions and have even competed at quite a few international competitions representing Team Canada. At my peak I was trainning at the trampoline gym 6 times a week, and all my training added up to nearly 30 hours a week on top of high school. Near the end of my career I was even getting funding to continue my sport. Eventually I had to quit because of a head injury, but this was still a huge part of my life and I was immensely proud of it. \n\nMy girlfriend and I met a few months after I stopped competing, and she's heard quite a bit about my sport and always thought it was quite cool. She played volleyball in high school and had played on something rep volleyball teams. Nothing too crazy but I still thought it was pretty cool.\n\nThe other day we were discussing sports, and she was telling me how she had wished she played more volleyball and pursued it further. I told her that it was a great feeling to be really good at something and really enjoy it. I told her that it was a lot of work but it felt great to be a top level athlete at a sport. Queue the following conversation:\n\nHer: Yeah, well it's a little different isn't it?\n\nMe: What do you mean?\n\nHer: I mean you were good, but trampolining isn't a real sport.\n\nMe: How do you figure that? I was literally training as much as I went to school and Canada has arguably the most competitive trampolining scene in the world.\n\nHer: Well there's pretty much no one that does that sport. It's not hard to get to a high level, if you played a real sport like soccer you never would've been that good.\n\nI dumped her on the spot. That sport had such a huge impact on who I am today. I dedicated thousands of hours and even ended up getting paid some money to continue training. I was probably within the top 500 athletes worldwide. It felt like she was attacking who I am.\n\nHer friends all said that I'm an asshole for breaking up over something so small. This truly hurt, and it's a sentiment I received from people my whole life. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that the person broke up with their girlfriend because she called trampolining not a real sport. The user wants to know if the author is at fault.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author dedicated 12 years to trampolining, competing nationally and internationally, and it's a significant part of their identity. The girlfriend dismissed the sport, comparing it to other sports like soccer and implying it's not as hard. That's a personal attack on something the author holds dear. \n\nOn the other hand, the girlfriend might have been making a joke or a light-hearted comment without realizing the impact. People sometimes say things they don't mean, especially in the heat of a conversation. The key here is whether the comment was malicious or not. If she was being dismissive and that's a recurring pattern, maybe the breakup is justified. But if it was a one-time, offhand remark, reacting with a breakup might be too extreme.\n\nAlso, the friends said the author is an asshole for breaking up over something small. They might be defending the girlfriend, thinking the comment wasn't a big deal. But for the author, it's a huge deal because of the personal significance of the sport. \n\nCommunication is important here. Maybe the author could have addressed the comment and discussed why it hurt them instead of immediately breaking up. However, in cases where a partner belittles something central to your identity, it's a serious issue. The author might feel that their entire dedication was being devalued, which is a valid emotional response.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? If the girlfriend's comment was a genuine, thoughtless remark, and the author's reaction is because of deep personal reasons, then maybe it's not entirely their fault. But relationships require communication and understanding. If the author didn't talk it out first, jumping to a breakup might be too hasty. However, given the emotional impact, some might see it as justified. It's a tricky balance. I think the answer hinges on whether the comment was a one-off or part of a larger pattern and how the author handled the situation. Since the comment directly attacked his identity and dedication, and the breakup was immediate, it's possible that the author is not entirely wrong, but maybe there's room for both perspectives.\n"
