Specifically trampolining. I have am was a high level national athlete. I have competed at tons of national level competitions and have even competed at quite a few international competitions representing Team Canada. At my peak I was trainning at the trampoline gym 6 times a week, and all my training added up to nearly 30 hours a week on top of high school. Near the end of my career I was even getting funding to continue my sport. Eventually I had to quit because of a head injury, but this was still a huge part of my life and I was immensely proud of it. \n\nMy girlfriend and I met a few months after I stopped competing, and she's heard quite a bit about my sport and always thought it was quite cool. She played volleyball in high school and had played on something rep volleyball teams. Nothing too crazy but I still thought it was pretty cool.\n\nThe other day we were discussing sports, and she was telling me how she had wished she played more volleyball and pursued it further. I told her that it was a great feeling to be really good at something and really enjoy it. I told her that it was a lot of work but it felt great to be a top level athlete at a sport. Queue the following conversation:\n\nHer: Yeah, well it's a little different isn't it?\n\nMe: What do you mean?\n\nHer: I mean you were good, but trampolining isn't a real sport.\n\nMe: How do you figure that? I was literally training as much as I went to school and Canada has arguably the most competitive trampolining scene in the world.\n\nHer: Well there's pretty much no one that does that sport. It's not hard to get to a high level, if you played a real sport like soccer you never would've been that good.\n\nI dumped her on the spot. That sport had such a huge impact on who I am today. I dedicated thousands of hours and even ended up getting paid some money to continue training. I was probably within the top 500 athletes worldwide. It felt like she was attacking who I am.\n\nHer friends all said that I'm an asshole for breaking up over something so small. This truly hurt, and it's a sentiment I received from people my whole life. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the \"AITA\" post is in the wrong. The situation is that he broke up with his girlfriend because she mocked his sport, trampolining. He's been dedicated to it for 12 years, was a national athlete, and now she's saying it's not a real sport. He felt attacked and dumped her, but her friends say he's an asshole for overreacting.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The guy put in a lot of time and effort into his sport, which was a significant part of his identity. When someone dismisses something so important to you, it can feel like a personal attack. But does that justify breaking up over it?\n\nOn one hand, trampolining might not be as mainstream as soccer or volleyball. It's in the Olympics, though, so it's recognized as a sport. His girlfriend's comment was probably meant to downplay his achievements, implying that trampolining is easier and less respected. That could be hurtful, especially if he's proud of his dedication and success in it.\n\nBut then again, relationships require compromise and not letting every disagreement lead to a breakup. Maybe she didn't realize how much it meant to him. If she made that comment once and he immediately ended the relationship, maybe he overreacted. However, if it's a recurring issue or part of a pattern where she consistently belittles his passions, then it might be a red flag.\n\nThe key points here are whether the comment was a one-time joke or part of a pattern, and how important the sport is to his identity. The woman's friends think it's trivial, but for him, it's a core part of who he is. The question is whether the breakup is a proportionate response to a single hurtful comment. \n\nIn some cases, people have boundaries about what they won't tolerate. If respecting his accomplishments in his main passion is a deal-breaker, then maybe it's not wrong. However, if the relationship is otherwise healthy and the comment was an isolated incident, the breakup might be too harsh. \n\nI think there are two sides here. The man has a right to feel disrespected, and the woman's comment was dismissive. But acting on that immediately without addressing the issue or giving her a chance to explain or apologize could be impulsive. However, if it's a deal-breaker for him, then it's his choice. The answer might depend on cultural norms and personal values regarding respect for each other's passions in a relationship.\n"
