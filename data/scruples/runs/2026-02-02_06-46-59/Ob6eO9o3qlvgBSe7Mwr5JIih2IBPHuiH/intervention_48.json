Specifically trampolining. I have am was a high level national athlete. I have competed at tons of national level competitions and have even competed at quite a few international competitions representing Team Canada. At my peak I was trainning at the trampoline gym 6 times a week, and all my training added up to nearly 30 hours a week on top of high school. Near the end of my career I was even getting funding to continue my sport. Eventually I had to quit because of a head injury, but this was still a huge part of my life and I was immensely proud of it. \n\nMy girlfriend and I met a few months after I stopped competing, and she's heard quite a bit about my sport and always thought it was quite cool. She played volleyball in high school and had played on something rep volleyball teams. Nothing too crazy but I still thought it was pretty cool.\n\nThe other day we were discussing sports, and she was telling me how she had wished she played more volleyball and pursued it further. I told her that it was a great feeling to be really good at something and really enjoy it. I told her that it was a lot of work but it felt great to be a top level athlete at a sport. Queue the following conversation:\n\nHer: Yeah, well it's a little different isn't it?\n\nMe: What do you mean?\n\nHer: I mean you were good, but trampolining isn't a real sport.\n\nMe: How do you figure that? I was literally training as much as I went to school and Canada has arguably the most competitive trampolining scene in the world.\n\nHer: Well there's pretty much no one that does that sport. It's not hard to get to a high level, if you played a real sport like soccer you never would've been that good.\n\nI dumped her on the spot. That sport had such a huge impact on who I am today. I dedicated thousands of hours and even ended up getting paid some money to continue training. I was probably within the top 500 athletes worldwide. It felt like she was attacking who I am.\n\nHer friends all said that I'm an asshole for breaking up over something so small. This truly hurt, and it's a sentiment I received from people my whole life. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the \"AITA\" post is in the wrong for dumping his girlfriend because she made fun of his sport, trampolining.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The author dedicated 12 years to trampolining, was a national and international athlete, and had funding. Then, after quitting due to injury, he starts a relationship with his girlfriend. She made a comment about trampolining not being a real sport compared to something like soccer. He took that as an attack on his identity and effort, and broke up with her immediately.\n\nNow, the key points here. The girlfriend's comment seems dismissive of his dedication and achievements. She implied that his sport isn't respected or difficult, which can be really hurtful when someone else has invested so much. The author felt that she was attacking who he is, which is a valid emotional response. However, the question is whether his reaction is justified.\n\nOn one hand, everyone has the right to feel defensive about what's important to them. If someone's identity is tied to their sport, a dismissive comment can feel personal. The girlfriend might not have realized the depth of his feelings about trampolining. Maybe she was just being flippant without understanding his history. But on the other hand, breaking up over a single comment, even if it's hurtful, might seem extreme. Relationships require communication and understanding. Instead of ending things immediately, could there have been a conversation about how her words hurt him?\n\nBut wait, the girlfriend's friends said he was an asshole for breaking up over something small. That's a common reaction in these situations. However, the author isn't breaking up over the comment itself, but the underlying disrespect for his identity. Maybe the issue isn't just the comment but the fact that she trivialized his years of dedication. \n\nIn relationships, it's important to respect each other's passions and achievements. If one partner makes a habit of belittling the other's interests, that's a problem. But this was a one-time comment. The author might be overreacting, but if it's a dealbreaker for him, then it's his right to end the relationship. The question is whether the severity of the reaction (dumping her) is in line with the issue.\n\nThe girlfriend's statement that trampolining isn't a real sport and that getting good at it isn't as hard as soccer is objectively incorrect. Trampolining requires immense skill, discipline, and physical training. The author's response was to end the relationship, which might be seen as extreme, but if it's a core part of who he is, maybe it's justified. \n\nHowever, the question is whether he's in the wrong. If he felt that his identity was attacked and couldn't move past it, then he isn't wrong for ending the relationship. But if the comment was an isolated incident and not part of a larger pattern, some might argue that he overreacted. But others might say that respecting each other's achievements is fundamental in a relationship.\n\nI think the answer depends on the context of their relationship. If this was the first sign of disrespect, then maybe it's a valid reason. But if there were no prior issues, breaking up over one hurtful comment might be seen as disproportionate. However, given the emotional weight the author attached to his sport, and the fact that the comment was a direct attack on his identity, it's possible he's justified. \n\nSo, considering all that, I'm leaning towards the author not being in the wrong. He has the right to feel that his dedication was disrespected. However, the friends' opinions might be influenced by not knowing the full context. The key is that the author felt attacked, and if that's a dealbreaker, then he's not wrong for leaving. Therefore, the answer would be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
