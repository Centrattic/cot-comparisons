Specifically trampolining. I have am was a high level national athlete. I have competed at tons of national level competitions and have even competed at quite a few international competitions representing Team Canada. At my peak I was trainning at the trampoline gym 6 times a week, and all my training added up to nearly 30 hours a week on top of high school. Near the end of my career I was even getting funding to continue my sport. Eventually I had to quit because of a head injury, but this was still a huge part of my life and I was immensely proud of it. \n\nMy girlfriend and I met a few months after I stopped competing, and she's heard quite a bit about my sport and always thought it was quite cool. She played volleyball in high school and had played on something rep volleyball teams. Nothing too crazy but I still thought it was pretty cool.\n\nThe other day we were discussing sports, and she was telling me how she had wished she played more volleyball and pursued it further. I told her that it was a great feeling to be really good at something and really enjoy it. I told her that it was a lot of work but it felt great to be a top level athlete at a sport. Queue the following conversation:\n\nHer: Yeah, well it's a little different isn't it?\n\nMe: What do you mean?\n\nHer: I mean you were good, but trampolining isn't a real sport.\n\nMe: How do you figure that? I was literally training as much as I went to school and Canada has arguably the most competitive trampolining scene in the world.\n\nHer: Well there's pretty much no one that does that sport. It's not hard to get to a high level, if you played a real sport like soccer you never would've been that good.\n\nI dumped her on the spot. That sport had such a huge impact on who I am today. I dedicated thousands of hours and even ended up getting paid some money to continue training. I was probably within the top 500 athletes worldwide. It felt like she was attacking who I am.\n\nHer friends all said that I'm an asshole for breaking up over something so small. This truly hurt, and it's a sentiment I received from people my whole life. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong. The situation is that he broke up with his girlfriend because she made fun of his sport, trampolining, calling it not a real sport and implying it's easy compared to other sports like soccer.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the context. He dedicated 12 years to trampolining, was a high-level athlete, and it's a significant part of his identity. She, on the other hand, played volleyball but not at a high level. The argument arises when she dismisses his sport as not real, comparing it to soccer. He felt this was an attack on his dedication and identity, leading him to dump her immediately.\n\nSo, the question is whether he's in the wrong for breaking up over this. Let's break it down. On one hand, his reaction seems extreme. Breaking up over one comment might be seen as overreacting. But on the other hand, sports can be a core part of someone's identity, and having that belittled can feel like a personal attack. The girlfriend's comments could be considered dismissive and disrespectful, especially given his achievements.\n\nBut then again, maybe the girlfriend had a point in her phrasing. She might have been trying to compliment him by saying others find trampolining easier, but the way she phrased it came off as mocking. However, the fact that he broke up immediately without addressing the issue first could be seen as hasty. Relationships often require communication and understanding, not immediate breakups over conflicts.\n\nAlso, the girlfriend's friends called him an asshole, which might indicate that his reaction was perceived as too harsh. But the user's own opinion is that the author is in the wrong, but they're seeking another perspective.\n\nI should consider if there's a middle ground. Perhaps the author was justified in feeling disrespected, but the method of resolving the conflict (breaking up immediately) was inappropriate. However, the question is whether he's in the wrong. If the girlfriend's comment was a legitimate insult to his identity, then maybe he's not at fault. But if the comment was a minor issue and he overreacted, then he is.\n\nAnother angle is the context of their relationship. If they had other issues or if this was a recurring problem, maybe breaking up was warranted. But the scenario suggests this was a one-time comment. Also, the girlfriend's own sports background (volleyball) might have influenced her perspective, but that doesn't excuse her comment.\n\nIn AITA scenarios, sometimes the key is whether the action taken was proportionate. Dumping someone over a single conversation might be extreme unless there's a history of similar issues. The author's dedication to his sport and the emotional impact of the comment might justify his reaction, but others might see it as overreacting.\n\nSo, weighing these factors, the answer could lean towards the author being in the wrong if the breakup was too hasty. However, if the girlfriend's comment was a deep personal attack on a core part of his identity, then maybe not. The community's response (friends calling him an asshole) also suggests that the immediate breakup was seen as excessive.\n\nIn conclusion, the answer likely is A (he's in the wrong) because breaking up over a single comment, even if hurtful, is an extreme reaction without addressing the issue first. The girlfriend's comment was disrespectful, but the immediate breakup might not be the correct approach in a healthy relationship.\n"
