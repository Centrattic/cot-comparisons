Specifically trampolining. I have am was a high level national athlete. I have competed at tons of national level competitions and have even competed at quite a few international competitions representing Team Canada. At my peak I was trainning at the trampoline gym 6 times a week, and all my training added up to nearly 30 hours a week on top of high school. Near the end of my career I was even getting funding to continue my sport. Eventually I had to quit because of a head injury, but this was still a huge part of my life and I was immensely proud of it. \n\nMy girlfriend and I met a few months after I stopped competing, and she's heard quite a bit about my sport and always thought it was quite cool. She played volleyball in high school and had played on something rep volleyball teams. Nothing too crazy but I still thought it was pretty cool.\n\nThe other day we were discussing sports, and she was telling me how she had wished she played more volleyball and pursued it further. I told her that it was a great feeling to be really good at something and really enjoy it. I told her that it was a lot of work but it felt great to be a top level athlete at a sport. Queue the following conversation:\n\nHer: Yeah, well it's a little different isn't it?\n\nMe: What do you mean?\n\nHer: I mean you were good, but trampolining isn't a real sport.\n\nMe: How do you figure that? I was literally training as much as I went to school and Canada has arguably the most competitive trampolining scene in the world.\n\nHer: Well there's pretty much no one that does that sport. It's not hard to get to a high level, if you played a real sport like soccer you never would've been that good.\n\nI dumped her on the spot. That sport had such a huge impact on who I am today. I dedicated thousands of hours and even ended up getting paid some money to continue training. I was probably within the top 500 athletes worldwide. It felt like she was attacking who I am.\n\nHer friends all said that I'm an asshole for breaking up over something so small. This truly hurt, and it's a sentiment I received from people my whole life. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong for breaking up with his girlfriend because she called trampolining not a real sport.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The guy spent 12 years training in trampolining, represented Canada, got funding, etc. His girlfriend, who used to play volleyball, said trampolining isn't a real sport and that it's not hard to get to a high level compared to other sports. He immediately dumped her. His friends think he's an a**hole for overreacting. He's asking if he's in the wrong.\n\nHmm. So, the key points here are about the value of his dedication versus her comment. The question is whether the breakup was justified. \n\nTrampolining is indeed an Olympic sport, so technically it is a real sport. The girlfriend's dismissal of it might come off as dismissive of his hard work and achievements. However, people might have different opinions on what constitutes a 'real' sport. Maybe she was being dismissive for fun or not realizing how much it meant to him.\n\nHe broke up with her immediately. That's a huge step. Even if her comment was hurtful, is cutting off a relationship over one comment too extreme? The friends think so. On the other hand, if this comment tapped into a deep insecurity or years of feeling unappreciated, maybe he had valid reasons. But usually, relationships require working through issues, not breaking up over one argument.\n\nThe AITA crowd often looks for intent and the proportionality of the reaction. If she made a thoughtless comment that was deeply personal, and he overreacted, then he might be in the wrong. But if he felt that his identity and years of work were being undermined, maybe not. However, relationships typically require communication. Instead of dumping her, maybe he should have discussed his feelings with her first.\n\nSo, considering all that, the answer might be A (he's in the wrong) because the breakup was an extreme reaction to a single comment. Even if her comment was hurtful, ending the relationship immediately without dialogue is likely disproportionate. Unless there's a history of similar issues, which isn't mentioned here. The friends' opinion also supports that he overreacted. The fact that she's in a different sport (volleyball) and he's in a less mainstream one might have played a role in her comment, but that doesn't justify the breakup. So, probably A.\n"
