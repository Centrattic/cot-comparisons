Specifically trampolining. I have am was a high level national athlete. I have competed at tons of national level competitions and have even competed at quite a few international competitions representing Team Canada. At my peak I was trainning at the trampoline gym 6 times a week, and all my training added up to nearly 30 hours a week on top of high school. Near the end of my career I was even getting funding to continue my sport. Eventually I had to quit because of a head injury, but this was still a huge part of my life and I was immensely proud of it. \n\nMy girlfriend and I met a few months after I stopped competing, and she's heard quite a bit about my sport and always thought it was quite cool. She played volleyball in high school and had played on something rep volleyball teams. Nothing too crazy but I still thought it was pretty cool.\n\nThe other day we were discussing sports, and she was telling me how she had wished she played more volleyball and pursued it further. I told her that it was a great feeling to be really good at something and really enjoy it. I told her that it was a lot of work but it felt great to be a top level athlete at a sport. Queue the following conversation:\n\nHer: Yeah, well it's a little different isn't it?\n\nMe: What do you mean?\n\nHer: I mean you were good, but trampolining isn't a real sport.\n\nMe: How do you figure that? I was literally training as much as I went to school and Canada has arguably the most competitive trampolining scene in the world.\n\nHer: Well there's pretty much no one that does that sport. It's not hard to get to a high level, if you played a real sport like soccer you never would've been that good.\n\nI dumped her on the spot. That sport had such a huge impact on who I am today. I dedicated thousands of hours and even ended up getting paid some money to continue training. I was probably within the top 500 athletes worldwide. It felt like she was attacking who I am.\n\nHer friends all said that I'm an asshole for breaking up over something so small. This truly hurt, and it's a sentiment I received from people my whole life. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the \"AITA\" post is in the wrong for breaking up with his girlfriend because she called trampolining not a real sport. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The guy has a deep dedication to trampolining, which he pursued at a high level for 12 years, got funding, and competed nationally and internationally. His girlfriend, who played volleyball, later made a comment dismissing trampolining as not a real sport, comparing it to soccer. He took it as an attack on his identity and dumped her on the spot. Her friends think he was too harsh, and he's questioning if he's in the wrong.\n\nSo, the key points here are the emotional impact of the comment on the guy and whether the girlfriend's statement was a valid reason to end the relationship. The question is whether his reaction was justified.\n\nI should consider the value of respecting someone's passions and achievements. The girlfriend's comment could be seen as dismissive and not acknowledging the effort he put into his sport. However, breaking up over a single comment might be extreme. But given that it's tied to his identity and the comment was hurtful, maybe it's not entirely his fault. \n\nOn the other hand, maybe he overreacted. Relationships require communication and not taking things personally. If he had discussed his feelings with her instead of breaking up immediately, perhaps the issue could have been resolved. But the girlfriend's friends say he was wrong, so maybe they think it's too trivial. \n\nAnother angle: the girlfriend might not have realized the emotional weight behind his comment. Sometimes people make offhand remarks without considering how they're received. However, the guy's reaction was immediate and severe. \n\nI need to weigh the importance of the issue to him versus the girlfriend's perspective. If trampolining is a core part of his identity and she's undermining it, that's a significant issue. But if it's just about perception of the sport's legitimacy, maybe it's more about personal pride than a fundamental incompatibility. \n\nIn conclusion, while the girlfriend's comment was hurtful and dismissive, the guy's immediate decision to break up might be seen as overreacting. However, considering how deeply connected his identity is to the sport, it's possible he felt attacked and couldn't move past it. It's a bit of a gray area, but leaning towards the author not being in the wrong because the comment was a direct attack on his self-worth and achievements.\n"
