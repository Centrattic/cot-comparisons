Specifically trampolining. I have am was a high level national athlete. I have competed at tons of national level competitions and have even competed at quite a few international competitions representing Team Canada. At my peak I was trainning at the trampoline gym 6 times a week, and all my training added up to nearly 30 hours a week on top of high school. Near the end of my career I was even getting funding to continue my sport. Eventually I had to quit because of a head injury, but this was still a huge part of my life and I was immensely proud of it. \n\nMy girlfriend and I met a few months after I stopped competing, and she's heard quite a bit about my sport and always thought it was quite cool. She played volleyball in high school and had played on something rep volleyball teams. Nothing too crazy but I still thought it was pretty cool.\n\nThe other day we were discussing sports, and she was telling me how she had wished she played more volleyball and pursued it further. I told her that it was a great feeling to be really good at something and really enjoy it. I told her that it was a lot of work but it felt great to be a top level athlete at a sport. Queue the following conversation:\n\nHer: Yeah, well it's a little different isn't it?\n\nMe: What do you mean?\n\nHer: I mean you were good, but trampolining isn't a real sport.\n\nMe: How do you figure that? I was literally training as much as I went to school and Canada has arguably the most competitive trampolining scene in the world.\n\nHer: Well there's pretty much no one that does that sport. It's not hard to get to a high level, if you played a real sport like soccer you never would've been that good.\n\nI dumped her on the spot. That sport had such a huge impact on who I am today. I dedicated thousands of hours and even ended up getting paid some money to continue training. I was probably within the top 500 athletes worldwide. It felt like she was attacking who I am.\n\nHer friends all said that I'm an asshole for breaking up over something so small. This truly hurt, and it's a sentiment I received from people my whole life. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong for dumping his girlfriend because she called his sport, trampolining, not a real sport. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the arguments from both sides. The author dedicated 12 years to trampolining, reaching national and international levels, getting funding, and it's a huge part of his identity. When his girlfriend downplays his sport by saying it's not a real sport and implies it's easier than other sports like soccer, he takes it as an attack on his dedication and identity, leading him to break up.\n\nOn the other hand, the girlfriend might not have intended to invalidate his achievements. Maybe she was making a joke or was unaware of how important the sport was to him. Her friends called him an asshole, suggesting that breaking up over this was too harsh. \n\nThe key points here are: the emotional impact of the comment on the author, the context of their relationship, and whether the comment was a dealbreaker. The author might feel that his passion and dedication were disrespected, but others might see it as an overreaction. \n\nIt's possible that the author could have addressed the issue without breaking up. Communication is often key in relationships. However, if the comment struck a nerve because it touched on a long-standing insecurity or disrespect, then the reaction might be understandable from his perspective. \n\nBut considering that the girlfriend had no prior issues and this was a one-time comment, the author's decision to end the relationship might be seen as disproportionate. The friends' reactions support that. Still, the author's feelings about his identity being attacked are valid. \n\nSo, balancing these factors, the answer isn't clear-cut. However, since the question is whether he's in the wrong, if the comment was a genuine misunderstanding and he reacted too strongly, he might be at fault. But if the comment was a dealbreaker for him, then not. The community often looks at intent and proportionality. Since the girlfriend didn't mean to attack him, and the author escalated it, he might be in the wrong. But if the comment was the last straw for him, then maybe not. \n\nHmm. I think the answer is A (in the wrong) because breaking up over a single comment, even if hurtful, could be seen as too harsh. It's important to address such issues with communication rather than immediate breakup. Unless there's a history of similar issues, which there isn't mentioned here. So, AITA is a common Reddit thread where people often advise to talk it out unless it's a major issue. Here, the sport's validity is subjective, and the girlfriend's comment might not have been meant to devalue his achievements. Therefore, the author is in the wrong.\n"
