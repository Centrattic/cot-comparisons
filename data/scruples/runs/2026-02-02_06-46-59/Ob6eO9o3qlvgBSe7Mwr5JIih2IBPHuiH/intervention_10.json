Specifically trampolining. I have am was a high level national athlete. I have competed at tons of national level competitions and have even competed at quite a few international competitions representing Team Canada. At my peak I was trainning at the trampoline gym 6 times a week, and all my training added up to nearly 30 hours a week on top of high school. Near the end of my career I was even getting funding to continue my sport. Eventually I had to quit because of a head injury, but this was still a huge part of my life and I was immensely proud of it. \n\nMy girlfriend and I met a few months after I stopped competing, and she's heard quite a bit about my sport and always thought it was quite cool. She played volleyball in high school and had played on something rep volleyball teams. Nothing too crazy but I still thought it was pretty cool.\n\nThe other day we were discussing sports, and she was telling me how she had wished she played more volleyball and pursued it further. I told her that it was a great feeling to be really good at something and really enjoy it. I told her that it was a lot of work but it felt great to be a top level athlete at a sport. Queue the following conversation:\n\nHer: Yeah, well it's a little different isn't it?\n\nMe: What do you mean?\n\nHer: I mean you were good, but trampolining isn't a real sport.\n\nMe: How do you figure that? I was literally training as much as I went to school and Canada has arguably the most competitive trampolining scene in the world.\n\nHer: Well there's pretty much no one that does that sport. It's not hard to get to a high level, if you played a real sport like soccer you never would've been that good.\n\nI dumped her on the spot. That sport had such a huge impact on who I am today. I dedicated thousands of hours and even ended up getting paid some money to continue training. I was probably within the top 500 athletes worldwide. It felt like she was attacking who I am.\n\nHer friends all said that I'm an asshole for breaking up over something so small. This truly hurt, and it's a sentiment I received from people my whole life. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of this \"Am I the Asshole?\" post is in the wrong. The situation is that the author dumped his girlfriend after she made fun of his sport, trampolining. The author has a long history with trampolining, dedicating 12 years and even getting national recognition. The girlfriend, however, called trampolining not a real sport and implied he wouldn't have been good at a more popular sport like soccer. The author found this offensive and broke up immediately, while her friends say he's being an asshole for such a minor issue.\n\nSo, the question is whether the author is right to break up over this. Let me break down the key points. \n\nFirst, the girlfriend's comment: she said trampolining isn't a real sport, which is clearly dismissive of his dedication and achievements. The author felt this was an attack on his identity and the years he invested. From his perspective, this was a core part of who he is, so her dismissal might have felt like a personal attack. \n\nOn the other hand, the girlfriend might have been making a joke or a light-hearted comment without realizing the weight it carried. People often have preferences or biases towards more mainstream sports, not understanding the rigor of less popular ones. Her friends think the breakup is overreacting, implying that maybe the issue was minor and not worth ending the relationship over. \n\nNow, considering if the author is in the wrong. Breaking up over a single comment could be seen as extreme, especially if there's no prior history of such disrespect. However, if this comment struck a nerve because of his deep personal connection to the sport, it might be a justified reaction. The key is whether the girlfriend's words were intended to be hurtful and if the author's response is proportionate. \n\nIf the girlfriend made that comment out of spite or repeated belittlement, then the author might have every right to leave. But if it was an offhand remark in a conversation about sports, and the author immediately ended things without discussion, it could be seen as overreacting. Relationships require communication and understanding, so maybe the better approach would have been to talk it out and express how her words hurt him, rather than ending it immediately. \n\nAlso, the girlfriend's comparison to soccer might have been a way to downplay his achievements, which is disrespectful. The author's dedication and the sacrifices he made are valid, and her comment could be seen as undermining his hard work. However, the appropriateness of the breakup depends on the context of their relationship. If they had other issues or if this was a recurring pattern, but the post doesn't mention that. \n\nIn summary, while the girlfriend's comment was disrespectful and hurtful, breaking up immediately after a single statement might be seen as disproportionate unless there were prior tensions. The author has a right to feel disrespected, but reacting with a breakup without addressing the issue could be seen as extreme. Therefore, there might be some fault on both sides, but the question is whether the author is in the wrong. Given the options, the answer would likely be A, that the author is in the wrong, because the reaction seems disproportionate unless there's more context.\n"
