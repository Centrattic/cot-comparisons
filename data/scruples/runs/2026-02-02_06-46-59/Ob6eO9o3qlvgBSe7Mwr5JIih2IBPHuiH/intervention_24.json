Specifically trampolining. I have am was a high level national athlete. I have competed at tons of national level competitions and have even competed at quite a few international competitions representing Team Canada. At my peak I was trainning at the trampoline gym 6 times a week, and all my training added up to nearly 30 hours a week on top of high school. Near the end of my career I was even getting funding to continue my sport. Eventually I had to quit because of a head injury, but this was still a huge part of my life and I was immensely proud of it. \n\nMy girlfriend and I met a few months after I stopped competing, and she's heard quite a bit about my sport and always thought it was quite cool. She played volleyball in high school and had played on something rep volleyball teams. Nothing too crazy but I still thought it was pretty cool.\n\nThe other day we were discussing sports, and she was telling me how she had wished she played more volleyball and pursued it further. I told her that it was a great feeling to be really good at something and really enjoy it. I told her that it was a lot of work but it felt great to be a top level athlete at a sport. Queue the following conversation:\n\nHer: Yeah, well it's a little different isn't it?\n\nMe: What do you mean?\n\nHer: I mean you were good, but trampolining isn't a real sport.\n\nMe: How do you figure that? I was literally training as much as I went to school and Canada has arguably the most competitive trampolining scene in the world.\n\nHer: Well there's pretty much no one that does that sport. It's not hard to get to a high level, if you played a real sport like soccer you never would've been that good.\n\nI dumped her on the spot. That sport had such a huge impact on who I am today. I dedicated thousands of hours and even ended up getting paid some money to continue training. I was probably within the top 500 athletes worldwide. It felt like she was attacking who I am.\n\nHer friends all said that I'm an asshole for breaking up over something so small. This truly hurt, and it's a sentiment I received from people my whole life. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking whether the author of the \"Am I the Asshole\" (AITA) post is in the wrong for breaking up with his girlfriend after she mocked his sport, trampolining.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation thoroughly. The man dedicated 12 years to trampolining, competed nationally and internationally, and even received funding. His girlfriend made a comment that trampolining isn't a real sport and implied it's easier than other sports like soccer. He took this as an attack on his identity and effort, leading him to break up immediately. His friends think he's an asshole for overreacting, but he's unsure.\n\nNow, considering the factors. The key points here are the significance of the sport to his identity and the girlfriend's comment. She dismissed his dedication and achievements, which he clearly valued highly. The comment isn't just about the sport; it's about minimizing his hard work and accomplishments. That can be deeply hurtful when someone else trivializes something you've poured your life into.\n\nOn the other hand, relationships require mutual respect. If one partner regularly belittles the other's passions or achievements, that's a red flag. However, in this case, the comment was made once during a conversation. The girlfriend might not have intended it as an attack, maybe she was just expressing her opinion, albeit poorly. But the man's reaction was immediate and extreme\u2014breaking up right then. That could be seen as overreacting, especially if this was a one-time comment and not a pattern of behavior.\n\nBut wait, the context matters. For him, trampolining is a huge part of his identity. The comment felt like an attack on his hard work and self-worth. In that light, his reaction might be justified because respecting each other's passions is crucial in a relationship. If she can't respect his achievements, it could lead to deeper issues.\n\nHowever, ending a relationship over a single, albeit hurtful, comment might be impulsive. Communication could have been a better approach. He could have discussed how her words hurt him and sought understanding. Jumping to a breakup without addressing the issue might prevent resolution.\n\nBut the question is about whether he's in the wrong. The girlfriend's statement was dismissive and disrespectful. If someone's core identity is being attacked, it's reasonable to feel that the relationship lacks mutual respect. In that case, ending the relationship isn't the wrong choice.\n\nI'm a bit torn. On one hand, reacting immediately without discussing is impulsive. On the other, the comment was deeply disrespectful. The decision hinges on the importance of mutual respect versus the need for communication. Since the comment was about his dedication and achievements, which are significant, it's possible he's not in the wrong. He's standing up for himself against invalidation. So maybe the answer is B (not in the wrong).\n"
