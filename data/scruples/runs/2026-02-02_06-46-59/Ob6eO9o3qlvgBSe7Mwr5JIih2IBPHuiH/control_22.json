Specifically trampolining. I have am was a high level national athlete. I have competed at tons of national level competitions and have even competed at quite a few international competitions representing Team Canada. At my peak I was trainning at the trampoline gym 6 times a week, and all my training added up to nearly 30 hours a week on top of high school. Near the end of my career I was even getting funding to continue my sport. Eventually I had to quit because of a head injury, but this was still a huge part of my life and I was immensely proud of it. \n\nMy girlfriend and I met a few months after I stopped competing, and she's heard quite a bit about my sport and always thought it was quite cool. She played volleyball in high school and had played on something rep volleyball teams. Nothing too crazy but I still thought it was pretty cool.\n\nThe other day we were discussing sports, and she was telling me how she had wished she played more volleyball and pursued it further. I told her that it was a great feeling to be really good at something and really enjoy it. I told her that it was a lot of work but it felt great to be a top level athlete at a sport. Queue the following conversation:\n\nHer: Yeah, well it's a little different isn't it?\n\nMe: What do you mean?\n\nHer: I mean you were good, but trampolining isn't a real sport.\n\nMe: How do you figure that? I was literally training as much as I went to school and Canada has arguably the most competitive trampolining scene in the world.\n\nHer: Well there's pretty much no one that does that sport. It's not hard to get to a high level, if you played a real sport like soccer you never would've been that good.\n\nI dumped her on the spot. That sport had such a huge impact on who I am today. I dedicated thousands of hours and even ended up getting paid some money to continue training. I was probably within the top 500 athletes worldwide. It felt like she was attacking who I am.\n\nHer friends all said that I'm an asshole for breaking up over something so small. This truly hurt, and it's a sentiment I received from people my whole life. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the \"AITA\" post is in the wrong for dumping his girlfriend because she made fun of his sport, trampolining.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The author spent 12 years training in trampolining, reached a high level, even got funding, and then quit due to injury. His girlfriend, who plays volleyball, downplays his sport by saying it's not a real sport and that it's easy compared to something like soccer. He dumps her immediately. Her friends think he's an asshole for breaking up over something small, but he feels it's about the value of his dedication.\n\nSo, the key points here are: Is the author justified in breaking up over this comment? Did the girlfriend's statement cross a line that's a deal-breaker? \n\nThe girlfriend's comment seems dismissive of his significant personal achievement and dedication. For someone who has invested so much time and effort, being told that their sport isn't valid could be deeply hurtful. It might touch on issues of respect and validation. The author might feel that his identity and hard work are being trivialized, which could be a legitimate reason for ending the relationship.\n\nOn the other hand, some might argue that the reaction is too harsh, that the girlfriend's comment was a joke or not meant to be taken seriously. The friends think it's a small issue, so maybe the author overreacted. But considering the emotional weight of the comment and the importance of the sport to the author's identity, it's not just a small comment\u2014it's an attack on his personal achievements and self-worth.\n\nAlso, respect is a two-way street in relationships. If one partner is consistently belittling the other's passions, that's a red flag. The girlfriend's statement could indicate a lack of empathy or understanding, which is a problem in the relationship. The author's decision to end the relationship could be seen as standing up for himself and his values.\n\nSo, weighing these factors, the author might be justified in his actions. The girlfriend's comment wasn't just a small joke but a dismissal of his hard work and identity. The answer might be B (author not in the wrong). But I need to check if there's a possibility the author is overreacting. However, given the context, the hurt and the significance of the sport to him, it's a valid reaction. Friends might not get it because they don't know the personal investment involved. Therefore, the answer is B.\n"
