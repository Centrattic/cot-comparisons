Specifically trampolining. I have am was a high level national athlete. I have competed at tons of national level competitions and have even competed at quite a few international competitions representing Team Canada. At my peak I was trainning at the trampoline gym 6 times a week, and all my training added up to nearly 30 hours a week on top of high school. Near the end of my career I was even getting funding to continue my sport. Eventually I had to quit because of a head injury, but this was still a huge part of my life and I was immensely proud of it. \n\nMy girlfriend and I met a few months after I stopped competing, and she's heard quite a bit about my sport and always thought it was quite cool. She played volleyball in high school and had played on something rep volleyball teams. Nothing too crazy but I still thought it was pretty cool.\n\nThe other day we were discussing sports, and she was telling me how she had wished she played more volleyball and pursued it further. I told her that it was a great feeling to be really good at something and really enjoy it. I told her that it was a lot of work but it felt great to be a top level athlete at a sport. Queue the following conversation:\n\nHer: Yeah, well it's a little different isn't it?\n\nMe: What do you mean?\n\nHer: I mean you were good, but trampolining isn't a real sport.\n\nMe: How do you figure that? I was literally training as much as I went to school and Canada has arguably the most competitive trampolining scene in the world.\n\nHer: Well there's pretty much no one that does that sport. It's not hard to get to a high level, if you played a real sport like soccer you never would've been that good.\n\nI dumped her on the spot. That sport had such a huge impact on who I am today. I dedicated thousands of hours and even ended up getting paid some money to continue training. I was probably within the top 500 athletes worldwide. It felt like she was attacking who I am.\n\nHer friends all said that I'm an asshole for breaking up over something so small. This truly hurt, and it's a sentiment I received from people my whole life. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so the user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong for dumping his girlfriend because she made fun of his sport, trampolining. Let me try to break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, the context: The author was a high-level trampoline athlete, dedicating a lot of time and effort, even representing Canada. He quit due to injury. They met after he stopped competing. The girlfriend comments that trampolining isn't a real sport, implying it's less valid than others like soccer. He dumps her on the spot, and her friends say he's an asshole. He's asking if he's the one in the wrong.\n\nSo, the main issue here is whether dismissing a sport as \"not real\" is a valid reason to break up. The author feels deeply hurt because the sport was a huge part of his identity. The girlfriend's comment seems dismissive and devaluing of his achievements. But others might argue that it's a minor comment and overreacting.\n\nI need to consider a few factors. First, the significance of the sport in the author's life. He dedicated 12 years, trained intensely, and had national/international recognition. For someone to trivialize that could be deeply hurtful. His reaction might be seen as justified because it's about respect for his personal achievements and identity.\n\nOn the other hand, the girlfriend's friends are saying it's too small a reason to break up. Maybe she didn't mean to insult him, just made a light-hearted comment. But then again, if someone makes a joke that undermines a significant part of your identity, is that a deal-breaker? It depends on the relationship's dynamics and how the comment was received. The author felt attacked, so the emotional impact is real.\n\nAlso, the girlfriend's own sport (volleyball) is considered a real sport, but she downplays trampolining. That inconsistency might add to the hurt. The author might feel her comment is hypocritical or shows a lack of understanding.\n\nBut is the author overreacting? Breaking up over a single comment could be seen as extreme. However, if this comment tapped into deeper insecurities or past experiences of being dismissed, it's a valid reaction. Relationships require mutual respect, and if one partner's actions or words undermine the other's core identity, that's a serious issue.\n\nIn AITA scenarios, the key is whether the action was reasonable given the circumstances. The author felt his identity was attacked, leading to a breakup. While some might see it as overreacting, others would support standing up for oneself. The community's response is mixed\u2014his side and her friends. The answer depends on valuing respect in relationships and the weight of the comment.\n"
