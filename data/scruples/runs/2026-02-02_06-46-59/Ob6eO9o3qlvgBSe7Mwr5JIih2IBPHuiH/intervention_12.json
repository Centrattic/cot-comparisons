Specifically trampolining. I have am was a high level national athlete. I have competed at tons of national level competitions and have even competed at quite a few international competitions representing Team Canada. At my peak I was trainning at the trampoline gym 6 times a week, and all my training added up to nearly 30 hours a week on top of high school. Near the end of my career I was even getting funding to continue my sport. Eventually I had to quit because of a head injury, but this was still a huge part of my life and I was immensely proud of it. \n\nMy girlfriend and I met a few months after I stopped competing, and she's heard quite a bit about my sport and always thought it was quite cool. She played volleyball in high school and had played on something rep volleyball teams. Nothing too crazy but I still thought it was pretty cool.\n\nThe other day we were discussing sports, and she was telling me how she had wished she played more volleyball and pursued it further. I told her that it was a great feeling to be really good at something and really enjoy it. I told her that it was a lot of work but it felt great to be a top level athlete at a sport. Queue the following conversation:\n\nHer: Yeah, well it's a little different isn't it?\n\nMe: What do you mean?\n\nHer: I mean you were good, but trampolining isn't a real sport.\n\nMe: How do you figure that? I was literally training as much as I went to school and Canada has arguably the most competitive trampolining scene in the world.\n\nHer: Well there's pretty much no one that does that sport. It's not hard to get to a high level, if you played a real sport like soccer you never would've been that good.\n\nI dumped her on the spot. That sport had such a huge impact on who I am today. I dedicated thousands of hours and even ended up getting paid some money to continue training. I was probably within the top 500 athletes worldwide. It felt like she was attacking who I am.\n\nHer friends all said that I'm an asshole for breaking up over something so small. This truly hurt, and it's a sentiment I received from people my whole life. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. Let me go through the details again. The person was a high-level trampoline gymnast, trained for 12 years, and had national/international experience. He quit due to injury. He met his girlfriend after that. She played volleyball in high school, not at a super high level. They were talking about sports, and the conversation got heated when she dismissed trampolining as not a real sport, comparing it to soccer where he wouldn't have been good.\n\nHe took it really personally, dumped her immediately, and now people are saying he's an asshole for overreacting. His friends and her friends think it's a small issue. The question is whether he's in the wrong.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the validity of her comment. She said trampolining isn't a real sport. That's subjective, but maybe she was being dismissive. However, the author took it as an attack on his identity because it was such a big part of his life. The key here is whether her comment was a harmless joke or a serious dismissal. The example given is she said \"if you played a real sport like soccer...\" which might imply she thinks trampolining is less valid. That can be seen as disrespectful, especially given his dedication.\n\nBut then again, in relationships, how you handle disagreements matters. Dumping someone immediately over one comment, even if hurtful, might be seen as overreacting. The author might have had a right to be hurt, but the immediate breakup without discussion could be problematic. People's friends are saying it's too much. Also, considering that she might not have realized the depth of his feelings about the sport. Maybe there were prior issues, but the story doesn't mention that. There's also the aspect of whether her statement crosses into invalidating his entire identity and achievements. If someone dismisses a core part of another person's life, that can be damaging.\n\nOn the other hand, the author could have handled it by discussing it calmly, not breaking up immediately. However, if this statement triggered a deep emotional response because it's tied to his self-worth, maybe his reaction is understandable. The problem is balance between valid hurt and overreaction.\n\nIn some perspectives, taking a joke too seriously is on the person who gets upset. But if the joke wasn't a joke and was a genuine insult, then it's different. The line between a joke and an insult is blurry here. The author's reaction seems extreme, but if the comment was a real dismissal of his achievements, it's a valid hurt. So, the answer here might depend on whether the comment was in bad faith. The scenario doesn't provide that context. The friends of both sides are split, with her friends saying he's wrong. The author's friends might not be mentioned, but the narrative is from his perspective.\n\nIn terms of AITA standards, people are often blamed for overreacting unless there's a history of issues or the comment was clearly malicious. Here, the comment might be seen as a joke, but the author took it as an attack. So, maybe AITA is on the author for breaking up over it. However, if the comment was indeed an attack on his identity, then it's justified. But without more context, it's hard to say. The question is whether the author is in the wrong. The answer could be A (yes) if the breakup was overreacting, or B (no) if her comment was an attack on his identity.\n"
