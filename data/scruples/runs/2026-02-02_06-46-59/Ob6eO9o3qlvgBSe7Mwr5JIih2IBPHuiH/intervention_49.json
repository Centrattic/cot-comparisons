Specifically trampolining. I have am was a high level national athlete. I have competed at tons of national level competitions and have even competed at quite a few international competitions representing Team Canada. At my peak I was trainning at the trampoline gym 6 times a week, and all my training added up to nearly 30 hours a week on top of high school. Near the end of my career I was even getting funding to continue my sport. Eventually I had to quit because of a head injury, but this was still a huge part of my life and I was immensely proud of it. \n\nMy girlfriend and I met a few months after I stopped competing, and she's heard quite a bit about my sport and always thought it was quite cool. She played volleyball in high school and had played on something rep volleyball teams. Nothing too crazy but I still thought it was pretty cool.\n\nThe other day we were discussing sports, and she was telling me how she had wished she played more volleyball and pursued it further. I told her that it was a great feeling to be really good at something and really enjoy it. I told her that it was a lot of work but it felt great to be a top level athlete at a sport. Queue the following conversation:\n\nHer: Yeah, well it's a little different isn't it?\n\nMe: What do you mean?\n\nHer: I mean you were good, but trampolining isn't a real sport.\n\nMe: How do you figure that? I was literally training as much as I went to school and Canada has arguably the most competitive trampolining scene in the world.\n\nHer: Well there's pretty much no one that does that sport. It's not hard to get to a high level, if you played a real sport like soccer you never would've been that good.\n\nI dumped her on the spot. That sport had such a huge impact on who I am today. I dedicated thousands of hours and even ended up getting paid some money to continue training. I was probably within the top 500 athletes worldwide. It felt like she was attacking who I am.\n\nHer friends all said that I'm an asshole for breaking up over something so small. This truly hurt, and it's a sentiment I received from people my whole life. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong for dumping his girlfriend over her comments about trampolining not being a real sport. Let me start by understanding the situation.\n\nFirst, the author has put in a lot of time and effort into trampolining, competing nationally and internationally, and even getting funding. Now he's stopped due to a head injury. His girlfriend, who played volleyball, made a comment implying that trampolining isn't a real sport and that it's easier than something like soccer. The author took this as an attack on his identity and dumped her. People are divided, with her friends saying he's an asshole for breaking up over something small, but he feels it was a big deal because it's such a huge part of who he is.\n\nSo, the question is whether he's in the wrong. Let's break it down. On one hand, his sport is a significant part of his identity. The girlfriend's comment could be seen as dismissive and disrespectful. The author might feel that his dedication and achievements aren't valued. On the other hand, maybe the girlfriend was just making a joke or a lighthearted comment without intending to hurt him. Sometimes people say things without realizing the impact. Also, the question is whether breaking up over this is too much of a reaction. \n\nThe key points here are intent versus impact. The girlfriend might not have meant to belittle his sport, but the author perceived it that way. However, the author's reaction was immediate and drastic\u2014breaking up. Is that a proportionate response? Trampolining is recognized as a sport by many international bodies, so calling it \"not real\" could be incorrect, which might add to the author's hurt. But does that justify ending the relationship? \n\nThe author's friends argue it's too small, but for him, it's a big deal. Relationships require communication and understanding. Maybe he should have addressed the issue calmly instead of reacting with a breakup. However, if this comment triggered deeper insecurities or feelings of undervaluation, maybe it was a valid breaking point. \n\nAnother angle: the girlfriend might not see the significance of his sport, but does that make her wrong? People have different values. The problem is whether her comment crossed a line. If she repeatedly dismissed his achievements, that's a problem, but one offhand comment might not be. \n\nIn summary, the author's reaction depends on context. If the comment was a one-time thing and she didn't realize the impact, maybe he overreacted. But if it was part of a pattern of belittlement, then maybe not. The story doesn't mention prior issues, so maybe it's a single incident. Therefore, the author's decision might be seen as too hasty, hence he's in the wrong. Alternatively, if his identity was deeply tied to the sport, her comment could be a dealbreaker. It's a tough call, but leaning towards A (yes, he's in the wrong) because breaking up over a single comment without knowing her intent might be excessive.\n"
