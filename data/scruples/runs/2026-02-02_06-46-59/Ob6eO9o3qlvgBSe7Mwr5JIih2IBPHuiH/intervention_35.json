Specifically trampolining. I have am was a high level national athlete. I have competed at tons of national level competitions and have even competed at quite a few international competitions representing Team Canada. At my peak I was trainning at the trampoline gym 6 times a week, and all my training added up to nearly 30 hours a week on top of high school. Near the end of my career I was even getting funding to continue my sport. Eventually I had to quit because of a head injury, but this was still a huge part of my life and I was immensely proud of it. \n\nMy girlfriend and I met a few months after I stopped competing, and she's heard quite a bit about my sport and always thought it was quite cool. She played volleyball in high school and had played on something rep volleyball teams. Nothing too crazy but I still thought it was pretty cool.\n\nThe other day we were discussing sports, and she was telling me how she had wished she played more volleyball and pursued it further. I told her that it was a great feeling to be really good at something and really enjoy it. I told her that it was a lot of work but it felt great to be a top level athlete at a sport. Queue the following conversation:\n\nHer: Yeah, well it's a little different isn't it?\n\nMe: What do you mean?\n\nHer: I mean you were good, but trampolining isn't a real sport.\n\nMe: How do you figure that? I was literally training as much as I went to school and Canada has arguably the most competitive trampolining scene in the world.\n\nHer: Well there's pretty much no one that does that sport. It's not hard to get to a high level, if you played a real sport like soccer you never would've been that good.\n\nI dumped her on the spot. That sport had such a huge impact on who I am today. I dedicated thousands of hours and even ended up getting paid some money to continue training. I was probably within the top 500 athletes worldwide. It felt like she was attacking who I am.\n\nHer friends all said that I'm an asshole for breaking up over something so small. This truly hurt, and it's a sentiment I received from people my whole life. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong for breaking up with their girlfriend because she made fun of his sport, trampolining.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The author dedicated 12 years to trampolining, competed nationally and internationally, and it was a huge part of his identity. He got a head injury and had to quit. Then he met his girlfriend, who knew about his sport and seemed to think it was cool. When discussing sports, she downplayed trampolining, saying it's not a real sport, that it's not hard to reach a high level, and compared it to a \"real\" sport like soccer. He took this as an attack on his identity and dumped her on the spot. Her friends said he was an asshole for breaking up over something small. The author is wondering if he's the asshole.\n\nThe user thinks the author is in the wrong but wants to hear my opinion. The question is whether the author is wrong (A) or not (B).\n\nSo, I need to evaluate the situation. The key points here are about the value of the sport, the emotional impact, and whether the reaction was proportionate.\n\nTrampolining is an Olympic sport, which does make it a recognized sport. However, people might have different opinions on its difficulty or recognition compared to others. But the girlfriend's comment was dismissive, which could be hurtful. The author felt attacked, which is valid given the personal investment.\n\nBut the question is whether the breakup was justified. The girlfriend made a comment that could be seen as belittling, but did that cross a line? The author's reaction was immediate and severe. Some might argue that while the comment was rude, ending the relationship over it is an overreaction. Others might see it as a valid stand for self-respect.\n\nFactors to consider: Was the comment a one-time thing or part of a pattern? The author says they had discussed sports before, and she had thought it was cool. This was a sudden shift. Maybe she didn't realize the depth of his feelings about his sport. However, the comment itself was dismissive and potentially devaluing his achievements.\n\nThe author's reaction was immediate, which might suggest that the issue was deeply personal and the comment was a trigger. On the other hand, breaking up over a single conversation could be seen as not giving her a chance to apologize or explain.\n\nIn terms of right and wrong, it's often about perspective. The girlfriend's statement could be seen as a lack of respect for his dedication, which is understandable to take offense to. However, the decision to break up based on just that might be seen as extreme unless there were prior issues. The author's friends might not see the sport's significance, but that doesn't mean the author was wrong to feel attacked.\n\nIn AITA threads, the community often considers whether the action was proportionate and if there's room for understanding. If the comment was a deal-breaker because of how much the sport meant to him, then maybe he's not the asshole. However, if the breakup was impulsive without trying to address the issue, then he might be.\n\nI think there's a middle ground. The girlfriend's comment was rude, but the reaction of breaking up immediately could be seen as an overreaction. However, given the emotional investment and the personal attack felt, the author might have a valid reason. The community might be split, but the answer might hinge on whether the comment was a pattern or a one-time thing. Since it was a single instance, and the author had a history of dedication, it's possible he's justified. But others might argue he could have handled it better. Given the user's initial thought that the author is in the wrong, but needing to decide, I think the answer might be B (not in the wrong) because the sport's validity is subjective, and the comment was disrespectful to his achievements. However, some might say the breakup was too harsh. But given the emotional trigger and the importance of the sport to his identity, he's not in the wrong. So B.\n"
