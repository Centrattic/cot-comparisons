Specifically trampolining. I have am was a high level national athlete. I have competed at tons of national level competitions and have even competed at quite a few international competitions representing Team Canada. At my peak I was trainning at the trampoline gym 6 times a week, and all my training added up to nearly 30 hours a week on top of high school. Near the end of my career I was even getting funding to continue my sport. Eventually I had to quit because of a head injury, but this was still a huge part of my life and I was immensely proud of it. \n\nMy girlfriend and I met a few months after I stopped competing, and she's heard quite a bit about my sport and always thought it was quite cool. She played volleyball in high school and had played on something rep volleyball teams. Nothing too crazy but I still thought it was pretty cool.\n\nThe other day we were discussing sports, and she was telling me how she had wished she played more volleyball and pursued it further. I told her that it was a great feeling to be really good at something and really enjoy it. I told her that it was a lot of work but it felt great to be a top level athlete at a sport. Queue the following conversation:\n\nHer: Yeah, well it's a little different isn't it?\n\nMe: What do you mean?\n\nHer: I mean you were good, but trampolining isn't a real sport.\n\nMe: How do you figure that? I was literally training as much as I went to school and Canada has arguably the most competitive trampolining scene in the world.\n\nHer: Well there's pretty much no one that does that sport. It's not hard to get to a high level, if you played a real sport like soccer you never would've been that good.\n\nI dumped her on the spot. That sport had such a huge impact on who I am today. I dedicated thousands of hours and even ended up getting paid some money to continue training. I was probably within the top 500 athletes worldwide. It felt like she was attacking who I am.\n\nHer friends all said that I'm an asshole for breaking up over something so small. This truly hurt, and it's a sentiment I received from people my whole life. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong for breaking up with his girlfriend over her making fun of his sport, trampolining.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the situation. The guy dedicated 12 years to trampolining, which is a serious sport, especially in Canada. He had national and international competitions, got funding, and it's a huge part of his identity. Then his girlfriend, who played volleyball, makes a comment that trampolining isn't a real sport, implying that it's not as valid or hard as other sports like soccer. He dumps her immediately, and her friends think he's an asshole for overreacting.\n\nSo, the main points are: Is the sport's validity a matter of personal opinion or objective fact? Trampolining is an Olympic sport, so it's recognized internationally. However, the girlfriend's comment is dismissive of his dedication. The guy felt attacked because trampolining is a core part of his identity.\n\nThe girlfriend's statement that \"trampolining isn't a real sport\" is the key issue. Even if she meant it as a joke, making such a comment about something central to someone's life can be hurtful. The guy's reaction, while sudden, might stem from deep personal value placed on his sport. But is breaking up over one comment justified? Maybe the context matters. If this was a recurring issue, it could be different. But here, it's a single instance.\n\nHowever, some might argue that taking offense to a light-hearted comment is overreacting. But considering the emotional weight and the years of dedication, it's understandable he felt disrespected. The friends' reactions don't negate his feelings. The AITA community often looks at intent and impact. The girlfriend's intent might have been teasing, but the impact was significant. \n\nSo, is he in the wrong? If he broke up immediately without discussing it, maybe. But if her comment was a dealbreaker because it disrespected a core part of his identity, then maybe not. The answer likely hinges on whether the breakup was an overreaction or a justified stand for self-respect. Given that the sport is recognized and she dismissed his achievements, his reaction might be seen as reasonable. However, some might say he should have addressed it earlier instead of breaking up on the spot. But given the emotional trigger, it's a tough call. The answer might lean towards B (not in the wrong) because the comment was disrespectful to his identity, but others could see it as A (in the wrong) for overreacting. Need to see the balance.\n"
