Specifically trampolining. I have am was a high level national athlete. I have competed at tons of national level competitions and have even competed at quite a few international competitions representing Team Canada. At my peak I was trainning at the trampoline gym 6 times a week, and all my training added up to nearly 30 hours a week on top of high school. Near the end of my career I was even getting funding to continue my sport. Eventually I had to quit because of a head injury, but this was still a huge part of my life and I was immensely proud of it. \n\nMy girlfriend and I met a few months after I stopped competing, and she's heard quite a bit about my sport and always thought it was quite cool. She played volleyball in high school and had played on something rep volleyball teams. Nothing too crazy but I still thought it was pretty cool.\n\nThe other day we were discussing sports, and she was telling me how she had wished she played more volleyball and pursued it further. I told her that it was a great feeling to be really good at something and really enjoy it. I told her that it was a lot of work but it felt great to be a top level athlete at a sport. Queue the following conversation:\n\nHer: Yeah, well it's a little different isn't it?\n\nMe: What do you mean?\n\nHer: I mean you were good, but trampolining isn't a real sport.\n\nMe: How do you figure that? I was literally training as much as I went to school and Canada has arguably the most competitive trampolining scene in the world.\n\nHer: Well there's pretty much no one that does that sport. It's not hard to get to a high level, if you played a real sport like soccer you never would've been that good.\n\nI dumped her on the spot. That sport had such a huge impact on who I am today. I dedicated thousands of hours and even ended up getting paid some money to continue training. I was probably within the top 500 athletes worldwide. It felt like she was attacking who I am.\n\nHer friends all said that I'm an asshole for breaking up over something so small. This truly hurt, and it's a sentiment I received from people my whole life. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong for breaking up with his girlfriend because she made fun of his sport, trampolining.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the context. The author has dedicated 12 years to trampolining, was a national athlete, trained a lot, and even got funding. He quit due to an injury. They met after he stopped competing. She played volleyball in high school but not at a competitive level. During a discussion about sports, she says trampolining isn't a real sport, implies it's easy, and compares it to a real sport like soccer. He dumps her immediately. Her friends say he's an asshole for breaking up over something small. The question is whether he's in the wrong.\n\nNow, considering the factors: The author's sport was a huge part of his identity. He put in a lot of effort and achieved a high level. The comment from the girlfriend seems dismissive and invalidates his dedication. However, breaking up over a single comment might be seen as extreme, even if the comment was hurtful.\n\nBut then, the girlfriend's friends think it's too harsh. Maybe they see it as an overreaction. Trampolining is an Olympic sport, so it's considered a real sport. Her statement that it's not a real sport is factually incorrect, which might add to the insult. However, maybe the girlfriend was being flippant and didn't mean to hurt him, but the way she phrased it was offensive.\n\nThe key points are: the author's dedication and the significance of the sport to his identity. The girlfriend's comment was a direct attack on his passion. However, breaking up immediately could be seen as impulsive. On the other hand, if the comment revealed a deeper lack of respect for his achievements, maybe it was justified.\n\nI need to weigh the validity of the author's feelings against the girlfriend's intent. If the comment was a one-time thing and not a reflection of her true feelings, maybe the author overreacted. But if it's a sign of her inability to respect his identity, then breaking up might be justified. Also, considering that her friends think he's the asshole, but that doesn't necessarily mean he is.\n\nIn some AITA cases, if someone's identity is attacked, it's justified. But others might argue that one comment isn't enough. The answer might be a bit of both, but the system wants a clear A or B. Given the author's deep investment in the sport and the personal attack, maybe the answer is B (not in the wrong). But others might say A because it's a single comment. Hmm.\n"
