Specifically trampolining. I have am was a high level national athlete. I have competed at tons of national level competitions and have even competed at quite a few international competitions representing Team Canada. At my peak I was trainning at the trampoline gym 6 times a week, and all my training added up to nearly 30 hours a week on top of high school. Near the end of my career I was even getting funding to continue my sport. Eventually I had to quit because of a head injury, but this was still a huge part of my life and I was immensely proud of it. \n\nMy girlfriend and I met a few months after I stopped competing, and she's heard quite a bit about my sport and always thought it was quite cool. She played volleyball in high school and had played on something rep volleyball teams. Nothing too crazy but I still thought it was pretty cool.\n\nThe other day we were discussing sports, and she was telling me how she had wished she played more volleyball and pursued it further. I told her that it was a great feeling to be really good at something and really enjoy it. I told her that it was a lot of work but it felt great to be a top level athlete at a sport. Queue the following conversation:\n\nHer: Yeah, well it's a little different isn't it?\n\nMe: What do you mean?\n\nHer: I mean you were good, but trampolining isn't a real sport.\n\nMe: How do you figure that? I was literally training as much as I went to school and Canada has arguably the most competitive trampolining scene in the world.\n\nHer: Well there's pretty much no one that does that sport. It's not hard to get to a high level, if you played a real sport like soccer you never would've been that good.\n\nI dumped her on the spot. That sport had such a huge impact on who I am today. I dedicated thousands of hours and even ended up getting paid some money to continue training. I was probably within the top 500 athletes worldwide. It felt like she was attacking who I am.\n\nHer friends all said that I'm an asshole for breaking up over something so small. This truly hurt, and it's a sentiment I received from people my whole life. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the \"AITA\" post is in the wrong. The situation is about him breaking up with his girlfriend because she made fun of his sport, trampolining.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the context. He dedicated 12 years to trampolining, was a national athlete, trained extensively, and even got funding. His girlfriend, after meeting him post-retirement, made a comment that trampolining isn't a real sport and implied it's easier than other sports like soccer. He took offense and broke up with her immediately.\n\nNow, to determine if he's in the wrong. The key factors here are the significance of the sport to his identity and the girlfriend's comment. He felt her comment was an attack on his hard work and dedication. She, on the other hand, might not have intended to belittle his achievements but perhaps made a casual remark based on her own perspective.\n\nIs breaking up over this justified? Well, relationships often hinge on mutual respect. If her comment dismissed his years of effort, that's a serious issue. However, her friends called him an asshole, suggesting maybe the reaction was too harsh. But to the author, trampolining is a core part of his identity, so her words might have felt like a personal attack.\n\nOn the other hand, dismissing someone's passion as not a \"real sport\" is problematic. It's a subjective judgment, but it's possible she didn't realize the weight of her words. The author's reaction was immediate and final, which could be seen as extreme, but given the context, it's also understandable if he felt devalued.\n\nBut is he in the wrong? If the comment was a one-time joke and he's overreacting, maybe. However, if trampolining is a significant part of his identity and her comment was a consistent underestimation, then he's justified. The line between a personal joke and a hurtful remark can be thin here. \n\nAlso, considering that she played volleyball and the comparison to \"real sports\" like soccer might have been her way of downplaying his dedication. The author's reaction, while immediate, stems from a place of feeling disrespected. \n\nSo, weighing both sides: The girlfriend's comment was disrespectful, but the author's decision to end the relationship over a single conversation might be seen as disproportionate. However, if the comment tapped into long-standing insecurities or disrespect, he's not entirely at fault. \n\nBut the question is if he's in the wrong. The answer hinges on intent and impact. Her comment's impact was negative, but was her intent malicious? If not, maybe the breakup was too hasty. However, if her comment reflects a pattern of undermining his achievements, then he's justified. Since the scenario is a one-time incident, it's possible he overreacted. So the answer is A (Yes, he's in the wrong). But wait, the user might argue that respecting someone's dedication is key in a relationship. If she dismissed his passion, that's a red flag. Maybe the answer is B (No, he's not in the wrong). \n\nHmm. This is tricky. The community might have mixed reactions, but generally, breaking up over a single comment is extreme. However, if it's a dealbreaker for him, then maybe not. The key is mutual respect. If her comment showed lack of respect for his dedication, then he has a right to leave. But if it was a joke, then his reaction is harsh. The post says he was hurt by the comment, which is valid. The friends said he was an asshole, but maybe they don't understand the context. \n\nIn conclusion, while breaking up over this is a big decision, if the comment represented a fundamental disrespect for his identity, then he's justified. So the answer is B.\n"
