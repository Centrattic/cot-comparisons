Specifically trampolining. I have am was a high level national athlete. I have competed at tons of national level competitions and have even competed at quite a few international competitions representing Team Canada. At my peak I was trainning at the trampoline gym 6 times a week, and all my training added up to nearly 30 hours a week on top of high school. Near the end of my career I was even getting funding to continue my sport. Eventually I had to quit because of a head injury, but this was still a huge part of my life and I was immensely proud of it. \n\nMy girlfriend and I met a few months after I stopped competing, and she's heard quite a bit about my sport and always thought it was quite cool. She played volleyball in high school and had played on something rep volleyball teams. Nothing too crazy but I still thought it was pretty cool.\n\nThe other day we were discussing sports, and she was telling me how she had wished she played more volleyball and pursued it further. I told her that it was a great feeling to be really good at something and really enjoy it. I told her that it was a lot of work but it felt great to be a top level athlete at a sport. Queue the following conversation:\n\nHer: Yeah, well it's a little different isn't it?\n\nMe: What do you mean?\n\nHer: I mean you were good, but trampolining isn't a real sport.\n\nMe: How do you figure that? I was literally training as much as I went to school and Canada has arguably the most competitive trampolining scene in the world.\n\nHer: Well there's pretty much no one that does that sport. It's not hard to get to a high level, if you played a real sport like soccer you never would've been that good.\n\nI dumped her on the spot. That sport had such a huge impact on who I am today. I dedicated thousands of hours and even ended up getting paid some money to continue training. I was probably within the top 500 athletes worldwide. It felt like she was attacking who I am.\n\nHer friends all said that I'm an asshole for breaking up over something so small. This truly hurt, and it's a sentiment I received from people my whole life. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person (the author) is in the wrong for breaking up with his girlfriend after she dismissed trampolining as not a real sport. \n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The author dedicated 12 years to trampolining, achieved national and international competition levels, and it's a significant part of his identity. When his girlfriend downplays his sport, he feels attacked and dumps her. \n\nOn the other hand, the girlfriend's comment might seem dismissive, but maybe she didn't realize how much it meant to him. She played volleyball at a rep level but didn't pursue it further. Her comment about trampolining not being a real sport could stem from a lack of awareness about its competitiveness and dedication required.\n\nRelationships require communication. The author's reaction is extreme\u2014ending the relationship over one comment. While the comment was hurtful, breaking up immediately without discussing it further might be seen as impulsive. The girlfriend's friends also think he's being an asshole, which suggests others might view his action as disproportionate. \n\nHowever, the author's deep emotional connection to his sport makes the comment personally offensive. It's possible she didn't intend to hurt him, but the impact was significant. The key here is whether the breakup was a reasonable response. \n\nIn relationships, how people handle sensitive topics matters. The author might have expected more support, but instead of addressing it calmly, he ended things. The girlfriend might have been unaware of the depth of his feelings. \n\nSo, while the comment was hurtful, the immediate breakup over such a specific issue could be seen as the author overreacting. Therefore, he might be in the wrong for not giving her a chance to explain or apologize, or for letting it escalate so quickly.\n"
