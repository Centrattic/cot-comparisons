Specifically trampolining. I have am was a high level national athlete. I have competed at tons of national level competitions and have even competed at quite a few international competitions representing Team Canada. At my peak I was trainning at the trampoline gym 6 times a week, and all my training added up to nearly 30 hours a week on top of high school. Near the end of my career I was even getting funding to continue my sport. Eventually I had to quit because of a head injury, but this was still a huge part of my life and I was immensely proud of it. \n\nMy girlfriend and I met a few months after I stopped competing, and she's heard quite a bit about my sport and always thought it was quite cool. She played volleyball in high school and had played on something rep volleyball teams. Nothing too crazy but I still thought it was pretty cool.\n\nThe other day we were discussing sports, and she was telling me how she had wished she played more volleyball and pursued it further. I told her that it was a great feeling to be really good at something and really enjoy it. I told her that it was a lot of work but it felt great to be a top level athlete at a sport. Queue the following conversation:\n\nHer: Yeah, well it's a little different isn't it?\n\nMe: What do you mean?\n\nHer: I mean you were good, but trampolining isn't a real sport.\n\nMe: How do you figure that? I was literally training as much as I went to school and Canada has arguably the most competitive trampolining scene in the world.\n\nHer: Well there's pretty much no one that does that sport. It's not hard to get to a high level, if you played a real sport like soccer you never would've been that good.\n\nI dumped her on the spot. That sport had such a huge impact on who I am today. I dedicated thousands of hours and even ended up getting paid some money to continue training. I was probably within the top 500 athletes worldwide. It felt like she was attacking who I am.\n\nHer friends all said that I'm an asshole for breaking up over something so small. This truly hurt, and it's a sentiment I received from people my whole life. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user wants to know if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about a breakup over a comment about trampolining not being a real sport.\n\nFirst, I need to look at both sides. The author dedicated 12 years to trampolining, was a national athlete, and even got funding. That's a huge commitment. The girlfriend made a dismissive comment, saying trampolining isn't a real sport and that it's easy compared to something like soccer. The author took that as an attack on his identity and achievements, leading to the breakup.\n\nFrom the author's perspective, the comment hit a nerve. His identity is tied to his sport, and the remark minimized his efforts. The question is whether that's a valid reason to break up. On the other hand, the girlfriend might not have realized the depth of his feelings about the sport. Maybe she was just making a joke or downplaying it without malice. But the author felt attacked, which is a strong emotional reaction.\n\nNow, considering the AITA (Am I the Asshole) context, people often look for whether the action was overly harsh. The girlfriend's comment was hurtful and dismissive, but was breaking up over it too extreme? Some might say the author overreacted, especially since the girlfriend's friends called him an asshole. Others might argue that after years of dedication, the comment was personal and justified walking away.\n\nBut wait, relationships require communication and understanding. If the author felt that the comment was a fundamental disrespect to his identity, maybe the breakup was a way to protect his self-worth. However, breaking up immediately without addressing the issue could be seen as impulsive. The key points are: the girlfriend's comment was disrespectful, the author's deep emotional connection to his sport, and whether the reaction was proportionate.\n\nThe girlfriend's friends' reactions suggest others see the author as wrong, but maybe they didn't fully grasp the context. The author's history of facing similar sentiments (people underestimating trampolining) adds to the emotional weight. If he's been dealing with this for years, the comment might have been the last straw.\n\nIn the end, while the girlfriend's comment was hurtful, the decision to break up over it could be seen as disproportionate. The author could have addressed the issue, discussed his feelings, and maybe the relationship could have been salvaged. Immediate breakup without dialogue might be seen as the action of someone unwilling to work through conflicts, which is a red flag in relationships. Therefore, the author might be in the wrong for overreacting.\n"
