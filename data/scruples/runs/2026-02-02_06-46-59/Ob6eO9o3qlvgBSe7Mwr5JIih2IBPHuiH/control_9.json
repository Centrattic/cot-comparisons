Specifically trampolining. I have am was a high level national athlete. I have competed at tons of national level competitions and have even competed at quite a few international competitions representing Team Canada. At my peak I was trainning at the trampoline gym 6 times a week, and all my training added up to nearly 30 hours a week on top of high school. Near the end of my career I was even getting funding to continue my sport. Eventually I had to quit because of a head injury, but this was still a huge part of my life and I was immensely proud of it. \n\nMy girlfriend and I met a few months after I stopped competing, and she's heard quite a bit about my sport and always thought it was quite cool. She played volleyball in high school and had played on something rep volleyball teams. Nothing too crazy but I still thought it was pretty cool.\n\nThe other day we were discussing sports, and she was telling me how she had wished she played more volleyball and pursued it further. I told her that it was a great feeling to be really good at something and really enjoy it. I told her that it was a lot of work but it felt great to be a top level athlete at a sport. Queue the following conversation:\n\nHer: Yeah, well it's a little different isn't it?\n\nMe: What do you mean?\n\nHer: I mean you were good, but trampolining isn't a real sport.\n\nMe: How do you figure that? I was literally training as much as I went to school and Canada has arguably the most competitive trampolining scene in the world.\n\nHer: Well there's pretty much no one that does that sport. It's not hard to get to a high level, if you played a real sport like soccer you never would've been that good.\n\nI dumped her on the spot. That sport had such a huge impact on who I am today. I dedicated thousands of hours and even ended up getting paid some money to continue training. I was probably within the top 500 athletes worldwide. It felt like she was attacking who I am.\n\nHer friends all said that I'm an asshole for breaking up over something so small. This truly hurt, and it's a sentiment I received from people my whole life. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is that he's a former high-level trampolining athlete who dedicated 12 years to his sport. He met his girlfriend after he stopped competing. She seemed to be into volleyball in high school. Then, during a conversation about sports, she says that trampolining isn't a real sport and that it's not hard to get to a high level in it, implying that if he had played a \"real\" sport like soccer, he wouldn't have been as good. He took that as an attack on his identity and dumped her on the spot. Now he's asking if he's the asshole here.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. He's put a lot of time and effort into his sport, which is something that's a big part of his identity. For someone with that level of dedication, a comment that undermines their sport can feel really personal. Trampolining might not be as mainstream as soccer, but it's definitely a recognized sport, especially in the Olympics. The fact that he was nationally and internationally competitive, got funding, and trained extensively shows that it's taken a lot of work. So her comment might have come off as dismissive of his achievements.\n\nBut then, why did she say that? Maybe she didn't realize how much it meant to him. People with different backgrounds might not understand the nuances. She played volleyball, which is more common in some regions. Maybe she was trying to make a joke or downplay his sport in a way she thought was light-hearted. It's possible she didn't mean to attack him personally but did so in a way that was hurtful because of his personal investment.\n\nIs it right to break up over this? Breaking up is a huge step. Some might say he overreacted because it's a subjective opinion. Others might say that when someone's identity is tied up in their work or passion, such a comment can be a deal-breaker. The key points here are respect and understanding. If she made a comment that was disrespectful to his achievements, that's a problem. But if she was just expressing her opinion without malice, maybe he should have addressed it through communication instead of ending the relationship immediately.\n\nAlso, the girlfriend's friends said he's an asshole, but that's not necessarily the case. Friends might not understand the depth of his feelings about his sport. The question is whether her statement was an attack or just a difference in perspective. If she dismissed his sport in a way that undermined his hard work and identity, then he's justified in feeling hurt. However, if he didn't give her a chance to clarify or apologize, maybe he didn't handle it correctly.\n\nOn the flip side, maybe the comment was just her opinion, and he took it too personally. But in relationships, especially when there's a significant emotional investment, certain topics can be triggers. If she knew his sport was important and still made that comment, it shows a lack of consideration. If she didn't know how much it meant to him, then communication could have prevented the break-up.\n\nSo, the answer depends on whether the girlfriend intentionally disrespected his sport or if he reacted disproportionately. The author's perspective is that her comment attacked who he is, which is valid. But others might say breaking up over a single comment, even if hurtful, is too extreme. However, considering the depth of his dedication and the personal nature of the attack, he's not entirely wrong to feel that way. The key here is mutual respect in a relationship. If one partner's core identity is being dismissed, it's a serious issue. Therefore, the author might not be in the wrong here.\n"
