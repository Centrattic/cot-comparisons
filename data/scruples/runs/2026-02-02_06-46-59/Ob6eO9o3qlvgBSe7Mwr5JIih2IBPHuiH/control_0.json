Specifically trampolining. I have am was a high level national athlete. I have competed at tons of national level competitions and have even competed at quite a few international competitions representing Team Canada. At my peak I was trainning at the trampoline gym 6 times a week, and all my training added up to nearly 30 hours a week on top of high school. Near the end of my career I was even getting funding to continue my sport. Eventually I had to quit because of a head injury, but this was still a huge part of my life and I was immensely proud of it. \n\nMy girlfriend and I met a few months after I stopped competing, and she's heard quite a bit about my sport and always thought it was quite cool. She played volleyball in high school and had played on something rep volleyball teams. Nothing too crazy but I still thought it was pretty cool.\n\nThe other day we were discussing sports, and she was telling me how she had wished she played more volleyball and pursued it further. I told her that it was a great feeling to be really good at something and really enjoy it. I told her that it was a lot of work but it felt great to be a top level athlete at a sport. Queue the following conversation:\n\nHer: Yeah, well it's a little different isn't it?\n\nMe: What do you mean?\n\nHer: I mean you were good, but trampolining isn't a real sport.\n\nMe: How do you figure that? I was literally training as much as I went to school and Canada has arguably the most competitive trampolining scene in the world.\n\nHer: Well there's pretty much no one that does that sport. It's not hard to get to a high level, if you played a real sport like soccer you never would've been that good.\n\nI dumped her on the spot. That sport had such a huge impact on who I am today. I dedicated thousands of hours and even ended up getting paid some money to continue training. I was probably within the top 500 athletes worldwide. It felt like she was attacking who I am.\n\nHer friends all said that I'm an asshole for breaking up over something so small. This truly hurt, and it's a sentiment I received from people my whole life. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who posted the story (AITA) is in the wrong for dumping his girlfriend because she made fun of his sport. \n\nFirst, the context: The author dedicated 12 years to trampolining, was a national-level athlete, and even got funding. He quit due to injury. His girlfriend, who played volleyball, made a comment that trampolining isn't a real sport, implying it's less legitimate than something like soccer. The author took this as an attack on his identity and dumped her on the spot. The question is whether he was wrong to do so.\n\nSo, the key points here are the value of the sport, the girlfriend's comment, the author's reaction, and whether the breakup was justified. \n\nTrampolining is an Olympic sport, so it's recognized as a legitimate sport. The girlfriend's comment dismissing it as not real could be seen as invalidating his dedication and achievements. The author feels it's an attack on his identity, which is significant given the time and effort he invested. \n\nOn the other hand, some might argue that a joke or a light-hearted comment doesn't warrant a breakup. The girlfriend's friends called the author an asshole, suggesting that maybe they didn't see the issue. But the author's reaction is rooted in feeling disrespected, which is a personal and emotional response. \n\nIs the author wrong? If the comment was a one-off joke, maybe overreacting. But if it's a deeper issue of disrespect towards his passion, then it's a valid reason. The line between a joke and a hurtful comment can be thin. The fact that he dedicated so much to the sport and it's part of his identity matters here. \n\nThe girlfriend's comparison to soccer (\"if you played a real sport like soccer...\") might imply that trampolining is less valuable, which could be seen as belittling. The author's reaction could be justified if this isn't an isolated incident but part of a pattern of disrespect. However, breaking up over a single comment might be seen as too harsh. \n\nBut the story says he dumped her \"on the spot,\" which could indicate impulsiveness. However, the hurt and feeling of being attacked might have led to that immediate decision. \n\nConsidering all this, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong. The girlfriend's comment dismissed his significant achievements and identity. The reaction, while immediate, stems from a place of feeling undervalued. So, the answer is B.\n"
