Specifically trampolining. I have am was a high level national athlete. I have competed at tons of national level competitions and have even competed at quite a few international competitions representing Team Canada. At my peak I was trainning at the trampoline gym 6 times a week, and all my training added up to nearly 30 hours a week on top of high school. Near the end of my career I was even getting funding to continue my sport. Eventually I had to quit because of a head injury, but this was still a huge part of my life and I was immensely proud of it. \n\nMy girlfriend and I met a few months after I stopped competing, and she's heard quite a bit about my sport and always thought it was quite cool. She played volleyball in high school and had played on something rep volleyball teams. Nothing too crazy but I still thought it was pretty cool.\n\nThe other day we were discussing sports, and she was telling me how she had wished she played more volleyball and pursued it further. I told her that it was a great feeling to be really good at something and really enjoy it. I told her that it was a lot of work but it felt great to be a top level athlete at a sport. Queue the following conversation:\n\nHer: Yeah, well it's a little different isn't it?\n\nMe: What do you mean?\n\nHer: I mean you were good, but trampolining isn't a real sport.\n\nMe: How do you figure that? I was literally training as much as I went to school and Canada has arguably the most competitive trampolining scene in the world.\n\nHer: Well there's pretty much no one that does that sport. It's not hard to get to a high level, if you played a real sport like soccer you never would've been that good.\n\nI dumped her on the spot. That sport had such a huge impact on who I am today. I dedicated thousands of hours and even ended up getting paid some money to continue training. I was probably within the top 500 athletes worldwide. It felt like she was attacking who I am.\n\nHer friends all said that I'm an asshole for breaking up over something so small. This truly hurt, and it's a sentiment I received from people my whole life. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that he broke up with his girlfriend because she called his sport, trampolining, not a real sport. He's been really dedicated to it for 12 years, got funding, competed nationally and internationally. She made a comment that trampolining isn't a real sport, comparing it to something like soccer. He took it as an attack on who he is and ended the relationship immediately.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. He's putting a lot of emotional investment into his sport. For him, it's a big part of his identity. Her comment might have been dismissive and hurtful. On the other hand, she might have been making a joke or not taking it seriously. Maybe she didn't mean to invalidate his achievements. But then again, if someone's identity is tied to something and another person mocks it, that's a big deal. \n\nBut wait, how serious was her comment? The user says she made a joke, but he took it as an attack. Sometimes people make comments without realizing the impact. Maybe he overreacted? Or maybe she shouldn't have made that comment about his dedication. \n\nAlso, the fact that he dumped her on the spot might be too abrupt. Relationships require communication. Maybe he should have discussed his feelings instead of ending things immediately. But if it's a fundamental issue about respect for his identity, maybe it's a deal-breaker. \n\nHer friends said he's an asshole for breaking up over something small. That's a social judgment, but maybe they don't see the depth of the hurt. His perspective is that it's not small because of his personal history with the sport. \n\nSo, is he in the wrong? If he ended the relationship without addressing the issue, maybe he should have communicated better. But if her comment was a deal-breaker for him in terms of respect, then maybe he's justified. \n\nI think the key points are: 1) The severity of her comment in his eyes, 2) Whether breaking up was an appropriate response. If someone insults your core identity, that's a big deal. However, the method of handling it could be questioned. But in the context of the question, it's whether he's in the wrong. Since he felt attacked and acted on that feeling, maybe he's not wrong. So answer B.\n"
