Specifically trampolining. I have am was a high level national athlete. I have competed at tons of national level competitions and have even competed at quite a few international competitions representing Team Canada. At my peak I was trainning at the trampoline gym 6 times a week, and all my training added up to nearly 30 hours a week on top of high school. Near the end of my career I was even getting funding to continue my sport. Eventually I had to quit because of a head injury, but this was still a huge part of my life and I was immensely proud of it. \n\nMy girlfriend and I met a few months after I stopped competing, and she's heard quite a bit about my sport and always thought it was quite cool. She played volleyball in high school and had played on something rep volleyball teams. Nothing too crazy but I still thought it was pretty cool.\n\nThe other day we were discussing sports, and she was telling me how she had wished she played more volleyball and pursued it further. I told her that it was a great feeling to be really good at something and really enjoy it. I told her that it was a lot of work but it felt great to be a top level athlete at a sport. Queue the following conversation:\n\nHer: Yeah, well it's a little different isn't it?\n\nMe: What do you mean?\n\nHer: I mean you were good, but trampolining isn't a real sport.\n\nMe: How do you figure that? I was literally training as much as I went to school and Canada has arguably the most competitive trampolining scene in the world.\n\nHer: Well there's pretty much no one that does that sport. It's not hard to get to a high level, if you played a real sport like soccer you never would've been that good.\n\nI dumped her on the spot. That sport had such a huge impact on who I am today. I dedicated thousands of hours and even ended up getting paid some money to continue training. I was probably within the top 500 athletes worldwide. It felt like she was attacking who I am.\n\nHer friends all said that I'm an asshole for breaking up over something so small. This truly hurt, and it's a sentiment I received from people my whole life. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong for breaking up with his girlfriend because she made fun of his sport, trampolining. Let me start by understanding the situation.\n\nThe author has spent 12 years dedicated to trampolining, competing at national and international levels, even getting funding. He had to quit due to an injury. His girlfriend met him after he stopped competing. She used to play volleyball in high school. They were talking about sports, and when the author mentioned how being a top athlete felt, she responded by saying trampolining isn't a real sport, implying it's less legitimate than sports like soccer. The author felt attacked and broke up with her. Her friends call him an asshole for overreacting.\n\nFirst, I should consider the value of personal dedication and identity. Trampolining is a recognized Olympic sport, so calling it not a real sport might be incorrect. However, the bigger issue is the girlfriend's dismissive attitude towards his significant life commitment. The author's reaction is based on feeling disrespected about something central to his identity. \n\nOn the other hand, relationships require communication and mutual respect. If the girlfriend had a history of belittling his accomplishments or if this was a one-off comment, it's different. The author might have overreacted, but if this comment struck a nerve about his identity and achievements, maybe it's valid. \n\nBut is breaking up over a single comment justified? Relationships can't survive if one partner constantly feels disrespected. However, the girlfriend might not have intended to mock him, just made a careless remark. The author's decision to end the relationship immediately without discussing further could be seen as hasty. \n\nThe key here is whether the girlfriend's comment was a legitimate critique or an insult. If she meant that trampolining isn't as popular as other sports, but didn't respect his dedication, then the author's reaction is about feeling undervalued. If she was being dismissive of his hard work, he's justified. But if she was just making a joke that didn't intend to hurt, then breaking up might be too severe. \n\nThe fact that her friends said he's an asshole suggests that others might see his reaction as disproportionate. However, people close to the situation might not understand the emotional impact. The author's history of hearing similar sentiments (from others) indicates that this was a recurring issue, not just a one-time comment. That context matters. \n\nIn conclusion, while the girlfriend's comment was disrespectful, the author's immediate decision to break up might be too extreme. But if her comment was a deal-breaker for him, he's within his right to end the relationship. However, the question is whether he's in the wrong. If the comment was a serious attack on his identity and dedication, then he's not in the wrong. But if it was a minor, unintentional slight, then he might be overreacting. Given the context of his lifelong dedication and her friends' reactions, it's a bit of a toss-up, but leaning towards the author not being in the wrong because the comment targeted his deeply held values.\n"
