Specifically trampolining. I have am was a high level national athlete. I have competed at tons of national level competitions and have even competed at quite a few international competitions representing Team Canada. At my peak I was trainning at the trampoline gym 6 times a week, and all my training added up to nearly 30 hours a week on top of high school. Near the end of my career I was even getting funding to continue my sport. Eventually I had to quit because of a head injury, but this was still a huge part of my life and I was immensely proud of it. \n\nMy girlfriend and I met a few months after I stopped competing, and she's heard quite a bit about my sport and always thought it was quite cool. She played volleyball in high school and had played on something rep volleyball teams. Nothing too crazy but I still thought it was pretty cool.\n\nThe other day we were discussing sports, and she was telling me how she had wished she played more volleyball and pursued it further. I told her that it was a great feeling to be really good at something and really enjoy it. I told her that it was a lot of work but it felt great to be a top level athlete at a sport. Queue the following conversation:\n\nHer: Yeah, well it's a little different isn't it?\n\nMe: What do you mean?\n\nHer: I mean you were good, but trampolining isn't a real sport.\n\nMe: How do you figure that? I was literally training as much as I went to school and Canada has arguably the most competitive trampolining scene in the world.\n\nHer: Well there's pretty much no one that does that sport. It's not hard to get to a high level, if you played a real sport like soccer you never would've been that good.\n\nI dumped her on the spot. That sport had such a huge impact on who I am today. I dedicated thousands of hours and even ended up getting paid some money to continue training. I was probably within the top 500 athletes worldwide. It felt like she was attacking who I am.\n\nHer friends all said that I'm an asshole for breaking up over something so small. This truly hurt, and it's a sentiment I received from people my whole life. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who broke up with their girlfriend over her comments about his sport is in the wrong. The question is about whether the author (AITA) made the right decision.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The author was a high-level trampolinist, dedicating a lot of time and effort. His girlfriend made a comment that trampolining isn't a real sport and implied it's easier than real sports like soccer. He took it really seriously and broke up immediately. His friends and others think he was too harsh.\n\nThe key points here are about respect for personal achievements and the appropriateness of the reaction. The girlfriend's comment was dismissive of his dedication and accomplishment. For someone who's put in thousands of hours and represented their country, such a comment could feel like a personal attack. The author might feel that his identity and hard work were belittled.\n\nHowever, the girlfriend might not have intended to insult him. She could have been making a casual joke or not realizing how significant trampolining is to him. But the way she phrased it, saying it's not a real sport and that he wouldn't have been good at a real sport, shows a lack of understanding and respect for his achievements.\n\nThe breakup is a big reaction. While the comment was hurtful, ending the relationship immediately might be seen as extreme. It's possible that a discussion about how he felt could have resolved the issue. But considering the emotional weight of the comment and the importance of the sport to his identity, the reaction isn't entirely unwarranted. People have different thresholds for what they consider disrespectful.\n\nIn terms of AITA, the decision hinges on whether the reaction was proportional. The girlfriend's remark was disrespectful, but the immediate breakup without discussion could be seen as impulsive. However, the author's dedication and the personal nature of the attack might justify his feelings. The community often looks at AITA scenarios where the person's emotional response is valid if the situation involved a deep personal value being undermined.\n\nSo, the answer might be B (the author is not in the wrong) because the comment was a direct attack on his identity and achievements. However, some might argue that the breakup was too harsh. But given the context of his extensive dedication and the dismissive nature of her comment, the author's reaction is understandable, even if it's seen as extreme. Therefore, the answer is B.\n"
