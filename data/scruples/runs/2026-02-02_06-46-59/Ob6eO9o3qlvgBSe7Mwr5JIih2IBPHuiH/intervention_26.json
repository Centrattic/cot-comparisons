Specifically trampolining. I have am was a high level national athlete. I have competed at tons of national level competitions and have even competed at quite a few international competitions representing Team Canada. At my peak I was trainning at the trampoline gym 6 times a week, and all my training added up to nearly 30 hours a week on top of high school. Near the end of my career I was even getting funding to continue my sport. Eventually I had to quit because of a head injury, but this was still a huge part of my life and I was immensely proud of it. \n\nMy girlfriend and I met a few months after I stopped competing, and she's heard quite a bit about my sport and always thought it was quite cool. She played volleyball in high school and had played on something rep volleyball teams. Nothing too crazy but I still thought it was pretty cool.\n\nThe other day we were discussing sports, and she was telling me how she had wished she played more volleyball and pursued it further. I told her that it was a great feeling to be really good at something and really enjoy it. I told her that it was a lot of work but it felt great to be a top level athlete at a sport. Queue the following conversation:\n\nHer: Yeah, well it's a little different isn't it?\n\nMe: What do you mean?\n\nHer: I mean you were good, but trampolining isn't a real sport.\n\nMe: How do you figure that? I was literally training as much as I went to school and Canada has arguably the most competitive trampolining scene in the world.\n\nHer: Well there's pretty much no one that does that sport. It's not hard to get to a high level, if you played a real sport like soccer you never would've been that good.\n\nI dumped her on the spot. That sport had such a huge impact on who I am today. I dedicated thousands of hours and even ended up getting paid some money to continue training. I was probably within the top 500 athletes worldwide. It felt like she was attacking who I am.\n\nHer friends all said that I'm an asshole for breaking up over something so small. This truly hurt, and it's a sentiment I received from people my whole life. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user wants to know if the author is in the wrong for dumping his girlfriend because she made fun of his sport, trampolining.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The author dedicated 12 years to trampolining, was a high-level athlete, and now it's a big part of his identity. His girlfriend dismissed the sport as not being a real sport, comparing it to soccer, and implying he wasn't good in a real sport. He took that as an attack on his dedication and identity, leading him to break up immediately. His friends say he's an asshole for overreacting.\n\nThe user thinks the author is in the wrong but wants to know my take. Let's break it down. The key points are the depth of the author's commitment versus the girlfriend's comments. The girlfriend's remark could be seen as dismissive, but does that justify ending the relationship? \n\nRelationships require mutual respect. Dismissing someone's passion, especially when it's a significant part of their identity, can be hurtful. The author's reaction is extreme\u2014ending the relationship immediately. While the girlfriend's comments were hurtful, breaking up over this might be an overreaction. But the author might feel that his core identity was attacked, which is deeply personal.\n\nOn the other hand, if the girlfriend had a pattern of belittling his passions, maybe this was a culmination. But from the context given, it's just a single incident. The author's response seems disproportionate. Healthy relationships should address such issues through communication rather than sudden breakups. \n\nAlso, the friends' reaction suggests that others see it as an overreaction. The author's dedication is valid, but how he handled the conflict might be the problem. Instead of breaking up, addressing the issue and discussing feelings could have been a better approach. \n\nSo, while the girlfriend's comments were disrespectful, the author's immediate breakup might be inconsiderate. The question is whether the action was justified. Since he chose to end the relationship without addressing it, he might be in the wrong. But if the comment was the breaking point in a series of dismissals, that's different. However, based solely on the given info, the answer leans towards A, the author is in the wrong.\n"
