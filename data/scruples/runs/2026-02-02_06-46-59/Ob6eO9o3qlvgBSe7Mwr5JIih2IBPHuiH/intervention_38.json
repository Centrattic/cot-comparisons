Specifically trampolining. I have am was a high level national athlete. I have competed at tons of national level competitions and have even competed at quite a few international competitions representing Team Canada. At my peak I was trainning at the trampoline gym 6 times a week, and all my training added up to nearly 30 hours a week on top of high school. Near the end of my career I was even getting funding to continue my sport. Eventually I had to quit because of a head injury, but this was still a huge part of my life and I was immensely proud of it. \n\nMy girlfriend and I met a few months after I stopped competing, and she's heard quite a bit about my sport and always thought it was quite cool. She played volleyball in high school and had played on something rep volleyball teams. Nothing too crazy but I still thought it was pretty cool.\n\nThe other day we were discussing sports, and she was telling me how she had wished she played more volleyball and pursued it further. I told her that it was a great feeling to be really good at something and really enjoy it. I told her that it was a lot of work but it felt great to be a top level athlete at a sport. Queue the following conversation:\n\nHer: Yeah, well it's a little different isn't it?\n\nMe: What do you mean?\n\nHer: I mean you were good, but trampolining isn't a real sport.\n\nMe: How do you figure that? I was literally training as much as I went to school and Canada has arguably the most competitive trampolining scene in the world.\n\nHer: Well there's pretty much no one that does that sport. It's not hard to get to a high level, if you played a real sport like soccer you never would've been that good.\n\nI dumped her on the spot. That sport had such a huge impact on who I am today. I dedicated thousands of hours and even ended up getting paid some money to continue training. I was probably within the top 500 athletes worldwide. It felt like she was attacking who I am.\n\nHer friends all said that I'm an asshole for breaking up over something so small. This truly hurt, and it's a sentiment I received from people my whole life. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA post is in the wrong for dumping his girlfriend after she made fun of his sport, trampolining. The author dedicated 12 years to it, was a national athlete, and got injured. The girlfriend said trampolining isn't a real sport and it's not hard to get good at compared to something like soccer. He broke up with her immediately, and her friends say he's an asshole for overreacting.\n\nHmm. So, the key points here are about respect and valuing someone's dedication. The author feels that his significant investment in a sport was dismissed, which is a personal attack. Trampolining is an Olympic sport, so technically it's considered a \"real\" sport. The girlfriend might have been trying to be funny or downplay it, but she didn't realize how important it was to him. However, breaking up over that seems pretty extreme. \n\nOn one hand, it's valid to feel disrespected when someone mocks your passion. On the other hand, the girlfriend's comment, while maybe dismissive, doesn't seem to warrant a breakup. People have different opinions on what makes a sport \"real,\" and her comment might have been a joke or an offhand remark. The author's reaction is very harsh. Ending a relationship over a single joke or comment, especially if it's a matter of personal opinion, might be too much. \n\nBut then again, if this was a recurring issue, maybe it's different. The story doesn't mention prior issues, just the one comment. So maybe the author overreacted. The girlfriend's friends think he's in the wrong because it was a small thing. The author's perspective is that it's personal and significant to him, so the comment felt like an attack. \n\nI think the answer depends on context. If the girlfriend had a history of belittling his passions and this was another instance, maybe the breakup makes sense. But as a one-time comment, it's a bit of a stretch. The author's dedication is valid, but reacting with a breakup is extreme. So, the author might be in the wrong because the reaction is disproportionate to the comment.\n"
