Specifically trampolining. I have am was a high level national athlete. I have competed at tons of national level competitions and have even competed at quite a few international competitions representing Team Canada. At my peak I was trainning at the trampoline gym 6 times a week, and all my training added up to nearly 30 hours a week on top of high school. Near the end of my career I was even getting funding to continue my sport. Eventually I had to quit because of a head injury, but this was still a huge part of my life and I was immensely proud of it. \n\nMy girlfriend and I met a few months after I stopped competing, and she's heard quite a bit about my sport and always thought it was quite cool. She played volleyball in high school and had played on something rep volleyball teams. Nothing too crazy but I still thought it was pretty cool.\n\nThe other day we were discussing sports, and she was telling me how she had wished she played more volleyball and pursued it further. I told her that it was a great feeling to be really good at something and really enjoy it. I told her that it was a lot of work but it felt great to be a top level athlete at a sport. Queue the following conversation:\n\nHer: Yeah, well it's a little different isn't it?\n\nMe: What do you mean?\n\nHer: I mean you were good, but trampolining isn't a real sport.\n\nMe: How do you figure that? I was literally training as much as I went to school and Canada has arguably the most competitive trampolining scene in the world.\n\nHer: Well there's pretty much no one that does that sport. It's not hard to get to a high level, if you played a real sport like soccer you never would've been that good.\n\nI dumped her on the spot. That sport had such a huge impact on who I am today. I dedicated thousands of hours and even ended up getting paid some money to continue training. I was probably within the top 500 athletes worldwide. It felt like she was attacking who I am.\n\nHer friends all said that I'm an asshole for breaking up over something so small. This truly hurt, and it's a sentiment I received from people my whole life. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. So the user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong for breaking up with his girlfriend because she made fun of his sport, which he's very dedicated to.\n\nFirst, I need to understand both sides. The guy has spent 12 years in trampolining, trained a lot, competed nationally and internationally, even got funding. That's a huge commitment. When they talk about sports, he's sharing his passion, and she minimizes it by saying trampolining isn't a real sport, implying it's easier than something like soccer. He feels attacked because it's a big part of his identity. Then he dumps her immediately.\n\nOn the other side, she might have been making a joke or trying to be playful, but he took it seriously. He was already sensitive about his sport being dismissed, maybe because others have done that before. But is breaking up over a comment about the sport being \"not real\" too extreme? \n\nI know that in relationships, how people handle sensitive topics matters. If she didn't understand the significance of his dedication, maybe she should have been more careful. But on the other hand, breaking up over a single conversation where the other person might not have intended it as a major insult could be seen as overreacting. \n\nThe friends also called him an asshole for breaking up over something small. That's a common reaction when the breakup seems disproportionate. But his perspective is that the comment hit a nerve because of the deep personal investment. \n\nSo, is it really about the sport or about deeper issues? Maybe she had a history of dismissing his passions, or maybe this was an isolated incident. The context here is only one conversation, but for him, it was the last straw. \n\nIn terms of general relationship advice, communication is key. Maybe he should have talked to her about how he feels before breaking up. But he felt hurt and attacked, which is valid. However, reacting with an immediate breakup might not be the healthiest approach. \n\nI think the key factors are whether she was being intentionally dismissive or if it was a misunderstanding. If she meant it as a joke and didn't realize how it would come off, maybe he overreacted. But if she consistently belittles his achievements, then it's a different story. Since this is a single instance, it's hard to say if it's a pattern. \n\nAlso, considering that he's had to deal with people underestimating his sport before, her comment might have triggered deeper insecurities. In that case, his reaction is more understandable. But the immediate breakup might still be seen as extreme. \n\nSo, balancing both sides, I think there's a mix here. He's not entirely wrong for feeling hurt, but breaking up immediately could be seen as overreacting unless there were prior issues. Since the question is whether he's in the wrong, I'm leaning towards A (yes, he's in the wrong) because the reaction might be too harsh for a single comment, even if the comment was hurtful. But if the sport is a core part of his identity and she's dismissive, maybe it's justified. Hmm, this is tricky.\n"
