Specifically trampolining. I have am was a high level national athlete. I have competed at tons of national level competitions and have even competed at quite a few international competitions representing Team Canada. At my peak I was trainning at the trampoline gym 6 times a week, and all my training added up to nearly 30 hours a week on top of high school. Near the end of my career I was even getting funding to continue my sport. Eventually I had to quit because of a head injury, but this was still a huge part of my life and I was immensely proud of it. \n\nMy girlfriend and I met a few months after I stopped competing, and she's heard quite a bit about my sport and always thought it was quite cool. She played volleyball in high school and had played on something rep volleyball teams. Nothing too crazy but I still thought it was pretty cool.\n\nThe other day we were discussing sports, and she was telling me how she had wished she played more volleyball and pursued it further. I told her that it was a great feeling to be really good at something and really enjoy it. I told her that it was a lot of work but it felt great to be a top level athlete at a sport. Queue the following conversation:\n\nHer: Yeah, well it's a little different isn't it?\n\nMe: What do you mean?\n\nHer: I mean you were good, but trampolining isn't a real sport.\n\nMe: How do you figure that? I was literally training as much as I went to school and Canada has arguably the most competitive trampolining scene in the world.\n\nHer: Well there's pretty much no one that does that sport. It's not hard to get to a high level, if you played a real sport like soccer you never would've been that good.\n\nI dumped her on the spot. That sport had such a huge impact on who I am today. I dedicated thousands of hours and even ended up getting paid some money to continue training. I was probably within the top 500 athletes worldwide. It felt like she was attacking who I am.\n\nHer friends all said that I'm an asshole for breaking up over something so small. This truly hurt, and it's a sentiment I received from people my whole life. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the \"Am I the Asshole\" post is in the wrong for breaking up with his girlfriend because she made fun of his sport, trampolining. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The author dedicated 12 years to trampolining, was a national-level athlete, got funding, and then quit due to injury. He met his girlfriend after he stopped competing. She used to play volleyball in high school. During a conversation about sports, she dismissed trampolining as not a real sport, saying it's not as hard as soccer. The author found this offensive and dumped her on the spot. Her friends and others think he's an asshole for breaking up over this, but he's hurt because the sport was a huge part of his identity.\n\nNow, I have to weigh both sides. On one hand, the author's feelings are understandable. His dedication and achievements in trampolining are significant, and being belittled could be deeply hurtful. The girlfriend's comments might be seen as dismissive of his hard work and accomplishments. Trampolining is an Olympic sport, so calling it not a real sport is factually incorrect, which might add to the offense.\n\nOn the other hand, relationships require communication and mutual respect. The girlfriend, while having her own perspective, might not have intended to be offensive. Maybe her comment came from a place of not understanding the sport's rigor. However, her statement was derogatory. The author's immediate reaction was to break up, which is a severe response. The question is whether this reaction is justified.\n\nI need to consider if the breakup was an overreaction. While the comment was hurtful, ending the relationship based on one conversation without discussion could be impulsive. The girlfriend's friends also think he's an asshole, which might indicate that society often sees such breakups as too harsh unless there's a deeper issue.\n\nAnother angle: trampolining's status as a sport. It's recognized by the IOC, so the girlfriend's dismissal is incorrect. The author's investment in the sport is valid. However, how he handled the situation\u2014breaking up immediately without addressing the issue\u2014might be problematic. Perhaps a more constructive approach would be to talk about why her comment hurt him, leading to understanding rather than an abrupt split.\n\nIn conclusion, while the girlfriend's comment was disrespectful, the author's decision to break up without dialogue might be inconsiderate. The key is whether the action was proportionate. Since the post asks if he's in the wrong, the answer hinges on whether the break up was too hasty and if the issue could have been resolved through communication. Therefore, the author might be in the wrong for not handling it more maturely.\n"
