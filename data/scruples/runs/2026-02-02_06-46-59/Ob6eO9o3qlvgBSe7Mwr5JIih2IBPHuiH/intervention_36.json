Specifically trampolining. I have am was a high level national athlete. I have competed at tons of national level competitions and have even competed at quite a few international competitions representing Team Canada. At my peak I was trainning at the trampoline gym 6 times a week, and all my training added up to nearly 30 hours a week on top of high school. Near the end of my career I was even getting funding to continue my sport. Eventually I had to quit because of a head injury, but this was still a huge part of my life and I was immensely proud of it. \n\nMy girlfriend and I met a few months after I stopped competing, and she's heard quite a bit about my sport and always thought it was quite cool. She played volleyball in high school and had played on something rep volleyball teams. Nothing too crazy but I still thought it was pretty cool.\n\nThe other day we were discussing sports, and she was telling me how she had wished she played more volleyball and pursued it further. I told her that it was a great feeling to be really good at something and really enjoy it. I told her that it was a lot of work but it felt great to be a top level athlete at a sport. Queue the following conversation:\n\nHer: Yeah, well it's a little different isn't it?\n\nMe: What do you mean?\n\nHer: I mean you were good, but trampolining isn't a real sport.\n\nMe: How do you figure that? I was literally training as much as I went to school and Canada has arguably the most competitive trampolining scene in the world.\n\nHer: Well there's pretty much no one that does that sport. It's not hard to get to a high level, if you played a real sport like soccer you never would've been that good.\n\nI dumped her on the spot. That sport had such a huge impact on who I am today. I dedicated thousands of hours and even ended up getting paid some money to continue training. I was probably within the top 500 athletes worldwide. It felt like she was attacking who I am.\n\nHer friends all said that I'm an asshole for breaking up over something so small. This truly hurt, and it's a sentiment I received from people my whole life. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking whether the author of the \"Am I the Asshole\" story is in the wrong for breaking up with his girlfriend after she mocked his sport, trampolining. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The author dedicated 12 years to high-level trampolining, was a national athlete, trained extensively, and had funding. He quit due to injury. They met after he stopped. She played volleyball but not at the same level. During a conversation about sports, she downplayed trampolining as not a \"real sport,\" suggesting it's easier than something like soccer. He dumps her immediately. Her friends say he's an asshole for overreacting. The user thinks the author is wrong but is curious for my opinion.\n\nSo, key points: The woman made a dismissive comment about his sport, which he took as an attack on his identity and years of dedication. He ended the relationship on the spot. The question is whether he was wrong to do so.\n\nI need to consider both perspectives. On one hand, the author's reaction might seem extreme. A breakup over a single comment could be seen as disproportionate. People have differing opinions on what's a \"real\" sport, and maybe she didn't mean to insult. On the other hand, the sport was a huge part of his identity. Her comment could feel like minimizing his achievements and hard work. He might feel that respect for his past is essential in a relationship.\n\nBut is it fair to end a relationship immediately over this? Communication is important. Maybe he should have discussed his feelings instead of breaking up right away. However, if this was a dealbreaker for him, maybe it's justified. The line between standing up for oneself and overreacting is thin here.\n\nAlso, the girlfriend's friends said he's an asshole. That could indicate that the community thinks he's overreacting. But personal feelings are subjective. If the relationship couldn't handle such a sensitive topic, maybe it was doomed anyway. \n\nIn the end, breaking up over a single joke or comment might be seen as the author being in the wrong (A) because it's a significant action for what some might see as a minor issue. However, if the comment was a dealbreaker and he felt deeply disrespected, then maybe not (B). But since the user thinks A (author wrong), I need to weigh the reasons.\n\nConsidering that the woman's statement was a joke or a personal opinion, and the author took it seriously, leading to an immediate breakup, it's possible he's overreacting. So, AITA-wise, the answer would lean towards A, the author is in the wrong.\n"
