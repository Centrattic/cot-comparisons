Specifically trampolining. I have am was a high level national athlete. I have competed at tons of national level competitions and have even competed at quite a few international competitions representing Team Canada. At my peak I was trainning at the trampoline gym 6 times a week, and all my training added up to nearly 30 hours a week on top of high school. Near the end of my career I was even getting funding to continue my sport. Eventually I had to quit because of a head injury, but this was still a huge part of my life and I was immensely proud of it. \n\nMy girlfriend and I met a few months after I stopped competing, and she's heard quite a bit about my sport and always thought it was quite cool. She played volleyball in high school and had played on something rep volleyball teams. Nothing too crazy but I still thought it was pretty cool.\n\nThe other day we were discussing sports, and she was telling me how she had wished she played more volleyball and pursued it further. I told her that it was a great feeling to be really good at something and really enjoy it. I told her that it was a lot of work but it felt great to be a top level athlete at a sport. Queue the following conversation:\n\nHer: Yeah, well it's a little different isn't it?\n\nMe: What do you mean?\n\nHer: I mean you were good, but trampolining isn't a real sport.\n\nMe: How do you figure that? I was literally training as much as I went to school and Canada has arguably the most competitive trampolining scene in the world.\n\nHer: Well there's pretty much no one that does that sport. It's not hard to get to a high level, if you played a real sport like soccer you never would've been that good.\n\nI dumped her on the spot. That sport had such a huge impact on who I am today. I dedicated thousands of hours and even ended up getting paid some money to continue training. I was probably within the top 500 athletes worldwide. It felt like she was attacking who I am.\n\nHer friends all said that I'm an asshole for breaking up over something so small. This truly hurt, and it's a sentiment I received from people my whole life. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong for dumping his girlfriend because she made fun of his sport, trampolining. He's been in a relationship where she was okay with his sport until a conversation where she dismissed it as not being a real sport and made a comment about other sports. He took it really personally and ended the relationship immediately.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The author's perspective: he dedicated a lot of time and effort to trampolining, which was a significant part of his identity. Being told it's not a real sport by his girlfriend, especially in a context where she's comparing it to sports like soccer, might have felt like a personal attack. He might have felt disrespected and that his achievements were being trivialized. That's a valid emotional response, especially given the investment he made.\n\nOn the other hand, the girlfriend's perspective: she could have been making a joke or not fully understanding the competitive aspect of trampolining. Maybe she didn't realize how important it was to him. People sometimes make offhand comments without considering the emotional impact. However, her statement that trampolining isn't a real sport and that it's not hard to get to a high level could be seen as dismissive. That's not just a joke but a judgment on his effort and achievements.\n\nNow, considering whether the breakup was justified. Breaking up over a single conversation might be extreme, even if the topic was sensitive. It's possible that the issue had been building up, but the immediate decision to end the relationship without further discussion might be seen as an overreaction. The girlfriend's friends also called the author an asshole, which suggests that others might view the breakup as disproportionate to the situation.\n\nThe key factors here are communication and mutual respect. Did the girlfriend's comment cross a line, or was it a misunderstanding? If the author had addressed the issue calmly and expressed how he felt instead of ending the relationship abruptly, maybe they could have resolved it. However, if the comment was a reflection of a deeper issue where the girlfriend consistently belittled his achievements or interests, then the breakup might be more understandable.\n\nBut in this scenario, it seems like it was a one-time incident. The author might have overreacted, especially since he had previously mentioned that his girlfriend found his sport cool. The sudden change in her attitude could have been a shock, but ending the relationship immediately without giving her a chance to explain or apologize might not be the right approach. People can have different opinions on what constitutes a \"real\" sport, but that doesn't mean the author's feelings are invalid. However, acting on those feelings by breaking up might be seen as the author's fault, especially if there wasn't a history of similar issues.\n\nIn conclusion, while the girlfriend's comment was hurtful and disrespectful, the author's immediate decision to break up without addressing the issue or giving her a chance to make amends could be seen as the wrong move. Relationships require compromise and communication, and reacting with a breakup over a single conversation might be excessive.\n"
