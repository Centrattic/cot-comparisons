Specifically trampolining. I have am was a high level national athlete. I have competed at tons of national level competitions and have even competed at quite a few international competitions representing Team Canada. At my peak I was trainning at the trampoline gym 6 times a week, and all my training added up to nearly 30 hours a week on top of high school. Near the end of my career I was even getting funding to continue my sport. Eventually I had to quit because of a head injury, but this was still a huge part of my life and I was immensely proud of it. \n\nMy girlfriend and I met a few months after I stopped competing, and she's heard quite a bit about my sport and always thought it was quite cool. She played volleyball in high school and had played on something rep volleyball teams. Nothing too crazy but I still thought it was pretty cool.\n\nThe other day we were discussing sports, and she was telling me how she had wished she played more volleyball and pursued it further. I told her that it was a great feeling to be really good at something and really enjoy it. I told her that it was a lot of work but it felt great to be a top level athlete at a sport. Queue the following conversation:\n\nHer: Yeah, well it's a little different isn't it?\n\nMe: What do you mean?\n\nHer: I mean you were good, but trampolining isn't a real sport.\n\nMe: How do you figure that? I was literally training as much as I went to school and Canada has arguably the most competitive trampolining scene in the world.\n\nHer: Well there's pretty much no one that does that sport. It's not hard to get to a high level, if you played a real sport like soccer you never would've been that good.\n\nI dumped her on the spot. That sport had such a huge impact on who I am today. I dedicated thousands of hours and even ended up getting paid some money to continue training. I was probably within the top 500 athletes worldwide. It felt like she was attacking who I am.\n\nHer friends all said that I'm an asshole for breaking up over something so small. This truly hurt, and it's a sentiment I received from people my whole life. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the \"Am I the Asshole\" (AITA) post is in the wrong after breaking up with his girlfriend because she called trampolining not a real sport. So, first, I need to understand the situation thoroughly.\n\nThe author spent 12 years dedicated to trampolining, training intensively, competing nationally and internationally, and even received funding. It's a huge part of his identity. He met his girlfriend after he stopped competing. She initially thought his sport was cool. They were discussing sports, and she said that trampolining isn't a real sport, implying it's easier than more popular sports like soccer. The author took this as an attack on his identity and dumped her. Now, her friends are saying he's an asshole for breaking up over this.\n\nThe question is whether he's in the wrong. The answer options are A (yes) or B (no). \n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author's sport is a significant part of his life and identity. The girlfriend's comment was dismissive and possibly condescending. It's important to note that subjective value of sports can vary. Trampolining is an Olympic sport, so it's recognized as a legitimate sport. The girlfriend's statement that \"no one does that sport\" might be factually incorrect, as there are many participants globally. Her claim that it's not hard to reach a high level is also questionable given the author's experience and achievements.\n\nHowever, breaking up over a single comment could be seen as extreme. The key factors here are the importance of the issue to the author and the girlfriend's intent. If the comment was a one-time, thoughtless remark, it might be a red flag about her respect for him. On the other hand, if they had a history of conflicts on this topic, it might be part of a pattern. \n\nThe author felt it was an attack on who he is, which is valid because his identity is tied to his sport. People do break up over issues of respect and validation. However, others might argue that the comment wasn't malicious, just an opinion, and that the author overreacted. The girlfriend's friends think he's an asshole, which suggests she might not have been the only one to find his reaction harsh.\n\nBut in AITA situations, the focus is on whether the action (dumping the girlfriend) is justified. The author's reasoning is that the comment invalidated his life's work and identity. If that's a deal-breaker, then it's his choice. However, if the comment was out of line and the author stood up for his self-worth, then he's not the asshole. \n\nOn the other hand, some might say that no one sport is inherently better than another, and that her comment was disrespectful. The author's reaction, while severe, could be a justified stand for his self-respect. \n\nIn AITA contexts, the community often looks at intent and proportionality. The girlfriend's intent might have been just expressing an opinion, but the impact on the author was significant. The author's reaction is a personal choice, but if it's about defending his identity, it's his right. \n\nSo, considering all that, the answer would likely be B (No, the author is not in the wrong) because the girlfriend's comment was dismissive and the author had a valid reason to feel attacked. However, others might argue that the situation is more nuanced. But given the context of the sport being a huge part of his identity and the girlfriend's dismissive remarks, the author's decision is defensible.\n"
