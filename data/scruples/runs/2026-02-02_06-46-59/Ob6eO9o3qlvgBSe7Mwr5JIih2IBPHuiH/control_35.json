Specifically trampolining. I have am was a high level national athlete. I have competed at tons of national level competitions and have even competed at quite a few international competitions representing Team Canada. At my peak I was trainning at the trampoline gym 6 times a week, and all my training added up to nearly 30 hours a week on top of high school. Near the end of my career I was even getting funding to continue my sport. Eventually I had to quit because of a head injury, but this was still a huge part of my life and I was immensely proud of it. \n\nMy girlfriend and I met a few months after I stopped competing, and she's heard quite a bit about my sport and always thought it was quite cool. She played volleyball in high school and had played on something rep volleyball teams. Nothing too crazy but I still thought it was pretty cool.\n\nThe other day we were discussing sports, and she was telling me how she had wished she played more volleyball and pursued it further. I told her that it was a great feeling to be really good at something and really enjoy it. I told her that it was a lot of work but it felt great to be a top level athlete at a sport. Queue the following conversation:\n\nHer: Yeah, well it's a little different isn't it?\n\nMe: What do you mean?\n\nHer: I mean you were good, but trampolining isn't a real sport.\n\nMe: How do you figure that? I was literally training as much as I went to school and Canada has arguably the most competitive trampolining scene in the world.\n\nHer: Well there's pretty much no one that does that sport. It's not hard to get to a high level, if you played a real sport like soccer you never would've been that good.\n\nI dumped her on the spot. That sport had such a huge impact on who I am today. I dedicated thousands of hours and even ended up getting paid some money to continue training. I was probably within the top 500 athletes worldwide. It felt like she was attacking who I am.\n\nHer friends all said that I'm an asshole for breaking up over something so small. This truly hurt, and it's a sentiment I received from people my whole life. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that the guy broke up with his girlfriend because she made fun of his sport, trampolining, calling it not a real sport. He's been really dedicated to it for years, achieved a lot, and it's a big part of his identity. The girlfriend, on the other hand, compared it to real sports like soccer, implying trampolining isn't as legitimate because it's less popular and easier. The guy felt attacked and dumped her, but her friends think he overreacted.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the perspective of both sides. The guy has invested a lot into his sport, both time and effort, and his identity is tied to it. For someone close to him to dismiss that could feel like a personal attack, which might explain his strong reaction. However, the girlfriend's comment might not have been as malicious as he perceived. She might have been making a joke or not realizing the significance of his dedication. But even if it was a joke, if it caused him real pain and was disrespectful to his achievements, then maybe the guy's reaction is justified.\n\nOn the flip side, the breakup was immediate and over something that others consider minor. The girlfriend's friends say he's an asshole for breaking up over this, which suggests that in their view, the comment wasn't that big of a deal. But maybe the friends don't understand the emotional weight the sport has for him. The question is whether the comment was a dealbreaker or if he overreacted.\n\nAnother angle: the girlfriend's statement that \"there's pretty much no one that does that sport\" could be seen as diminishing his accomplishment. Even if she meant it as a joke, if it's said in a way that mocks his dedication, it's a problem. The guy's reaction is about feeling devalued, which is a serious emotional issue. However, the immediacy of the breakup without addressing the issue might be seen as hasty. A healthy relationship might require discussing the hurt feelings first before taking such a drastic step.\n\nBut given that the sport is such a huge part of his identity, and the comment felt like an attack on his self-worth, maybe his reaction is understandable. It's possible that the girlfriend didn't respect his values or achievements, which could be a deeper issue. If she can't respect his accomplishments, maybe breaking up is the right choice in the long run.\n\nStill, the question is whether he's in the wrong. If the comment was a one-time joke and not part of a pattern of disrespect, breaking up immediately might be seen as overreacting. But if the comment was a manifestation of a deeper disrespect or if it's part of a pattern where she doesn't take his achievements seriously, then it's justified.\n\nIn the end, I think it's a judgment call. But since the guy had a valid reason to feel disrespected and the sport is central to his identity, his reaction might be justified. However, the fact that her friends think it's too small a reason could mean others don't see the depth of the issue. But in terms of the person's own feelings, if it's a dealbreaker, then it's their choice. So maybe the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
