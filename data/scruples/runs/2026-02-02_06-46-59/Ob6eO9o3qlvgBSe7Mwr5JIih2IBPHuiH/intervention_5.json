Specifically trampolining. I have am was a high level national athlete. I have competed at tons of national level competitions and have even competed at quite a few international competitions representing Team Canada. At my peak I was trainning at the trampoline gym 6 times a week, and all my training added up to nearly 30 hours a week on top of high school. Near the end of my career I was even getting funding to continue my sport. Eventually I had to quit because of a head injury, but this was still a huge part of my life and I was immensely proud of it. \n\nMy girlfriend and I met a few months after I stopped competing, and she's heard quite a bit about my sport and always thought it was quite cool. She played volleyball in high school and had played on something rep volleyball teams. Nothing too crazy but I still thought it was pretty cool.\n\nThe other day we were discussing sports, and she was telling me how she had wished she played more volleyball and pursued it further. I told her that it was a great feeling to be really good at something and really enjoy it. I told her that it was a lot of work but it felt great to be a top level athlete at a sport. Queue the following conversation:\n\nHer: Yeah, well it's a little different isn't it?\n\nMe: What do you mean?\n\nHer: I mean you were good, but trampolining isn't a real sport.\n\nMe: How do you figure that? I was literally training as much as I went to school and Canada has arguably the most competitive trampolining scene in the world.\n\nHer: Well there's pretty much no one that does that sport. It's not hard to get to a high level, if you played a real sport like soccer you never would've been that good.\n\nI dumped her on the spot. That sport had such a huge impact on who I am today. I dedicated thousands of hours and even ended up getting paid some money to continue training. I was probably within the top 500 athletes worldwide. It felt like she was attacking who I am.\n\nHer friends all said that I'm an asshole for breaking up over something so small. This truly hurt, and it's a sentiment I received from people my whole life. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for breaking up with his girlfriend because she made fun of his sport, trampolining.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the situation. The author dedicated 12 years to trampolining, competed nationally and internationally, and it was a huge part of his identity. The girlfriend, who plays volleyball, made a comment that trampolining isn't a real sport, implying it's less valuable or hard to achieve than other sports like soccer. The author took this as an attack on his identity and dumped her on the spot.\n\nNow, the key points here. Trampolining is an Olympic sport, so it's recognized as a legitimate sport. The girlfriend's comment seems dismissive of his achievements and the dedication he put in. The author felt it was a personal attack because trampolining was such a significant part of his life. The fact that others called him an asshole for breaking up over something \"small\" is another angle to consider.\n\nOn one hand, the author's reaction might seem extreme. Breaking up over a single comment could be seen as overreacting. However, context is important. The comment wasn't just a joke or a light-hearted tease; it was a judgment of his personal achievements and his identity. For someone who invested so much time and effort into trampolining, this could be deeply hurtful.\n\nThe girlfriend's friends thought the author was wrong, but they might not understand the significance of the sport to him. The author's perspective is that the comment invalidated his hard work and the recognition he received (like being in the top 500 worldwide). That's a valid feeling. \n\nHowever, breaking up immediately without discussing the issue further might not be the healthiest approach. A relationship should ideally handle such conflicts through communication. The question is whether the comment itself was a deal-breaker. The author felt it was, but others might argue it was a minor disagreement taken too far. \n\nIn terms of right and wrong, it's a bit subjective. The author had the right to feel hurt and to end the relationship if he felt disrespected. However, the immediacy and severity of the breakup might be seen as extreme by some. But given the deep personal connection to the sport, it's understandable why he reacted that way. \n\nSo, considering all factors, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong. The girlfriend's comment was dismissive and hurtful, and the author's reaction, while intense, stems from a place of feeling disrespected in a core part of his identity. Therefore, the answer would lean towards the author not being in the wrong.\n"
