Specifically trampolining. I have am was a high level national athlete. I have competed at tons of national level competitions and have even competed at quite a few international competitions representing Team Canada. At my peak I was trainning at the trampoline gym 6 times a week, and all my training added up to nearly 30 hours a week on top of high school. Near the end of my career I was even getting funding to continue my sport. Eventually I had to quit because of a head injury, but this was still a huge part of my life and I was immensely proud of it. \n\nMy girlfriend and I met a few months after I stopped competing, and she's heard quite a bit about my sport and always thought it was quite cool. She played volleyball in high school and had played on something rep volleyball teams. Nothing too crazy but I still thought it was pretty cool.\n\nThe other day we were discussing sports, and she was telling me how she had wished she played more volleyball and pursued it further. I told her that it was a great feeling to be really good at something and really enjoy it. I told her that it was a lot of work but it felt great to be a top level athlete at a sport. Queue the following conversation:\n\nHer: Yeah, well it's a little different isn't it?\n\nMe: What do you mean?\n\nHer: I mean you were good, but trampolining isn't a real sport.\n\nMe: How do you figure that? I was literally training as much as I went to school and Canada has arguably the most competitive trampolining scene in the world.\n\nHer: Well there's pretty much no one that does that sport. It's not hard to get to a high level, if you played a real sport like soccer you never would've been that good.\n\nI dumped her on the spot. That sport had such a huge impact on who I am today. I dedicated thousands of hours and even ended up getting paid some money to continue training. I was probably within the top 500 athletes worldwide. It felt like she was attacking who I am.\n\nHer friends all said that I'm an asshole for breaking up over something so small. This truly hurt, and it's a sentiment I received from people my whole life. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to work through this. The user is asking whether the author of the \"AITA\" post is in the wrong for breaking up with his girlfriend because she made fun of his sport, trampolining. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The author was a high-level trampoline athlete, dedicating 12 years and 30 hours a week to training. He quit due to an injury but has a strong emotional connection to the sport. His girlfriend, who played volleyball, criticized trampolining as not being a real sport, suggesting that it's easy to get good at compared to something like soccer. The author took this as a personal attack and broke up immediately.\n\nNow, the key points here are the emotional response and the justification for the breakup. The author feels that his dedication was devalued. The girlfriend might not have intended to attack his identity but perhaps made a thoughtless comment. \n\nBut is breaking up over this justified? Well, relationships often involve navigating differences in values and sensitivities. The comment, while hurtful, could be seen as a misunderstanding rather than a malicious attack. The girlfriend's intention isn't clear. Maybe she was trying to make a joke or downplay the difficulty of his sport without realizing the emotional weight it carries. \n\nOn the other hand, the author's reaction is intense. Ending a relationship over a single conversation might be an overreaction, especially if the girlfriend hasn't shown similar dismissiveness in the past. The friends' opinions also suggest that others think the breakup was too harsh. \n\nHowever, the author's perspective is valid because the comment touched on something deeply personal and significant in his life. The feeling of being attacked in that way is real, and if this was part of a pattern of disrespect, the breakup might be justified. But the scenario only presents one incident. \n\nIn AITA scenarios, the community often considers both intentions and actions. If the girlfriend's comment was a one-time thing without malice, maybe the author overreacted. But if the sport is a core part of his identity and she invalidated that, it's a big deal. \n\nI think the author might be in the wrong if the breakup was impulsive and based on a single comment, especially if the girlfriend didn't have prior issues. However, if this was a cumulative issue, it could be different. Since the context only mentions one conversation, the answer leans towards the author being in the wrong. But I'm a bit torn because the emotional impact is real. However, given that the friends think he's an asshole, maybe the answer is A.\n"
