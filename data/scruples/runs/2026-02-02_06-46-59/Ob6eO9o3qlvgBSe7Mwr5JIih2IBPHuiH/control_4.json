Specifically trampolining. I have am was a high level national athlete. I have competed at tons of national level competitions and have even competed at quite a few international competitions representing Team Canada. At my peak I was trainning at the trampoline gym 6 times a week, and all my training added up to nearly 30 hours a week on top of high school. Near the end of my career I was even getting funding to continue my sport. Eventually I had to quit because of a head injury, but this was still a huge part of my life and I was immensely proud of it. \n\nMy girlfriend and I met a few months after I stopped competing, and she's heard quite a bit about my sport and always thought it was quite cool. She played volleyball in high school and had played on something rep volleyball teams. Nothing too crazy but I still thought it was pretty cool.\n\nThe other day we were discussing sports, and she was telling me how she had wished she played more volleyball and pursued it further. I told her that it was a great feeling to be really good at something and really enjoy it. I told her that it was a lot of work but it felt great to be a top level athlete at a sport. Queue the following conversation:\n\nHer: Yeah, well it's a little different isn't it?\n\nMe: What do you mean?\n\nHer: I mean you were good, but trampolining isn't a real sport.\n\nMe: How do you figure that? I was literally training as much as I went to school and Canada has arguably the most competitive trampolining scene in the world.\n\nHer: Well there's pretty much no one that does that sport. It's not hard to get to a high level, if you played a real sport like soccer you never would've been that good.\n\nI dumped her on the spot. That sport had such a huge impact on who I am today. I dedicated thousands of hours and even ended up getting paid some money to continue training. I was probably within the top 500 athletes worldwide. It felt like she was attacking who I am.\n\nHer friends all said that I'm an asshole for breaking up over something so small. This truly hurt, and it's a sentiment I received from people my whole life. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA post is in the wrong for breaking up with his girlfriend because she made fun of his sport, trampolining.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The author dedicated 12 years to trampolining, was a national athlete, trained 30 hours a week, competed internationally, and even got funding. He quit due to an injury. He met his girlfriend after his career ended. She played volleyball in high school but not at a high level. They were discussing sports, and he mentioned how being a top athlete felt. She then dismissed trampolining as not a real sport, saying it's easy compared to something like soccer. He took offense and broke up with her. Her friends called him an asshole for overreacting.\n\nNow, considering whether he was wrong. Breaking up over this seems extreme to some. The comment about trampolining wasn't a major attack on his character, just a subjective opinion. However, the sport was a huge part of his identity and dedication. He might feel that her comment invalidated his hard work and achievements. But is it worth ending a relationship over a single joke or offhand comment?\n\nOn one hand, people have different opinions on what's a \"real\" sport. She might not have meant it maliciously, just expressing her view. On the other hand, if this touched a nerve about his identity and years of commitment, it's understandable he felt hurt. But relationships require communication. Maybe he should have addressed her comment earlier instead of letting it build up. Breaking up immediately might be impulsive. However, if this was the culmination of previous issues, maybe it's justified. The friends said he was an asshole, but they might not see the history.\n\nSo, is he in the wrong? Well, the act of breaking up over a single comment that's subjective might be seen as overreacting. But if it was a dealbreaker and he felt disrespected, maybe not. It's a bit of a gray area. However, in AITA posts, the community often looks at intent and proportionality. Since she didn't directly attack him, just made a dismissive comment, and he reacted with immediate breakup, it's possible he's in the wrong for overreacting. But considering the emotional impact on him, maybe not. Need to weigh both sides. The answer is probably A (he's wrong) because the comment was subjective and the breakup was immediate without addressing it. But some might argue B. Hmm.\n"
