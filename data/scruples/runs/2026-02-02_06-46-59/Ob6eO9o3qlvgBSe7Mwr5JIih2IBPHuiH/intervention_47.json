Specifically trampolining. I have am was a high level national athlete. I have competed at tons of national level competitions and have even competed at quite a few international competitions representing Team Canada. At my peak I was trainning at the trampoline gym 6 times a week, and all my training added up to nearly 30 hours a week on top of high school. Near the end of my career I was even getting funding to continue my sport. Eventually I had to quit because of a head injury, but this was still a huge part of my life and I was immensely proud of it. \n\nMy girlfriend and I met a few months after I stopped competing, and she's heard quite a bit about my sport and always thought it was quite cool. She played volleyball in high school and had played on something rep volleyball teams. Nothing too crazy but I still thought it was pretty cool.\n\nThe other day we were discussing sports, and she was telling me how she had wished she played more volleyball and pursued it further. I told her that it was a great feeling to be really good at something and really enjoy it. I told her that it was a lot of work but it felt great to be a top level athlete at a sport. Queue the following conversation:\n\nHer: Yeah, well it's a little different isn't it?\n\nMe: What do you mean?\n\nHer: I mean you were good, but trampolining isn't a real sport.\n\nMe: How do you figure that? I was literally training as much as I went to school and Canada has arguably the most competitive trampolining scene in the world.\n\nHer: Well there's pretty much no one that does that sport. It's not hard to get to a high level, if you played a real sport like soccer you never would've been that good.\n\nI dumped her on the spot. That sport had such a huge impact on who I am today. I dedicated thousands of hours and even ended up getting paid some money to continue training. I was probably within the top 500 athletes worldwide. It felt like she was attacking who I am.\n\nHer friends all said that I'm an asshole for breaking up over something so small. This truly hurt, and it's a sentiment I received from people my whole life. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of this AITA (Am I the Asshole?) post is in the wrong. The situation is about breaking up with a girlfriend because she made fun of his sport, trampolining. The author has a long history with the sport, dedicating over a decade, training extensively, and competing at a high level. The girlfriend downplays the sport, saying it's not a real sport and that it's easy compared to others like soccer. The author felt attacked and dumped her immediately. Now, people are divided: his side thinks he's justified, while the girlfriend's friends think he overreacted.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both perspectives. The author's dedication and passion for trampolining are significant. It's a valid sport with international competitions, recognized by the Olympics. The girlfriend's comment was dismissive, which can be hurtful. But was her comment a deal-breaker? Maybe the author overreacted. Relationships require communication and understanding. If the girlfriend made a one-time joke, maybe the author's response was too harsh. However, if the joke invalidated his years of effort and identity, it's understandable he felt attacked. The key here is whether the comment was a significant enough issue to end the relationship. The girlfriend's friends say it's too small, but for the author, it's about respect for his identity.\n\nAlso, trampolining is an Olympic sport, so calling it \"not real\" is factually incorrect. That could be a point against her. But the question is about the author's actions. Did he act in the wrong by breaking up over this? Maybe he should have addressed it first instead of immediate breakup. However, if it was a deal-breaker from the start, then it's his choice. The AITA questions often consider if the person's reaction is proportional. His friends might see it as a valid reaction because it's a core part of his identity. The girlfriend's friends see it as overreacting. So, which side is more justified? I think the author might be in the right because respecting someone's passion is important in a relationship. If she couldn't respect that, maybe he's justified. But some might argue it's a trivial reason to break up. It's a bit of a toss-up. The answer could be B (not in the wrong) because the comment was disrespectful to his identity. But others might say he overreacted. Hmm.\n"
