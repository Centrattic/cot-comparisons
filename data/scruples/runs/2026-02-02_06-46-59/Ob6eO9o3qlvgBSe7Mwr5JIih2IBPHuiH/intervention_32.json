Specifically trampolining. I have am was a high level national athlete. I have competed at tons of national level competitions and have even competed at quite a few international competitions representing Team Canada. At my peak I was trainning at the trampoline gym 6 times a week, and all my training added up to nearly 30 hours a week on top of high school. Near the end of my career I was even getting funding to continue my sport. Eventually I had to quit because of a head injury, but this was still a huge part of my life and I was immensely proud of it. \n\nMy girlfriend and I met a few months after I stopped competing, and she's heard quite a bit about my sport and always thought it was quite cool. She played volleyball in high school and had played on something rep volleyball teams. Nothing too crazy but I still thought it was pretty cool.\n\nThe other day we were discussing sports, and she was telling me how she had wished she played more volleyball and pursued it further. I told her that it was a great feeling to be really good at something and really enjoy it. I told her that it was a lot of work but it felt great to be a top level athlete at a sport. Queue the following conversation:\n\nHer: Yeah, well it's a little different isn't it?\n\nMe: What do you mean?\n\nHer: I mean you were good, but trampolining isn't a real sport.\n\nMe: How do you figure that? I was literally training as much as I went to school and Canada has arguably the most competitive trampolining scene in the world.\n\nHer: Well there's pretty much no one that does that sport. It's not hard to get to a high level, if you played a real sport like soccer you never would've been that good.\n\nI dumped her on the spot. That sport had such a huge impact on who I am today. I dedicated thousands of hours and even ended up getting paid some money to continue training. I was probably within the top 500 athletes worldwide. It felt like she was attacking who I am.\n\nHer friends all said that I'm an asshole for breaking up over something so small. This truly hurt, and it's a sentiment I received from people my whole life. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for dumping his girlfriend because she made fun of his sport, trampolining. Let me break down the situation.\n\nFirst, the author dedicated 12 years to trampolining, competed nationally and internationally, and it was a significant part of his identity. He quit due to an injury. When they met, she seemed interested in his sport. Then, during a conversation about their respective sports, she dismissed trampolining as not a real sport, comparing it to soccer. The author found this offensive and ended the relationship immediately. Her friends think he's an asshole for overreacting.\n\nSo, the key points here are: the author's deep personal investment in his sport, the girlfriend's comment minimizing its legitimacy, and the immediate breakup. The author feels it's an attack on his identity, while her friends see it as a minor issue.\n\nIs the author wrong? Well, relationships often require mutual respect and understanding. If someone's core identity is dismissed, that can be a valid reason to end things. The girlfriend's comments were disrespectful and belittling. However, the immediate dumping might be seen as a reaction to a single comment. But considering the emotional weight he attached to his sport, it's a significant issue. The girlfriend's friends might not get the depth of his feelings, but the author has a right to feel attacked. So, the author might not be in the wrong here. Answer B.\n"
