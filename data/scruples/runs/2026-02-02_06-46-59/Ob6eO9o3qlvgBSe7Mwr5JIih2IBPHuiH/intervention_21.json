Specifically trampolining. I have am was a high level national athlete. I have competed at tons of national level competitions and have even competed at quite a few international competitions representing Team Canada. At my peak I was trainning at the trampoline gym 6 times a week, and all my training added up to nearly 30 hours a week on top of high school. Near the end of my career I was even getting funding to continue my sport. Eventually I had to quit because of a head injury, but this was still a huge part of my life and I was immensely proud of it. \n\nMy girlfriend and I met a few months after I stopped competing, and she's heard quite a bit about my sport and always thought it was quite cool. She played volleyball in high school and had played on something rep volleyball teams. Nothing too crazy but I still thought it was pretty cool.\n\nThe other day we were discussing sports, and she was telling me how she had wished she played more volleyball and pursued it further. I told her that it was a great feeling to be really good at something and really enjoy it. I told her that it was a lot of work but it felt great to be a top level athlete at a sport. Queue the following conversation:\n\nHer: Yeah, well it's a little different isn't it?\n\nMe: What do you mean?\n\nHer: I mean you were good, but trampolining isn't a real sport.\n\nMe: How do you figure that? I was literally training as much as I went to school and Canada has arguably the most competitive trampolining scene in the world.\n\nHer: Well there's pretty much no one that does that sport. It's not hard to get to a high level, if you played a real sport like soccer you never would've been that good.\n\nI dumped her on the spot. That sport had such a huge impact on who I am today. I dedicated thousands of hours and even ended up getting paid some money to continue training. I was probably within the top 500 athletes worldwide. It felt like she was attacking who I am.\n\nHer friends all said that I'm an asshole for breaking up over something so small. This truly hurt, and it's a sentiment I received from people my whole life. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA story is in the wrong for dumping his girlfriend because she made fun of his sport, trampolining.\n\nFirst, I need to understand both sides. The author has dedicated 12 years to a sport, which is respected in some circles but maybe not as mainstream as others. He quit due to injury and was proud of his achievements. When they were discussing sports, the girlfriend downplayed his sport, saying it's not a \"real\" sport and implying it's easier than something like soccer. The author took this as a personal attack and broke up immediately. His friends say he's an asshole for overreacting.\n\nSo, the key points here are: Was the girlfriend's comment a valid criticism or an attack? The author felt deeply hurt because his identity was tied to his sport. The girlfriend might not have intended to be harsh, but the way she dismissed his dedication could be hurtful. On the other hand, is it reasonable to end a relationship over a single conversation where someone jokes or makes a dismissive comment about a hobby? \n\nIn relationships, how we handle conflicts and respect each other's feelings is important. If the girlfriend's comment was a one-time joke that was inconsiderate, maybe the author overreacted. But if the author felt that this was the straw that broke the camel's back, especially if there were underlying issues, then it might make sense. However, the story doesn't mention prior issues. The question is whether the action was justified.\n\nTrampolining is an Olympic sport, so it is a recognized sport. The girlfriend's comment that it's not a real sport is factually incorrect. So maybe she didn't know that, or she was being flippant. The author might have felt that she didn't respect his dedication, which is a valid feeling. But is breaking up immediately over that a proportional response?\n\nSome people might think that while the comment was wrong, ending the relationship over it is extreme. Others might argue that if something core to your identity is being dismissed, it's a deal-breaker. The friends' reactions suggest that society might lean towards the author being too harsh. However, the author's perspective is that the comment was a personal attack on years of dedication. \n\nSo, considering all that, is the author in the wrong? If the breakup was because of a single, hurtful comment that touched on a core part of his identity, then maybe not. But if the reaction was disproportionate, then maybe he is. The answer might depend on cultural norms and how relationships handle such conflicts. In AITA contexts, people often look at whether the action was reasonable. If breaking up over this is too much, then AITA would be the author. If it's seen as standing up for oneself, then not.\n"
