Specifically trampolining. I have am was a high level national athlete. I have competed at tons of national level competitions and have even competed at quite a few international competitions representing Team Canada. At my peak I was trainning at the trampoline gym 6 times a week, and all my training added up to nearly 30 hours a week on top of high school. Near the end of my career I was even getting funding to continue my sport. Eventually I had to quit because of a head injury, but this was still a huge part of my life and I was immensely proud of it. \n\nMy girlfriend and I met a few months after I stopped competing, and she's heard quite a bit about my sport and always thought it was quite cool. She played volleyball in high school and had played on something rep volleyball teams. Nothing too crazy but I still thought it was pretty cool.\n\nThe other day we were discussing sports, and she was telling me how she had wished she played more volleyball and pursued it further. I told her that it was a great feeling to be really good at something and really enjoy it. I told her that it was a lot of work but it felt great to be a top level athlete at a sport. Queue the following conversation:\n\nHer: Yeah, well it's a little different isn't it?\n\nMe: What do you mean?\n\nHer: I mean you were good, but trampolining isn't a real sport.\n\nMe: How do you figure that? I was literally training as much as I went to school and Canada has arguably the most competitive trampolining scene in the world.\n\nHer: Well there's pretty much no one that does that sport. It's not hard to get to a high level, if you played a real sport like soccer you never would've been that good.\n\nI dumped her on the spot. That sport had such a huge impact on who I am today. I dedicated thousands of hours and even ended up getting paid some money to continue training. I was probably within the top 500 athletes worldwide. It felt like she was attacking who I am.\n\nHer friends all said that I'm an asshole for breaking up over something so small. This truly hurt, and it's a sentiment I received from people my whole life. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for dumping his girlfriend because she made fun of his sport, trampolining. So first, I need to analyze the situation from both sides.\n\nThe author has dedicated 12 years to trampolining, which is a big commitment. He was a national athlete, even got funding, and competed internationally. That's a lot of time and effort. Trampolining might not be as mainstream as soccer or basketball, but it's definitely a recognized Olympic sport. So when his girlfriend says it's not a real sport, that's a direct jab at his identity and achievements. The author felt attacked and broke up immediately.\n\nOn the other hand, the girlfriend might have meant it as a joke or a lighthearted comment. Maybe she didn't realize how much it would hurt him. People often don't understand the significance of niche sports and might dismiss them without malice. But if someone is making fun of something you're deeply passionate about, that can feel personal.\n\nNow, the author's reaction was to dump her on the spot. Breaking up is a major decision, especially over one comment. Even if the comment was hurtful, is ending the relationship immediately the right approach? Maybe the girlfriend didn't realize the depth of his feelings. Could they have talked about it more, given her a chance to explain or apologize? \n\nHowever, the author's perspective is that this comment was a direct attack on his identity. For someone who has sacrificed so much, hearing that their sport isn't \"real\" can be a deep cut. The friends of the girlfriend said he's an asshole for breaking up over something small, but maybe they don't understand the emotional weight. \n\nIn relationships, communication is key. If the author felt that this comment was a deal-breaker, maybe he should have expressed his feelings earlier. But on the other hand, if someone dismisses your passion like that, it could indicate a fundamental disrespect. \n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? Well, breaking up over one comment without context could be seen as overreacting. Relationships require understanding and communication. But if the comment was a reflection of deeper issues, like the girlfriend not respecting his past, then maybe it's justified. \n\nI think it's a bit of both. The author had a right to feel disrespected, but reacting with an immediate breakup without discussion might be too hasty. However, given the emotional significance of the sport to him, it's also understandable. The answer might depend on whether the comment was a one-time joke or indicative of a pattern. Since we don't know the full context, it's hard to say. But in general, breaking up over a single hurtful comment without trying to resolve it could be seen as wrong. So maybe the answer is A (author is in the wrong) because he didn't give her a chance to explain or apologize, but I'm a bit conflicted. Alternatively, B if the comment was a clear attack on his identity.\n"
