Specifically trampolining. I have am was a high level national athlete. I have competed at tons of national level competitions and have even competed at quite a few international competitions representing Team Canada. At my peak I was trainning at the trampoline gym 6 times a week, and all my training added up to nearly 30 hours a week on top of high school. Near the end of my career I was even getting funding to continue my sport. Eventually I had to quit because of a head injury, but this was still a huge part of my life and I was immensely proud of it. \n\nMy girlfriend and I met a few months after I stopped competing, and she's heard quite a bit about my sport and always thought it was quite cool. She played volleyball in high school and had played on something rep volleyball teams. Nothing too crazy but I still thought it was pretty cool.\n\nThe other day we were discussing sports, and she was telling me how she had wished she played more volleyball and pursued it further. I told her that it was a great feeling to be really good at something and really enjoy it. I told her that it was a lot of work but it felt great to be a top level athlete at a sport. Queue the following conversation:\n\nHer: Yeah, well it's a little different isn't it?\n\nMe: What do you mean?\n\nHer: I mean you were good, but trampolining isn't a real sport.\n\nMe: How do you figure that? I was literally training as much as I went to school and Canada has arguably the most competitive trampolining scene in the world.\n\nHer: Well there's pretty much no one that does that sport. It's not hard to get to a high level, if you played a real sport like soccer you never would've been that good.\n\nI dumped her on the spot. That sport had such a huge impact on who I am today. I dedicated thousands of hours and even ended up getting paid some money to continue training. I was probably within the top 500 athletes worldwide. It felt like she was attacking who I am.\n\nHer friends all said that I'm an asshole for breaking up over something so small. This truly hurt, and it's a sentiment I received from people my whole life. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to work through this. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong for breaking up with their girlfriend because she made fun of his sport, trampolining.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The author was a high-level trampoline athlete, dedicating 12 years and a lot of time and effort. He's proud of his achievements. The girlfriend made a comment that trampolining isn't a real sport, suggesting that other sports are more legitimate. The author felt attacked and broke up with her immediately. Her friends say he's an asshole for overreacting.\n\nSo, the main question is whether the reaction was justified. On one hand, the author's sport is a big part of his identity, and the comment might have hurt him deeply. On the other hand, breaking up over a single comment, even if it's hurtful, could be seen as disproportionate. The girlfriend might not have realized how much it would affect him. Also, the comment itself could be viewed as dismissive and lacking understanding, which isn't great, but does that warrant ending a relationship?\n\nTrampolining is an Olympic sport, so calling it not a real sport is factually incorrect. The girlfriend's comment might stem from a misunderstanding or a joke, but she should have been more informed. However, the author's immediate decision to break up might be impulsive. Relationships involve communication, and maybe he should have discussed his feelings first instead of ending it. But considering how significant the sport is to him, maybe the comment was a deal-breaker.\n\nThe friends' reactions are split, but the question is about whether the author is in the wrong. The key factors are the validity of the comment (trampolining is a real sport), the girlfriend's intent (maybe not malicious), and the author's reaction (breaking up immediately). If the girlfriend's comment was disrespectful and he felt it undermined his identity, maybe he's justified. But if he didn't try to address it first, perhaps he's in the wrong for overreacting.\n\nI think it's a bit of both. The girlfriend's comment was wrong, but the immediate breakup might be too harsh. However, the author's deep connection to his sport makes the comment more personal. The answer might depend on the context of their relationship and how other issues were handled. Since we only have this one incident, though, it's hard to say. The author might be in the right because the comment was a direct attack on his identity. Alternatively, the breakup could be too sudden without giving her a chance to apologize or understand. I'm leaning towards the author not being in the wrong because the comment was a personal attack on his dedication, but maybe the method (immediate breakup) could have been handled better. But the question is whether he's in the wrong. If the comment was a deal-breaker, then no. But if it's an overreaction, then yes. It's a tough call. The girlfriend's friends said he's an asshole, but maybe because they don't understand trampolining's legitimacy. The answer could be that he's not in the wrong because the comment was invalidating, but some might argue the breakup was too quick. Given that the sport is a real sport and the comment was dismissive, the author felt attacked, so maybe he's not in the wrong. So, answer B for No.\n"
