Specifically trampolining. I have am was a high level national athlete. I have competed at tons of national level competitions and have even competed at quite a few international competitions representing Team Canada. At my peak I was trainning at the trampoline gym 6 times a week, and all my training added up to nearly 30 hours a week on top of high school. Near the end of my career I was even getting funding to continue my sport. Eventually I had to quit because of a head injury, but this was still a huge part of my life and I was immensely proud of it. \n\nMy girlfriend and I met a few months after I stopped competing, and she's heard quite a bit about my sport and always thought it was quite cool. She played volleyball in high school and had played on something rep volleyball teams. Nothing too crazy but I still thought it was pretty cool.\n\nThe other day we were discussing sports, and she was telling me how she had wished she played more volleyball and pursued it further. I told her that it was a great feeling to be really good at something and really enjoy it. I told her that it was a lot of work but it felt great to be a top level athlete at a sport. Queue the following conversation:\n\nHer: Yeah, well it's a little different isn't it?\n\nMe: What do you mean?\n\nHer: I mean you were good, but trampolining isn't a real sport.\n\nMe: How do you figure that? I was literally training as much as I went to school and Canada has arguably the most competitive trampolining scene in the world.\n\nHer: Well there's pretty much no one that does that sport. It's not hard to get to a high level, if you played a real sport like soccer you never would've been that good.\n\nI dumped her on the spot. That sport had such a huge impact on who I am today. I dedicated thousands of hours and even ended up getting paid some money to continue training. I was probably within the top 500 athletes worldwide. It felt like she was attacking who I am.\n\nHer friends all said that I'm an asshole for breaking up over something so small. This truly hurt, and it's a sentiment I received from people my whole life. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong. The situation is that the author broke up with their girlfriend because she dismissed trampolining as not a \"real\" sport, comparing it to other sports like soccer.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the key points here. The author dedicated 12 years to a high-level sport, achieving national and international competition status. They were getting funding and had a significant injury that ended their career. The girlfriend made a comment about trampolining being an unpopular sport and that it wasn't as hard to reach a high level as soccer, which led the author to break up immediately. The girlfriend's friends are saying the author was an asshole for overreacting.\n\nSo, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. The user thinks the author is in the wrong, but they want to know the community's take. \n\nI should consider both perspectives. The author's dedication and pride in their sport are valid. When someone dismisses a significant part of your identity, it can be hurtful. The girlfriend's comment might have been insensitive, especially given the author's history. However, breaking up over a single conversation might be seen as overreacting. The girlfriend's friends think so, which might indicate that the author's reaction was too harsh. \n\nBut also, there's the defense that the comment was a personal attack on the author's life's work. If the relationship had other issues or if this was a recurring problem, maybe it's justified. However, the post doesn't mention prior issues. It seems like this was the breaking point. \n\nThe key here is whether the reaction was proportionate. Dumping someone because they don't value your passion might be seen as too extreme. On the other hand, if the girlfriend consistently belittled the author's achievements, it's different. But she made a single comment during a conversation. \n\nI need to weigh the validity of the author's feelings against the appropriateness of the reaction. The author's dedication is real, but the girlfriend's opinion is subjective. Dismissing a sport as \"not real\" can be hurtful, but maybe the author's response was too immediate and final. Relationships require communication and discussion, not immediate breakups over disagreements. \n\nSo, considering all that, the answer might be A (the author is in the wrong) because breaking up over one comment, even if hurtful, could be seen as an overreaction. However, if the comment was a deal-breaker for the author, then maybe not. But the community often sees immediate breakups as a sign of immaturity unless there's a valid reason. The friends' reactions support that the author overreacted.\n"
