Specifically trampolining. I have am was a high level national athlete. I have competed at tons of national level competitions and have even competed at quite a few international competitions representing Team Canada. At my peak I was trainning at the trampoline gym 6 times a week, and all my training added up to nearly 30 hours a week on top of high school. Near the end of my career I was even getting funding to continue my sport. Eventually I had to quit because of a head injury, but this was still a huge part of my life and I was immensely proud of it. \n\nMy girlfriend and I met a few months after I stopped competing, and she's heard quite a bit about my sport and always thought it was quite cool. She played volleyball in high school and had played on something rep volleyball teams. Nothing too crazy but I still thought it was pretty cool.\n\nThe other day we were discussing sports, and she was telling me how she had wished she played more volleyball and pursued it further. I told her that it was a great feeling to be really good at something and really enjoy it. I told her that it was a lot of work but it felt great to be a top level athlete at a sport. Queue the following conversation:\n\nHer: Yeah, well it's a little different isn't it?\n\nMe: What do you mean?\n\nHer: I mean you were good, but trampolining isn't a real sport.\n\nMe: How do you figure that? I was literally training as much as I went to school and Canada has arguably the most competitive trampolining scene in the world.\n\nHer: Well there's pretty much no one that does that sport. It's not hard to get to a high level, if you played a real sport like soccer you never would've been that good.\n\nI dumped her on the spot. That sport had such a huge impact on who I am today. I dedicated thousands of hours and even ended up getting paid some money to continue training. I was probably within the top 500 athletes worldwide. It felt like she was attacking who I am.\n\nHer friends all said that I'm an asshole for breaking up over something so small. This truly hurt, and it's a sentiment I received from people my whole life. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for breaking up with his girlfriend because she made fun of his sport, trampolining.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author dedicated 12 years to trampoline gymnastics, competed nationally and internationally, and it was a huge part of his identity. He even got funding. He quit due to an injury. When they met, she thought it was cool, but later mocked it by saying it's not a real sport and that it's not hard compared to others like soccer. The author then dumps her, and now her friends think he's an asshole for overreacting.\n\nThe key question is whether the reaction is justified. The girlfriend's comments were dismissive of his dedication and achievements. The author felt the comments attacked who he is, which is understandable given the time and effort he invested. However, some might argue that breaking up over this is too extreme, especially since trampolining is less mainstream and others might not understand its significance.\n\nOn the other hand, if someone's core identity is being devalued by a partner, that can be a deal-breaker. The fact that she dismissed his sport as not real and implied he wasn't good because of the sport's difficulty level could be seen as undermining his hard work. Relationships require mutual respect, and if one partner doesn't respect the other's passions, that's a problem.\n\nBut is breaking up over this too harsh? Some might say that while her comments were hurtful, the break-up was over a single comment and not a pattern of disrespect. Others might argue that for someone who invested so much into their sport, this was a fundamental disrespect of their identity.\n\nI think it's a bit of both. The girlfriend's comments were definitely disrespectful, but the author's reaction was immediate and final. Depending on the relationship's context, maybe there was more to it. However, based solely on the information given, the author's feelings are valid. So, the answer might be that he's not in the wrong because the breakup was in response to a direct attack on his identity and achievements.\n"
