Specifically trampolining. I have am was a high level national athlete. I have competed at tons of national level competitions and have even competed at quite a few international competitions representing Team Canada. At my peak I was trainning at the trampoline gym 6 times a week, and all my training added up to nearly 30 hours a week on top of high school. Near the end of my career I was even getting funding to continue my sport. Eventually I had to quit because of a head injury, but this was still a huge part of my life and I was immensely proud of it. \n\nMy girlfriend and I met a few months after I stopped competing, and she's heard quite a bit about my sport and always thought it was quite cool. She played volleyball in high school and had played on something rep volleyball teams. Nothing too crazy but I still thought it was pretty cool.\n\nThe other day we were discussing sports, and she was telling me how she had wished she played more volleyball and pursued it further. I told her that it was a great feeling to be really good at something and really enjoy it. I told her that it was a lot of work but it felt great to be a top level athlete at a sport. Queue the following conversation:\n\nHer: Yeah, well it's a little different isn't it?\n\nMe: What do you mean?\n\nHer: I mean you were good, but trampolining isn't a real sport.\n\nMe: How do you figure that? I was literally training as much as I went to school and Canada has arguably the most competitive trampolining scene in the world.\n\nHer: Well there's pretty much no one that does that sport. It's not hard to get to a high level, if you played a real sport like soccer you never would've been that good.\n\nI dumped her on the spot. That sport had such a huge impact on who I am today. I dedicated thousands of hours and even ended up getting paid some money to continue training. I was probably within the top 500 athletes worldwide. It felt like she was attacking who I am.\n\nHer friends all said that I'm an asshole for breaking up over something so small. This truly hurt, and it's a sentiment I received from people my whole life. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is about a guy who dedicated 12 years to trampolining, which isn't a very popular sport. He was a high-level athlete, even getting funding. Then he dumps his girlfriend because she said trampolining isn't a real sport and implied it's easier than real sports like soccer.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The guy has put a lot of time and effort into his sport, which is a significant part of his identity. When someone dismisses that, especially in a way that minimizes his achievements, it can feel like a personal attack. The girlfriend, on the other hand, might not have realized the depth of his feelings about it. She had her own experience with volleyball, which she found cool, but her comments came off as disrespectful.\n\nBut is the guy right to break up over this? Relationships require communication and understanding. One instance of a negative comment, even if hurtful, might not justify ending the relationship. However, if this was a recurring issue or if she had a history of belittling his passions, maybe it's a bigger problem. The key here is that the breakup happened immediately after the comment, which suggests it was a deal-breaker for him. \n\nOn the other hand, the girlfriend's friends think he's an asshole for breaking up over something small. They might see it as overreacting. But for the guy, this wasn't just about the sport; it was about his identity and the respect for his hard work. So, there's a balance between respecting someone's feelings and not overreacting to a single comment.\n\nI should also consider if there's a history of similar issues. The post mentions that people have told him this before, implying he's been sensitive to such remarks. That could mean he's been holding onto this for a while, and this incident was the final straw. In that case, maybe the breakup is justified because the disrespect was a pattern, not just a one-time thing.\n\nIn terms of right and wrong, it's tricky. The girlfriend's comment was disrespectful and dismissive, which is wrong. But the guy's immediate decision to break up might be seen as an overreaction. However, if this comment triggered deeper insecurities or past validations he's needed, it's a valid response. The question is whether the action was proportionate. \n\nLooking at similar situations, people often break up over issues that deeply affect their self-worth. Since trampolining is a niche sport, others might not understand its challenges, leading to such comments. The guy's reaction could be seen as defending his identity, which is important in a relationship. \n\nSo, putting it all together, the guy might not be in the wrong because the comment disrespected his dedication and achievements. However, the abruptness of the breakup could be seen as harsh. But given the significance of the issue to him, maybe it's justified. The answer likely depends on the depth of the disrespect and how it's perceived. In this case, I think the author isn't in the wrong because the comment was a direct attack on his identity and work, which is a valid reason for breaking up.\n"
