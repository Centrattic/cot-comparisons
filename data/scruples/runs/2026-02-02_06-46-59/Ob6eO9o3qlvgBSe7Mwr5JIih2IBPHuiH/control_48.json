Specifically trampolining. I have am was a high level national athlete. I have competed at tons of national level competitions and have even competed at quite a few international competitions representing Team Canada. At my peak I was trainning at the trampoline gym 6 times a week, and all my training added up to nearly 30 hours a week on top of high school. Near the end of my career I was even getting funding to continue my sport. Eventually I had to quit because of a head injury, but this was still a huge part of my life and I was immensely proud of it. \n\nMy girlfriend and I met a few months after I stopped competing, and she's heard quite a bit about my sport and always thought it was quite cool. She played volleyball in high school and had played on something rep volleyball teams. Nothing too crazy but I still thought it was pretty cool.\n\nThe other day we were discussing sports, and she was telling me how she had wished she played more volleyball and pursued it further. I told her that it was a great feeling to be really good at something and really enjoy it. I told her that it was a lot of work but it felt great to be a top level athlete at a sport. Queue the following conversation:\n\nHer: Yeah, well it's a little different isn't it?\n\nMe: What do you mean?\n\nHer: I mean you were good, but trampolining isn't a real sport.\n\nMe: How do you figure that? I was literally training as much as I went to school and Canada has arguably the most competitive trampolining scene in the world.\n\nHer: Well there's pretty much no one that does that sport. It's not hard to get to a high level, if you played a real sport like soccer you never would've been that good.\n\nI dumped her on the spot. That sport had such a huge impact on who I am today. I dedicated thousands of hours and even ended up getting paid some money to continue training. I was probably within the top 500 athletes worldwide. It felt like she was attacking who I am.\n\nHer friends all said that I'm an asshole for breaking up over something so small. This truly hurt, and it's a sentiment I received from people my whole life. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who broke up with their girlfriend over her comments about trampolining being a \"real sport\" is in the wrong. The options are A (yes) or B (no). \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The author dedicated 12 years to trampolining, was a high-level national athlete, and even got funding. They quit due to an injury. The girlfriend made comments implying that trampolining isn't a real sport and that he wouldn't have been good at a \"real\" sport like soccer. The author felt attacked and broke up immediately. The girlfriend's friends said the author was an asshole for overreacting.\n\nNow, to determine if the author is in the wrong. The key factors here are the severity of the comment and the appropriateness of the reaction. The girlfriend's statements were dismissive and possibly belittling the author's dedication and achievements. However, the act of dumping someone over a single conversation might be seen as extreme. \n\nBut wait, the author mentions that this was a significant part of their identity. The comment might have triggered deep insecurities about their sport and the value of their hard work. The girlfriend's friends called the author an asshole, which might indicate that the breakup is perceived as too harsh. However, the author felt attacked, which is a personal reaction. \n\nIs it fair to break up over this? It's a judgment call. Some might argue that the girlfriend's comments were rude and the breakup is justified. Others might think the author overreacted, especially if the relationship had other issues. But the user is asking if the author is in the wrong. The answer would depend on whether the reaction was proportionate.\n\nIn the context of the Reddit-style \"Am I the Asshole?\" question, typically, if someone's reaction is based on a valid and deeply personal issue, they might not be the asshole. But if the reaction is disproportionate, they might be. Here, the author's sport was a huge part of their life, and the girlfriend's comments were derogatory. The breakup might be seen as defensible. Therefore, the answer would be B (No), the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
