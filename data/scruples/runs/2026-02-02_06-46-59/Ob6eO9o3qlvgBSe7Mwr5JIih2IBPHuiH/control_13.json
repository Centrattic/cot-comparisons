Specifically trampolining. I have am was a high level national athlete. I have competed at tons of national level competitions and have even competed at quite a few international competitions representing Team Canada. At my peak I was trainning at the trampoline gym 6 times a week, and all my training added up to nearly 30 hours a week on top of high school. Near the end of my career I was even getting funding to continue my sport. Eventually I had to quit because of a head injury, but this was still a huge part of my life and I was immensely proud of it. \n\nMy girlfriend and I met a few months after I stopped competing, and she's heard quite a bit about my sport and always thought it was quite cool. She played volleyball in high school and had played on something rep volleyball teams. Nothing too crazy but I still thought it was pretty cool.\n\nThe other day we were discussing sports, and she was telling me how she had wished she played more volleyball and pursued it further. I told her that it was a great feeling to be really good at something and really enjoy it. I told her that it was a lot of work but it felt great to be a top level athlete at a sport. Queue the following conversation:\n\nHer: Yeah, well it's a little different isn't it?\n\nMe: What do you mean?\n\nHer: I mean you were good, but trampolining isn't a real sport.\n\nMe: How do you figure that? I was literally training as much as I went to school and Canada has arguably the most competitive trampolining scene in the world.\n\nHer: Well there's pretty much no one that does that sport. It's not hard to get to a high level, if you played a real sport like soccer you never would've been that good.\n\nI dumped her on the spot. That sport had such a huge impact on who I am today. I dedicated thousands of hours and even ended up getting paid some money to continue training. I was probably within the top 500 athletes worldwide. It felt like she was attacking who I am.\n\nHer friends all said that I'm an asshole for breaking up over something so small. This truly hurt, and it's a sentiment I received from people my whole life. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the story (the author) is in the wrong for breaking up with their girlfriend after she made fun of his sport, trampolining.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The author dedicated over a decade to high-level trampolining, even getting national and international recognition. He quit due to an injury but is clearly proud of his achievements. The girlfriend, who met him after he stopped competing, initially showed interest in his sport. However, during a conversation about sports, she dismissed trampolining as not a \"real sport,\" implying it's less legitimate than others like soccer, and that it's not as hard to excel in. The author took this as an attack on his identity and effort, leading to a breakup. The girlfriend's friends and others are saying he's an asshole for breaking up over this, but he's hurt and feels disrespected.\n\nNow, considering the factors here. The key points are: the author's deep personal investment in his sport, the girlfriend's comments that invalidated his achievements, and the immediate breakup. The question is whether his reaction is justified.\n\nOn one hand, the girlfriend's comments could be seen as dismissive and lacking understanding of the dedication required. The author might feel that his identity and years of work were being trivialized. On the other hand, some might argue that a breakup over a single conversation is too extreme, especially if the relationship had other strengths. However, the context is important: the sport was a huge part of the author's life and identity, and the comment might have hit a nerve beyond just a joke. If the girlfriend didn't respect a core part of his self, it could be a deal-breaker. \n\nAlso, the girlfriend's comparison to other sports like soccer might stem from a lack of awareness about the difficulty of trampolining. It's possible she didn't realize the level of commitment involved, but the way she phrased it was disrespectful. The author's reaction, while immediate, could be seen as a justified stand on respecting his identity. However, others might say he should have addressed the issue calmly instead of breaking up immediately. \n\nConsidering all that, the decision hinges on whether the comment was a deal-breaker. If respect for one's achievements is a fundamental value in a relationship, then the author isn't in the wrong. But if the breakup was too hasty without addressing the issue, maybe AITA. But given the context of the author's feelings being attacked, it's more about mutual respect. So, the answer might be B (author not in the wrong).\n"
