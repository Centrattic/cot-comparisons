Specifically trampolining. I have am was a high level national athlete. I have competed at tons of national level competitions and have even competed at quite a few international competitions representing Team Canada. At my peak I was trainning at the trampoline gym 6 times a week, and all my training added up to nearly 30 hours a week on top of high school. Near the end of my career I was even getting funding to continue my sport. Eventually I had to quit because of a head injury, but this was still a huge part of my life and I was immensely proud of it. \n\nMy girlfriend and I met a few months after I stopped competing, and she's heard quite a bit about my sport and always thought it was quite cool. She played volleyball in high school and had played on something rep volleyball teams. Nothing too crazy but I still thought it was pretty cool.\n\nThe other day we were discussing sports, and she was telling me how she had wished she played more volleyball and pursued it further. I told her that it was a great feeling to be really good at something and really enjoy it. I told her that it was a lot of work but it felt great to be a top level athlete at a sport. Queue the following conversation:\n\nHer: Yeah, well it's a little different isn't it?\n\nMe: What do you mean?\n\nHer: I mean you were good, but trampolining isn't a real sport.\n\nMe: How do you figure that? I was literally training as much as I went to school and Canada has arguably the most competitive trampolining scene in the world.\n\nHer: Well there's pretty much no one that does that sport. It's not hard to get to a high level, if you played a real sport like soccer you never would've been that good.\n\nI dumped her on the spot. That sport had such a huge impact on who I am today. I dedicated thousands of hours and even ended up getting paid some money to continue training. I was probably within the top 500 athletes worldwide. It felt like she was attacking who I am.\n\nHer friends all said that I'm an asshole for breaking up over something so small. This truly hurt, and it's a sentiment I received from people my whole life. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for dumping his girlfriend because she made fun of his sport, trampolining. \n\nFirst, I need to look at the situation. The guy spent 12 years training, was a national athlete, even got funding, and then quit because of an injury. That's a huge commitment. His girlfriend, who played volleyball in high school, makes a comment that trampolining isn't a real sport because it's not as popular and implies that if he had played a sport like soccer, he wouldn't have been as good. The guy dumps her immediately because it felt like an attack on who he is. His friends think he's an asshole for breaking up over something small.\n\nSo, the question is whether breaking up over that comment was wrong. On one hand, she made a derogatory comment about his dedication and the legitimacy of his sport, which clearly hurt him. On the other hand, maybe the reaction was too harsh. But considering the emotional weight the sport had in his life, dismissing it as a small issue might not be fair. \n\nTrampolining is an Olympic sport, so it is recognized as a legitimate sport, even if less popular. Her comment minimized his achievements. The guy's reaction was immediate, which is a bit extreme, but if the sport is a core part of his identity, a relationship built on respect should acknowledge that. \n\nHer friends think it's too much, but maybe they aren't considering the emotional impact. The guy felt attacked, which is a valid response if the relationship was built on mutual respect. However, breaking up on the spot might be impulsive. But in the context of deep personal value, maybe it's justified. \n\nI'm leaning towards thinking the author is not in the wrong because the comment was disrespectful towards his hard work and identity. However, maybe the immediate breakup without discussion was hasty. But the question is about being in the wrong, not about the method. If his reaction was a direct consequence of her disrespect, then he's justified. So answer B (No).\n"
