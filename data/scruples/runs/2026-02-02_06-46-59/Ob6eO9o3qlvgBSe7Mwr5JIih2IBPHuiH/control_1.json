Specifically trampolining. I have am was a high level national athlete. I have competed at tons of national level competitions and have even competed at quite a few international competitions representing Team Canada. At my peak I was trainning at the trampoline gym 6 times a week, and all my training added up to nearly 30 hours a week on top of high school. Near the end of my career I was even getting funding to continue my sport. Eventually I had to quit because of a head injury, but this was still a huge part of my life and I was immensely proud of it. \n\nMy girlfriend and I met a few months after I stopped competing, and she's heard quite a bit about my sport and always thought it was quite cool. She played volleyball in high school and had played on something rep volleyball teams. Nothing too crazy but I still thought it was pretty cool.\n\nThe other day we were discussing sports, and she was telling me how she had wished she played more volleyball and pursued it further. I told her that it was a great feeling to be really good at something and really enjoy it. I told her that it was a lot of work but it felt great to be a top level athlete at a sport. Queue the following conversation:\n\nHer: Yeah, well it's a little different isn't it?\n\nMe: What do you mean?\n\nHer: I mean you were good, but trampolining isn't a real sport.\n\nMe: How do you figure that? I was literally training as much as I went to school and Canada has arguably the most competitive trampolining scene in the world.\n\nHer: Well there's pretty much no one that does that sport. It's not hard to get to a high level, if you played a real sport like soccer you never would've been that good.\n\nI dumped her on the spot. That sport had such a huge impact on who I am today. I dedicated thousands of hours and even ended up getting paid some money to continue training. I was probably within the top 500 athletes worldwide. It felt like she was attacking who I am.\n\nHer friends all said that I'm an asshole for breaking up over something so small. This truly hurt, and it's a sentiment I received from people my whole life. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong for dumping his girlfriend because she made fun of his sport, trampolining. Let me start by reading through the scenario again carefully.\n\nThe author was a high-level national trampoline athlete, trained 30 hours a week, competed internationally for Canada, got funding, and was in the top 500 worldwide. He quit due to a head injury. They met after he stopped competing. She played volleyball in high school. When discussing sports, she said trampolining isn't a real sport, implying that it's less valid than something like soccer. He took offense and broke up with her immediately. Her friends say he's an asshole for overreacting, but he feels it's a big deal because the sport shaped his identity.\n\nFirst, I need to assess whether the author's reaction was justified. The key issue here is whether disliking or not considering a sport \"real\" is a sufficient reason to end a relationship. Trampolining is a recognized sport, part of the Olympics, so it is a real sport. However, the girlfriend's comment was not about the sport itself but about its status relative to other sports. She might have been implying that it's less challenging or less mainstream than soccer. That could come off as dismissive, especially if the person has invested a lot into it.\n\nThe author's dedication is clear, so for him, this was a significant part of his identity. If someone devalues a part of your identity, that can be deeply hurtful. But the question is whether that devaluation is a valid reason to end a relationship. Relationships require mutual respect and understanding. If she was belittling his achievements, that's a problem. But maybe she didn't mean it as an attack? The way she phrased it: \"Well there's pretty much no one that does that sport. It's not hard to get to a high level, if you played a real sport like soccer you never would've been that good.\" That sounds pretty dismissive. She's not just saying it's not her favorite, but questioning the difficulty and validity of the sport, which could be seen as undermining his hard work and identity.\n\nOn the other hand, the girlfriend might have a different perspective. She played volleyball, which is a team sport with different dynamics, but she might not see trampolining as equally \"real\" because it's individual or less popular. Some people might not understand the intensity of individual sports. However, the author's point is that he put in thousands of hours and competed at the national/international level, which should be respected.\n\nThe friends' reactions are mixed. They say he's an asshole for overreacting, but the author feels it's a valid reason because of how much it meant to him. The question is about whether the author is in the wrong. In terms of right and wrong, it's often about mutual respect and how each person perceives the issue. If she was mocking a core part of his identity, then the author's reaction might be justified. But if she was just making a casual comment, maybe it's not worth breaking up over. However, the way she phrased it suggests she was being critical, not just a light-hearted joke. \n\nAlso, the fact that she's comparing it to other sports and implying his achievements aren't as valid could be a deal-breaker for some. The author might have felt that she was being disrespectful towards his life's work. So, the answer hinges on whether her comment was a legitimate critique of the sport's status versus a personal attack on his dedication. Since the comment was about the sport's legitimacy, which does touch on his personal history and identity, the author's response could be seen as appropriate if he felt disrespected. Alternatively, if the breakup was impulsive and based on a single comment, maybe he overreacted. But given the context of her friends' dismissive attitude and the fact that he had a significant history with the sport, it's plausible that he had a right to feel hurt and decide to end the relationship over this.\n"
