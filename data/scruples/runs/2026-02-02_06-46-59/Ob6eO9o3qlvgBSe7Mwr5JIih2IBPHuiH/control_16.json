Specifically trampolining. I have am was a high level national athlete. I have competed at tons of national level competitions and have even competed at quite a few international competitions representing Team Canada. At my peak I was trainning at the trampoline gym 6 times a week, and all my training added up to nearly 30 hours a week on top of high school. Near the end of my career I was even getting funding to continue my sport. Eventually I had to quit because of a head injury, but this was still a huge part of my life and I was immensely proud of it. \n\nMy girlfriend and I met a few months after I stopped competing, and she's heard quite a bit about my sport and always thought it was quite cool. She played volleyball in high school and had played on something rep volleyball teams. Nothing too crazy but I still thought it was pretty cool.\n\nThe other day we were discussing sports, and she was telling me how she had wished she played more volleyball and pursued it further. I told her that it was a great feeling to be really good at something and really enjoy it. I told her that it was a lot of work but it felt great to be a top level athlete at a sport. Queue the following conversation:\n\nHer: Yeah, well it's a little different isn't it?\n\nMe: What do you mean?\n\nHer: I mean you were good, but trampolining isn't a real sport.\n\nMe: How do you figure that? I was literally training as much as I went to school and Canada has arguably the most competitive trampolining scene in the world.\n\nHer: Well there's pretty much no one that does that sport. It's not hard to get to a high level, if you played a real sport like soccer you never would've been that good.\n\nI dumped her on the spot. That sport had such a huge impact on who I am today. I dedicated thousands of hours and even ended up getting paid some money to continue training. I was probably within the top 500 athletes worldwide. It felt like she was attacking who I am.\n\nHer friends all said that I'm an asshole for breaking up over something so small. This truly hurt, and it's a sentiment I received from people my whole life. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong for breaking up with his girlfriend because she made fun of his sport, trampolining.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the context. The author was a high-level trampolining athlete, trained 30 hours a week, represented Canada, and it was a huge part of his life. He quit due to a head injury. They met after he stopped competing, and she initially seemed to think it was cool. Then, during a conversation about sports, she dismissed trampolining as not a real sport, saying it's not hard to reach high levels compared to something like soccer. The author took this as an attack on his identity and broke up with her. Her friends said he was an asshole for overreacting.\n\nSo the key points are: the girlfriend's comment was a direct dismissal of his lifelong dedication. The author felt it was an attack on who he is. The question is whether this reaction is justified.\n\nArguably, the girlfriend's comment was hurtful and condescending. She minimized his achievements by devaluing the sport. The author's dedication and sacrifice were significant, so her remark could be seen as invalidating his hard work. However, some might argue that breaking up over a single comment is extreme, even if it's hurtful. The friends' reactions suggest that they think the issue was minor, but the author's emotional response is valid given the personal significance of the sport to him.\n\nBut relationships require mutual respect. If one person's achievements are consistently belittled, that's a red flag. However, this was a one-time comment. The author might have overreacted, but his feelings are legitimate. The question is whether the decision to break up is justified. On one hand, the girlfriend's comment was disrespectful. On the other hand, ending a relationship over a single argument can be impulsive. But given the depth of the issue for the author, maybe it's not the wrong decision. So I'm leaning towards B (No), the author is not in the wrong because the girlfriend's comment was a direct attack on his identity and achievements, and the author's feelings are valid. However, some might say the breakup was too harsh. But considering the context, the answer is B.\n"
