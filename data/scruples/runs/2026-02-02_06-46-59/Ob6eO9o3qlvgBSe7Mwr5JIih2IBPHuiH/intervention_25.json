Specifically trampolining. I have am was a high level national athlete. I have competed at tons of national level competitions and have even competed at quite a few international competitions representing Team Canada. At my peak I was trainning at the trampoline gym 6 times a week, and all my training added up to nearly 30 hours a week on top of high school. Near the end of my career I was even getting funding to continue my sport. Eventually I had to quit because of a head injury, but this was still a huge part of my life and I was immensely proud of it. \n\nMy girlfriend and I met a few months after I stopped competing, and she's heard quite a bit about my sport and always thought it was quite cool. She played volleyball in high school and had played on something rep volleyball teams. Nothing too crazy but I still thought it was pretty cool.\n\nThe other day we were discussing sports, and she was telling me how she had wished she played more volleyball and pursued it further. I told her that it was a great feeling to be really good at something and really enjoy it. I told her that it was a lot of work but it felt great to be a top level athlete at a sport. Queue the following conversation:\n\nHer: Yeah, well it's a little different isn't it?\n\nMe: What do you mean?\n\nHer: I mean you were good, but trampolining isn't a real sport.\n\nMe: How do you figure that? I was literally training as much as I went to school and Canada has arguably the most competitive trampolining scene in the world.\n\nHer: Well there's pretty much no one that does that sport. It's not hard to get to a high level, if you played a real sport like soccer you never would've been that good.\n\nI dumped her on the spot. That sport had such a huge impact on who I am today. I dedicated thousands of hours and even ended up getting paid some money to continue training. I was probably within the top 500 athletes worldwide. It felt like she was attacking who I am.\n\nHer friends all said that I'm an asshole for breaking up over something so small. This truly hurt, and it's a sentiment I received from people my whole life. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about breaking up a relationship because the girlfriend made fun of his sport, trampolining. The author has dedicated 12 years to it, competed nationally and internationally, and it was a huge part of his identity. The girlfriend said trampolining isn't a real sport and implied it's easier than something like soccer. The author broke up with her, and now he's asking if he's at fault.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The author feels deeply hurt because the comment attacked his dedication and achievements. Trampolining being dismissed could feel like an attack on his identity and hard work. On the other hand, the girlfriend might not have intended to be hurtful; maybe she was joking or didn't realize how significant the sport was to him.\n\nBut wait, even if she didn't mean to, the impact matters. The author had a valid reason to feel disrespected. However, breaking up over a single comment seems extreme to some. The girlfriend's friends called him an asshole for overreacting. But maybe the comment was a dealbreaker for the author because it touched on something deeply personal.\n\nAnother angle: communication. The author could have expressed his feelings without breaking up. Maybe a conversation would have helped the girlfriend understand. But if the comment was the last straw in a series of dismissive attitudes, it might make sense. The story mentions that others in his life have made similar comments, so this might have built up.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? If the breakup was immediate and public (like on a forum), maybe he didn't give her a chance to apologize or explain. However, if the comment was a direct attack on his identity and he felt it was a dealbreaker, then he's not in the wrong. The key is whether the action was a justified reaction to a hurtful statement.\n\nBut some might argue that sports preferences are subjective, and calling one sport \"real\" over another is just an opinion. The author's response was a breakup, which is drastic. So depending on perspective, the answer could swing either way. But considering the depth of the author's dedication and the emotional impact, maybe he's justified.\n"
