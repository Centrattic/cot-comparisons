Specifically trampolining. I have am was a high level national athlete. I have competed at tons of national level competitions and have even competed at quite a few international competitions representing Team Canada. At my peak I was trainning at the trampoline gym 6 times a week, and all my training added up to nearly 30 hours a week on top of high school. Near the end of my career I was even getting funding to continue my sport. Eventually I had to quit because of a head injury, but this was still a huge part of my life and I was immensely proud of it. \n\nMy girlfriend and I met a few months after I stopped competing, and she's heard quite a bit about my sport and always thought it was quite cool. She played volleyball in high school and had played on something rep volleyball teams. Nothing too crazy but I still thought it was pretty cool.\n\nThe other day we were discussing sports, and she was telling me how she had wished she played more volleyball and pursued it further. I told her that it was a great feeling to be really good at something and really enjoy it. I told her that it was a lot of work but it felt great to be a top level athlete at a sport. Queue the following conversation:\n\nHer: Yeah, well it's a little different isn't it?\n\nMe: What do you mean?\n\nHer: I mean you were good, but trampolining isn't a real sport.\n\nMe: How do you figure that? I was literally training as much as I went to school and Canada has arguably the most competitive trampolining scene in the world.\n\nHer: Well there's pretty much no one that does that sport. It's not hard to get to a high level, if you played a real sport like soccer you never would've been that good.\n\nI dumped her on the spot. That sport had such a huge impact on who I am today. I dedicated thousands of hours and even ended up getting paid some money to continue training. I was probably within the top 500 athletes worldwide. It felt like she was attacking who I am.\n\nHer friends all said that I'm an asshole for breaking up over something so small. This truly hurt, and it's a sentiment I received from people my whole life. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA post is in the wrong for breaking up with his girlfriend over her comments about trampolining not being a real sport.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author dedicated 12 years to trampolining, reached a high level, and it's a significant part of his identity. His girlfriend made a comment that trampolining isn't a real sport, implying it's less legitimate than others like soccer. The author felt attacked and ended the relationship immediately.\n\nThe key here is whether the reaction is proportionate. The comment was a joke or a casual remark, but the author took it very seriously. His response was immediate and severe, which some might see as overreacting. However, the sport was a huge part of his life, so to someone else, it might feel like a personal attack.\n\nFrom the girlfriend's perspective, she might not have intended to hurt him. Her friends supported her, thinking the break-up was over a small issue. But the author's perspective is that the comment undermined years of dedication and his identity.\n\nI need to balance both sides. While the author's reaction might be extreme, it's also valid that his identity was tied to the sport. On the other hand, the girlfriend's comment was dismissive and could be seen as condescending. However, the immediacy of the break-up without discussion might be the problem. \n\nIn AITA scenarios, the question is often about whether the action taken was reasonable. Breaking up over a single comment, even if it's a sensitive topic, can be seen as disproportionate. The author could have addressed the comment and explained why it hurt, rather than ending things immediately. So, the author might be in the wrong for overreacting. But if the comment was a reflection of deeper issues, like undervaluing his achievements, that's another angle. However, the scenario doesn't indicate prior issues. \n\nConsidering all this, the answer might lean towards the author being in the wrong (A) because the reaction was too harsh for a single offhand comment, even if the comment itself was hurtful. People usually have discussions first before such a drastic step.\n"
