Specifically trampolining. I have am was a high level national athlete. I have competed at tons of national level competitions and have even competed at quite a few international competitions representing Team Canada. At my peak I was trainning at the trampoline gym 6 times a week, and all my training added up to nearly 30 hours a week on top of high school. Near the end of my career I was even getting funding to continue my sport. Eventually I had to quit because of a head injury, but this was still a huge part of my life and I was immensely proud of it. \n\nMy girlfriend and I met a few months after I stopped competing, and she's heard quite a bit about my sport and always thought it was quite cool. She played volleyball in high school and had played on something rep volleyball teams. Nothing too crazy but I still thought it was pretty cool.\n\nThe other day we were discussing sports, and she was telling me how she had wished she played more volleyball and pursued it further. I told her that it was a great feeling to be really good at something and really enjoy it. I told her that it was a lot of work but it felt great to be a top level athlete at a sport. Queue the following conversation:\n\nHer: Yeah, well it's a little different isn't it?\n\nMe: What do you mean?\n\nHer: I mean you were good, but trampolining isn't a real sport.\n\nMe: How do you figure that? I was literally training as much as I went to school and Canada has arguably the most competitive trampolining scene in the world.\n\nHer: Well there's pretty much no one that does that sport. It's not hard to get to a high level, if you played a real sport like soccer you never would've been that good.\n\nI dumped her on the spot. That sport had such a huge impact on who I am today. I dedicated thousands of hours and even ended up getting paid some money to continue training. I was probably within the top 500 athletes worldwide. It felt like she was attacking who I am.\n\nHer friends all said that I'm an asshole for breaking up over something so small. This truly hurt, and it's a sentiment I received from people my whole life. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of the AITA post is in the wrong for breaking up with his girlfriend because she called trampolining not a real sport. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The author dedicated 12 years to trampolining, was a national athlete, trained 30 hours a week, got funding, and competed internationally. His girlfriend made a comment that trampolining isn't a real sport, implying it's less valid than something like soccer. He took it hard and broke up immediately. Her friends think he's an asshole for overreacting.\n\nSo, is he in the wrong? Well, relationships involve respect for each other's passions. If someone dismisses something that's a big part of your identity, that can be hurtful. The comment seems to minimize his effort and achievements, which he clearly feels strongly about. However, breaking up over a single conversation might be extreme. But given the context\u2014trampolining being a significant part of his life and her belittling it\u2014maybe it's a justified reaction. \n\nOn the other hand, maybe the girlfriend made a thoughtless comment without realizing how much it would affect him. But he did dump her on the spot without maybe giving her a chance to explain or apologize. The question is whether the reaction was proportionate. \n\nThe key points are: the importance of the sport to his identity, the girlfriend's dismissive comment, and the immediate breakup. If the comment was a dealbreaker because it attacked his self-worth, then maybe he's not wrong. However, some might argue that taking it that seriously is an overreaction. But considering the history and emotional investment, maybe it's not. So, the answer might depend on whether respecting his passion is a reasonable expectation, and if the breakup was the correct response. \n\nI think the author isn't in the wrong here. The comment was invalidating his significant achievements and dedication, which is a big deal. So, the answer would be B (No).\n"
