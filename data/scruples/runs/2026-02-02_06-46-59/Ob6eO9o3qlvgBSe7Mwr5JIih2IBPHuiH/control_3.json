Specifically trampolining. I have am was a high level national athlete. I have competed at tons of national level competitions and have even competed at quite a few international competitions representing Team Canada. At my peak I was trainning at the trampoline gym 6 times a week, and all my training added up to nearly 30 hours a week on top of high school. Near the end of my career I was even getting funding to continue my sport. Eventually I had to quit because of a head injury, but this was still a huge part of my life and I was immensely proud of it. \n\nMy girlfriend and I met a few months after I stopped competing, and she's heard quite a bit about my sport and always thought it was quite cool. She played volleyball in high school and had played on something rep volleyball teams. Nothing too crazy but I still thought it was pretty cool.\n\nThe other day we were discussing sports, and she was telling me how she had wished she played more volleyball and pursued it further. I told her that it was a great feeling to be really good at something and really enjoy it. I told her that it was a lot of work but it felt great to be a top level athlete at a sport. Queue the following conversation:\n\nHer: Yeah, well it's a little different isn't it?\n\nMe: What do you mean?\n\nHer: I mean you were good, but trampolining isn't a real sport.\n\nMe: How do you figure that? I was literally training as much as I went to school and Canada has arguably the most competitive trampolining scene in the world.\n\nHer: Well there's pretty much no one that does that sport. It's not hard to get to a high level, if you played a real sport like soccer you never would've been that good.\n\nI dumped her on the spot. That sport had such a huge impact on who I am today. I dedicated thousands of hours and even ended up getting paid some money to continue training. I was probably within the top 500 athletes worldwide. It felt like she was attacking who I am.\n\nHer friends all said that I'm an asshole for breaking up over something so small. This truly hurt, and it's a sentiment I received from people my whole life. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong for breaking up with their girlfriend because she called trampolining not a real sport. Hmm.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The person dedicated 12 years to trampolining, which is part of gymnastics. They were a national-level athlete, trained a lot, and even got funding. Then they met their girlfriend after they quit, and she made a comment downplaying their sport. The user broke up immediately because they felt it was an attack on who they are.\n\nThe girlfriend's friends say the user is an asshole for overreacting. The question is if the user is in the wrong. So, the key points here are the validity of the reaction to the comment and whether the breakup was justified.\n\nTrampolining is recognized as a sport by international governing bodies like the International Gymnastics Federation. It's included in the Olympics, so it's definitely a legitimate sport. The girlfriend's assertion that it's not a real sport is incorrect. That's a factual point. But does that make the user right to break up?\n\nEmotionally, the user felt attacked and devalued because the sport was a huge part of their identity. The comment might have triggered a deep sense of invalidation. On the other hand, the girlfriend might not have realized the depth of the user's feelings. However, the user's reaction was immediate and severe\u2014a breakup over one comment. That could be seen as disproportionate.\n\nBut considering the emotional investment and the personal significance of the sport, maybe the user is justified. The girlfriend's statement dismissed their hard work and achievements, which is a big deal. However, breaking up over a single argument, even if it's a deeply emotional issue, can be seen as hasty. The user didn't give her a chance to retract or apologize.\n\nSo, the answer hinges on whether the reaction was too harsh. The user's feelings are valid, but acting on them without considering the relationship's context could be seen as wrong. The girlfriend's friends think the user is in the wrong, but the user's perspective is also understandable. It's a tough call. Maybe the user is not in the wrong because the sport's legitimacy is a fact, and the comment was a direct attack on their identity. But the immediate breakup might be seen as overreaction.\n"
