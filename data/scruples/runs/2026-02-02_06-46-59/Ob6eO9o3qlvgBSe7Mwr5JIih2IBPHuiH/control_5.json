Specifically trampolining. I have am was a high level national athlete. I have competed at tons of national level competitions and have even competed at quite a few international competitions representing Team Canada. At my peak I was trainning at the trampoline gym 6 times a week, and all my training added up to nearly 30 hours a week on top of high school. Near the end of my career I was even getting funding to continue my sport. Eventually I had to quit because of a head injury, but this was still a huge part of my life and I was immensely proud of it. \n\nMy girlfriend and I met a few months after I stopped competing, and she's heard quite a bit about my sport and always thought it was quite cool. She played volleyball in high school and had played on something rep volleyball teams. Nothing too crazy but I still thought it was pretty cool.\n\nThe other day we were discussing sports, and she was telling me how she had wished she played more volleyball and pursued it further. I told her that it was a great feeling to be really good at something and really enjoy it. I told her that it was a lot of work but it felt great to be a top level athlete at a sport. Queue the following conversation:\n\nHer: Yeah, well it's a little different isn't it?\n\nMe: What do you mean?\n\nHer: I mean you were good, but trampolining isn't a real sport.\n\nMe: How do you figure that? I was literally training as much as I went to school and Canada has arguably the most competitive trampolining scene in the world.\n\nHer: Well there's pretty much no one that does that sport. It's not hard to get to a high level, if you played a real sport like soccer you never would've been that good.\n\nI dumped her on the spot. That sport had such a huge impact on who I am today. I dedicated thousands of hours and even ended up getting paid some money to continue training. I was probably within the top 500 athletes worldwide. It felt like she was attacking who I am.\n\nHer friends all said that I'm an asshole for breaking up over something so small. This truly hurt, and it's a sentiment I received from people my whole life. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for dumping his girlfriend because she made fun of his sport, trampolining.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the context. The author trained for 12 years, competed nationally and internationally, got funding, and had a serious injury. Trampolining was a huge part of his life. His ex made a comment that trampolining isn't a real sport, suggesting it's less valid than something like soccer. He took it really personally and broke up with her immediately.\n\nNow, the question is whether he was in the wrong. To evaluate this, I should consider several factors: the severity of the comment, the context of their relationship, and whether the reaction was proportionate.\n\nTrampolining is an Olympic sport, so technically it is considered a real sport. The ex's comment might come from a place of ignorance or a joke, but the author's reaction seems to be about a personal attack on his identity and achievements. He had dedicated so much time and effort, so the comment might have felt like a dismissal of his hard work.\n\nOn the other hand, breaking up over a single comment that could have been a joke or misunderstanding might be seen as overreacting. The girlfriend's friends called him an asshole, implying the reaction was too harsh. But the author might feel that this comment was a deal-breaker because it invalidated something so central to his identity.\n\nI need to weigh the importance of mutual respect in a relationship. If the comment was made without malice, the author's immediate breakup might be seen as disproportionate. However, if the comment was part of a pattern of disrespect, it's a different scenario. The story doesn't mention prior issues, so it's likely a one-time incident.\n\nAlso, considering that the girlfriend played volleyball, maybe there's a comparison she was trying to make about her own experience versus his. But her phrasing was dismissive of his sport, which the author found offensive.\n\nIn relationships, how people handle each other's passions is important. Dismissing someone's achievements can be hurtful. But reacting with a breakup might be too extreme unless there's a history of such comments.\n\nSo, the author's actions could be seen as justified if he felt disrespected in a core area of his identity. However, others might say that breaking up over this is too much, especially if the comment was a flippant remark not meant to hurt. The key is the intent behind the comment and the context. Since the story doesn't give more context, it's hard to know if it was a one-off joke or a deeper issue.\n\nIn many cases, open communication could resolve such issues instead of an immediate breakup. However, if the author felt that his identity was under attack and that this was a fundamental incompatibility, he might not be in the wrong. The answer might depend on cultural or personal values regarding respect for others' passions.\n"
