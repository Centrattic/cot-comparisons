Specifically trampolining. I have am was a high level national athlete. I have competed at tons of national level competitions and have even competed at quite a few international competitions representing Team Canada. At my peak I was trainning at the trampoline gym 6 times a week, and all my training added up to nearly 30 hours a week on top of high school. Near the end of my career I was even getting funding to continue my sport. Eventually I had to quit because of a head injury, but this was still a huge part of my life and I was immensely proud of it. \n\nMy girlfriend and I met a few months after I stopped competing, and she's heard quite a bit about my sport and always thought it was quite cool. She played volleyball in high school and had played on something rep volleyball teams. Nothing too crazy but I still thought it was pretty cool.\n\nThe other day we were discussing sports, and she was telling me how she had wished she played more volleyball and pursued it further. I told her that it was a great feeling to be really good at something and really enjoy it. I told her that it was a lot of work but it felt great to be a top level athlete at a sport. Queue the following conversation:\n\nHer: Yeah, well it's a little different isn't it?\n\nMe: What do you mean?\n\nHer: I mean you were good, but trampolining isn't a real sport.\n\nMe: How do you figure that? I was literally training as much as I went to school and Canada has arguably the most competitive trampolining scene in the world.\n\nHer: Well there's pretty much no one that does that sport. It's not hard to get to a high level, if you played a real sport like soccer you never would've been that good.\n\nI dumped her on the spot. That sport had such a huge impact on who I am today. I dedicated thousands of hours and even ended up getting paid some money to continue training. I was probably within the top 500 athletes worldwide. It felt like she was attacking who I am.\n\nHer friends all said that I'm an asshole for breaking up over something so small. This truly hurt, and it's a sentiment I received from people my whole life. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong for breaking up with their girlfriend over her comments about his sport. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The author spent 12 years dedicated to trampolining, competed nationally and internationally, and it was a huge part of his identity. After he quit due to an injury, he met his girlfriend. They were discussing sports, and she made comments downplaying trampolining as not a \"real sport,\" implying it's less valid than others like soccer. He took it personally, dumping her right then.\n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong. The user thinks he might be, but wants my opinion. Let's break down the factors.\n\nOn one hand, his sport was a major part of his life, and her comments could have felt like a personal attack on his identity and achievements. People can be sensitive about areas they've invested so much in, especially when it's a core part of their self-worth. The girlfriend's friends say he's an asshole for breaking up over something small, but maybe they don't see how significant this was to him.\n\nOn the other hand, maybe the breakup was overreacting. Sports like trampolining might not be as mainstream as soccer, but that doesn't make them less valid. However, the girlfriend's comments were dismissive and possibly rooted in a misunderstanding or bias. If the author felt this was a deal-breaker, maybe it's about mutual respect and valuing each other's passions. If she couldn't take it seriously, maybe he felt it's a fundamental incompatibility.\n\nBut was it right to break up immediately? Breaking up over a single conversation where someone makes a dismissive comment can be seen as impulsive. Relationships require communication and addressing issues rather than reacting impulsively. However, the author might have felt that this comment was a culmination of long-standing feelings of being misunderstood about his sport. If he had built up resentment, maybe the breakup was a result of deeper issues rather than just one comment.\n\nAnother angle: the girlfriend's perspective. She might not have intended to attack his identity. Perhaps she made a joke or a casual remark without realizing the depth of his feelings. In that case, a breakup might be too harsh without giving her a chance to acknowledge her mistake.\n\nBut the author's reaction shows that this issue was a significant trigger for him. If someone's core identity is dismissed, it's understandable that they might feel hurt. However, relationships should ideally provide a space where both partners feel respected. If the girlfriend couldn't respect his passion, maybe the relationship was already strained in that area.\n\nSo, considering all angles, the author might not be in the wrong because the comment did touch on something deeply personal. However, the immediate breakup could be seen as an overreaction. The key is whether the issue was a deal-breaker for him. If respecting each other's passions is essential, then the author's action is justified. But if it's about handling conflict appropriately, maybe not. There's a balance between standing up for oneself and reacting impulsively.\n"
