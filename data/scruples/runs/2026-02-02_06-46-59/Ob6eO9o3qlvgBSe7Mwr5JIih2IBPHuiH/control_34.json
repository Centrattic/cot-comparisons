Specifically trampolining. I have am was a high level national athlete. I have competed at tons of national level competitions and have even competed at quite a few international competitions representing Team Canada. At my peak I was trainning at the trampoline gym 6 times a week, and all my training added up to nearly 30 hours a week on top of high school. Near the end of my career I was even getting funding to continue my sport. Eventually I had to quit because of a head injury, but this was still a huge part of my life and I was immensely proud of it. \n\nMy girlfriend and I met a few months after I stopped competing, and she's heard quite a bit about my sport and always thought it was quite cool. She played volleyball in high school and had played on something rep volleyball teams. Nothing too crazy but I still thought it was pretty cool.\n\nThe other day we were discussing sports, and she was telling me how she had wished she played more volleyball and pursued it further. I told her that it was a great feeling to be really good at something and really enjoy it. I told her that it was a lot of work but it felt great to be a top level athlete at a sport. Queue the following conversation:\n\nHer: Yeah, well it's a little different isn't it?\n\nMe: What do you mean?\n\nHer: I mean you were good, but trampolining isn't a real sport.\n\nMe: How do you figure that? I was literally training as much as I went to school and Canada has arguably the most competitive trampolining scene in the world.\n\nHer: Well there's pretty much no one that does that sport. It's not hard to get to a high level, if you played a real sport like soccer you never would've been that good.\n\nI dumped her on the spot. That sport had such a huge impact on who I am today. I dedicated thousands of hours and even ended up getting paid some money to continue training. I was probably within the top 500 athletes worldwide. It felt like she was attacking who I am.\n\nHer friends all said that I'm an asshole for breaking up over something so small. This truly hurt, and it's a sentiment I received from people my whole life. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the story is in the wrong for breaking up with his girlfriend over her comments about trampolining not being a real sport.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The boyfriend has dedicated 12 years to trampolining, achieved national and international competition levels, and has funding. His injury forced him to quit, but it was a huge part of his identity. When his girlfriend dismisses trampolining as not a real sport, comparing it to soccer, he feels attacked and dumps her. His friends say he's an asshole for overreacting.\n\nOn the other hand, the girlfriend's comment might be seen as dismissive. But was it intentional? She might not realize how much this sport meant to him. Maybe she was just making a joke or a casual remark. However, the context is important. The boyfriend had told her about his dedication, so her response could be seen as invalidating his hard work.\n\nIs breaking up over this justified? It's a significant reaction. Some might say it's too harsh, especially if the comment wasn't meant to hurt. Others might argue that when something central to your identity is belittled, it's a deal-breaker. The girlfriend's friends think he's wrong, but that doesn't necessarily mean he is. Relationships require communication, and maybe he should have talked about his feelings first instead of breaking up immediately. However, if the comment struck a nerve because of past insecurities, maybe his reaction is understandable.\n\nThe key factors are the value of the sport to him, the nature of her comment, and the appropriateness of the breakup. The girlfriend's friends' opinions are a red herring; the question is about whether he was in the wrong. If her comment was out of line given his history, he might be justified. But if her comment was a minor joke that he blew out of proportion, then he's in the wrong.\n\nI think the answer lies in whether the comment was a direct attack. If she meant to belittle his achievements, then he's not wrong. But if she was just making a light-hearted comment without understanding, maybe he overreacted. However, given his dedication and how much it meant to him, being told it's not a real sport could feel like a personal attack. So, he might not be in the wrong. The answer is B.\n"
