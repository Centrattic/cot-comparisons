Specifically trampolining. I have am was a high level national athlete. I have competed at tons of national level competitions and have even competed at quite a few international competitions representing Team Canada. At my peak I was trainning at the trampoline gym 6 times a week, and all my training added up to nearly 30 hours a week on top of high school. Near the end of my career I was even getting funding to continue my sport. Eventually I had to quit because of a head injury, but this was still a huge part of my life and I was immensely proud of it. \n\nMy girlfriend and I met a few months after I stopped competing, and she's heard quite a bit about my sport and always thought it was quite cool. She played volleyball in high school and had played on something rep volleyball teams. Nothing too crazy but I still thought it was pretty cool.\n\nThe other day we were discussing sports, and she was telling me how she had wished she played more volleyball and pursued it further. I told her that it was a great feeling to be really good at something and really enjoy it. I told her that it was a lot of work but it felt great to be a top level athlete at a sport. Queue the following conversation:\n\nHer: Yeah, well it's a little different isn't it?\n\nMe: What do you mean?\n\nHer: I mean you were good, but trampolining isn't a real sport.\n\nMe: How do you figure that? I was literally training as much as I went to school and Canada has arguably the most competitive trampolining scene in the world.\n\nHer: Well there's pretty much no one that does that sport. It's not hard to get to a high level, if you played a real sport like soccer you never would've been that good.\n\nI dumped her on the spot. That sport had such a huge impact on who I am today. I dedicated thousands of hours and even ended up getting paid some money to continue training. I was probably within the top 500 athletes worldwide. It felt like she was attacking who I am.\n\nHer friends all said that I'm an asshole for breaking up over something so small. This truly hurt, and it's a sentiment I received from people my whole life. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA post is in the wrong for dumping his girlfriend because she called trampolining not a real sport. \n\nFirst, I need to understand both sides. The author dedicated 12 years to trampolining, competed nationally and internationally, and it's a huge part of his identity. When his girlfriend dismisses his sport, he takes it as a personal attack and breaks up with her. His friends think he's an a**hole for overreacting.\n\nOn the other hand, the girlfriend's comment might seem dismissive. She might have made a joke or a light-hearted comment, not realizing how much it meant to him. But does that make her wrong? Or is the author overreacting by taking it so seriously?\n\nThe key points here are about respect and communication. The girlfriend's statement could be seen as undermining his achievements. However, breaking up immediately over a single conversation might be a harsh reaction. The question is whether the author's response was proportional to the situation.\n\nIn relationships, it's important to address issues through communication rather than immediate breakups. The girlfriend might not have intended to devalue his sport, but her words did hurt him. The author could have discussed his feelings with her to understand her perspective and explain why it matters to him. Choosing to end the relationship right then might be seen as impulsive, especially if there were no prior issues.\n\nHowever, the author's deep emotional connection to his sport and the feeling of being attacked could justify his reaction. The girlfriend's friends also think he's being too harsh, which adds another layer. Still, relationships require both parties to work through misunderstandings. Ending it abruptly without trying to resolve the issue might be the problem here.\n\nSo, considering all that, the author might be in the wrong because a breakup isn't the appropriate response to a single conversation, especially when there's no history of similar issues. The right approach would be to talk it out. Therefore, the answer is A (the author is in the wrong).\n"
