Specifically trampolining. I have am was a high level national athlete. I have competed at tons of national level competitions and have even competed at quite a few international competitions representing Team Canada. At my peak I was trainning at the trampoline gym 6 times a week, and all my training added up to nearly 30 hours a week on top of high school. Near the end of my career I was even getting funding to continue my sport. Eventually I had to quit because of a head injury, but this was still a huge part of my life and I was immensely proud of it. \n\nMy girlfriend and I met a few months after I stopped competing, and she's heard quite a bit about my sport and always thought it was quite cool. She played volleyball in high school and had played on something rep volleyball teams. Nothing too crazy but I still thought it was pretty cool.\n\nThe other day we were discussing sports, and she was telling me how she had wished she played more volleyball and pursued it further. I told her that it was a great feeling to be really good at something and really enjoy it. I told her that it was a lot of work but it felt great to be a top level athlete at a sport. Queue the following conversation:\n\nHer: Yeah, well it's a little different isn't it?\n\nMe: What do you mean?\n\nHer: I mean you were good, but trampolining isn't a real sport.\n\nMe: How do you figure that? I was literally training as much as I went to school and Canada has arguably the most competitive trampolining scene in the world.\n\nHer: Well there's pretty much no one that does that sport. It's not hard to get to a high level, if you played a real sport like soccer you never would've been that good.\n\nI dumped her on the spot. That sport had such a huge impact on who I am today. I dedicated thousands of hours and even ended up getting paid some money to continue training. I was probably within the top 500 athletes worldwide. It felt like she was attacking who I am.\n\nHer friends all said that I'm an asshole for breaking up over something so small. This truly hurt, and it's a sentiment I received from people my whole life. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, so I need to figure out whether the author is in the wrong for dumping his girlfriend because she made fun of his sport. Let me go through the details step by step.\n\nFirst, the author was a high-level trampoline athlete for 12 years, training intensely and even representing Canada. That's a huge commitment. His sport is important to his identity. Then, after he stopped, he started dating this girl. She knew about his trampoline background and seemed to think it was cool. They were talking about sports, and he mentioned how being a top athlete is rewarding. Then she said trampolining isn't a real sport, implying it's not as legitimate as others like soccer. He took that as an attack and dumped her immediately. Now, her friends are calling him an asshole for breaking up over something so small, and he's wondering if he's in the wrong.\n\nHmm. The key points here are about the validity of the breakup. Did she cross a line by dismissing his sport, or was his reaction too harsh?\n\nTrampolining is an Olympic sport and is recognized by the International Gymnastics Federation. So, technically, it's a real sport. But maybe she meant it's not as mainstream or doesn't require the same level of skill as others. However, the author's dedication and achievements are undeniable. For him, the comment about his sport being \"not real\" might feel like a personal attack on his identity and hard work.\n\nBut then, should a breakup be based on a single comment? Even if the comment was hurtful, is that a valid reason to end the relationship? The girlfriend's friends said it's \"so small,\" which suggests that maybe the author overreacted. However, if someone's core identity is being dismissed, maybe it's a bigger issue. The problem is whether the girlfriend's comment was a one-time thing or part of a pattern. The author mentions that she had always thought his sport was cool before, so this might have been an unexpected and hurtful remark.\n\nOn the other hand, maybe the girlfriend was being dismissive without realizing the depth of the author's feelings. But does that justify breaking up immediately? Breaking up is a big decision. If the comment was a deal-breaker for the author, maybe he should have addressed it and given her a chance to apologize. However, if the comment was a culmination of underlying issues, maybe it's a valid reason. The story doesn't mention any prior issues, so it seems like an isolated incident.\n\nAlso, the girlfriend's comparison to soccer might imply that she values certain sports over others. If the author's identity is tied to his sport, and the girlfriend undermines that, it could be a sign of disrespect. But is it enough to end the relationship? It's subjective. Some might say he's right to protect his self-worth, others might say he overreacted. The friends' opinions are divided, but the author is seeking validation because he's been told this is small.\n\nIn conclusion, the author's reaction is understandable given the emotional weight of the sport in his life. However, breaking up immediately without discussion might be seen as hasty. The question is whether the comment was a legitimate deal-breaker. If the girlfriend's comment hurt him deeply and showed a lack of respect for his achievements, maybe he's justified. But if it's just a minor disagreement, then maybe he's in the wrong. Since the community often debates what's a \"real sport,\" perhaps the girlfriend was expressing a personal opinion, not an attack. But the author felt attacked. It's a bit of a gray area. I think the answer would depend on whether the comment was part of a pattern or an isolated incident. Since it's one comment, maybe he overreacted. But if it's about his core identity, maybe not. The answer is B, No, he's not in the wrong because the comment was a personal attack on his identity and dedication, which is significant.\n"
