Specifically trampolining. I have am was a high level national athlete. I have competed at tons of national level competitions and have even competed at quite a few international competitions representing Team Canada. At my peak I was trainning at the trampoline gym 6 times a week, and all my training added up to nearly 30 hours a week on top of high school. Near the end of my career I was even getting funding to continue my sport. Eventually I had to quit because of a head injury, but this was still a huge part of my life and I was immensely proud of it. \n\nMy girlfriend and I met a few months after I stopped competing, and she's heard quite a bit about my sport and always thought it was quite cool. She played volleyball in high school and had played on something rep volleyball teams. Nothing too crazy but I still thought it was pretty cool.\n\nThe other day we were discussing sports, and she was telling me how she had wished she played more volleyball and pursued it further. I told her that it was a great feeling to be really good at something and really enjoy it. I told her that it was a lot of work but it felt great to be a top level athlete at a sport. Queue the following conversation:\n\nHer: Yeah, well it's a little different isn't it?\n\nMe: What do you mean?\n\nHer: I mean you were good, but trampolining isn't a real sport.\n\nMe: How do you figure that? I was literally training as much as I went to school and Canada has arguably the most competitive trampolining scene in the world.\n\nHer: Well there's pretty much no one that does that sport. It's not hard to get to a high level, if you played a real sport like soccer you never would've been that good.\n\nI dumped her on the spot. That sport had such a huge impact on who I am today. I dedicated thousands of hours and even ended up getting paid some money to continue training. I was probably within the top 500 athletes worldwide. It felt like she was attacking who I am.\n\nHer friends all said that I'm an asshole for breaking up over something so small. This truly hurt, and it's a sentiment I received from people my whole life. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for dumping his girlfriend because she made fun of his sport, trampolining.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The author dedicated 12 years to trampolining, was a national athlete, competed internationally, and even got funding. His girlfriend made comments saying trampolining isn't a real sport and that it's easy to get good at compared to something like soccer. The author felt attacked and broke up with her immediately. Her friends said he's an asshole for overreacting. The question is whether he's in the wrong.\n\nSo, the key points here are: the author's sport is important to his identity, the girlfriend's comments were dismissive and belittling, and the author felt that his dedication and achievements were being devalued. He took immediate action, which some people found harsh.\n\nOn one hand, some might argue that breaking up over a single conversation is extreme, especially if the relationship had been going well otherwise. The girlfriend's comments might be seen as a joke or a moment of insensitivity rather than a deep-rooted issue. Friends might suggest that the author is overreacting because the comment wasn't meant to be taken seriously, and that the relationship's overall health should be considered before ending it.\n\nOn the other hand, the author's perspective is that the comment was a direct attack on his identity and years of dedication. For someone who has invested so much into their sport and identity, such a comment can feel deeply personal and invalidating. The fact that he had to quit due to injury might have added to his sensitivity. If the comment reflected a broader pattern of disrespect for his passions, then the breakup could be seen as a justified stand for self-respect.\n\nI need to consider cultural context too. Trampolining might not be as widely recognized as other sports, so the girlfriend's dismissal could stem from a lack of awareness rather than malice. However, the author's reaction is about feeling devalued, which is a valid emotional response. The question is whether the reaction is proportionate to the comment.\n\nIn relationships, communication is key. If the author had expressed his feelings earlier, maybe the situation could have been resolved. But since it led to a breakup, people might judge based on their own values. Some might see the author as standing up for his self-worth, others as being too sensitive.\n\nAlso, considering the girlfriend's background\u2014she played volleyball, which she considers a real sport. Her comment might be a result of comparing sports she's familiar with, not realizing the depth of the author's experience. However, that doesn't excuse the dismissive nature of her remarks.\n\nSo, the answer hinges on whether the comment was a one-time joke or part of a larger issue. If it's the former, the author might be in the wrong for not addressing it with more discussion. If it's the latter, then the breakup is justified. Since the scenario presents this as an isolated incident, but the emotional impact was significant, it's a bit of a toss-up. However, in such scenarios, the AITA (Am I the Asshole) format often looks for whether the action is a reasonable response to a clear disrespect. Given the author's explanation and the emotional toll, many might side with him not being the asshole. But others would argue that breaking up over a single conversation is extreme. However, given the depth of the issue for the author, it's a valid reaction. So, maybe the answer is B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
