Specifically trampolining. I have am was a high level national athlete. I have competed at tons of national level competitions and have even competed at quite a few international competitions representing Team Canada. At my peak I was trainning at the trampoline gym 6 times a week, and all my training added up to nearly 30 hours a week on top of high school. Near the end of my career I was even getting funding to continue my sport. Eventually I had to quit because of a head injury, but this was still a huge part of my life and I was immensely proud of it. \n\nMy girlfriend and I met a few months after I stopped competing, and she's heard quite a bit about my sport and always thought it was quite cool. She played volleyball in high school and had played on something rep volleyball teams. Nothing too crazy but I still thought it was pretty cool.\n\nThe other day we were discussing sports, and she was telling me how she had wished she played more volleyball and pursued it further. I told her that it was a great feeling to be really good at something and really enjoy it. I told her that it was a lot of work but it felt great to be a top level athlete at a sport. Queue the following conversation:\n\nHer: Yeah, well it's a little different isn't it?\n\nMe: What do you mean?\n\nHer: I mean you were good, but trampolining isn't a real sport.\n\nMe: How do you figure that? I was literally training as much as I went to school and Canada has arguably the most competitive trampolining scene in the world.\n\nHer: Well there's pretty much no one that does that sport. It's not hard to get to a high level, if you played a real sport like soccer you never would've been that good.\n\nI dumped her on the spot. That sport had such a huge impact on who I am today. I dedicated thousands of hours and even ended up getting paid some money to continue training. I was probably within the top 500 athletes worldwide. It felt like she was attacking who I am.\n\nHer friends all said that I'm an asshole for breaking up over something so small. This truly hurt, and it's a sentiment I received from people my whole life. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. Let's see. The situation is about a guy who's been into trampolining for 12 years, high-level competitions, representing Canada, and then he dumps his girlfriend because she called trampolining not a real sport. The girlfriend says things like it's not a real sport, not many people do it, and if he played a real sport like soccer, he'd never be that good. The guy dumps her immediately, and her friends say he's an asshole for breaking up over something small. The question is whether he's in the wrong.\n\nFirst, I should consider both sides. The guy's perspective: trampolining was a huge part of his life, dedication, sacrifice, injury, funding. He's proud of his achievement. The comment from his girlfriend felt like an attack on his identity. He took it very seriously, which makes sense given the emotional investment. \n\nOn the other hand, the girlfriend's comment might seem dismissive. She might not have realized the depth of his feelings about his sport. Maybe she was joking or making a casual remark, but he took it the wrong way. The problem is, does that justify breaking up? \n\nTrampolining is an Olympic sport, so it's recognized as a real sport. The fact that it's less popular than soccer doesn't make it not a real sport. Her comparison to soccer is flawed because success in one doesn't preclude success in another. But maybe she meant that it's easier to get to a high level in trampolining compared to soccer, which is more common. However, the guy's response was immediate and severe. \n\nIs a breakup over this justified? Well, communication is key in relationships. If this was a recurring issue, maybe, but it seems like a single conversation. The guy took it as an attack on his identity, which is valid. But the girlfriend's friends think it's overreacting. The line between a valid reason and an overreaction is blurry here. \n\nThe author's action was to dump her on the spot without any discussion. That might be seen as impulsive. However, if the comment really struck a nerve and he felt disrespected, maybe he had a right to feel that way. But relationships require understanding and communication. If he didn't address the issue calmly, it might come off as wrong. \n\nI think the key points are whether the comment was a deal-breaker and if the reaction was proportionate. The girlfriend's friends say it's small, but to him, it was significant. It's a matter of perspective. However, ending a relationship over a single comment, even if it's hurtful, might be considered overreacting. So maybe the author is in the wrong (A), but others might say B. I'm leaning towards A because the breakup was immediate and maybe not giving the girlfriend a chance to explain or apologize. But I'm not sure. Alternatively, if the comment was a deal-breaker for him, then B. Hmm.\n"
