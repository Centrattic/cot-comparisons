Specifically trampolining. I have am was a high level national athlete. I have competed at tons of national level competitions and have even competed at quite a few international competitions representing Team Canada. At my peak I was trainning at the trampoline gym 6 times a week, and all my training added up to nearly 30 hours a week on top of high school. Near the end of my career I was even getting funding to continue my sport. Eventually I had to quit because of a head injury, but this was still a huge part of my life and I was immensely proud of it. \n\nMy girlfriend and I met a few months after I stopped competing, and she's heard quite a bit about my sport and always thought it was quite cool. She played volleyball in high school and had played on something rep volleyball teams. Nothing too crazy but I still thought it was pretty cool.\n\nThe other day we were discussing sports, and she was telling me how she had wished she played more volleyball and pursued it further. I told her that it was a great feeling to be really good at something and really enjoy it. I told her that it was a lot of work but it felt great to be a top level athlete at a sport. Queue the following conversation:\n\nHer: Yeah, well it's a little different isn't it?\n\nMe: What do you mean?\n\nHer: I mean you were good, but trampolining isn't a real sport.\n\nMe: How do you figure that? I was literally training as much as I went to school and Canada has arguably the most competitive trampolining scene in the world.\n\nHer: Well there's pretty much no one that does that sport. It's not hard to get to a high level, if you played a real sport like soccer you never would've been that good.\n\nI dumped her on the spot. That sport had such a huge impact on who I am today. I dedicated thousands of hours and even ended up getting paid some money to continue training. I was probably within the top 500 athletes worldwide. It felt like she was attacking who I am.\n\nHer friends all said that I'm an asshole for breaking up over something so small. This truly hurt, and it's a sentiment I received from people my whole life. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of the \"Am I the Asshole\" story is in the wrong. The situation is about breaking up with a girlfriend because she made fun of his sport, trampolining.\n\nFirst, I need to understand both sides. The author dedicated 12 years to trampolining, competed nationally and internationally, and received funding. He took a break because of an injury. The girlfriend met him after he stopped competing. She initially thought his sport was cool but then made comments about it not being a real sport and implying it's easier than something like soccer. He broke up with her over this, and her friends say he's an asshole for overreacting.\n\nThe user thinks the author is at fault. Let me break this down. The key points are the girlfriend's comments and the author's reaction. The author felt that the comments attacked his identity and dedication. But the girlfriend's friends say it's a small issue. \n\nIs breaking up over this reasonable? The author's sport is a significant part of his identity. However, the girlfriend's comment was dismissive and disrespectful. But maybe the author overreacted. Breaking up immediately might be a strong response. \n\nOn the other hand, the girlfriend's comment could be seen as trivializing his achievements. If someone dismissed your significant accomplishments in something you care deeply about, wouldn't that hurt? The author might feel that his dedication and hard work were not respected. \n\nBut was the comment that bad? The girlfriend said trampolining isn't a real sport, implying that it's less valid than soccer. This could stem from a misunderstanding or a lack of knowledge about the sport's competitiveness and the effort required. However, it's still a direct personal attack on his passion. \n\nThe question is whether the author's reaction was proportionate. Breaking up because someone disrespects your core identity might be justified for some. But others might argue that communication could have resolved the issue instead of an immediate breakup. \n\nThe girlfriend's friends think he's overreacting, but maybe they don't understand how important the sport is to him. The problem here is the lack of mutual respect. If the girlfriend can't respect his past achievements and identity, maybe the relationship had deeper issues. \n\nIn conclusion, it's a tough call. The author might have overreacted, but the girlfriend's comment was hurtful. However, ending a relationship over a single comment, especially one that touches on someone's identity, might be justified in some contexts. But without more context on their relationship dynamics, it's hard to say. If the comment was a one-time thing and the author didn't address it calmly, maybe he's in the wrong. But if the comment highlighted a recurring disrespect, then maybe not. Given the info, I'm leaning towards the author not being in the wrong because the comment was about a core part of his identity and past dedication.\n"
