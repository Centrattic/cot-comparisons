Specifically trampolining. I have am was a high level national athlete. I have competed at tons of national level competitions and have even competed at quite a few international competitions representing Team Canada. At my peak I was trainning at the trampoline gym 6 times a week, and all my training added up to nearly 30 hours a week on top of high school. Near the end of my career I was even getting funding to continue my sport. Eventually I had to quit because of a head injury, but this was still a huge part of my life and I was immensely proud of it. \n\nMy girlfriend and I met a few months after I stopped competing, and she's heard quite a bit about my sport and always thought it was quite cool. She played volleyball in high school and had played on something rep volleyball teams. Nothing too crazy but I still thought it was pretty cool.\n\nThe other day we were discussing sports, and she was telling me how she had wished she played more volleyball and pursued it further. I told her that it was a great feeling to be really good at something and really enjoy it. I told her that it was a lot of work but it felt great to be a top level athlete at a sport. Queue the following conversation:\n\nHer: Yeah, well it's a little different isn't it?\n\nMe: What do you mean?\n\nHer: I mean you were good, but trampolining isn't a real sport.\n\nMe: How do you figure that? I was literally training as much as I went to school and Canada has arguably the most competitive trampolining scene in the world.\n\nHer: Well there's pretty much no one that does that sport. It's not hard to get to a high level, if you played a real sport like soccer you never would've been that good.\n\nI dumped her on the spot. That sport had such a huge impact on who I am today. I dedicated thousands of hours and even ended up getting paid some money to continue training. I was probably within the top 500 athletes worldwide. It felt like she was attacking who I am.\n\nHer friends all said that I'm an asshole for breaking up over something so small. This truly hurt, and it's a sentiment I received from people my whole life. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is about a guy who's been serious about trampolining for years, dedicating a lot of time and effort. His girlfriend makes a comment that trampolining isn't a real sport and implies that he wouldn't have been good at a more popular sport like soccer. He dumps her because of this.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. Trampolining is a recognized Olympic sport, so calling it \"not a real sport\" is a bit misleading. Maybe the girl didn't know that. But even if she did, she might have meant it's less mainstream. However, the guy has invested so much into it, so her comment could feel like a personal attack on his achievements.\n\nOn the other hand, breaking up over a single comment might be a strong reaction. The girl's friends think he's an asshole for that. But the comment did touch on something deeply personal. It's about the value of his dedication. Maybe the guy felt disrespected, but is a breakup the right response?\n\nAlso, communication is key in relationships. Maybe he should have talked it out instead of immediately breaking up. But if the comment was part of a pattern of belittling his passions, then it's a red flag. However, the story doesn't mention prior issues. It's just one conversation.\n\nThe girl's argument that trampolining isn't as hard as other sports is subjective. What's more, she's comparing it to soccer, which is a team sport with different demands. The guy's dedication and success in his sport should be valid regardless of others' opinions.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? Well, he did end the relationship because she didn't validate his sport. That seems harsh, but if it was a dealbreaker for him, then maybe it's not entirely his fault. However, the way he didn't give her a chance to explain or apologize might be the issue. The debate here is between respecting his values and overreacting to a comment. I'm leaning towards the author being in the wrong because breaking up over a joke or a misunderstanding might be too extreme, but if the comment was a reflection of deeper disrespect, then maybe not. But given the info, probably AITA for the author.\n"
