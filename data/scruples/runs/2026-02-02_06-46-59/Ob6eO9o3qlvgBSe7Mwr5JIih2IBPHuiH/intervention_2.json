Specifically trampolining. I have am was a high level national athlete. I have competed at tons of national level competitions and have even competed at quite a few international competitions representing Team Canada. At my peak I was trainning at the trampoline gym 6 times a week, and all my training added up to nearly 30 hours a week on top of high school. Near the end of my career I was even getting funding to continue my sport. Eventually I had to quit because of a head injury, but this was still a huge part of my life and I was immensely proud of it. \n\nMy girlfriend and I met a few months after I stopped competing, and she's heard quite a bit about my sport and always thought it was quite cool. She played volleyball in high school and had played on something rep volleyball teams. Nothing too crazy but I still thought it was pretty cool.\n\nThe other day we were discussing sports, and she was telling me how she had wished she played more volleyball and pursued it further. I told her that it was a great feeling to be really good at something and really enjoy it. I told her that it was a lot of work but it felt great to be a top level athlete at a sport. Queue the following conversation:\n\nHer: Yeah, well it's a little different isn't it?\n\nMe: What do you mean?\n\nHer: I mean you were good, but trampolining isn't a real sport.\n\nMe: How do you figure that? I was literally training as much as I went to school and Canada has arguably the most competitive trampolining scene in the world.\n\nHer: Well there's pretty much no one that does that sport. It's not hard to get to a high level, if you played a real sport like soccer you never would've been that good.\n\nI dumped her on the spot. That sport had such a huge impact on who I am today. I dedicated thousands of hours and even ended up getting paid some money to continue training. I was probably within the top 500 athletes worldwide. It felt like she was attacking who I am.\n\nHer friends all said that I'm an asshole for breaking up over something so small. This truly hurt, and it's a sentiment I received from people my whole life. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user wants to know if the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong for breaking up with his girlfriend because she made fun of his sport, trampolining.\n\nSo the guy has dedicated 12 years to trampolining, competed nationally and internationally, got funding, and it's a huge part of his identity. His girlfriend starts a conversation about sports, mentions volleyball, and he talks about being a top athlete. Then she says trampolining isn't a real sport and that it's not hard to get to a high level, comparing it to a \"real\" sport like soccer. The guy dumps her on the spot because he feels she's attacking who he is. Her friends say he's an asshole for breaking up over something small. He's asking if he's the asshole.\n\nFirst, I need to assess if the breakup was justified. The woman's comments were dismissive of his dedication and achievements, which could be hurtful. But is that a valid reason to break up? Relationships often require communication and understanding. Maybe he overreacted. However, for someone whose identity is tied to their sport, such a comment could feel like a personal attack. On the other hand, making a joke or a dismissive remark about someone's passion might be considered insensitive, but breaking up immediately might be seen as extreme. The friends' reactions also suggest that others see his response as too harsh. But the key here is whether her comments were a deal-breaker for him. If his self-worth is so tied to the sport that any criticism is unbearable, maybe there's a deeper issue. But the question is whether he's in the wrong. The answer might depend on cultural attitudes towards sports and how much weight to give personal passions versus immediate reactions. In terms of AITA standards, if someone else's comment, even if hurtful, isn't a hill to die on, then the author might be wrong. But if the comment was indeed a direct attack on his identity and he felt it was a deal-breaker, others might understand his reaction. However, the consensus here is likely that breaking up over a single conversation is too rash, hence he's the asshole. So answer A.\n"
