Specifically trampolining. I have am was a high level national athlete. I have competed at tons of national level competitions and have even competed at quite a few international competitions representing Team Canada. At my peak I was trainning at the trampoline gym 6 times a week, and all my training added up to nearly 30 hours a week on top of high school. Near the end of my career I was even getting funding to continue my sport. Eventually I had to quit because of a head injury, but this was still a huge part of my life and I was immensely proud of it. \n\nMy girlfriend and I met a few months after I stopped competing, and she's heard quite a bit about my sport and always thought it was quite cool. She played volleyball in high school and had played on something rep volleyball teams. Nothing too crazy but I still thought it was pretty cool.\n\nThe other day we were discussing sports, and she was telling me how she had wished she played more volleyball and pursued it further. I told her that it was a great feeling to be really good at something and really enjoy it. I told her that it was a lot of work but it felt great to be a top level athlete at a sport. Queue the following conversation:\n\nHer: Yeah, well it's a little different isn't it?\n\nMe: What do you mean?\n\nHer: I mean you were good, but trampolining isn't a real sport.\n\nMe: How do you figure that? I was literally training as much as I went to school and Canada has arguably the most competitive trampolining scene in the world.\n\nHer: Well there's pretty much no one that does that sport. It's not hard to get to a high level, if you played a real sport like soccer you never would've been that good.\n\nI dumped her on the spot. That sport had such a huge impact on who I am today. I dedicated thousands of hours and even ended up getting paid some money to continue training. I was probably within the top 500 athletes worldwide. It felt like she was attacking who I am.\n\nHer friends all said that I'm an asshole for breaking up over something so small. This truly hurt, and it's a sentiment I received from people my whole life. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for dumping his girlfriend because she mocked his sport, trampolining. The author was a high-level national athlete, put in a lot of time and effort, and now he's upset that she called trampolining \"not a real sport\" and said it's easy compared to something like soccer. He broke up with her immediately, and her friends think he's being an a**hole.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The author clearly puts a lot of value on trampolining as part of his identity. Being told that his sport isn't real and that he wouldn't be good at a \"real\" sport like soccer could be a deep personal attack. He might feel that his years of dedication and achievements are being dismissed. That's a valid emotional reaction.\n\nOn the other hand, the girlfriend's comment might not have been intended as a personal attack. Maybe she was joking or trying to make a point about the difficulty of her own sport (volleyball) versus his. She might not realize the emotional weight trampolining has for him. But she did say some hurtful things, like implying his sport isn't real and that it's easy to get good at. That could come off as dismissive of his efforts and achievements.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author was wrong to break up over this. Breaking up over a single comment is a big step. Maybe the girlfriend didn't mean to be disrespectful, and the author overreacted. However, if this comment hit a nerve because of his personal investment in the sport, then his reaction might be understandable. It's about how much weight each person puts on their partner's achievements and whether respect and understanding were present in the relationship.\n\nThe girlfriend's friends think the author is wrong because the issue seems minor. But for the author, it's about his self-worth and how he's perceived. If he felt that his identity was being attacked, then he might have needed to set a boundary. However, breaking up instantly without addressing the issue might not be the healthiest approach. Maybe a conversation could have clarified her intentions and resolved the conflict instead of ending the relationship.\n\nIn terms of right or wrong, it's possible that both parties have some responsibility. The author might have overreacted by ending the relationship immediately, but the girlfriend did make a comment that could be seen as belittling. The key here is whether the comment was malicious or a thoughtless remark. If it was the latter, the author's reaction might be too harsh. But if it was a recurring issue, then maybe it's justified.\n\nThe author's dedication and the emotional impact of the comment are significant factors. However, relationships require communication and understanding both sides. Maybe the author should have discussed why the comment hurt him and given her a chance to acknowledge his feelings. Ending the relationship without that step could be seen as impulsive. So, while the girlfriend made a hurtful comment, the author's immediate decision to break up might not be the best approach, making him partially at fault.\n"
