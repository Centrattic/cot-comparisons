Specifically trampolining. I have am was a high level national athlete. I have competed at tons of national level competitions and have even competed at quite a few international competitions representing Team Canada. At my peak I was trainning at the trampoline gym 6 times a week, and all my training added up to nearly 30 hours a week on top of high school. Near the end of my career I was even getting funding to continue my sport. Eventually I had to quit because of a head injury, but this was still a huge part of my life and I was immensely proud of it. \n\nMy girlfriend and I met a few months after I stopped competing, and she's heard quite a bit about my sport and always thought it was quite cool. She played volleyball in high school and had played on something rep volleyball teams. Nothing too crazy but I still thought it was pretty cool.\n\nThe other day we were discussing sports, and she was telling me how she had wished she played more volleyball and pursued it further. I told her that it was a great feeling to be really good at something and really enjoy it. I told her that it was a lot of work but it felt great to be a top level athlete at a sport. Queue the following conversation:\n\nHer: Yeah, well it's a little different isn't it?\n\nMe: What do you mean?\n\nHer: I mean you were good, but trampolining isn't a real sport.\n\nMe: How do you figure that? I was literally training as much as I went to school and Canada has arguably the most competitive trampolining scene in the world.\n\nHer: Well there's pretty much no one that does that sport. It's not hard to get to a high level, if you played a real sport like soccer you never would've been that good.\n\nI dumped her on the spot. That sport had such a huge impact on who I am today. I dedicated thousands of hours and even ended up getting paid some money to continue training. I was probably within the top 500 athletes worldwide. It felt like she was attacking who I am.\n\nHer friends all said that I'm an asshole for breaking up over something so small. This truly hurt, and it's a sentiment I received from people my whole life. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user wants to know if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. The story is about breaking up a girlfriend because she made fun of his sport, trampolining. He's been doing it for 12 years, high-level national and international competitions, and she said it's not a real sport. He dumped her on the spot, and her friends think he's an asshole for overreacting. The user thinks the author is in the wrong but wants my opinion.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The guy's dedication to his sport is clear; he's invested a lot of time and effort, and for someone to dismiss it as not a real sport could be really hurtful. His reaction is based on feeling that his identity and achievements are being attacked. On the other hand, the girlfriend's comment seems disrespectful. Even if she didn't mean it maliciously, the fact that she made a joke about his sport, which was such a big part of his life, is problematic. \n\nBut the key question is whether breaking up over this is justified. The post says her friends think it's too harsh. Maybe they're right. However, the guy felt that it was an attack on who he is. If you can't respect each other's passions, that could be a deal-breaker. But is this overreacting? The girlfriend's comment was out of line, but was the breakup too quick? The guy might have overreacted, but the comment itself was disrespectful. \n\nAlso, considering the context: he was getting funding, top 500 worldwide, and she compared it to a real sport like soccer, implying it's easier. That's a direct attack on the legitimacy of his hard work. People might say that the breakup was too fast, but others might agree that respect for each other's achievements is crucial in a relationship. If the girlfriend can't respect his passion, maybe the relationship is on shaky ground. \n\nSo, the answer hinges on whether the girlfriend's comment was a valid critique or a disrespectful jab. It's the latter, so the guy's hurt is understandable. However, breaking up immediately might be extreme. But given the emotional impact, maybe not. The user said they think he's in the wrong, but I'm leaning towards B (not in the wrong) because the girlfriend dismissed his significant achievements, and if you can't respect each other's passions, the relationship has a fundamental issue. However, I should consider if the comment was a one-time joke and if there's more to it. Since the post says \"she made fun of my sport,\" it's a clear disrespect. So, the author might be justified in ending it.\n"
