Specifically trampolining. I have am was a high level national athlete. I have competed at tons of national level competitions and have even competed at quite a few international competitions representing Team Canada. At my peak I was trainning at the trampoline gym 6 times a week, and all my training added up to nearly 30 hours a week on top of high school. Near the end of my career I was even getting funding to continue my sport. Eventually I had to quit because of a head injury, but this was still a huge part of my life and I was immensely proud of it. \n\nMy girlfriend and I met a few months after I stopped competing, and she's heard quite a bit about my sport and always thought it was quite cool. She played volleyball in high school and had played on something rep volleyball teams. Nothing too crazy but I still thought it was pretty cool.\n\nThe other day we were discussing sports, and she was telling me how she had wished she played more volleyball and pursued it further. I told her that it was a great feeling to be really good at something and really enjoy it. I told her that it was a lot of work but it felt great to be a top level athlete at a sport. Queue the following conversation:\n\nHer: Yeah, well it's a little different isn't it?\n\nMe: What do you mean?\n\nHer: I mean you were good, but trampolining isn't a real sport.\n\nMe: How do you figure that? I was literally training as much as I went to school and Canada has arguably the most competitive trampolining scene in the world.\n\nHer: Well there's pretty much no one that does that sport. It's not hard to get to a high level, if you played a real sport like soccer you never would've been that good.\n\nI dumped her on the spot. That sport had such a huge impact on who I am today. I dedicated thousands of hours and even ended up getting paid some money to continue training. I was probably within the top 500 athletes worldwide. It felt like she was attacking who I am.\n\nHer friends all said that I'm an asshole for breaking up over something so small. This truly hurt, and it's a sentiment I received from people my whole life. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for breaking up with his girlfriend over her comments about his sport, trampolining.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author dedicated 12 years to a high-level competitive sport, which is a significant commitment. His identity and pride are tied to this, especially since he was funded and competed internationally. The girlfriend's comments seemed dismissive, calling trampolining \"not a real sport\" and implying it's easy compared to others like soccer. The author felt this was an attack on his dedication and achievements.\n\nNow, the key factors here: Was the breakup justified? The girlfriend's remarks were hurtful and disrespectful to his passion and accomplishments. The author felt that his identity was under attack, which is a big deal. However, dumping someone over this might be seen as a reaction to something that, while personal, is a specific topic. The girlfriend's friends think the author is an asshole for overreacting. \n\nBut, from the author's perspective, the comment struck at the core of his self-worth and identity. It's possible that his reaction was a culmination of past insecurities about his sport being undervalued. The girlfriend didn't realize the emotional weight her words carried. \n\nOn the other hand, breaking up over a single argument, even if emotionally charged, might be seen as extreme. The girlfriend might not have intended such a harsh consequence. However, the author's response was immediate and decisive, which could indicate that the issue was a deal-breaker for him. \n\nIs the author in the wrong? If the relationship had built up issues where this was the final straw, then maybe not. But if this was an isolated incident and the breakup is solely based on this comment, it's debatable. The girlfriend's comment was disrespectful, but the author's reaction is a personal choice. \n\nIn terms of right or wrong, the situation is complex. The author might not be in the wrong if he felt that his core values were disrespected. However, others might see it as an overreaction. The key here is whether the reaction was proportionate. Since the sport was such a huge part of his identity, the reaction might be seen as justified. Therefore, the answer could be B (not in the wrong). But some might argue A (in the wrong) for overreacting. \n\nBut considering the emotional impact and the significance of the sport to his identity, the author's reaction is more about feeling attacked personally. So, the answer is B.\n"
