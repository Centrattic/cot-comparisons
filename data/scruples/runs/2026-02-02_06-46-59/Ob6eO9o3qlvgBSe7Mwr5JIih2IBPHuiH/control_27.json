Specifically trampolining. I have am was a high level national athlete. I have competed at tons of national level competitions and have even competed at quite a few international competitions representing Team Canada. At my peak I was trainning at the trampoline gym 6 times a week, and all my training added up to nearly 30 hours a week on top of high school. Near the end of my career I was even getting funding to continue my sport. Eventually I had to quit because of a head injury, but this was still a huge part of my life and I was immensely proud of it. \n\nMy girlfriend and I met a few months after I stopped competing, and she's heard quite a bit about my sport and always thought it was quite cool. She played volleyball in high school and had played on something rep volleyball teams. Nothing too crazy but I still thought it was pretty cool.\n\nThe other day we were discussing sports, and she was telling me how she had wished she played more volleyball and pursued it further. I told her that it was a great feeling to be really good at something and really enjoy it. I told her that it was a lot of work but it felt great to be a top level athlete at a sport. Queue the following conversation:\n\nHer: Yeah, well it's a little different isn't it?\n\nMe: What do you mean?\n\nHer: I mean you were good, but trampolining isn't a real sport.\n\nMe: How do you figure that? I was literally training as much as I went to school and Canada has arguably the most competitive trampolining scene in the world.\n\nHer: Well there's pretty much no one that does that sport. It's not hard to get to a high level, if you played a real sport like soccer you never would've been that good.\n\nI dumped her on the spot. That sport had such a huge impact on who I am today. I dedicated thousands of hours and even ended up getting paid some money to continue training. I was probably within the top 500 athletes worldwide. It felt like she was attacking who I am.\n\nHer friends all said that I'm an asshole for breaking up over something so small. This truly hurt, and it's a sentiment I received from people my whole life. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about a guy who dumped his girlfriend because she called trampolining not a real sport. He's been really into it for years, had a national career, and it's a big part of his identity. She says something dismissive, he dumps her, and her friends say he's an asshole. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the core issue. The girlfriend made a comment that trampolining isn't a real sport, comparing it to something like soccer where he wouldn't have been good. The author felt that this was an attack on his identity and dedication, leading him to break up immediately.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? Well, breaking up over a single comment might seem extreme. But the context is that this was a sensitive topic for him. Did she cross a line? Maybe. She dismissed his sport, which he obviously values a lot. But was her statement that bad?\n\nOn one hand, calling a sport \"not real\" can be seen as belittling. Especially when he's invested so much time and effort. It's possible that she didn't mean to attack him, but the way she phrased it could come off as dismissive. On the other hand, if he took it so seriously, maybe he overreacted. Breaking up on the spot over a single conversation might be too hasty. Relationships require communication and handling conflicts, so maybe he should have discussed it instead of ending things immediately.\n\nHer friends' opinions might be biased, but they also think he's wrong. However, his feelings are valid because the comment hurt him deeply. It's about mutual respect in a relationship. If one partner's core identity is being undermined, that's a big deal. But was her comment an intentional attack or just a momentary joke? The answer might depend on their relationship dynamics and past interactions.\n\nIn the end, while the author's reaction might be seen as extreme, the girlfriend's comment could be considered disrespectful. Whether the author is in the wrong depends on whether the breakup was justified given the emotional weight of the issue. If the comment was a deal-breaker for him, maybe not. But if he didn't address it properly and just left, that might be where the fault lies. It's a bit of a grey area, but considering the emotional impact and the fact that he felt attacked, maybe he's not in the wrong. But others might argue that the breakup was overreacting. Hmm.\n"
