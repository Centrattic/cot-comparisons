Specifically trampolining. I have am was a high level national athlete. I have competed at tons of national level competitions and have even competed at quite a few international competitions representing Team Canada. At my peak I was trainning at the trampoline gym 6 times a week, and all my training added up to nearly 30 hours a week on top of high school. Near the end of my career I was even getting funding to continue my sport. Eventually I had to quit because of a head injury, but this was still a huge part of my life and I was immensely proud of it. \n\nMy girlfriend and I met a few months after I stopped competing, and she's heard quite a bit about my sport and always thought it was quite cool. She played volleyball in high school and had played on something rep volleyball teams. Nothing too crazy but I still thought it was pretty cool.\n\nThe other day we were discussing sports, and she was telling me how she had wished she played more volleyball and pursued it further. I told her that it was a great feeling to be really good at something and really enjoy it. I told her that it was a lot of work but it felt great to be a top level athlete at a sport. Queue the following conversation:\n\nHer: Yeah, well it's a little different isn't it?\n\nMe: What do you mean?\n\nHer: I mean you were good, but trampolining isn't a real sport.\n\nMe: How do you figure that? I was literally training as much as I went to school and Canada has arguably the most competitive trampolining scene in the world.\n\nHer: Well there's pretty much no one that does that sport. It's not hard to get to a high level, if you played a real sport like soccer you never would've been that good.\n\nI dumped her on the spot. That sport had such a huge impact on who I am today. I dedicated thousands of hours and even ended up getting paid some money to continue training. I was probably within the top 500 athletes worldwide. It felt like she was attacking who I am.\n\nHer friends all said that I'm an asshole for breaking up over something so small. This truly hurt, and it's a sentiment I received from people my whole life. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that he's a former high-level trampolining athlete who put in a lot of time and effort. His girlfriend made fun of his sport by saying it's not a real sport, comparing it to something like soccer. He took it really personally and dumped her on the spot. Now, people are saying he was too harsh, but he feels like it's a big deal.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. Trampolining is a recognized sport with national and international competitions, so calling it \"not a real sport\" is a bit dismissive. The guy's dedication is genuine, and it's a big part of his identity. The girl's comments might have been a joke or meant to be lighthearted, but she didn't realize how much it hurt him. \n\nOn the other hand, breaking up over a single comment, even if it's about something important, might be seen as overreacting. Relationships usually require working through conflicts, not ending them over one disagreement. But if the comment was a deal-breaker for him because it attacked his identity, maybe it's valid. Also, her friends said he was an asshole, implying that the issue was trivial. \n\nI need to think about how significant the issue is. If the girlfriend had a pattern of belittling his passions, it might be different, but this is a one-time comment. However, for someone who's deeply invested in their sport, this could feel like a personal attack. But reacting by breaking up immediately without discussion could be seen as extreme. \n\nSo, is he wrong? If the comment was a genuine misunderstanding and he didn't give her a chance to explain, then maybe he's in the wrong. But if it was a clear dismissal of his hard work and identity, then maybe he's justified. The key is whether the reaction was proportionate. Breaking up over a joke might be disproportionate, but if it's a fundamental disrespect, maybe not. I'm leaning towards B (not in the wrong) because the comment was about his core identity and dedication, which is a big deal. But others might see it as too small an issue. Hmm.\n"
