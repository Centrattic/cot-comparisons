Specifically trampolining. I have am was a high level national athlete. I have competed at tons of national level competitions and have even competed at quite a few international competitions representing Team Canada. At my peak I was trainning at the trampoline gym 6 times a week, and all my training added up to nearly 30 hours a week on top of high school. Near the end of my career I was even getting funding to continue my sport. Eventually I had to quit because of a head injury, but this was still a huge part of my life and I was immensely proud of it. \n\nMy girlfriend and I met a few months after I stopped competing, and she's heard quite a bit about my sport and always thought it was quite cool. She played volleyball in high school and had played on something rep volleyball teams. Nothing too crazy but I still thought it was pretty cool.\n\nThe other day we were discussing sports, and she was telling me how she had wished she played more volleyball and pursued it further. I told her that it was a great feeling to be really good at something and really enjoy it. I told her that it was a lot of work but it felt great to be a top level athlete at a sport. Queue the following conversation:\n\nHer: Yeah, well it's a little different isn't it?\n\nMe: What do you mean?\n\nHer: I mean you were good, but trampolining isn't a real sport.\n\nMe: How do you figure that? I was literally training as much as I went to school and Canada has arguably the most competitive trampolining scene in the world.\n\nHer: Well there's pretty much no one that does that sport. It's not hard to get to a high level, if you played a real sport like soccer you never would've been that good.\n\nI dumped her on the spot. That sport had such a huge impact on who I am today. I dedicated thousands of hours and even ended up getting paid some money to continue training. I was probably within the top 500 athletes worldwide. It felt like she was attacking who I am.\n\nHer friends all said that I'm an asshole for breaking up over something so small. This truly hurt, and it's a sentiment I received from people my whole life. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA post is in the wrong for breaking up with his girlfriend because she made fun of his sport. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The author was a high-level trampoline gymnast, dedicating 12 years and a lot of time and effort. After he quit due to injury, he met his girlfriend. She later makes a comment that trampolining isn't a real sport and implies it's easier than sports like soccer. He takes this as a personal attack on his dedication and identity, so he breaks up with her. Her friends think he's an asshole for overreacting.\n\nThe key points here are the value of the sport to the author's identity, the girlfriend's comment being dismissive, and the immediate breakup. The author felt that his hard work and achievements were belittled. The girlfriend's friends and others might see it as a minor issue, but for the author, it was a significant part of his self-worth.\n\nNow, considering if he's in the wrong. Relationships require mutual respect and understanding. If she mocked something he's passionate about, that's a problem. However, breaking up over a single comment, even if hurtful, might be seen as extreme by some. But others might argue that if you don't value each other's passions, there's a deeper issue. The girlfriend's comment could be seen as invalidating his efforts, which is disrespectful. The author might feel that if she can't respect his background, they're incompatible. \n\nOn the other hand, maybe the girlfriend was just expressing her opinion, not intending to attack his identity. But in the context of their conversation about sports, her comment could be interpreted as a jab. The author's reaction is immediate and final, which might be seen as overreacting, but if it's about respect for his identity, some might support his decision. \n\nIt's a tough call. The answer depends on whether the comment was a genuine attack or a misunderstanding. If the girlfriend had a pattern of disrespect, the breakup makes sense. If it was a one-time joke taken the wrong way, maybe he overreacted. But given the context, the author's dedication, and the personal significance of the sport, many might side with him. So, probably the author is not in the wrong.\n"
