Specifically trampolining. I have am was a high level national athlete. I have competed at tons of national level competitions and have even competed at quite a few international competitions representing Team Canada. At my peak I was trainning at the trampoline gym 6 times a week, and all my training added up to nearly 30 hours a week on top of high school. Near the end of my career I was even getting funding to continue my sport. Eventually I had to quit because of a head injury, but this was still a huge part of my life and I was immensely proud of it. \n\nMy girlfriend and I met a few months after I stopped competing, and she's heard quite a bit about my sport and always thought it was quite cool. She played volleyball in high school and had played on something rep volleyball teams. Nothing too crazy but I still thought it was pretty cool.\n\nThe other day we were discussing sports, and she was telling me how she had wished she played more volleyball and pursued it further. I told her that it was a great feeling to be really good at something and really enjoy it. I told her that it was a lot of work but it felt great to be a top level athlete at a sport. Queue the following conversation:\n\nHer: Yeah, well it's a little different isn't it?\n\nMe: What do you mean?\n\nHer: I mean you were good, but trampolining isn't a real sport.\n\nMe: How do you figure that? I was literally training as much as I went to school and Canada has arguably the most competitive trampolining scene in the world.\n\nHer: Well there's pretty much no one that does that sport. It's not hard to get to a high level, if you played a real sport like soccer you never would've been that good.\n\nI dumped her on the spot. That sport had such a huge impact on who I am today. I dedicated thousands of hours and even ended up getting paid some money to continue training. I was probably within the top 500 athletes worldwide. It felt like she was attacking who I am.\n\nHer friends all said that I'm an asshole for breaking up over something so small. This truly hurt, and it's a sentiment I received from people my whole life. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here.\n\nFirst, the situation: The author is a former high-level trampolining athlete who dedicated 12 years to the sport. He met his girlfriend after he stopped competing. She made a comment downplaying his sport, saying it's not a real sport and implying it's easier than something like soccer. He broke up with her over this. Now, people are saying he's an asshole for doing so over something \"small.\"\n\nThe question is whether he's wrong. The user thinks he is, but wants my opinion.\n\nSo, the key points here. The girlfriend's comment was hurtful and dismissive. She compared his dedication and achievements to something else, which he took as an attack. The author saw his identity tied to his sport and felt disrespected. But is breaking up over a single comment too harsh?\n\nOn one hand, trampolining is a recognized Olympic sport, so maybe she was wrong to call it not a real sport. But does that justify a breakup? Relationships require tolerance for each other's passions. If someone makes a dismissive comment about your significant life achievement, that's a red flag. But is it a dealbreaker?\n\nAlso, the timing matters. They had been talking about sports, and she might have been trying to relate but phrased it poorly. The author's reaction was immediate\u2014dumping her on the spot. That suggests he didn't give her a chance to explain or apologize. Maybe she didn't realize how much it would hurt him.\n\nBut the fact that she made such a comment, despite knowing his dedication, does show a lack of respect. People in relationships should be supportive of each other's passions. If she can't do that, then maybe the relationship wasn't healthy.\n\nHowever, reacting with a breakup might be overreacting. Maybe he could have addressed it calmly, discussed his feelings, and set boundaries. Instead, he acted impulsively. But given the emotional weight of his dedication, maybe her comment was a dealbreaker for him.\n\nSo, is he in the wrong? It's a tough call. The breakup might be justified if the comment revealed a fundamental disrespect for his identity. But the immediate action without communication could be seen as harsh. The people around him said he's an asshole, but maybe they don't understand the depth of his feelings.\n\nIn the end, it's about whether the comment was a legitimate reason to end the relationship. If the comment was a genuine disrespect and he felt it was a dealbreaker, then maybe he's not in the wrong. But if it was a minor issue, then yes. I think the comment was significant enough because it attacked his core identity, so maybe he's not in the wrong. But others might see it as overreacting. Hmm.\n"
