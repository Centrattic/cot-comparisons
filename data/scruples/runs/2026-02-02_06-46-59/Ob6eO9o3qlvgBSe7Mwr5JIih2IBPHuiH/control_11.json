Specifically trampolining. I have am was a high level national athlete. I have competed at tons of national level competitions and have even competed at quite a few international competitions representing Team Canada. At my peak I was trainning at the trampoline gym 6 times a week, and all my training added up to nearly 30 hours a week on top of high school. Near the end of my career I was even getting funding to continue my sport. Eventually I had to quit because of a head injury, but this was still a huge part of my life and I was immensely proud of it. \n\nMy girlfriend and I met a few months after I stopped competing, and she's heard quite a bit about my sport and always thought it was quite cool. She played volleyball in high school and had played on something rep volleyball teams. Nothing too crazy but I still thought it was pretty cool.\n\nThe other day we were discussing sports, and she was telling me how she had wished she played more volleyball and pursued it further. I told her that it was a great feeling to be really good at something and really enjoy it. I told her that it was a lot of work but it felt great to be a top level athlete at a sport. Queue the following conversation:\n\nHer: Yeah, well it's a little different isn't it?\n\nMe: What do you mean?\n\nHer: I mean you were good, but trampolining isn't a real sport.\n\nMe: How do you figure that? I was literally training as much as I went to school and Canada has arguably the most competitive trampolining scene in the world.\n\nHer: Well there's pretty much no one that does that sport. It's not hard to get to a high level, if you played a real sport like soccer you never would've been that good.\n\nI dumped her on the spot. That sport had such a huge impact on who I am today. I dedicated thousands of hours and even ended up getting paid some money to continue training. I was probably within the top 500 athletes worldwide. It felt like she was attacking who I am.\n\nHer friends all said that I'm an asshole for breaking up over something so small. This truly hurt, and it's a sentiment I received from people my whole life. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the \"Am I the Asshole\" (AITA) post is in the wrong for breaking up with their girlfriend over her comments about trampolining not being a real sport.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The author dedicated 12 years to trampolining, achieved a high level as a national athlete, and was even getting funding. Then they met their girlfriend after they stopped competing. The girlfriend played volleyball in high school but not at a competitive level. During a conversation about sports, the girlfriend says trampolining isn't a real sport, implying it's less valid than, say, soccer. The author takes this personally and dumps her on the spot. The girlfriend's friends think the author is an asshole for breaking up over something small, and the author is seeking validation.\n\nNow, to determine if the author is in the wrong. Breaking up over a single comment can seem drastic. The key points are: the girlfriend made a dismissive comment about the author's sport, which was a significant part of their identity. The author felt attacked, but is breaking up an overreaction?\n\nTrampolining is an Olympic sport, so it's recognized as a real sport. However, some people might not see it that way, possibly due to lack of awareness. The girlfriend's comment could be seen as dismissive, which might be hurtful. But is that enough to justify ending a relationship?\n\nThe author's reaction was immediate. They didn't discuss the issue or give the girlfriend a chance to explain or apologize. The girlfriend's friends think it's too small an issue. The author's perspective is that the comment attacked their identity and dedication. But others might argue that the comment was a personal slight but not a dealbreaker.\n\nFactors to consider: the importance of the sport to the author's identity, the context of the relationship (how long they were together), and whether the comment was part of a pattern of disrespect. The post doesn't mention prior issues, just this one incident. The girlfriend's comment was a judgment about the sport, which could be seen as invalidating the author's efforts.\n\nHowever, breaking up over a single joke or comment, even if hurtful, can be seen as overreacting. Relationships require communication and understanding. If the author felt deeply hurt, maybe they should have discussed it instead of ending things abruptly. The girlfriend's friends' opinion that it's too small a reason might be valid. On the other hand, if the comment hit a nerve about the author's self-worth tied to their sport, it's understandable but perhaps not justified.\n\nIn AITA scenarios, the community often looks at whether the action was reasonable. If the comment was a dealbreaker and part of a larger pattern, maybe not. But as a one-off, it's more likely the author overreacted. So the answer would be A (author is in the wrong) because the reaction seems disproportionate without further discussion.\n"
