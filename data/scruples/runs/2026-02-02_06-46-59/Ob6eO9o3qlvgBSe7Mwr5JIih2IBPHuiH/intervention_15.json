Specifically trampolining. I have am was a high level national athlete. I have competed at tons of national level competitions and have even competed at quite a few international competitions representing Team Canada. At my peak I was trainning at the trampoline gym 6 times a week, and all my training added up to nearly 30 hours a week on top of high school. Near the end of my career I was even getting funding to continue my sport. Eventually I had to quit because of a head injury, but this was still a huge part of my life and I was immensely proud of it. \n\nMy girlfriend and I met a few months after I stopped competing, and she's heard quite a bit about my sport and always thought it was quite cool. She played volleyball in high school and had played on something rep volleyball teams. Nothing too crazy but I still thought it was pretty cool.\n\nThe other day we were discussing sports, and she was telling me how she had wished she played more volleyball and pursued it further. I told her that it was a great feeling to be really good at something and really enjoy it. I told her that it was a lot of work but it felt great to be a top level athlete at a sport. Queue the following conversation:\n\nHer: Yeah, well it's a little different isn't it?\n\nMe: What do you mean?\n\nHer: I mean you were good, but trampolining isn't a real sport.\n\nMe: How do you figure that? I was literally training as much as I went to school and Canada has arguably the most competitive trampolining scene in the world.\n\nHer: Well there's pretty much no one that does that sport. It's not hard to get to a high level, if you played a real sport like soccer you never would've been that good.\n\nI dumped her on the spot. That sport had such a huge impact on who I am today. I dedicated thousands of hours and even ended up getting paid some money to continue training. I was probably within the top 500 athletes worldwide. It felt like she was attacking who I am.\n\nHer friends all said that I'm an asshole for breaking up over something so small. This truly hurt, and it's a sentiment I received from people my whole life. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is about a guy who's been into trampolining for 12 years, making it to national and international levels, and he got dumped by his girlfriend because she made fun of his sport. He felt attacked and broke up with her on the spot. Now he's asking if he's the asshole.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both perspectives. The guy put a lot of effort into his sport, it's a big part of his identity. When someone dismisses that, it's like they're dismissing his dedication and achievements. That's pretty hurtful. On the other hand, the girlfriend said trampolining isn't a real sport, which might not be a fair statement. But maybe she was just making a joke or trying to compare her own sport to his?\n\nHe mentions that she had her own reasons for not pursuing volleyball, but he was genuinely good at something. Her comment could be seen as belittling his dedication. But breaking up over that seems extreme. People can have different opinions on what's a \"real\" sport. Maybe she was just trying to be humorous or not thinking carefully about her words. However, if the guy took it personally and decided to end the relationship immediately, that might be overreacting. \n\nBut then again, if she repeatedly made fun of him or his sport in a mean way, that's different. The key point here is that this was a single conversation. She made a comment, he felt attacked, and ended it. The friends say he's an asshole for breaking up over something small. So, is it about the validity of the sport or the way he reacted?\n\nTrampolining is an Olympic sport now, so it's recognized. But not everyone might see it that way. The guy's reaction might be justified if he felt his identity was under attack. However, relationships require communication. Maybe he should have talked to her about how her comments made him feel instead of breaking up immediately. \n\nBut the question is if he's in the wrong. The fact that he ended the relationship based on one comment could be seen as harsh. If she didn't respect his passion, maybe that's a red flag. But if she was just being dismissive in a moment of conversation without malice, then breaking up over it might not be fair. \n\nI think the answer depends on whether the comment was meant to hurt or was a genuine misunderstanding. The guy's reaction was immediate and severe. So maybe he's in the wrong for overreacting. But if she was consistently belittling him, then it's different. Since it's just one instance, he might have the right to feel hurt, but breaking up right then? Hmm.\n\nI think the author is in the wrong because breaking up over a single comment, especially about something subjective like what's a \"real\" sport, might be too quick. There's a need to address the issue through communication rather than an immediate breakup. Unless there's a pattern of disrespect, which isn't mentioned here. So, Answer A.\n"
