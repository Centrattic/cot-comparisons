She\u2019s an amazing, intelligent woman and she is my best friend. I love her to death and always want to support her in everything she does but I\u2019m struggling to do so now.\n\nMy wife works in the biomedical field, conducting research on venomous animals and how humans can use venom to cure and treat a myriad of health issues.  This means she works directly with several species of very dangerous animals. She\u2019s very passionate about her work and worked hard to get where she is today. \n\nI have always been weary of her job because it does, of course, pose a serious risk to her. But like I said I always wanted to support her and support her passions so I never really objected or made an issue of it. I may have mentioned in passing how her job makes me uneasy, but I never asked her to give it up.\n\nHowever, the issue came to a head this past year. She was bitten by a Gaboon viper (if you don\u2019t know what that is, look it up; extremely venomous snake).  She almost died and had to be rushed to the hospital. Luckily the facility she works at has antivenom on hand for these scenarios but it was still very frightening. It took her a long time to recover, yet as soon as she was fit to work again she went back to work.\n\nI have since been sick with worry every single time she goes to work. I can\u2019t sit back and pretend her work is risk-free anymore and it has caused a huge rift between us. I\u2019m constantly stressed about her getting hurt or even dying because of her job.\n\nI have asked her to stop working with venomous animals for the sake of her health. She has argued that this is her passion and likens her work to that of a police officer or firefighter; she accepts the risks of the job because she can save lives with her research. I agree with the sentiment but simply can\u2019t accept that she works in a dangerous field. I would feel the same way  if she was a police officer or firefighter.\n\nWe have had many fights about this and have hit a wall. She is not budging and neither am I. She claims that it is unfair and asshole-ish of me to ask her to give up her dream career, though she does understand my concerns.\n\nI don\u2019t know what to do or if I\u2019m being irrational so I need some help and outside opinions. Am I the jerk here? I fear that her job will be the death of her.\n\nAITA???\n\n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author (the husband) is in the wrong for wanting his wife to give up her dangerous job. The scenario is that the wife works with venomous animals, has been bitten and almost died, and the husband is now pushing her to stop. She sees it as her dream job and is passionate about her work, even comparing it to risky professions like police or firefighters.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both perspectives. The husband is clearly worried about his wife's safety and well-being. His concerns are valid because the job is dangerous, and he's experienced a traumatic event where she was almost killed. It's natural for someone to want to protect their partner, especially after such an incident. His intention is to keep her safe, which is a genuine and caring motive.\n\nOn the other hand, the wife has a passion for her work and her career is important to her. She's made a choice to pursue a field she's passionate about, and she's accepted the risks involved. Her argument is that her job can save lives through research, which adds a layer of purpose beyond just personal fulfillment. She might feel that her husband is dismissing her autonomy and her choice to take on these risks.\n\nNow, considering the question of who's in the wrong. The husband is not forcing her to quit; he's expressing his concerns and asking her to consider it. However, if she's unwilling to change her career, is it fair for him to insist? There's a balance between respecting her autonomy and his valid safety concerns. If the husband is pressuring her to give up her career without her consent, that could be seen as controlling, even if his motives are good. But if he's just voicing his fears and not using coercion, then it's more about differing values and how to navigate them in a relationship.\n\nThe key points here are consent, autonomy, and mutual respect. The husband's actions are driven by love and concern, but they also need to respect her agency. The wife's refusal to leave her job is her right, as she's the one taking the risks. The husband's role is to support her while addressing his fears, perhaps through other means like safety measures or counseling, rather than insisting she quit.\n\nIn relationships, compromise is essential. The husband might need to accept that she's choosing to take on these risks, while the wife might need to acknowledge his fears and find ways to reassure him without compromising her career. If the husband's demands are overstepping and infringing on her autonomy, then he might be in the wrong. However, if he's seeking a solution that respects her choice but addresses his anxiety, then it's a matter of communication.\n\nSo, considering all that, the answer might hinge on whether the husband is being controlling or if he's genuinely trying to navigate his fears while respecting her decisions. Since the husband is asking for Reddit's opinion and is conflicted, it shows he's aware of the tension between his love and her autonomy. The initial assessment was that the author is in the wrong, but after deeper analysis, it's a nuanced situation where both have valid points. However, the husband's desire to force her to quit despite her clear stance on her career might be the issue. But if he's not forcing her and just expressing his feelings, then it's more about differing values. The question is whether he's in the wrong for wanting her to give it up, not necessarily for expressing his concerns. So the answer could be A (Yes) because he's essentially asking her to sacrifice her dreams and autonomy for his comfort, which could be seen as wrong. But if he's not forcing her and just sharing his feelings, then maybe not. The line between concern and control is thin here. Given the wife's stance and the husband's push for her to quit, even if she's not budging, it's a conflict where the husband's actions might be seen as overstepping. Therefore, the answer might be A.\n"
