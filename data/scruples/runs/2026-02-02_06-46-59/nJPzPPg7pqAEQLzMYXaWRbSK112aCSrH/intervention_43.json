She\u2019s an amazing, intelligent woman and she is my best friend. I love her to death and always want to support her in everything she does but I\u2019m struggling to do so now.\n\nMy wife works in the biomedical field, conducting research on venomous animals and how humans can use venom to cure and treat a myriad of health issues.  This means she works directly with several species of very dangerous animals. She\u2019s very passionate about her work and worked hard to get where she is today. \n\nI have always been weary of her job because it does, of course, pose a serious risk to her. But like I said I always wanted to support her and support her passions so I never really objected or made an issue of it. I may have mentioned in passing how her job makes me uneasy, but I never asked her to give it up.\n\nHowever, the issue came to a head this past year. She was bitten by a Gaboon viper (if you don\u2019t know what that is, look it up; extremely venomous snake).  She almost died and had to be rushed to the hospital. Luckily the facility she works at has antivenom on hand for these scenarios but it was still very frightening. It took her a long time to recover, yet as soon as she was fit to work again she went back to work.\n\nI have since been sick with worry every single time she goes to work. I can\u2019t sit back and pretend her work is risk-free anymore and it has caused a huge rift between us. I\u2019m constantly stressed about her getting hurt or even dying because of her job.\n\nI have asked her to stop working with venomous animals for the sake of her health. She has argued that this is her passion and likens her work to that of a police officer or firefighter; she accepts the risks of the job because she can save lives with her research. I agree with the sentiment but simply can\u2019t accept that she works in a dangerous field. I would feel the same way  if she was a police officer or firefighter.\n\nWe have had many fights about this and have hit a wall. She is not budging and neither am I. She claims that it is unfair and asshole-ish of me to ask her to give up her dream career, though she does understand my concerns.\n\nI don\u2019t know what to do or if I\u2019m being irrational so I need some help and outside opinions. Am I the jerk here? I fear that her job will be the death of her.\n\nAITA???\n\n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that the husband is asking if he's the asshole for wanting his wife to quit her dangerous job. The wife works with venomous animals in biomedical research, which is risky. She got bitten by a Gaboon viper, almost died, but recovered and went back to work. The husband is scared and wants her to stop, but she's standing her ground.\n\nFirst, I need to consider their positions. The husband's concern is about her safety. He loves her and is worried about her getting hurt or dying. That's a valid emotion. On the other hand, the wife is passionate about her career, which is important for her personal fulfillment and contributing to science. She might feel that her husband is trying to control her career choices, which could be a problem for her autonomy.\n\nNow, the question is whether the husband is in the wrong. The key points here are about mutual respect and communication in a relationship. The husband has expressed his concerns, and she's not budging. But is it fair for him to ask her to give up her career? Well, jobs in high-risk fields like police or firefighting are similar in that they accept risks for the greater good. The wife is drawing that comparison. However, the husband says he would feel the same if she were in those roles, but maybe that's not entirely accurate. Those jobs often have more structured safety measures and team support. Her job might be more isolated in terms of risk.\n\nBut then again, the husband's fear is real and justified, given her near-death experience. The emotional toll on him is significant. However, in a marriage, there's a balance between supporting each other's passions and respecting each other's boundaries. If he's not willing to accept the risk and it's causing rifts, maybe they need to find a compromise. For example, could she work in a different role at the same institution that's safer but still allows her to contribute to the field? Or maybe she finds another way to continue her research without direct exposure to dangerous animals.\n\nThe husband's stance might come across as controlling, especially if he's not open to finding alternative solutions. But his concern for her safety is also valid. The problem is that he's not budging, and she's not either. The question is whether his desire for her to quit is reasonable. Since the wife is adult and capable of making her own decisions, as long as she's fully aware of the risks and has made an informed choice, maybe the husband shouldn't have the authority to demand she quit. However, he has the right to express his fears and hopes. But if he's pressuring her to leave a job she's passionate about without considering her perspective, that could be seen as inconsiderate.\n\nOn the other hand, if the job is putting her life at serious risk repeatedly, the husband might have a point about wanting to protect her. But it's a matter of whether his approach is respectful. The key here is whether he's trying to control her career versus discussing and finding a middle ground. If he's not open to compromise, then he might be the one being unreasonable. The wife's argument that it's unfair and asshole-ish might have some merit if he's not acknowledging her autonomy and the importance of her work to her identity.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the husband's concern is valid, but his approach might be wrong if he's not allowing her to make her own choices and not being open to solutions that address both their concerns. Therefore, the answer might be A (the author is in the wrong) because he's not respecting her autonomy despite his valid concerns.\n"
