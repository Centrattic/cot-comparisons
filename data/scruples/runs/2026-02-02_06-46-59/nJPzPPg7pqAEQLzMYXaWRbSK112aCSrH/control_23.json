She\u2019s an amazing, intelligent woman and she is my best friend. I love her to death and always want to support her in everything she does but I\u2019m struggling to do so now.\n\nMy wife works in the biomedical field, conducting research on venomous animals and how humans can use venom to cure and treat a myriad of health issues.  This means she works directly with several species of very dangerous animals. She\u2019s very passionate about her work and worked hard to get where she is today. \n\nI have always been weary of her job because it does, of course, pose a serious risk to her. But like I said I always wanted to support her and support her passions so I never really objected or made an issue of it. I may have mentioned in passing how her job makes me uneasy, but I never asked her to give it up.\n\nHowever, the issue came to a head this past year. She was bitten by a Gaboon viper (if you don\u2019t know what that is, look it up; extremely venomous snake).  She almost died and had to be rushed to the hospital. Luckily the facility she works at has antivenom on hand for these scenarios but it was still very frightening. It took her a long time to recover, yet as soon as she was fit to work again she went back to work.\n\nI have since been sick with worry every single time she goes to work. I can\u2019t sit back and pretend her work is risk-free anymore and it has caused a huge rift between us. I\u2019m constantly stressed about her getting hurt or even dying because of her job.\n\nI have asked her to stop working with venomous animals for the sake of her health. She has argued that this is her passion and likens her work to that of a police officer or firefighter; she accepts the risks of the job because she can save lives with her research. I agree with the sentiment but simply can\u2019t accept that she works in a dangerous field. I would feel the same way  if she was a police officer or firefighter.\n\nWe have had many fights about this and have hit a wall. She is not budging and neither am I. She claims that it is unfair and asshole-ish of me to ask her to give up her dream career, though she does understand my concerns.\n\nI don\u2019t know what to do or if I\u2019m being irrational so I need some help and outside opinions. Am I the jerk here? I fear that her job will be the death of her.\n\nAITA???\n\n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's dive into this. The user is asking whether the author of the Reddit post is in the wrong for wanting his wife to give up her dangerous job. The situation is complex because it involves personal safety, passion, and marriage.\n\nFirst, the wife has a high-risk job in biomedical research with venomous animals. She's had a serious accident, which makes the husband really worried. He's not asking her to quit entirely but to stop working with the dangerous animals. He supports her passion but can't handle the stress anymore. On the other hand, she sees her work as important and comparable to law enforcement or firefighters who take risks for the greater good.\n\nSo, the key points here are consent and mutual respect. The husband didn't force her before, only after the incident. He's expressing his concerns, which are valid given the danger. But the wife has her own agency; she chose this career and feels it's important. The question is about whether his request is overstepping. \n\nIn a healthy relationship, both partners should respect each other's goals and safety. The husband is trying to protect her, which is understandable, but he can't make her quit. The wife also has the right to pursue her career despite the risks. The conflict here is about balancing personal safety with personal fulfillment. \n\nIt's possible neither is entirely wrong. The husband isn't in the wrong for expressing his fears, but he can't control her career choices. The wife is right to pursue her passion if she's aware of the risks. So, the answer might hinge on whether his request is a demand versus a discussion. If he's not forcing her but sharing his feelings, he's not wrong. But if he's pressuring her, maybe. The post says he's not budging, so it's a stalemate. \n\nConsidering all that, the answer is probably B (No, he's not in the wrong) because he's voicing his concerns, but the wife should have the autonomy. However, some might argue he's overstepping. But in terms of being in the wrong, he's not forcing her; he's just expressing his feelings. So, he's not the jerk here.\n"
