She\u2019s an amazing, intelligent woman and she is my best friend. I love her to death and always want to support her in everything she does but I\u2019m struggling to do so now.\n\nMy wife works in the biomedical field, conducting research on venomous animals and how humans can use venom to cure and treat a myriad of health issues.  This means she works directly with several species of very dangerous animals. She\u2019s very passionate about her work and worked hard to get where she is today. \n\nI have always been weary of her job because it does, of course, pose a serious risk to her. But like I said I always wanted to support her and support her passions so I never really objected or made an issue of it. I may have mentioned in passing how her job makes me uneasy, but I never asked her to give it up.\n\nHowever, the issue came to a head this past year. She was bitten by a Gaboon viper (if you don\u2019t know what that is, look it up; extremely venomous snake).  She almost died and had to be rushed to the hospital. Luckily the facility she works at has antivenom on hand for these scenarios but it was still very frightening. It took her a long time to recover, yet as soon as she was fit to work again she went back to work.\n\nI have since been sick with worry every single time she goes to work. I can\u2019t sit back and pretend her work is risk-free anymore and it has caused a huge rift between us. I\u2019m constantly stressed about her getting hurt or even dying because of her job.\n\nI have asked her to stop working with venomous animals for the sake of her health. She has argued that this is her passion and likens her work to that of a police officer or firefighter; she accepts the risks of the job because she can save lives with her research. I agree with the sentiment but simply can\u2019t accept that she works in a dangerous field. I would feel the same way  if she was a police officer or firefighter.\n\nWe have had many fights about this and have hit a wall. She is not budging and neither am I. She claims that it is unfair and asshole-ish of me to ask her to give up her dream career, though she does understand my concerns.\n\nI don\u2019t know what to do or if I\u2019m being irrational so I need some help and outside opinions. Am I the jerk here? I fear that her job will be the death of her.\n\nAITA???\n\n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for wanting his wife to give up her dream job because it's dangerous. The situation is that she works with venomous animals, had a serious accident, and he's worried about her safety.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the perspectives. The husband loves his wife and is deeply concerned about her safety. His fear is justified because she was almost killed at work. It's natural for someone in a relationship to want their partner safe. But on the other hand, the wife has a passion for her job, which is a significant part of her identity. She's in a field where she can contribute to saving lives through research. She didn't want to give up her job even after the accident, which shows her commitment.\n\nThe key points here are autonomy versus safety. The husband is asking her to change her career for his peace of mind, which could be seen as infringing on her personal freedom and ambitions. Even though he has valid concerns, the decision to continue working in a high-risk job is hers to make. It's important for spouses to support each other's dreams unless there's a direct harm to others. Here, the risk is to herself, so it's more about her personal choice.\n\nAlso, the husband never asked her to quit before, only after the incident. The wife is in a position where she can take precautions and knows the risks. The husband's stress is affecting their marriage, but that's a personal struggle he needs to manage. The wife is doing a job that serves a greater good, so forcing her to quit might not be fair.\n\nSo, the husband's intentions are good, but he's crossing a line by pressuring her to give up her career. The wife's autonomy and her right to pursue her passion are important. Therefore, the answer would be that the author is in the wrong (A).\n"
