She\u2019s an amazing, intelligent woman and she is my best friend. I love her to death and always want to support her in everything she does but I\u2019m struggling to do so now.\n\nMy wife works in the biomedical field, conducting research on venomous animals and how humans can use venom to cure and treat a myriad of health issues.  This means she works directly with several species of very dangerous animals. She\u2019s very passionate about her work and worked hard to get where she is today. \n\nI have always been weary of her job because it does, of course, pose a serious risk to her. But like I said I always wanted to support her and support her passions so I never really objected or made an issue of it. I may have mentioned in passing how her job makes me uneasy, but I never asked her to give it up.\n\nHowever, the issue came to a head this past year. She was bitten by a Gaboon viper (if you don\u2019t know what that is, look it up; extremely venomous snake).  She almost died and had to be rushed to the hospital. Luckily the facility she works at has antivenom on hand for these scenarios but it was still very frightening. It took her a long time to recover, yet as soon as she was fit to work again she went back to work.\n\nI have since been sick with worry every single time she goes to work. I can\u2019t sit back and pretend her work is risk-free anymore and it has caused a huge rift between us. I\u2019m constantly stressed about her getting hurt or even dying because of her job.\n\nI have asked her to stop working with venomous animals for the sake of her health. She has argued that this is her passion and likens her work to that of a police officer or firefighter; she accepts the risks of the job because she can save lives with her research. I agree with the sentiment but simply can\u2019t accept that she works in a dangerous field. I would feel the same way  if she was a police officer or firefighter.\n\nWe have had many fights about this and have hit a wall. She is not budging and neither am I. She claims that it is unfair and asshole-ish of me to ask her to give up her dream career, though she does understand my concerns.\n\nI don\u2019t know what to do or if I\u2019m being irrational so I need some help and outside opinions. Am I the jerk here? I fear that her job will be the death of her.\n\nAITA???\n\n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that the husband wants his wife to give up her dangerous job in biomedical research involving venomous animals. She was bitten by a snake and almost died, and he's really worried. They're having a big conflict over this.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The husband loves his wife and is concerned for her safety. He's not just being a nagging spouse; he's genuinely scared after she got injured. His motivation is to protect her, which is a natural instinct. On the other hand, the wife has worked hard to achieve her career, which is her passion. She's in a field that could save lives, and she's comparing her job to high-risk professions like firefighters, which are respected for their public service.\n\nNow, the question is whether the husband is in the wrong by asking her to quit. The key factors here might be consent, respect for autonomy, and the balance between concern for safety and personal freedom. The husband isn't forcing her but is expressing his feelings and concerns. However, the wife is making a choice to continue her job despite the risks. \n\nIn a healthy relationship, partners should respect each other's choices unless there's some form of coercion or manipulation. The husband is voicing his feelings but not necessarily trying to control her. However, if his concern is leading to constant conflict and making her feel pressured without considering her autonomy, that could be an issue. \n\nAnother angle is whether the husband's fear is rational. While the job is dangerous, she's already taken precautions (like the antivenom), and the field does have safety measures. The husband's anxiety is valid, but should that override her career choice? The wife has the right to make her own decisions about her career, even if it's risky. \n\nSo, the husband isn't in the wrong for being worried or for expressing his feelings. However, the way he's handling it\u2014refusing to back down and causing a rift\u2014might be problematic. But since the question is about being \"in the wrong,\" not about how they handle the conflict, it's more about whether his request is unreasonable. Since her job is her choice and she's aware of the risks, the husband's request to her to quit might be seen as overstepping, especially if he's not respecting her agency. But he's also acting from a place of love and fear. \n\nI think the answer hinges on whether the husband's request is a reasonable expression of concern or an infringement on her autonomy. Since the wife is making an informed choice and the husband isn't coercing her, he might not be in the wrong. But if he's persistently pressuring her against her will, that could be an issue. However, based on the information given, he's not forcing her; he's just expressing his feelings. So maybe he's not in the wrong (B), but there's nuance.\n"
