She\u2019s an amazing, intelligent woman and she is my best friend. I love her to death and always want to support her in everything she does but I\u2019m struggling to do so now.\n\nMy wife works in the biomedical field, conducting research on venomous animals and how humans can use venom to cure and treat a myriad of health issues.  This means she works directly with several species of very dangerous animals. She\u2019s very passionate about her work and worked hard to get where she is today. \n\nI have always been weary of her job because it does, of course, pose a serious risk to her. But like I said I always wanted to support her and support her passions so I never really objected or made an issue of it. I may have mentioned in passing how her job makes me uneasy, but I never asked her to give it up.\n\nHowever, the issue came to a head this past year. She was bitten by a Gaboon viper (if you don\u2019t know what that is, look it up; extremely venomous snake).  She almost died and had to be rushed to the hospital. Luckily the facility she works at has antivenom on hand for these scenarios but it was still very frightening. It took her a long time to recover, yet as soon as she was fit to work again she went back to work.\n\nI have since been sick with worry every single time she goes to work. I can\u2019t sit back and pretend her work is risk-free anymore and it has caused a huge rift between us. I\u2019m constantly stressed about her getting hurt or even dying because of her job.\n\nI have asked her to stop working with venomous animals for the sake of her health. She has argued that this is her passion and likens her work to that of a police officer or firefighter; she accepts the risks of the job because she can save lives with her research. I agree with the sentiment but simply can\u2019t accept that she works in a dangerous field. I would feel the same way  if she was a police officer or firefighter.\n\nWe have had many fights about this and have hit a wall. She is not budging and neither am I. She claims that it is unfair and asshole-ish of me to ask her to give up her dream career, though she does understand my concerns.\n\nI don\u2019t know what to do or if I\u2019m being irrational so I need some help and outside opinions. Am I the jerk here? I fear that her job will be the death of her.\n\nAITA???\n\n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user wants to know if the author of the Reddit post is in the wrong for asking his wife to quit her dangerous job.\n\nFirst, the wife works with venomous animals and got bitten by a Gaboon viper, which was life-threatening. The husband is really worried about her safety. He's been supportive but now, after the incident, he's asking her to stop. She's passionate about her work and compares it to jobs like police or firefighters, which have inherent risks. \n\nSo, the main question is whether the husband has the right to ask her to give up her job, even if it's dangerous. On one hand, he's concerned about her safety and their relationship is affected. On the other hand, she's pursuing her dream and has a right to choose her career, even with the risks involved.\n\nI need to consider both perspectives. The husband's fear is valid; he's experienced a traumatic event where she almost died. His concern for her well-being is natural. But he can't force her to quit. She's an adult, and she's accepted the risks of her job. Comparing it to other high-risk professions makes sense. The husband's request might be seen as controlling if he's not allowing her to make her own decisions. However, his intentions are protective. \n\nBut ultimately, the wife's autonomy is key. It's her life and career, and while he can express his fears and maybe try to find compromises, he can't demand she quit. So, the husband's position is understandable but he's overstepping by insisting she stop her job. Therefore, the author might be in the wrong because he's infringing on her personal choices, even if his intentions are good.\n"
