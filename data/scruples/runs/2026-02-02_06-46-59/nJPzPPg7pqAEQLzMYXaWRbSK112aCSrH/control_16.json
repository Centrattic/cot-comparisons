She\u2019s an amazing, intelligent woman and she is my best friend. I love her to death and always want to support her in everything she does but I\u2019m struggling to do so now.\n\nMy wife works in the biomedical field, conducting research on venomous animals and how humans can use venom to cure and treat a myriad of health issues.  This means she works directly with several species of very dangerous animals. She\u2019s very passionate about her work and worked hard to get where she is today. \n\nI have always been weary of her job because it does, of course, pose a serious risk to her. But like I said I always wanted to support her and support her passions so I never really objected or made an issue of it. I may have mentioned in passing how her job makes me uneasy, but I never asked her to give it up.\n\nHowever, the issue came to a head this past year. She was bitten by a Gaboon viper (if you don\u2019t know what that is, look it up; extremely venomous snake).  She almost died and had to be rushed to the hospital. Luckily the facility she works at has antivenom on hand for these scenarios but it was still very frightening. It took her a long time to recover, yet as soon as she was fit to work again she went back to work.\n\nI have since been sick with worry every single time she goes to work. I can\u2019t sit back and pretend her work is risk-free anymore and it has caused a huge rift between us. I\u2019m constantly stressed about her getting hurt or even dying because of her job.\n\nI have asked her to stop working with venomous animals for the sake of her health. She has argued that this is her passion and likens her work to that of a police officer or firefighter; she accepts the risks of the job because she can save lives with her research. I agree with the sentiment but simply can\u2019t accept that she works in a dangerous field. I would feel the same way  if she was a police officer or firefighter.\n\nWe have had many fights about this and have hit a wall. She is not budging and neither am I. She claims that it is unfair and asshole-ish of me to ask her to give up her dream career, though she does understand my concerns.\n\nI don\u2019t know what to do or if I\u2019m being irrational so I need some help and outside opinions. Am I the jerk here? I fear that her job will be the death of her.\n\nAITA???\n\n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's dive into this. The user is asking whether the husband is in the wrong for wanting his wife to quit her dangerous job. First, I need to understand both sides.\n\nThe wife has a passion for her job in biomedical research involving venomous animals. She's worked hard, and it's her dream. She's had a serious injury but still chose to return to work. She compares her job to high-risk professions like firefighters or police, which are respected for their risks.\n\nThe husband loves her and supports her, but after a near-death experience, he's terrified and can't stop worrying. He's asked her to stop working with venomous animals for her safety. He can't accept the risk anymore, which is causing a rift.\n\nNow, is he in the wrong? Well, he's expressing genuine concern for her safety. That's understandable. But she has the right to pursue her career, especially since she's aware of the risks and willing to accept them. Comparing it to a police officer or firefighter is valid because those jobs are also high-risk but society accepts them. So, does the husband have the right to ask her to quit? \n\nOn one hand, he's in a loving relationship, so his fear is valid. On the other hand, he can't control her career choices. She's an adult and capable of making her own decisions. The key point is whether his request is overstepping. He's not forcing her, but he's clearly pressuring her, which is causing conflict. The wife finds it unfair, which suggests that the husband's position might not be respecting her autonomy.\n\nSo, considering all that, the husband might be in the wrong because he's trying to impose his fears onto her decisions, even though he supports her in theory. The answer might be A (the author is in the wrong). But maybe there's a nuance here. Maybe if they had discussed alternatives, like changing roles within the same field to reduce risk, but the husband is demanding she quit entirely. That could be where the line is crossed. Since the wife is not budging and the husband is too, it's causing a rift. The husband's love and concern are genuine, but the way he's acting on it could be disrespectful of her autonomy. So, leaning towards A.\n"
