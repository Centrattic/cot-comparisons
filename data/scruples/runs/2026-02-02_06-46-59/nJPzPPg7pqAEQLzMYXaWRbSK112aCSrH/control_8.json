She\u2019s an amazing, intelligent woman and she is my best friend. I love her to death and always want to support her in everything she does but I\u2019m struggling to do so now.\n\nMy wife works in the biomedical field, conducting research on venomous animals and how humans can use venom to cure and treat a myriad of health issues.  This means she works directly with several species of very dangerous animals. She\u2019s very passionate about her work and worked hard to get where she is today. \n\nI have always been weary of her job because it does, of course, pose a serious risk to her. But like I said I always wanted to support her and support her passions so I never really objected or made an issue of it. I may have mentioned in passing how her job makes me uneasy, but I never asked her to give it up.\n\nHowever, the issue came to a head this past year. She was bitten by a Gaboon viper (if you don\u2019t know what that is, look it up; extremely venomous snake).  She almost died and had to be rushed to the hospital. Luckily the facility she works at has antivenom on hand for these scenarios but it was still very frightening. It took her a long time to recover, yet as soon as she was fit to work again she went back to work.\n\nI have since been sick with worry every single time she goes to work. I can\u2019t sit back and pretend her work is risk-free anymore and it has caused a huge rift between us. I\u2019m constantly stressed about her getting hurt or even dying because of her job.\n\nI have asked her to stop working with venomous animals for the sake of her health. She has argued that this is her passion and likens her work to that of a police officer or firefighter; she accepts the risks of the job because she can save lives with her research. I agree with the sentiment but simply can\u2019t accept that she works in a dangerous field. I would feel the same way  if she was a police officer or firefighter.\n\nWe have had many fights about this and have hit a wall. She is not budging and neither am I. She claims that it is unfair and asshole-ish of me to ask her to give up her dream career, though she does understand my concerns.\n\nI don\u2019t know what to do or if I\u2019m being irrational so I need some help and outside opinions. Am I the jerk here? I fear that her job will be the death of her.\n\nAITA???\n\n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The situation is that the husband wants his wife to quit her dangerous job working with venomous animals, despite her passion for it. He's upset because she had a near-death experience and is worried about her safety. The wife, on the other hand, sees her job as important and comparable to high-risk professions like police or firefighters.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both perspectives. The husband's main argument is his concern for her safety. He loves her and wants to protect her from harm. That's a natural feeling. However, the wife is pursuing a career she's worked hard for and finds meaningful. She accepts the risks because she believes in the importance of her work.\n\nNow, the question is whether the husband is in the wrong for asking her to quit. It's a tough balance between personal choice and safety. The husband isn't forcing her; he's voicing his concerns and making a request. The wife is choosing not to comply. The key here is consent and mutual respect. The husband isn't controlling her but is expressing his feelings, which is a valid part of a relationship. However, her autonomy in her career is also important. \n\nI should also think about the nature of the job. If it's a high-risk job that she's passionate about and she's aware of the dangers, her decision to continue might be her own choice. The husband's concern is valid, but pushing her to quit could be seen as undermining her autonomy. On the other hand, he's not using coercion, just expressing his feelings. So maybe he's not in the wrong because he's communicating his feelings, even if it's difficult. \n\nBut then again, if the wife is making an informed decision about her career, the husband's request might be seen as overstepping, unless there's a mutual agreement. The answer might depend on whether the husband is respecting her agency. If he's not forcing her but is just expressing his concerns, he might not be in the wrong. However, if he's pressuring her to quit despite her clear passion, that's where the conflict lies. The question is whether his request is reasonable given the risks. \n\nIn the end, the husband is in a tough spot. His love and concern are genuine, but so is her dedication to her work. The answer hinges on whether his request is infringing on her autonomy. Since he's not using coercion and is just expressing his feelings, he might not be in the wrong. However, others might argue that he should respect her choice. But given the scenario as presented, the husband's position might be seen as not in the wrong because he's advocating for her safety, which is a valid concern. However, there's a line between concern and control. It's a nuanced situation, but the answer likely is B (No).\n"
