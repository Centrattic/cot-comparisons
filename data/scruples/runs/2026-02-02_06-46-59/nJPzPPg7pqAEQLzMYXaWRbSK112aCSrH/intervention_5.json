She\u2019s an amazing, intelligent woman and she is my best friend. I love her to death and always want to support her in everything she does but I\u2019m struggling to do so now.\n\nMy wife works in the biomedical field, conducting research on venomous animals and how humans can use venom to cure and treat a myriad of health issues.  This means she works directly with several species of very dangerous animals. She\u2019s very passionate about her work and worked hard to get where she is today. \n\nI have always been weary of her job because it does, of course, pose a serious risk to her. But like I said I always wanted to support her and support her passions so I never really objected or made an issue of it. I may have mentioned in passing how her job makes me uneasy, but I never asked her to give it up.\n\nHowever, the issue came to a head this past year. She was bitten by a Gaboon viper (if you don\u2019t know what that is, look it up; extremely venomous snake).  She almost died and had to be rushed to the hospital. Luckily the facility she works at has antivenom on hand for these scenarios but it was still very frightening. It took her a long time to recover, yet as soon as she was fit to work again she went back to work.\n\nI have since been sick with worry every single time she goes to work. I can\u2019t sit back and pretend her work is risk-free anymore and it has caused a huge rift between us. I\u2019m constantly stressed about her getting hurt or even dying because of her job.\n\nI have asked her to stop working with venomous animals for the sake of her health. She has argued that this is her passion and likens her work to that of a police officer or firefighter; she accepts the risks of the job because she can save lives with her research. I agree with the sentiment but simply can\u2019t accept that she works in a dangerous field. I would feel the same way  if she was a police officer or firefighter.\n\nWe have had many fights about this and have hit a wall. She is not budging and neither am I. She claims that it is unfair and asshole-ish of me to ask her to give up her dream career, though she does understand my concerns.\n\nI don\u2019t know what to do or if I\u2019m being irrational so I need some help and outside opinions. Am I the jerk here? I fear that her job will be the death of her.\n\nAITA???\n\n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's look at this situation. The author is married to his wife for a long time, and she's in a dangerous job researching venomous animals. He supports her passion but now feels scared after she was bitten and almost died. He wants her to quit, but she won't. The question is whether he's in the wrong.\n\nFirst, the wife has a legitimate passion and career. She's worked hard to get there and her job can save lives. The author is concerned for her safety, which is understandable. But is it right to ask her to give up her dream job? The wife's argument is that she accepts the risks, like someone in law enforcement might. The author doesn't want her to take those risks, even if she's willing to. \n\nMarriage involves compromise, but does one partner have the right to demand another to abandon their career? The author is trying to protect her, but at what point does that become controlling? The wife's autonomy is a factor here. If she's making an informed choice about her job, even with the risks, the author's request might be infringing on her independence. \n\nOn the other hand, the author's fear is real and after such a traumatic event. The emotional toll it's taking on him is significant. However, their disagreement seems to be a matter of differing values. The key is whether the author is being reasonable. While his concern is valid, pushing her to quit her job because he can't handle the stress might not be fair. He's asking her to sacrifice her career for his peace of mind, which could be seen as the wrong approach.\n\nIn a healthy relationship, both partners should support each other's dreams unless there's a compelling reason to intervene. Here, the wife's job is her passion and she's aware of the risks. The author's fear is causing a rift, but that's her choice to accept the job. So, the author might be in the wrong for not respecting her autonomy and career choices.\n"
