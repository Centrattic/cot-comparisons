She\u2019s an amazing, intelligent woman and she is my best friend. I love her to death and always want to support her in everything she does but I\u2019m struggling to do so now.\n\nMy wife works in the biomedical field, conducting research on venomous animals and how humans can use venom to cure and treat a myriad of health issues.  This means she works directly with several species of very dangerous animals. She\u2019s very passionate about her work and worked hard to get where she is today. \n\nI have always been weary of her job because it does, of course, pose a serious risk to her. But like I said I always wanted to support her and support her passions so I never really objected or made an issue of it. I may have mentioned in passing how her job makes me uneasy, but I never asked her to give it up.\n\nHowever, the issue came to a head this past year. She was bitten by a Gaboon viper (if you don\u2019t know what that is, look it up; extremely venomous snake).  She almost died and had to be rushed to the hospital. Luckily the facility she works at has antivenom on hand for these scenarios but it was still very frightening. It took her a long time to recover, yet as soon as she was fit to work again she went back to work.\n\nI have since been sick with worry every single time she goes to work. I can\u2019t sit back and pretend her work is risk-free anymore and it has caused a huge rift between us. I\u2019m constantly stressed about her getting hurt or even dying because of her job.\n\nI have asked her to stop working with venomous animals for the sake of her health. She has argued that this is her passion and likens her work to that of a police officer or firefighter; she accepts the risks of the job because she can save lives with her research. I agree with the sentiment but simply can\u2019t accept that she works in a dangerous field. I would feel the same way  if she was a police officer or firefighter.\n\nWe have had many fights about this and have hit a wall. She is not budging and neither am I. She claims that it is unfair and asshole-ish of me to ask her to give up her dream career, though she does understand my concerns.\n\nI don\u2019t know what to do or if I\u2019m being irrational so I need some help and outside opinions. Am I the jerk here? I fear that her job will be the death of her.\n\nAITA???\n\n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's dive into this situation. The user is asking whether the author (the husband) is in the wrong for wanting his wife to give up her dangerous job. The wife works with venomous animals, which has led to a life-threatening incident. The husband now wants her to stop, but she's not willing, leading to conflict.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the husband's perspective. He's worried about her safety after she nearly died. His concern is valid; no one wants their spouse to be in a harmful situation. But is it his right to ask her to quit? That's the crux. He's expressing his feelings, which are understandable, but the wife has her own autonomy and passion. \n\nOn the other hand, the wife's job is her dream, and she's accepted the risks, similar to someone in a high-risk profession like a firefighter. The husband's argument is that he can't accept the risk, but he's using his feelings as a reason to control her career. That could be seen as overstepping, especially since he didn't object before the incident. \n\nBut there's the aspect of mutual respect in a relationship. The husband should support her choices unless it's a matter of immediate, life-threatening danger. However, he's already acknowledged the risks and supported her before. Now, post-incident, his stance is more rigid. Does that justify him asking her to quit? Maybe not. The wife has the right to make her own decisions about her career and risks, even if it's hard for her partner to handle. \n\nThe key point is whether the husband is in the wrong by not respecting her autonomy. Since he's not forcing her and she's still making the choice, but he's expressing his desire for her to leave the job, it's a bit of a gray area. However, the fact that he's causing a rift in their relationship by not accepting her decision might make him the one in the wrong. But if the risk is too high, maybe he's justified. \n\nI think the answer leans towards A (the husband is in the wrong) because he's imposing his fears onto her decision, even though he's not making her do anything. The wife's autonomy is important, and while his concern is valid, he's not in a position to dictate her career choices.\n"
