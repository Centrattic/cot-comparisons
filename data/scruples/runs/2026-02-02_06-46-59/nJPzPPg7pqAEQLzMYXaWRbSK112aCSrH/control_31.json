She\u2019s an amazing, intelligent woman and she is my best friend. I love her to death and always want to support her in everything she does but I\u2019m struggling to do so now.\n\nMy wife works in the biomedical field, conducting research on venomous animals and how humans can use venom to cure and treat a myriad of health issues.  This means she works directly with several species of very dangerous animals. She\u2019s very passionate about her work and worked hard to get where she is today. \n\nI have always been weary of her job because it does, of course, pose a serious risk to her. But like I said I always wanted to support her and support her passions so I never really objected or made an issue of it. I may have mentioned in passing how her job makes me uneasy, but I never asked her to give it up.\n\nHowever, the issue came to a head this past year. She was bitten by a Gaboon viper (if you don\u2019t know what that is, look it up; extremely venomous snake).  She almost died and had to be rushed to the hospital. Luckily the facility she works at has antivenom on hand for these scenarios but it was still very frightening. It took her a long time to recover, yet as soon as she was fit to work again she went back to work.\n\nI have since been sick with worry every single time she goes to work. I can\u2019t sit back and pretend her work is risk-free anymore and it has caused a huge rift between us. I\u2019m constantly stressed about her getting hurt or even dying because of her job.\n\nI have asked her to stop working with venomous animals for the sake of her health. She has argued that this is her passion and likens her work to that of a police officer or firefighter; she accepts the risks of the job because she can save lives with her research. I agree with the sentiment but simply can\u2019t accept that she works in a dangerous field. I would feel the same way  if she was a police officer or firefighter.\n\nWe have had many fights about this and have hit a wall. She is not budging and neither am I. She claims that it is unfair and asshole-ish of me to ask her to give up her dream career, though she does understand my concerns.\n\nI don\u2019t know what to do or if I\u2019m being irrational so I need some help and outside opinions. Am I the jerk here? I fear that her job will be the death of her.\n\nAITA???\n\n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the author of the Reddit post is in the wrong for wanting his wife to give up her dangerous job.\n\nFirst, I need to understand both sides. The husband loves his wife and is worried about her safety after she was bitten. He's stressed every time she goes to work. But she's passionate about her job in biomedical research with venomous animals. She's had a career she worked hard for, and even though it's risky, she sees it as similar to jobs like police or firefighters who also take risks. The husband agrees with the sentiment but can't accept the risk because of the potential loss.\n\nSo, is he in the wrong? Well, love and support in a relationship usually involve respecting each other's passions. The husband says he wants to support her but feels conflicted. He hasn't outright made her stop before, only after the incident. However, he's now asking her to change her job for his peace of mind. On the other hand, she's not a child; she's an adult making her own choices. Her job has risks, but she's aware and accepts them. The husband's concern is valid, but does his fear justify overriding her career? \n\nThere's a balance between caring for each other's well-being and respecting personal choices. If the husband is causing her to give up her passion due to his anxiety, that could be seen as being inconsiderate of her aspirations. But if her job is seriously life-threatening, maybe his concern is justified. However, the key point is whether he has the right to demand she quit. Since they've hit a wall and he's not budging, maybe he's overstepping by making the decision for her. The answer might hinge on whether the request is reasonable. Since the job is her choice and she's making an informed decision, the husband might be in the wrong by not supporting her choice despite his fears.\n"
