She\u2019s an amazing, intelligent woman and she is my best friend. I love her to death and always want to support her in everything she does but I\u2019m struggling to do so now.\n\nMy wife works in the biomedical field, conducting research on venomous animals and how humans can use venom to cure and treat a myriad of health issues.  This means she works directly with several species of very dangerous animals. She\u2019s very passionate about her work and worked hard to get where she is today. \n\nI have always been weary of her job because it does, of course, pose a serious risk to her. But like I said I always wanted to support her and support her passions so I never really objected or made an issue of it. I may have mentioned in passing how her job makes me uneasy, but I never asked her to give it up.\n\nHowever, the issue came to a head this past year. She was bitten by a Gaboon viper (if you don\u2019t know what that is, look it up; extremely venomous snake).  She almost died and had to be rushed to the hospital. Luckily the facility she works at has antivenom on hand for these scenarios but it was still very frightening. It took her a long time to recover, yet as soon as she was fit to work again she went back to work.\n\nI have since been sick with worry every single time she goes to work. I can\u2019t sit back and pretend her work is risk-free anymore and it has caused a huge rift between us. I\u2019m constantly stressed about her getting hurt or even dying because of her job.\n\nI have asked her to stop working with venomous animals for the sake of her health. She has argued that this is her passion and likens her work to that of a police officer or firefighter; she accepts the risks of the job because she can save lives with her research. I agree with the sentiment but simply can\u2019t accept that she works in a dangerous field. I would feel the same way  if she was a police officer or firefighter.\n\nWe have had many fights about this and have hit a wall. She is not budging and neither am I. She claims that it is unfair and asshole-ish of me to ask her to give up her dream career, though she does understand my concerns.\n\nI don\u2019t know what to do or if I\u2019m being irrational so I need some help and outside opinions. Am I the jerk here? I fear that her job will be the death of her.\n\nAITA???\n\n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author (the husband) is in the wrong for wanting his wife to give up her dangerous job. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The wife works with venomous animals in biomedical research, which is risky. She had a serious injury (Gaboon viper bite) and almost died. The husband is now really worried and wants her to stop working with these animals. The wife argues that it's her passion and compares it to high-risk jobs like police or firefighters. The husband can't accept the risk even though he agrees with her sentiment.\n\nSo, the question is whether he's in the wrong. Let me think about different angles. \n\nOn one hand, the husband is concerned for his wife's safety. It's natural for a spouse to want their partner to be safe. After a life-threatening incident, his fear and anxiety are valid. He's expressed his concerns, but now he's taking a stronger stance. But is it his place to dictate her career choices? That's a key point.\n\nOn the other hand, the wife has a career she's worked hard for and is passionate about. She's aware of the risks and has accepted them, similar to how someone in a high-risk profession does. The husband is essentially asking her to sacrifice her career for his peace of mind. That could be seen as controlling or not respecting her autonomy.\n\nMarriage involves compromise, but there's a difference between supporting each other and making demands. If the husband can't handle the stress and it's causing conflict, maybe he should explore ways to manage his anxiety rather than forcing her to quit. However, if the job genuinely endangers her life, the husband's concern is legitimate. But the wife might feel her independence is being threatened.\n\nAlso, considering the wife's willingness to take risks as part of her job, even with her passion, the husband's request might come across as dismissive of her personal goals and career. It's possible he's not the jerk, but perhaps he's approaching the situation in a way that's not respecting her agency.\n\nAnother angle: maybe they need to find a middle ground. The wife could take more precautions, but the husband is demanding she stop entirely. The husband might not realize he's overstepping. The wife's comparison to police officers is interesting because society generally respects their choice to take risks. So maybe the husband's stance is more about his own emotional response than the actual danger level.\n\nIn conclusion, while the husband's fear is understandable, he's in a position where he's asking his wife to give up her career for his well-being. That could be seen as not respecting her autonomy and choices, especially if she's already accepted the risks. So, the answer might lean towards A (the author is in the wrong) because he's not supporting her career choice despite her accepting the risks, which is a matter of personal autonomy. But there's a balance between safety and autonomy. However, the key point is whether he has the right to make that decision for her. Since she's an adult and the one taking the job, her autonomy is her right. The husband's fear is valid, but the way he's handling it might be the issue. So probably answer A.\n"
