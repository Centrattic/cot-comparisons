She\u2019s an amazing, intelligent woman and she is my best friend. I love her to death and always want to support her in everything she does but I\u2019m struggling to do so now.\n\nMy wife works in the biomedical field, conducting research on venomous animals and how humans can use venom to cure and treat a myriad of health issues.  This means she works directly with several species of very dangerous animals. She\u2019s very passionate about her work and worked hard to get where she is today. \n\nI have always been weary of her job because it does, of course, pose a serious risk to her. But like I said I always wanted to support her and support her passions so I never really objected or made an issue of it. I may have mentioned in passing how her job makes me uneasy, but I never asked her to give it up.\n\nHowever, the issue came to a head this past year. She was bitten by a Gaboon viper (if you don\u2019t know what that is, look it up; extremely venomous snake).  She almost died and had to be rushed to the hospital. Luckily the facility she works at has antivenom on hand for these scenarios but it was still very frightening. It took her a long time to recover, yet as soon as she was fit to work again she went back to work.\n\nI have since been sick with worry every single time she goes to work. I can\u2019t sit back and pretend her work is risk-free anymore and it has caused a huge rift between us. I\u2019m constantly stressed about her getting hurt or even dying because of her job.\n\nI have asked her to stop working with venomous animals for the sake of her health. She has argued that this is her passion and likens her work to that of a police officer or firefighter; she accepts the risks of the job because she can save lives with her research. I agree with the sentiment but simply can\u2019t accept that she works in a dangerous field. I would feel the same way  if she was a police officer or firefighter.\n\nWe have had many fights about this and have hit a wall. She is not budging and neither am I. She claims that it is unfair and asshole-ish of me to ask her to give up her dream career, though she does understand my concerns.\n\nI don\u2019t know what to do or if I\u2019m being irrational so I need some help and outside opinions. Am I the jerk here? I fear that her job will be the death of her.\n\nAITA???\n\n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA post is in the wrong for wanting his wife to quit her dangerous job. The wife works with venomous animals in biomedical research and had a near-death experience from a snake bite. The husband is worried about her safety, but she's passionate about her work and compares it to jobs like police or firefighters. They're in a conflict where neither is budging.\n\nFirst, I need to think about the key elements here. The husband's concern is valid because his wife has been in a life-threatening situation. His job does have inherent risks, similar to emergency responders. However, the husband is asking her to give up her career, which she's worked hard for and is passionate about. \n\nOn one hand, the husband's fear and anxiety are understandable. He loves her and doesn't want her to be in danger. On the other hand, the wife has a right to pursue her career, especially since others in high-risk professions are allowed to do so without being pressured to quit. The husband's request might be seen as overstepping because he's not facing the risks himself, unlike someone who's in the job by choice and with awareness of the dangers.\n\nBut maybe there's a middle ground. The husband could be trying to communicate his feelings without controlling her career choices. However, he's not allowing her to make that choice, which could be where he's wrong. The wife's autonomy is important, and her job contributes to science and saving lives. The husband's refusal to accept her decision despite her understanding his concerns might indicate that he's being controlling.\n\nAlternatively, the husband might feel it's his role to protect her. But in a healthy relationship, both partners should respect each other's autonomy, even if they disagree. The wife's job is her passion, and while dangerous, she's aware of the risks and has chosen it. The husband's insistence on her quitting could be seen as not respecting her agency.\n\nSo, considering all that, the answer might be A (the author is in the wrong) because he's not respecting his wife's career choice and autonomy, even though his concern is valid. The wife's job is her own decision, and he shouldn't dictate that for her, especially when others in similar roles aren't pressured the same way.\n"
