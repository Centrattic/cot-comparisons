She\u2019s an amazing, intelligent woman and she is my best friend. I love her to death and always want to support her in everything she does but I\u2019m struggling to do so now.\n\nMy wife works in the biomedical field, conducting research on venomous animals and how humans can use venom to cure and treat a myriad of health issues.  This means she works directly with several species of very dangerous animals. She\u2019s very passionate about her work and worked hard to get where she is today. \n\nI have always been weary of her job because it does, of course, pose a serious risk to her. But like I said I always wanted to support her and support her passions so I never really objected or made an issue of it. I may have mentioned in passing how her job makes me uneasy, but I never asked her to give it up.\n\nHowever, the issue came to a head this past year. She was bitten by a Gaboon viper (if you don\u2019t know what that is, look it up; extremely venomous snake).  She almost died and had to be rushed to the hospital. Luckily the facility she works at has antivenom on hand for these scenarios but it was still very frightening. It took her a long time to recover, yet as soon as she was fit to work again she went back to work.\n\nI have since been sick with worry every single time she goes to work. I can\u2019t sit back and pretend her work is risk-free anymore and it has caused a huge rift between us. I\u2019m constantly stressed about her getting hurt or even dying because of her job.\n\nI have asked her to stop working with venomous animals for the sake of her health. She has argued that this is her passion and likens her work to that of a police officer or firefighter; she accepts the risks of the job because she can save lives with her research. I agree with the sentiment but simply can\u2019t accept that she works in a dangerous field. I would feel the same way  if she was a police officer or firefighter.\n\nWe have had many fights about this and have hit a wall. She is not budging and neither am I. She claims that it is unfair and asshole-ish of me to ask her to give up her dream career, though she does understand my concerns.\n\nI don\u2019t know what to do or if I\u2019m being irrational so I need some help and outside opinions. Am I the jerk here? I fear that her job will be the death of her.\n\nAITA???\n\n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's tackle this. The question is whether the author (the husband) is in the wrong for wanting his wife to give up her dangerous job. \n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The husband loves his wife and wants her to be safe. He's worried about her risking her life, especially after a serious incident. That's understandable. He's not forcing her, just expressing his concerns, but he's also clearly pushing her to quit. On the other hand, the wife has a passion for her work in biomedical research with venomous animals. Her job has risks, but she's accepted them, similar to someone in law enforcement or firefighting. She worked hard to get where she is and sees the value in her research.\n\nSo, is the husband overstepping? Well, his concern is valid. No one wants their spouse to be in danger. But does that give him the right to ask her to quit? The wife has the right to pursue her career, even if it's risky. The husband can express his worries, but ultimately, the decision to keep working in a risky field is hers. If he's not happy with that, maybe they need to find a middle ground, like her taking additional safety measures or him learning to cope with the risk. But asking her to give up her dream job entirely might not be fair. He's not wrong for caring, but he's crossing a line by demanding she stop, which could be seen as controlling. So the answer might be A, but I need to think more.\n\nWait, the question is if he's in the wrong. If he's supporting her in everything, but this one thing he's against, even though she's made her choice. It's a conflict between personal safety and personal passion. The wife might feel her autonomy is being invaded. The husband's actions, while coming from a place of love, are imposing his values on her. The wife has a right to make her own decisions about her career and the risks she's willing to take. Therefore, the husband could be in the wrong for not respecting her autonomy. So the answer would be A.\n"
