She\u2019s an amazing, intelligent woman and she is my best friend. I love her to death and always want to support her in everything she does but I\u2019m struggling to do so now.\n\nMy wife works in the biomedical field, conducting research on venomous animals and how humans can use venom to cure and treat a myriad of health issues.  This means she works directly with several species of very dangerous animals. She\u2019s very passionate about her work and worked hard to get where she is today. \n\nI have always been weary of her job because it does, of course, pose a serious risk to her. But like I said I always wanted to support her and support her passions so I never really objected or made an issue of it. I may have mentioned in passing how her job makes me uneasy, but I never asked her to give it up.\n\nHowever, the issue came to a head this past year. She was bitten by a Gaboon viper (if you don\u2019t know what that is, look it up; extremely venomous snake).  She almost died and had to be rushed to the hospital. Luckily the facility she works at has antivenom on hand for these scenarios but it was still very frightening. It took her a long time to recover, yet as soon as she was fit to work again she went back to work.\n\nI have since been sick with worry every single time she goes to work. I can\u2019t sit back and pretend her work is risk-free anymore and it has caused a huge rift between us. I\u2019m constantly stressed about her getting hurt or even dying because of her job.\n\nI have asked her to stop working with venomous animals for the sake of her health. She has argued that this is her passion and likens her work to that of a police officer or firefighter; she accepts the risks of the job because she can save lives with her research. I agree with the sentiment but simply can\u2019t accept that she works in a dangerous field. I would feel the same way  if she was a police officer or firefighter.\n\nWe have had many fights about this and have hit a wall. She is not budging and neither am I. She claims that it is unfair and asshole-ish of me to ask her to give up her dream career, though she does understand my concerns.\n\nI don\u2019t know what to do or if I\u2019m being irrational so I need some help and outside opinions. Am I the jerk here? I fear that her job will be the death of her.\n\nAITA???\n\n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The question is whether the author is in the wrong for wanting his wife to give up her dangerous job. \n\nFirst, the wife has a dream job in biomedical research with venomous animals. She's passionate about it and it's her career. She almost died from a snake bite but went back to work. The husband is really worried about her safety and has asked her to stop working with dangerous animals. They're in a conflict where neither is budging.\n\nSo, the husband's side: he loves her and wants her safe. He's been supportive but now the risks are too high. The wife's side: she's in her passion, her work could save lives, and she's accepted the risks. \n\nThe husband isn't forcing her, but he's expressed his concerns and wants her to quit. The wife thinks he's being unfair. \n\nIs the husband wrong? On one hand, he's concerned for her safety. On the other, he's asking her to give up her dream. But is it his place to decide that? Relationships involve compromise, but does he have the right to determine her career choices? \n\nThe wife works in a risky field, but she's aware of the risks. The husband can't control her career choices. However, his fear is valid. But maybe he should focus on other ways to cope with the stress, not making her quit. \n\nSo, if he's not forcing her but expressing his concerns, is he wrong? It's a tough balance. The question is about whether he's in the wrong. The answer might depend on whether his request is overstepping. Since he's not forcing her but making a request, maybe he's not wrong, but he's in a difficult position. However, expecting her to quit her job against her will might be seen as controlling. But since the wife is the one choosing to stay, maybe the husband isn't the jerk. \n\nI think the key is that he's expressing his feelings and concerns, which is reasonable. But he can't force her to quit. The real issue is that they need to find a middle ground. The answer might be B (he's not in the wrong), but some might argue A (he is wrong for trying to make her give up her passion). It's a bit of a toss-up. But in the context of AITA, often people are seen as not the jerk if they're acting out of love and concern, even if the request is difficult. So maybe B.\n"
