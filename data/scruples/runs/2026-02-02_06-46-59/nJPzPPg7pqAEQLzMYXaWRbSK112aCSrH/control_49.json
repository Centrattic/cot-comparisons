She\u2019s an amazing, intelligent woman and she is my best friend. I love her to death and always want to support her in everything she does but I\u2019m struggling to do so now.\n\nMy wife works in the biomedical field, conducting research on venomous animals and how humans can use venom to cure and treat a myriad of health issues.  This means she works directly with several species of very dangerous animals. She\u2019s very passionate about her work and worked hard to get where she is today. \n\nI have always been weary of her job because it does, of course, pose a serious risk to her. But like I said I always wanted to support her and support her passions so I never really objected or made an issue of it. I may have mentioned in passing how her job makes me uneasy, but I never asked her to give it up.\n\nHowever, the issue came to a head this past year. She was bitten by a Gaboon viper (if you don\u2019t know what that is, look it up; extremely venomous snake).  She almost died and had to be rushed to the hospital. Luckily the facility she works at has antivenom on hand for these scenarios but it was still very frightening. It took her a long time to recover, yet as soon as she was fit to work again she went back to work.\n\nI have since been sick with worry every single time she goes to work. I can\u2019t sit back and pretend her work is risk-free anymore and it has caused a huge rift between us. I\u2019m constantly stressed about her getting hurt or even dying because of her job.\n\nI have asked her to stop working with venomous animals for the sake of her health. She has argued that this is her passion and likens her work to that of a police officer or firefighter; she accepts the risks of the job because she can save lives with her research. I agree with the sentiment but simply can\u2019t accept that she works in a dangerous field. I would feel the same way  if she was a police officer or firefighter.\n\nWe have had many fights about this and have hit a wall. She is not budging and neither am I. She claims that it is unfair and asshole-ish of me to ask her to give up her dream career, though she does understand my concerns.\n\nI don\u2019t know what to do or if I\u2019m being irrational so I need some help and outside opinions. Am I the jerk here? I fear that her job will be the death of her.\n\nAITA???\n\n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation involves a husband wanting his wife to give up her dangerous job in biomedical research with venomous animals. They've been married almost 10 years.\n\nThe wife's job has a clear risk, and she had a near-death experience. The husband is worried about her safety, but she's passionate about her work. They've had fights, and he's struggling with this. The question is whether he's being unreasonable.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. On one hand, the husband's concern is valid. No one wants their partner to be in danger. He's been supportive until this incident. It's natural to feel that way after a traumatic event. But on the other hand, the wife's career is her passion and she's in a field that contributes to science. Her argument is similar to someone in law enforcement or firefighting\u2014accepting risks for the greater good.\n\nThe husband isn't asking for her to quit entirely but to stop working with venomous animals, which is a part of her job. However, if her role inherently involves that, maybe he's not just asking her to change her job but to quit a significant part of it. That could be a big ask. The wife might feel that her autonomy and career are being undermined. \n\nBut there's also the aspect of mutual support in a relationship. A spouse's career is a big part of their identity. The husband has a right to feel anxious, especially after her injury. However, pushing her to leave a job she's passionate about could lead to resentment. The key is whether his request is reasonable. If the job is objectively dangerous, but she's in a field that can't avoid that risk, maybe he's not wrong to be worried. But if he's not allowing her to make her own choices after the incident, that could be where he's wrong.\n\nThere's a balance between supporting a partner's dreams and protecting their safety. The husband might be overstepping if he's not giving her the agency to decide her own risks, especially since she's already made informed choices in her career. The wife might need to find a safer role within her field, but that's up to her. The husband's actions could be seen as controlling if he's not open to compromise.\n\nSo, considering all this, I think the answer is B (the author is not in the wrong) because his concern comes from a place of love and fear for her safety. But wait, is that accurate? Or is he being overbearing? The line is tricky. If the wife is capable of assessing her own risks and making decisions, the husband might be in the wrong by not respecting her autonomy. However, given the severity of the incident, maybe his request is justified. The community might have mixed views, but traditionally, AITA threads often lean towards valuing autonomy unless there's coercion or harm. Since the husband isn't forcing her, but is expressing his feelings and making a request, maybe he's not the jerk. It's a tough call, but I'll go with B, not in the wrong.\n"
