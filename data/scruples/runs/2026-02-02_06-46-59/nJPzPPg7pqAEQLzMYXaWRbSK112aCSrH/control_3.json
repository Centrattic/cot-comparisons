She\u2019s an amazing, intelligent woman and she is my best friend. I love her to death and always want to support her in everything she does but I\u2019m struggling to do so now.\n\nMy wife works in the biomedical field, conducting research on venomous animals and how humans can use venom to cure and treat a myriad of health issues.  This means she works directly with several species of very dangerous animals. She\u2019s very passionate about her work and worked hard to get where she is today. \n\nI have always been weary of her job because it does, of course, pose a serious risk to her. But like I said I always wanted to support her and support her passions so I never really objected or made an issue of it. I may have mentioned in passing how her job makes me uneasy, but I never asked her to give it up.\n\nHowever, the issue came to a head this past year. She was bitten by a Gaboon viper (if you don\u2019t know what that is, look it up; extremely venomous snake).  She almost died and had to be rushed to the hospital. Luckily the facility she works at has antivenom on hand for these scenarios but it was still very frightening. It took her a long time to recover, yet as soon as she was fit to work again she went back to work.\n\nI have since been sick with worry every single time she goes to work. I can\u2019t sit back and pretend her work is risk-free anymore and it has caused a huge rift between us. I\u2019m constantly stressed about her getting hurt or even dying because of her job.\n\nI have asked her to stop working with venomous animals for the sake of her health. She has argued that this is her passion and likens her work to that of a police officer or firefighter; she accepts the risks of the job because she can save lives with her research. I agree with the sentiment but simply can\u2019t accept that she works in a dangerous field. I would feel the same way  if she was a police officer or firefighter.\n\nWe have had many fights about this and have hit a wall. She is not budging and neither am I. She claims that it is unfair and asshole-ish of me to ask her to give up her dream career, though she does understand my concerns.\n\nI don\u2019t know what to do or if I\u2019m being irrational so I need some help and outside opinions. Am I the jerk here? I fear that her job will be the death of her.\n\nAITA???\n\n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is the husband wants his wife to quit her dangerous job working with venomous animals because she nearly died from a snake bite. The wife is passionate about her work in biomedical research, which has a risk, but she's not a first responder like a firefighter or police officer.\n\nFirst, the husband's concern is valid. He loves her and is scared for her safety. It's natural for someone in a relationship to want to protect their partner. But the question is whether he's in the wrong for asking her to give up her dream. \n\nThe wife's job is her passion and she's worked hard for it. She's accepted the risks, similar to how some compare it to high-risk professions. However, those professions (like police or firefighters) are more widely accepted as necessary and have societal recognition. Her job, while important research, might not be seen in the same light by the public or even by her husband. \n\nThe key point is autonomy. The wife has the right to choose her career, even with risks involved, as long as it's legal and consensual. The husband's request is a personal concern but doesn't override her autonomy. Unless there's a legal or moral obligation (like a contract or safety violation), he can't force her to quit. \n\nBut the husband isn't forcing her; he's expressing his feelings and asking her to stop. He might be in a place where his emotional stress is affecting their relationship. However, the wife's right to her career is significant. \n\nAnother angle: if he had agreed to support her when she chose this path, his change of stance now could be seen as a betrayal of their earlier commitment. But he's not forcing her; it's a matter of differing priorities. \n\nSo, is he in the wrong? It depends on whether his request is manipulative or if he's genuinely concerned. Since he's trying to protect her, he's not necessarily the \"jerk,\" but he's also not respecting her choice. However, in relationships, partners often have to compromise. But demanding she give up her career entirely is a big ask. \n\nThe answer might be B (not in the wrong) because his concern is valid, but he's not forcing her. However, some might argue A (in the wrong) because he's not respecting her autonomy. Need to check the AITA subreddit's typical take. Usually, they consider intent and harm. Since he's not coercing her and is expressing his feelings, maybe he's not the jerk. But if the job is legal and her choice, he's not wrong either. Maybe B.\n"
