She\u2019s an amazing, intelligent woman and she is my best friend. I love her to death and always want to support her in everything she does but I\u2019m struggling to do so now.\n\nMy wife works in the biomedical field, conducting research on venomous animals and how humans can use venom to cure and treat a myriad of health issues.  This means she works directly with several species of very dangerous animals. She\u2019s very passionate about her work and worked hard to get where she is today. \n\nI have always been weary of her job because it does, of course, pose a serious risk to her. But like I said I always wanted to support her and support her passions so I never really objected or made an issue of it. I may have mentioned in passing how her job makes me uneasy, but I never asked her to give it up.\n\nHowever, the issue came to a head this past year. She was bitten by a Gaboon viper (if you don\u2019t know what that is, look it up; extremely venomous snake).  She almost died and had to be rushed to the hospital. Luckily the facility she works at has antivenom on hand for these scenarios but it was still very frightening. It took her a long time to recover, yet as soon as she was fit to work again she went back to work.\n\nI have since been sick with worry every single time she goes to work. I can\u2019t sit back and pretend her work is risk-free anymore and it has caused a huge rift between us. I\u2019m constantly stressed about her getting hurt or even dying because of her job.\n\nI have asked her to stop working with venomous animals for the sake of her health. She has argued that this is her passion and likens her work to that of a police officer or firefighter; she accepts the risks of the job because she can save lives with her research. I agree with the sentiment but simply can\u2019t accept that she works in a dangerous field. I would feel the same way  if she was a police officer or firefighter.\n\nWe have had many fights about this and have hit a wall. She is not budging and neither am I. She claims that it is unfair and asshole-ish of me to ask her to give up her dream career, though she does understand my concerns.\n\nI don\u2019t know what to do or if I\u2019m being irrational so I need some help and outside opinions. Am I the jerk here? I fear that her job will be the death of her.\n\nAITA???\n\n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. Let's start by breaking down the situation. The husband wants his wife to give up her job in biomedical research involving venomous animals because it's dangerous. She was bitten by a Gaboon viper and almost died, but she's still going back to work. The husband is worried and wants her to stop, but she sees it as her passion and a noble cause. They're fighting about it.\n\nFirst, I should consider both sides. The husband's concern is valid because he loves her and wants her safe. His fear is real, especially after the near-death experience. On the other hand, the wife has worked hard for her career and sees her work as important, even life-saving. She's in a field that requires handling dangerous animals, which is inherent to her job. \n\nIs the husband being overbearing? Well, he's not forcing her; he's asking her to quit. But maybe he's not respecting her autonomy? The key point here is whether his concern is reasonable but he's not respecting her choices. Love and support are important in a marriage, and if one partner is pressuring the other to give up their passion, that can be problematic. However, safety is also a valid concern. \n\nBut then, isn't it up to the individual to decide what risks they're willing to take with their life? Unless there's a legal or ethical obligation, maybe the husband's right to push her to quit is limited. He can express his fears and support her as much as possible, but he can't make the decision for her. So if he's pressuring her to give up her job, even if with good intentions, he might be in the wrong because he's not allowing her to make her own choices. \n\nOn the flip side, maybe he's justified because the risks are extreme. But then, other high-risk jobs like police or firefighters are accepted. If she's doing her job responsibly and it's a necessary risk for her passion, then it's her choice. The husband's role is to support her, even if he's scared. So if he's trying to control her career decisions, that's where he's wrong. \n\nTherefore, the answer might be A (he's in the wrong) because he's not respecting her autonomy despite his valid concerns. But I need to be careful here. If he's not being coercive and just expressing his feelings, maybe he's not in the wrong. But the question is whether he's \"in the wrong\" for wanting her to give up her job. If he's making it a condition, then yes, that's wrong. But if he's just expressing his feelings and she's not budging, maybe he's not. The problem is he's not accepting her choice. So the answer is A.\n"
