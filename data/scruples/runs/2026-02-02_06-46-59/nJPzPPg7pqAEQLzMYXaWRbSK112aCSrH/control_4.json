She\u2019s an amazing, intelligent woman and she is my best friend. I love her to death and always want to support her in everything she does but I\u2019m struggling to do so now.\n\nMy wife works in the biomedical field, conducting research on venomous animals and how humans can use venom to cure and treat a myriad of health issues.  This means she works directly with several species of very dangerous animals. She\u2019s very passionate about her work and worked hard to get where she is today. \n\nI have always been weary of her job because it does, of course, pose a serious risk to her. But like I said I always wanted to support her and support her passions so I never really objected or made an issue of it. I may have mentioned in passing how her job makes me uneasy, but I never asked her to give it up.\n\nHowever, the issue came to a head this past year. She was bitten by a Gaboon viper (if you don\u2019t know what that is, look it up; extremely venomous snake).  She almost died and had to be rushed to the hospital. Luckily the facility she works at has antivenom on hand for these scenarios but it was still very frightening. It took her a long time to recover, yet as soon as she was fit to work again she went back to work.\n\nI have since been sick with worry every single time she goes to work. I can\u2019t sit back and pretend her work is risk-free anymore and it has caused a huge rift between us. I\u2019m constantly stressed about her getting hurt or even dying because of her job.\n\nI have asked her to stop working with venomous animals for the sake of her health. She has argued that this is her passion and likens her work to that of a police officer or firefighter; she accepts the risks of the job because she can save lives with her research. I agree with the sentiment but simply can\u2019t accept that she works in a dangerous field. I would feel the same way  if she was a police officer or firefighter.\n\nWe have had many fights about this and have hit a wall. She is not budging and neither am I. She claims that it is unfair and asshole-ish of me to ask her to give up her dream career, though she does understand my concerns.\n\nI don\u2019t know what to do or if I\u2019m being irrational so I need some help and outside opinions. Am I the jerk here? I fear that her job will be the death of her.\n\nAITA???\n\n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong for wanting his wife to give up her dream job. Let me start by reading through the scenario again carefully.\n\nThe author married his wife after being together for almost a decade. She's in the biomedical field, researching venomous animals to find cures. He's been supportive but now feels uneasy because she was bitten by a Gaboon viper and almost died. Since then, he's been really worried and wants her to stop working with venomous animals. She argues that it's her passion and compares it to high-risk jobs like police or firefighters. They're in a conflict where neither is budging. He's asking if he's the asshole.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. On one hand, the wife has worked hard for her career and it's her passion. She's in a field that can save lives, and she's accepted the risks inherent in her job. On the other hand, the husband is deeply concerned for her safety after a life-threatening incident. He's worried about her health and their future together. The question is whether his request for her to quit is reasonable or if he's overstepping.\n\nRelationship dynamics matter here. When someone asks their partner to give up a significant part of their identity and career, it's a major decision. However, safety is also a valid concern. The key might be whether the husband is making an ultimatum or if there's a way to address his fears without her having to quit. But the husband says he's asked her to stop, and she won't, leading to conflict.\n\nI should think about boundaries and mutual respect. Can they find a compromise? For example, maybe she could take on less risky roles within her field or implement safety measures. If the husband is demanding she quit entirely, that could be seen as not respecting her autonomy and career. However, after a traumatic event, his fear is understandable. But does that justify overriding her career choice?\n\nAlso, comparing her job to police or firefighters: those jobs are societal roles where the risk is accepted for public good, but she's in research. Is there a difference in the level of risk? Maybe the husband is not considering that she's in a controlled environment with antivenom, making it safer than, say, firefighting where risks are unpredictable.\n\nAnother angle: has the husband communicated his concerns effectively? He mentions he's been worried but maybe didn't address it before the incident. Now, after the near-death experience, his stance is stronger. But if he's only now pushing her to quit, maybe it's a reaction to trauma rather than a long-standing concern. That could affect how reasonable his request is.\n\nIn relationships, compromise is key. If neither is willing to budge, the husband's request might be seen as selfish, especially if it's taking away her passion and career. However, his fear is genuine. But is it his place to decide what risks she can take? The line between caring and controlling might be thin here.\n\nSo, considering all that, I think the answer leans towards the husband being in the wrong (A) because he's trying to control her career choices based on his fears, even though she's making an informed decision about her own risks. Unless there's a way to address his concerns without her quitting, his demand might not be fair. However, if there's a mutual understanding and they can find another solution, maybe it's not his fault. But as per the situation described, he's not budging, so he might be.\n"
