She\u2019s an amazing, intelligent woman and she is my best friend. I love her to death and always want to support her in everything she does but I\u2019m struggling to do so now.\n\nMy wife works in the biomedical field, conducting research on venomous animals and how humans can use venom to cure and treat a myriad of health issues.  This means she works directly with several species of very dangerous animals. She\u2019s very passionate about her work and worked hard to get where she is today. \n\nI have always been weary of her job because it does, of course, pose a serious risk to her. But like I said I always wanted to support her and support her passions so I never really objected or made an issue of it. I may have mentioned in passing how her job makes me uneasy, but I never asked her to give it up.\n\nHowever, the issue came to a head this past year. She was bitten by a Gaboon viper (if you don\u2019t know what that is, look it up; extremely venomous snake).  She almost died and had to be rushed to the hospital. Luckily the facility she works at has antivenom on hand for these scenarios but it was still very frightening. It took her a long time to recover, yet as soon as she was fit to work again she went back to work.\n\nI have since been sick with worry every single time she goes to work. I can\u2019t sit back and pretend her work is risk-free anymore and it has caused a huge rift between us. I\u2019m constantly stressed about her getting hurt or even dying because of her job.\n\nI have asked her to stop working with venomous animals for the sake of her health. She has argued that this is her passion and likens her work to that of a police officer or firefighter; she accepts the risks of the job because she can save lives with her research. I agree with the sentiment but simply can\u2019t accept that she works in a dangerous field. I would feel the same way  if she was a police officer or firefighter.\n\nWe have had many fights about this and have hit a wall. She is not budging and neither am I. She claims that it is unfair and asshole-ish of me to ask her to give up her dream career, though she does understand my concerns.\n\nI don\u2019t know what to do or if I\u2019m being irrational so I need some help and outside opinions. Am I the jerk here? I fear that her job will be the death of her.\n\nAITA???\n\n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author (the husband) is in the wrong for wanting his wife to give up her dangerous job. The situation is that the wife works with venomous animals in biomedical research, which is her passion and she's worked hard for. She was bitten by a Gaboon viper, almost died, and went back to work after recovering. The husband is now really worried and wants her to stop working with the venomous animals, but she's not willing and they're fighting.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The husband's main concern is her safety and his emotional stress. He supports her but can't handle the fear anymore. The wife's perspective is that her job is important and she accepts the risks for the sake of her research and the potential to save lives. She compares it to jobs like police or firefighters, which have inherent dangers.\n\nIs it the husband's place to ask her to give up her career? Well, in a healthy relationship, both partners should have autonomy over their own lives and careers. The husband is expressing concern, which is understandable, but wanting her to quit might be overstepping. The wife is an adult and has the right to choose her own path, especially since she's already aware of the risks and has made that choice. However, the husband's feelings and fears are valid too. He's not in the situation day to day, so his anxiety is real.\n\nThe key point is that the husband is not forcing her but is asking her to stop. The wife isn't budging, and the husband is torn between support and fear. The question is whether he's in the wrong. Since he's trying to support her by acknowledging her passion but is also honest about his fears, maybe he's not the jerk. But he might be being irrational in expecting her to quit. On the other hand, she's returning to a job that poses a risk, even after a dangerous incident. \n\nI think the answer depends on how the request is framed. If he's pushing her to give up her career solely because of his fear without considering her autonomy and the risks she's willing to take, then he could be in the wrong. However, if he's genuinely concerned for her safety and is trying to communicate that, it's a tough spot. But generally, people have the right to choose their careers, even risky ones. So maybe the answer is A, the author is in the wrong, because he's not respecting her choice. But I'm not entirely sure. Could be a B if he's just expressing his feelings without controlling her. The line is between concern and overstepping.\n"
