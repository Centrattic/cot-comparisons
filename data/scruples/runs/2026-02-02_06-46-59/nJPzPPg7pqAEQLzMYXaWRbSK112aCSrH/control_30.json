She\u2019s an amazing, intelligent woman and she is my best friend. I love her to death and always want to support her in everything she does but I\u2019m struggling to do so now.\n\nMy wife works in the biomedical field, conducting research on venomous animals and how humans can use venom to cure and treat a myriad of health issues.  This means she works directly with several species of very dangerous animals. She\u2019s very passionate about her work and worked hard to get where she is today. \n\nI have always been weary of her job because it does, of course, pose a serious risk to her. But like I said I always wanted to support her and support her passions so I never really objected or made an issue of it. I may have mentioned in passing how her job makes me uneasy, but I never asked her to give it up.\n\nHowever, the issue came to a head this past year. She was bitten by a Gaboon viper (if you don\u2019t know what that is, look it up; extremely venomous snake).  She almost died and had to be rushed to the hospital. Luckily the facility she works at has antivenom on hand for these scenarios but it was still very frightening. It took her a long time to recover, yet as soon as she was fit to work again she went back to work.\n\nI have since been sick with worry every single time she goes to work. I can\u2019t sit back and pretend her work is risk-free anymore and it has caused a huge rift between us. I\u2019m constantly stressed about her getting hurt or even dying because of her job.\n\nI have asked her to stop working with venomous animals for the sake of her health. She has argued that this is her passion and likens her work to that of a police officer or firefighter; she accepts the risks of the job because she can save lives with her research. I agree with the sentiment but simply can\u2019t accept that she works in a dangerous field. I would feel the same way  if she was a police officer or firefighter.\n\nWe have had many fights about this and have hit a wall. She is not budging and neither am I. She claims that it is unfair and asshole-ish of me to ask her to give up her dream career, though she does understand my concerns.\n\nI don\u2019t know what to do or if I\u2019m being irrational so I need some help and outside opinions. Am I the jerk here? I fear that her job will be the death of her.\n\nAITA???\n\n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for wanting his wife to quit her dangerous job. The scenario involves a decade-long marriage where the wife works with venomous animals and had a near-death experience. The husband supports her passion but now wants her to stop due to safety concerns.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics of their relationship. The husband has always been supportive but now has a legitimate fear after the snakebite incident. He's asking her to give up her career, which she's worked hard for and is passionate about. She sees it as her dream job and compares it to high-risk professions like police or firefighters who accept the risks.\n\nIs the husband being overprotective? It's important to note that he didn't ask her to quit before the incident but now can't handle the stress. His concern for her safety is valid, but does that justify him asking her to leave her job? On the other hand, she's making a conscious choice to continue, which is her right. \n\nMarriage involves mutual support, but there's a balance between support and controlling behavior. The husband might be overstepping by trying to force her to quit, especially since she's not a police officer with inherent risks that come with the job. Her job is research-based and she's taking necessary precautions, like having antivenom. \n\nThe key here is consent and autonomy. The wife is an adult making an informed choice. The husband can express his concerns, but he can't make her quit. The fact that they've hit a wall in their communication suggests that their needs aren't being met. The husband should explore ways to manage his anxiety without controlling her career. \n\nIn conclusion, while his fear is genuine, he's in the wrong because he's infringing on her autonomy and the decision isn't his to make. The answer would be A (the author is in the wrong) because he's pressuring her to give up her career against her will, despite her informed consent and passion for her work.\n"
