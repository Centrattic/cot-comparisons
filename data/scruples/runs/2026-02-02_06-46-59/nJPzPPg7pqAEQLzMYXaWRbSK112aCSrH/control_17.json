She\u2019s an amazing, intelligent woman and she is my best friend. I love her to death and always want to support her in everything she does but I\u2019m struggling to do so now.\n\nMy wife works in the biomedical field, conducting research on venomous animals and how humans can use venom to cure and treat a myriad of health issues.  This means she works directly with several species of very dangerous animals. She\u2019s very passionate about her work and worked hard to get where she is today. \n\nI have always been weary of her job because it does, of course, pose a serious risk to her. But like I said I always wanted to support her and support her passions so I never really objected or made an issue of it. I may have mentioned in passing how her job makes me uneasy, but I never asked her to give it up.\n\nHowever, the issue came to a head this past year. She was bitten by a Gaboon viper (if you don\u2019t know what that is, look it up; extremely venomous snake).  She almost died and had to be rushed to the hospital. Luckily the facility she works at has antivenom on hand for these scenarios but it was still very frightening. It took her a long time to recover, yet as soon as she was fit to work again she went back to work.\n\nI have since been sick with worry every single time she goes to work. I can\u2019t sit back and pretend her work is risk-free anymore and it has caused a huge rift between us. I\u2019m constantly stressed about her getting hurt or even dying because of her job.\n\nI have asked her to stop working with venomous animals for the sake of her health. She has argued that this is her passion and likens her work to that of a police officer or firefighter; she accepts the risks of the job because she can save lives with her research. I agree with the sentiment but simply can\u2019t accept that she works in a dangerous field. I would feel the same way  if she was a police officer or firefighter.\n\nWe have had many fights about this and have hit a wall. She is not budging and neither am I. She claims that it is unfair and asshole-ish of me to ask her to give up her dream career, though she does understand my concerns.\n\nI don\u2019t know what to do or if I\u2019m being irrational so I need some help and outside opinions. Am I the jerk here? I fear that her job will be the death of her.\n\nAITA???\n\n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who posted the situation is in the wrong. The scenario is about a husband wanting his wife to quit her dangerous job in biomedical research with venomous animals. The wife got bitten seriously before and he's worried about her safety. They're arguing because he doesn't want her to take the risks anymore.\n\nSo, the question is whether he's in the wrong. Let's break it down. The husband loves his wife and supports her, but after a life-threatening incident, he's struggling. On one hand, he's concerned for her safety, which is natural. On the other, he's asking her to give up her passion and career. \n\nThe wife's perspective is that her job is her dream and she's willing to accept the risks to save lives, similar to police or firefighters. The husband disagrees, thinking the risk is too high. The key points here are mutual respect for each other's feelings and finding a solution that balances safety with personal fulfillment.\n\nIs it the husband's fault? Well, he's not forcing her, just expressing his concerns. However, he can't control her job choices. The problem is the conflict arises from differing priorities. He's not wrong for caring about her safety, but he might be wrong if he's being overly controlling or not considering her autonomy. However, since he's not forcing her and he's just trying to express his fears, maybe he's not in the wrong. It's a tough situation where both have valid points. The answer might hinge on whether he's respecting her autonomy while expressing his concerns. Since he's not stopping her but is struggling with their relationship's rift, it's more about communication rather than being in the wrong. So, the answer might be B.\n"
