She\u2019s an amazing, intelligent woman and she is my best friend. I love her to death and always want to support her in everything she does but I\u2019m struggling to do so now.\n\nMy wife works in the biomedical field, conducting research on venomous animals and how humans can use venom to cure and treat a myriad of health issues.  This means she works directly with several species of very dangerous animals. She\u2019s very passionate about her work and worked hard to get where she is today. \n\nI have always been weary of her job because it does, of course, pose a serious risk to her. But like I said I always wanted to support her and support her passions so I never really objected or made an issue of it. I may have mentioned in passing how her job makes me uneasy, but I never asked her to give it up.\n\nHowever, the issue came to a head this past year. She was bitten by a Gaboon viper (if you don\u2019t know what that is, look it up; extremely venomous snake).  She almost died and had to be rushed to the hospital. Luckily the facility she works at has antivenom on hand for these scenarios but it was still very frightening. It took her a long time to recover, yet as soon as she was fit to work again she went back to work.\n\nI have since been sick with worry every single time she goes to work. I can\u2019t sit back and pretend her work is risk-free anymore and it has caused a huge rift between us. I\u2019m constantly stressed about her getting hurt or even dying because of her job.\n\nI have asked her to stop working with venomous animals for the sake of her health. She has argued that this is her passion and likens her work to that of a police officer or firefighter; she accepts the risks of the job because she can save lives with her research. I agree with the sentiment but simply can\u2019t accept that she works in a dangerous field. I would feel the same way  if she was a police officer or firefighter.\n\nWe have had many fights about this and have hit a wall. She is not budging and neither am I. She claims that it is unfair and asshole-ish of me to ask her to give up her dream career, though she does understand my concerns.\n\nI don\u2019t know what to do or if I\u2019m being irrational so I need some help and outside opinions. Am I the jerk here? I fear that her job will be the death of her.\n\nAITA???\n\n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so the user is asking whether the author of the Reddit post is in the wrong for wanting his wife to give up her dangerous job. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the situation: The wife works with venomous animals in research, which is risky. She was nearly killed by a snake bite, and the husband is now really worried. He's asked her to stop working with these animals, but she's not willing. They're having major fights about it. The husband says he wants to support her but can't handle the stress anymore. The wife thinks he's being unfair.\n\nThe user thinks the author is in the wrong, but wants to know what I think. I need to decide if the answer is A or B.\n\nSo, the key points here. The husband is concerned for her safety, which is understandable. But is it his place to tell her to quit her job? The wife chose her career, which she's passionate about, and it's her right to take on risks in her profession. Comparing it to police or firefighters who take risks for the greater good. The husband's argument is that if she were in a high-risk job like those, he'd feel the same. But the difference is that those jobs are more socially accepted as necessary, maybe? Or perhaps the husband is projecting his anxiety onto her.\n\nIn a relationship, mutual respect is crucial. The husband's love and concern are valid, but overriding her autonomy could be problematic. He's not forcing her to quit, but he's expressing a strong desire for her to do so. The wife is making a valid point about her own choices and passions.\n\nSo, is the husband in the wrong? Well, he's not forcing her, but he's expressing a desire that conflicts with her career. The question is whether his concern is a legitimate reason to ask her to quit. If she's aware of the risks and still chooses to do the job, maybe the husband's request is overstepping. However, if the stress is causing major marital issues, maybe it's a different angle.\n\nBut the main issue is autonomy. The wife has the right to choose her career, even if it's risky. The husband's fear is personal and maybe irrational, but he's dealing with it. If he can't handle the stress, maybe the problem is his inability to cope rather than her job. So, the answer might be A, the author is in the wrong because he's infringing on her autonomy despite her right to choose her career path. But if he's genuinely concerned and they need to find a compromise, maybe not. However, since he's not budging and she's not, it's a stalemate. The husband's stance might be seen as controlling, even if well-intentioned.\n"
