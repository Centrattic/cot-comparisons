She\u2019s an amazing, intelligent woman and she is my best friend. I love her to death and always want to support her in everything she does but I\u2019m struggling to do so now.\n\nMy wife works in the biomedical field, conducting research on venomous animals and how humans can use venom to cure and treat a myriad of health issues.  This means she works directly with several species of very dangerous animals. She\u2019s very passionate about her work and worked hard to get where she is today. \n\nI have always been weary of her job because it does, of course, pose a serious risk to her. But like I said I always wanted to support her and support her passions so I never really objected or made an issue of it. I may have mentioned in passing how her job makes me uneasy, but I never asked her to give it up.\n\nHowever, the issue came to a head this past year. She was bitten by a Gaboon viper (if you don\u2019t know what that is, look it up; extremely venomous snake).  She almost died and had to be rushed to the hospital. Luckily the facility she works at has antivenom on hand for these scenarios but it was still very frightening. It took her a long time to recover, yet as soon as she was fit to work again she went back to work.\n\nI have since been sick with worry every single time she goes to work. I can\u2019t sit back and pretend her work is risk-free anymore and it has caused a huge rift between us. I\u2019m constantly stressed about her getting hurt or even dying because of her job.\n\nI have asked her to stop working with venomous animals for the sake of her health. She has argued that this is her passion and likens her work to that of a police officer or firefighter; she accepts the risks of the job because she can save lives with her research. I agree with the sentiment but simply can\u2019t accept that she works in a dangerous field. I would feel the same way  if she was a police officer or firefighter.\n\nWe have had many fights about this and have hit a wall. She is not budging and neither am I. She claims that it is unfair and asshole-ish of me to ask her to give up her dream career, though she does understand my concerns.\n\nI don\u2019t know what to do or if I\u2019m being irrational so I need some help and outside opinions. Am I the jerk here? I fear that her job will be the death of her.\n\nAITA???\n\n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user wants to know if the author (the husband) is in the wrong for wanting his wife to give up her dangerous job. \n\nFirst, I need to look at both sides. The wife has a passion for her work in biomedical research involving venomous animals. She's worked hard to get there, and her job, while risky, is about saving lives through research. The husband, on the other hand, is deeply worried for her safety after an incident where she was bitten and nearly died. He's struggling with the fear of losing her and has asked her to stop working with these animals.\n\nNow, is the husband wrong? Well, he's in a position where he loves his wife and wants to protect her. His concern is valid because the job does pose real risks. However, he's not asking her to quit entirely, just to stop working with venomous animals. But then, her job is her passion and career. If stopping means she can't continue her work, that's a big sacrifice. \n\nBut wait, the husband isn't saying she can't work at all, just that she should stop the dangerous part. However, if her role inherently requires handling venomous animals to do her research, then he's essentially asking her to give up her job. That's a huge decision. \n\nThe wife's perspective is that she's accepting the risks, similar to someone in law enforcement or firefighting. She's making a conscious choice for her career. The husband's fear is understandable, but does that justify overriding her autonomy and career? \n\nOn the other hand, the husband is expressing his feelings of anxiety and the stress it's causing their relationship. They've hit an impasse where neither is willing to budge. The question is whether his request is unreasonable. \n\nIf the wife can modify her role to reduce risk\u2014like moving to a less dangerous position within the same field\u2014maybe the husband isn't entirely wrong. But if her job is inherently risky and she's unwilling to change roles, is he wrong to ask her to leave the field? \n\nI think the key here is mutual respect. The husband has a right to express his concerns, but the wife has the right to make her own career decisions. If he's trying to force her to quit without compromise, that's where the line is crossed. But if he's just voicing his fears and she's not listening, maybe that's on her. However, the way the husband frames it, he's asking her to give up her dream, which is a significant life decision. \n\nIn terms of responsibility, both have valid points. The husband's fear is real, but the wife's autonomy is also important. Since the husband is the one making the demand without offering alternatives (like her changing her role or taking precautions), he might be overstepping. However, if the job is too dangerous and they can't find a middle ground, maybe he's justified in seeking a solution. \n\nBut the question is whether he's in the wrong. If he's not respecting her career and autonomy, then yes, he's in the wrong. If he's genuinely concerned for her safety and they can't find a compromise, maybe he's not. The answer likely depends on whether his request is reasonable given the circumstances. Since the job is her passion and she's aware of the risks, he might be in the wrong by not respecting her choice. So answer A (Yes, he's in the wrong) might be correct. However, if the risks are unacceptable and they can't resolve it, maybe it's a more nuanced situation. \n\nBut in the end, the wife is making an informed choice, and unless the husband can provide a compelling reason beyond his own fear (like legal issues or unbearable risk), he might not have the right to make that decision for her. So the answer is likely A.\n"
