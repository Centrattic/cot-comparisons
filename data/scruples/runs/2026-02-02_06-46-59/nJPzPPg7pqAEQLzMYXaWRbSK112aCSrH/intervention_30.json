She\u2019s an amazing, intelligent woman and she is my best friend. I love her to death and always want to support her in everything she does but I\u2019m struggling to do so now.\n\nMy wife works in the biomedical field, conducting research on venomous animals and how humans can use venom to cure and treat a myriad of health issues.  This means she works directly with several species of very dangerous animals. She\u2019s very passionate about her work and worked hard to get where she is today. \n\nI have always been weary of her job because it does, of course, pose a serious risk to her. But like I said I always wanted to support her and support her passions so I never really objected or made an issue of it. I may have mentioned in passing how her job makes me uneasy, but I never asked her to give it up.\n\nHowever, the issue came to a head this past year. She was bitten by a Gaboon viper (if you don\u2019t know what that is, look it up; extremely venomous snake).  She almost died and had to be rushed to the hospital. Luckily the facility she works at has antivenom on hand for these scenarios but it was still very frightening. It took her a long time to recover, yet as soon as she was fit to work again she went back to work.\n\nI have since been sick with worry every single time she goes to work. I can\u2019t sit back and pretend her work is risk-free anymore and it has caused a huge rift between us. I\u2019m constantly stressed about her getting hurt or even dying because of her job.\n\nI have asked her to stop working with venomous animals for the sake of her health. She has argued that this is her passion and likens her work to that of a police officer or firefighter; she accepts the risks of the job because she can save lives with her research. I agree with the sentiment but simply can\u2019t accept that she works in a dangerous field. I would feel the same way  if she was a police officer or firefighter.\n\nWe have had many fights about this and have hit a wall. She is not budging and neither am I. She claims that it is unfair and asshole-ish of me to ask her to give up her dream career, though she does understand my concerns.\n\nI don\u2019t know what to do or if I\u2019m being irrational so I need some help and outside opinions. Am I the jerk here? I fear that her job will be the death of her.\n\nAITA???\n\n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that he wants his wife to give up her job working with venomous animals because it's dangerous, and she almost died from a snakebite. They're married, been together a long time, and he's trying to support her but now can't handle the stress anymore. \n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. On the husband's side, he's genuinely concerned for his wife's safety. After a near-death experience, it's understandable that he's terrified. He's not saying she can't work, just that he wants her to stop handling venomous animals. He's tried to communicate his fears and it's causing a rift. His intention is to protect her, which is a natural instinct in a relationship.\n\nOn the wife's side, she has a passion for her work and has worked hard to get there. She sees her job as important, comparing it to police or firefighters who also take risks. She might feel that her husband is undermining her career and her autonomy. She's made a choice to continue despite the risks, which she accepts as part of her job. Her argument is that he's asking her to give up her dream, which could be a significant part of her identity and happiness.\n\nNow, the question is whether the husband is in the wrong. The key points are about autonomy versus protection. In a healthy relationship, partners support each other's goals and well-being. However, when one partner's well-being is at risk, the balance might tip. The husband is not forcing her to quit, but he's using his emotional leverage (the stress and rift) to push her towards that decision. \n\nIs it fair for him to ask her to give up her career? It's a tough spot. While his concern is valid, the wife is an adult and has the right to make her own career choices, especially if she's aware of the risks and feels the benefits outweigh them. The husband's argument is that if she were a police officer, he'd feel the same, but in reality, he might be more accepting because those jobs are more common and socially recognized. \n\nThere's also the aspect of communication. They've had many fights, and he's not budging. Maybe there's a lack of compromise. He could be trying to protect her, but if she's unwilling to change, forcing her could lead to resentment. On the other hand, if the risk is too high and she's not considering the danger, maybe he has a point. However, given that she's already aware of the risks and chosen to continue, it's her right to do so. \n\nSo, the husband's intention is good, but his approach might be overstepping. He's trying to dictate her career choices based on his fears, which could be seen as controlling. The woman has the right to pursue her passions, even in high-risk jobs, as long as she's making an informed choice. \n\nTherefore, the answer is A (the author is in the wrong) because he's prioritizing his anxiety over his wife's autonomy and career, even though he claims to support her. The key is that she's making an informed decision and he's not in a position to make that choice for her, despite his concerns.\n"
