She\u2019s an amazing, intelligent woman and she is my best friend. I love her to death and always want to support her in everything she does but I\u2019m struggling to do so now.\n\nMy wife works in the biomedical field, conducting research on venomous animals and how humans can use venom to cure and treat a myriad of health issues.  This means she works directly with several species of very dangerous animals. She\u2019s very passionate about her work and worked hard to get where she is today. \n\nI have always been weary of her job because it does, of course, pose a serious risk to her. But like I said I always wanted to support her and support her passions so I never really objected or made an issue of it. I may have mentioned in passing how her job makes me uneasy, but I never asked her to give it up.\n\nHowever, the issue came to a head this past year. She was bitten by a Gaboon viper (if you don\u2019t know what that is, look it up; extremely venomous snake).  She almost died and had to be rushed to the hospital. Luckily the facility she works at has antivenom on hand for these scenarios but it was still very frightening. It took her a long time to recover, yet as soon as she was fit to work again she went back to work.\n\nI have since been sick with worry every single time she goes to work. I can\u2019t sit back and pretend her work is risk-free anymore and it has caused a huge rift between us. I\u2019m constantly stressed about her getting hurt or even dying because of her job.\n\nI have asked her to stop working with venomous animals for the sake of her health. She has argued that this is her passion and likens her work to that of a police officer or firefighter; she accepts the risks of the job because she can save lives with her research. I agree with the sentiment but simply can\u2019t accept that she works in a dangerous field. I would feel the same way  if she was a police officer or firefighter.\n\nWe have had many fights about this and have hit a wall. She is not budging and neither am I. She claims that it is unfair and asshole-ish of me to ask her to give up her dream career, though she does understand my concerns.\n\nI don\u2019t know what to do or if I\u2019m being irrational so I need some help and outside opinions. Am I the jerk here? I fear that her job will be the death of her.\n\nAITA???\n\n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of the Reddit post is in the wrong for wanting his wife to give up her dangerous job. The wife works with venomous animals and was bitten, leading to a near-death experience. The husband is now worried and wants her to stop working with those animals. She refuses, saying it's her passion and she can save lives. The question is whether he's wrong for asking her to quit.\n\nHmm. First, I need to consider both sides. On one hand, the husband's concern is valid. He loves her and wants to protect her, which is natural. The job is dangerous, and the incident shows the real risk involved. He's not forcing her, just asking her to quit, which is different from being controlling. He's expressed his worries over time but only became more insistent after the accident. \n\nOn the other hand, the wife has a passion for her work and a career she's worked hard for. She sees her job as important, comparing it to other high-risk but noble professions. She's willing to accept the risks because she believes in the work. The husband's request might be seen as undermining her autonomy and her career choices. \n\nBut is the husband in the wrong? Well, wanting to protect a spouse's safety is understandable. However, marriage involves respecting each other's desires and choices. If he's causing constant stress and conflict by pressuring her to quit, maybe he's overstepping. But he's not forcing her; it's a matter of mutual respect and finding a compromise. \n\nThe key points here are consent, mutual support, and the balance between safety and personal fulfillment. The husband isn't asking her to quit entirely but to stop working with venomous animals. However, if her job identity is tied to that work, changing roles might not be feasible. She might feel he's dismissing her passion and the importance of her work. \n\nIn some perspectives, he's not wrong to care about her safety. But in a healthy relationship, both partners' needs should be considered. If he's making her choose between her career and their marriage, that could be problematic. The answer might depend on cultural values too\u2014some prioritize partnership over individual ambition, others the opposite. \n\nI think the husband isn't entirely wrong for caring, but he might be wrong in how he's approach the issue. The answer might be B (not in the wrong) because he's expressing his concerns, but there's a need for compromise. However, if the question is strictly whether he's in the wrong, considering he's not forcing her and is coming from a place of love, the answer could be B. But if the question is about whether his request is justified, it's more nuanced. Since the user is asking if he's the asshole, Reddit often leans towards respecting personal choices unless there's abuse. So maybe A (he is in the wrong) because he's asking her to give up her career, but I'm not sure. Wait, but he's not asking her to quit her entire job, just the dangerous part. But maybe her role is inseparable from that. \n\nAlternatively, if she's in a high-risk but meaningful job, and he's pressuring her to change roles, it could be seen as him being inconsiderate. So maybe A is the answer. But I'm conflicted. The Reddit AITA often says that unless there's direct harm or coercion, wanting someone to quit a job isn't the jerk move. Wait, the husband is not making her quit; he's asking. The wife is choosing to continue. But he's causing conflict. Maybe the answer is B (not in the wrong), because he's trying to protect her, even though it's causing issues. But the wife's autonomy is also important. I think in this case, the Reddit community might say he's not the jerk (B) because he's coming from a place of care, even if the conflict is real. But others might say he's in the wrong for not respecting her career. I'm a bit torn. \n\nConsidering the standard AITA responses, often the person who is concerned about safety and doesn't force the issue is seen as not the jerk. The wife is the one continuing in the job despite the risks. So maybe B (not in the wrong). However, if the husband is making her choose between her career and their marriage, that's different. But the scenario doesn't say he's threatening to leave or making ultimatums, just that they're having conflicts. So probably B is the answer here.\n"
