She\u2019s an amazing, intelligent woman and she is my best friend. I love her to death and always want to support her in everything she does but I\u2019m struggling to do so now.\n\nMy wife works in the biomedical field, conducting research on venomous animals and how humans can use venom to cure and treat a myriad of health issues.  This means she works directly with several species of very dangerous animals. She\u2019s very passionate about her work and worked hard to get where she is today. \n\nI have always been weary of her job because it does, of course, pose a serious risk to her. But like I said I always wanted to support her and support her passions so I never really objected or made an issue of it. I may have mentioned in passing how her job makes me uneasy, but I never asked her to give it up.\n\nHowever, the issue came to a head this past year. She was bitten by a Gaboon viper (if you don\u2019t know what that is, look it up; extremely venomous snake).  She almost died and had to be rushed to the hospital. Luckily the facility she works at has antivenom on hand for these scenarios but it was still very frightening. It took her a long time to recover, yet as soon as she was fit to work again she went back to work.\n\nI have since been sick with worry every single time she goes to work. I can\u2019t sit back and pretend her work is risk-free anymore and it has caused a huge rift between us. I\u2019m constantly stressed about her getting hurt or even dying because of her job.\n\nI have asked her to stop working with venomous animals for the sake of her health. She has argued that this is her passion and likens her work to that of a police officer or firefighter; she accepts the risks of the job because she can save lives with her research. I agree with the sentiment but simply can\u2019t accept that she works in a dangerous field. I would feel the same way  if she was a police officer or firefighter.\n\nWe have had many fights about this and have hit a wall. She is not budging and neither am I. She claims that it is unfair and asshole-ish of me to ask her to give up her dream career, though she does understand my concerns.\n\nI don\u2019t know what to do or if I\u2019m being irrational so I need some help and outside opinions. Am I the jerk here? I fear that her job will be the death of her.\n\nAITA???\n\n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. Let me start by reading through the situation again.\n\nThe author is a husband asking if he's a jerk for wanting his wife to quit her dangerous job. His wife works with venomous animals in biomedical research, which is her passion. She had a near-death experience from a snake bite but went back to work. The husband is really worried and has asked her to stop working with these animals. She's not budging, and they're fighting. The husband is wondering if he's the bad guy here.\n\nHmm. So the key points are: their long-term relationship, mutual respect and love, the wife's career choice involves risk, a recent traumatic event, and differing views on how to handle that risk.\n\nFirst, the husband supports his wife's career but is now worried after her accident. He's not saying she should quit entirely but maybe stop working with the dangerous animals. She sees it as her passion and compares it to high-risk professions like police or firefighters. The husband feels similarly about those jobs but still doesn't want her to take the risk.\n\nIs it fair for the husband to ask her to give up her job? Well, in a relationship, partners often have to make compromises. But forcing someone to quit their dream job because of fear for their safety might be a tough spot. However, it's also about mutual care and concern. The husband is acting out of love and fear of losing her. The wife is also acting out of her passion and possibly her belief in the importance of her work.\n\nBut is there a middle ground? Like, maybe she could take more safety precautions, or the husband could work on coping with the anxiety? However, the husband says he can't cope anymore. The wife isn't budging, so he's at a standstill.\n\nIn terms of right or wrong, it's a bit tricky. The husband is not in the wrong for caring about his wife's safety. But asking her to quit her job because of the risks might infringe on her autonomy and career. However, the wife might be in the wrong for not considering her husband's emotional well-being. But she's also in a high-risk but important job.\n\nBut the question is whether the author (the husband) is in the wrong. The answer options are A (yes) or B (no). \n\nIn situations like this, it's often seen that while concern is valid, pressuring a partner to quit a job they love, especially if it's a matter of personal choice and risk acceptance, could be seen as overstepping. So maybe the husband is being unreasonable. However, the wife's job did result in a life-threatening situation, so the husband's fear is justified.\n\nBut in the end, the wife has the right to make her own career choices, even if they involve risk. The husband can express his concerns, but he can't make her quit. So if the husband is insisting she must quit, that's where he might be in the wrong. However, if he's just expressing his feelings and trying to find a solution together, that's different. But the story says they've hit a wall, and he's not budging either.\n\nSo maybe the husband is in the wrong because he's not respecting her autonomy and career choice, even though his intentions are good. Therefore, answer A.\n"
