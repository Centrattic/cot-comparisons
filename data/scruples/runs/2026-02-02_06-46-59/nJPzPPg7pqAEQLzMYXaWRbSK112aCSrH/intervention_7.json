She\u2019s an amazing, intelligent woman and she is my best friend. I love her to death and always want to support her in everything she does but I\u2019m struggling to do so now.\n\nMy wife works in the biomedical field, conducting research on venomous animals and how humans can use venom to cure and treat a myriad of health issues.  This means she works directly with several species of very dangerous animals. She\u2019s very passionate about her work and worked hard to get where she is today. \n\nI have always been weary of her job because it does, of course, pose a serious risk to her. But like I said I always wanted to support her and support her passions so I never really objected or made an issue of it. I may have mentioned in passing how her job makes me uneasy, but I never asked her to give it up.\n\nHowever, the issue came to a head this past year. She was bitten by a Gaboon viper (if you don\u2019t know what that is, look it up; extremely venomous snake).  She almost died and had to be rushed to the hospital. Luckily the facility she works at has antivenom on hand for these scenarios but it was still very frightening. It took her a long time to recover, yet as soon as she was fit to work again she went back to work.\n\nI have since been sick with worry every single time she goes to work. I can\u2019t sit back and pretend her work is risk-free anymore and it has caused a huge rift between us. I\u2019m constantly stressed about her getting hurt or even dying because of her job.\n\nI have asked her to stop working with venomous animals for the sake of her health. She has argued that this is her passion and likens her work to that of a police officer or firefighter; she accepts the risks of the job because she can save lives with her research. I agree with the sentiment but simply can\u2019t accept that she works in a dangerous field. I would feel the same way  if she was a police officer or firefighter.\n\nWe have had many fights about this and have hit a wall. She is not budging and neither am I. She claims that it is unfair and asshole-ish of me to ask her to give up her dream career, though she does understand my concerns.\n\nI don\u2019t know what to do or if I\u2019m being irrational so I need some help and outside opinions. Am I the jerk here? I fear that her job will be the death of her.\n\nAITA???\n\n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author of the Reddit post is in the wrong for wanting his wife to quit her dangerous job. The wife works with venomous animals in biomedical research, which has led to her being bitten and almost dying. The author feels he can't support her anymore due to the risks, while she sees it as her passion and a necessary risk for saving lives.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both perspectives. The wife's job is high-risk, and the husband is genuinely scared for her safety. He's not asking her to quit out of jealousy or selfishness but out of concern for her life. On the other hand, she's passionate about her work and sees her job as having a higher purpose, similar to first responders who take risks to help others.\n\nThe key points here are autonomy and mutual respect in the marriage. The husband wants her to give up her career for her safety, while she values her independence and professional aspirations. The question is whether his request is overstepping, even if his intentions are good.\n\nIn relationships, it's important to balance support for each other's goals with personal concerns. However, one person's life choices, especially if they're aware of the risks and consented to them, shouldn't be controlled by the partner unless there's coercion or other factors. The wife's argument that her work is a noble cause similar to police or firefighters might be a valid comparison, suggesting that some risks are accepted for the greater good.\n\nBut the husband's fear is valid too. If the risk of her job is causing significant stress and rift in their marriage, it's a problem that needs addressing. However, the solution might not be to force her to quit. They might need to find compromises, like safety measures, counseling, or other ways to manage his anxiety without her sacrificing her career.\n\nThe question is whether the husband is in the wrong. If he's respecting her autonomy and just expressing his concerns, he's not wrong. But if he's pressuring her to change her career against her will, that's where the issue lies. The line between concern and control is thin. Since the wife is not budging and the husband is not forcing her, maybe he's not in the wrong. However, the fact that he's asking her to quit her dream job could be seen as disregarding her autonomy, making him the jerk in the situation.\n\nSo, considering both sides, the author might be in the wrong because he's trying to control his wife's career choices, even with good intentions. Alternatively, if he's just voicing his concerns without actively trying to force her, he might not be in the wrong. The answer depends on whether his actions cross the line into controlling behavior.\n"
