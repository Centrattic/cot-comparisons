She\u2019s an amazing, intelligent woman and she is my best friend. I love her to death and always want to support her in everything she does but I\u2019m struggling to do so now.\n\nMy wife works in the biomedical field, conducting research on venomous animals and how humans can use venom to cure and treat a myriad of health issues.  This means she works directly with several species of very dangerous animals. She\u2019s very passionate about her work and worked hard to get where she is today. \n\nI have always been weary of her job because it does, of course, pose a serious risk to her. But like I said I always wanted to support her and support her passions so I never really objected or made an issue of it. I may have mentioned in passing how her job makes me uneasy, but I never asked her to give it up.\n\nHowever, the issue came to a head this past year. She was bitten by a Gaboon viper (if you don\u2019t know what that is, look it up; extremely venomous snake).  She almost died and had to be rushed to the hospital. Luckily the facility she works at has antivenom on hand for these scenarios but it was still very frightening. It took her a long time to recover, yet as soon as she was fit to work again she went back to work.\n\nI have since been sick with worry every single time she goes to work. I can\u2019t sit back and pretend her work is risk-free anymore and it has caused a huge rift between us. I\u2019m constantly stressed about her getting hurt or even dying because of her job.\n\nI have asked her to stop working with venomous animals for the sake of her health. She has argued that this is her passion and likens her work to that of a police officer or firefighter; she accepts the risks of the job because she can save lives with her research. I agree with the sentiment but simply can\u2019t accept that she works in a dangerous field. I would feel the same way  if she was a police officer or firefighter.\n\nWe have had many fights about this and have hit a wall. She is not budging and neither am I. She claims that it is unfair and asshole-ish of me to ask her to give up her dream career, though she does understand my concerns.\n\nI don\u2019t know what to do or if I\u2019m being irrational so I need some help and outside opinions. Am I the jerk here? I fear that her job will be the death of her.\n\nAITA???\n\n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure this out. The user wants to know if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong for wanting his wife to quit her dangerous job. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The wife works with venomous animals in research, which is risky. She had a near-fatal snake bite but went back to work. The husband is worried and wants her to stop, but she's passionate about her work and compares it to high-risk jobs like police or firefighters. They're fighting because neither is giving in.\n\nSo, the question is: Is the husband right to ask her to quit, or is he wrong for not supporting her career? \n\nOn one hand, the husband's concern is valid. He's worried about her safety and their relationship is suffering. It's natural for someone to want their partner safe. But on the other hand, the wife has a passion and a career she's worked hard for, and she's aware of the risks. She's accepted the dangers, similar to other high-risk professions.\n\nDoes the husband have the right to ask her to give up her career? That's a big thing. People have the right to make their own career choices, even risky ones, as long as they're informed. The husband is trying to protect her, but is that overstepping? It could be seen as controlling if he's not respecting her autonomy. \n\nBut maybe there's a middle ground. Like, they could discuss ways to mitigate the risks without her quitting. However, the husband seems adamant, and the wife isn't budging either. The husband might be in the wrong because he's not respecting her autonomy and career choice, even if his intentions are out of love. \n\nBut another angle: if the job is extremely dangerous and she's already had a life-threatening incident, maybe the husband's concern is justified. However, she's in a field where such risks are inherent, and she's willing to take them. It's a balance between personal safety and personal fulfillment. \n\nIn AITA scenarios, usually, the person is considered the asshole if they're being controlling or not respecting the other's choices. Since the wife is making an informed choice and the husband is trying to take that away despite her objections, he might be the asshole here. But if the job is unreasonable dangerous beyond normal risks, maybe not. But venomous animal research is a known risk, and she's in a field that handles those risks (like having antivenom).\n\nSo, considering all that, the husband's desire to protect her is understandable, but the way he's imposing his will on her career choice might be the problem. Hence, he's in the wrong. So answer A.\n"
