She\u2019s an amazing, intelligent woman and she is my best friend. I love her to death and always want to support her in everything she does but I\u2019m struggling to do so now.\n\nMy wife works in the biomedical field, conducting research on venomous animals and how humans can use venom to cure and treat a myriad of health issues.  This means she works directly with several species of very dangerous animals. She\u2019s very passionate about her work and worked hard to get where she is today. \n\nI have always been weary of her job because it does, of course, pose a serious risk to her. But like I said I always wanted to support her and support her passions so I never really objected or made an issue of it. I may have mentioned in passing how her job makes me uneasy, but I never asked her to give it up.\n\nHowever, the issue came to a head this past year. She was bitten by a Gaboon viper (if you don\u2019t know what that is, look it up; extremely venomous snake).  She almost died and had to be rushed to the hospital. Luckily the facility she works at has antivenom on hand for these scenarios but it was still very frightening. It took her a long time to recover, yet as soon as she was fit to work again she went back to work.\n\nI have since been sick with worry every single time she goes to work. I can\u2019t sit back and pretend her work is risk-free anymore and it has caused a huge rift between us. I\u2019m constantly stressed about her getting hurt or even dying because of her job.\n\nI have asked her to stop working with venomous animals for the sake of her health. She has argued that this is her passion and likens her work to that of a police officer or firefighter; she accepts the risks of the job because she can save lives with her research. I agree with the sentiment but simply can\u2019t accept that she works in a dangerous field. I would feel the same way  if she was a police officer or firefighter.\n\nWe have had many fights about this and have hit a wall. She is not budging and neither am I. She claims that it is unfair and asshole-ish of me to ask her to give up her dream career, though she does understand my concerns.\n\nI don\u2019t know what to do or if I\u2019m being irrational so I need some help and outside opinions. Am I the jerk here? I fear that her job will be the death of her.\n\nAITA???\n\n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who posted the story is in the wrong for wanting his wife to quit her dangerous job. The story is about a wife who works with venomous animals and got bitten, which almost cost her life. The husband wants her to stop, but she won't.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze both sides. The husband is clearly worried about her safety. After a near-death experience, it's natural for him to be scared. He loves her and doesn't want her to get hurt. But he's asking her to give up her passion and career, which is a big deal.\n\nOn the other hand, the wife has worked hard to get where she is. Her job is important to her, and she's willing to accept the risks because she believes in the research. She's compared her job to high-risk professions like police or firefighters, which implies she accepts the dangers as part of her role.\n\nThe key points here are consent, mutual respect, and compromise. The husband hasn't forced her; he's expressed his concerns. However, he's asking her to make a significant life change. The wife has the right to her career, especially since she's aware of the risks. But the husband's fear is valid after the incident. \n\nNow, considering relationship dynamics. In a healthy relationship, both partners should support each other's goals unless there's a compelling reason to intervene. Here, the husband's concern is safety. However, the wife's autonomy is also important. If she's making an informed choice to continue her work despite the risks, the husband can't force her to quit. But he can express his fears and perhaps suggest compromises, like moving to a less dangerous position within the same field or other safety measures.\n\nThe question is whether the husband is wrong in making this request. Since he's not controlling or abusive, just expressing his feelings, it's a matter of perspective. Some might say he's overstepping by asking her to give up her career, while others understand his fear. However, the wife's right to her career is significant. The husband's request might be seen as selfish if it's about his emotional well-being over her career, but it's also about her safety.\n\nIn conclusion, while the husband's feelings are valid, the wife has the right to her career choice as long as she's making an informed decision. The husband isn't in the wrong for expressing his concerns, but he might be in the wrong for expecting her to quit against her will. However, the answer hinges on whether the request is reasonable. Since the wife is aware of the risks and has a valid reason to continue, the husband's request might be seen as unreasonable. Therefore, the husband is in the wrong.\n"
