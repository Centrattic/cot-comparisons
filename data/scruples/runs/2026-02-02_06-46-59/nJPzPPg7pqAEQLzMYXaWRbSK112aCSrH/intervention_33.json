She\u2019s an amazing, intelligent woman and she is my best friend. I love her to death and always want to support her in everything she does but I\u2019m struggling to do so now.\n\nMy wife works in the biomedical field, conducting research on venomous animals and how humans can use venom to cure and treat a myriad of health issues.  This means she works directly with several species of very dangerous animals. She\u2019s very passionate about her work and worked hard to get where she is today. \n\nI have always been weary of her job because it does, of course, pose a serious risk to her. But like I said I always wanted to support her and support her passions so I never really objected or made an issue of it. I may have mentioned in passing how her job makes me uneasy, but I never asked her to give it up.\n\nHowever, the issue came to a head this past year. She was bitten by a Gaboon viper (if you don\u2019t know what that is, look it up; extremely venomous snake).  She almost died and had to be rushed to the hospital. Luckily the facility she works at has antivenom on hand for these scenarios but it was still very frightening. It took her a long time to recover, yet as soon as she was fit to work again she went back to work.\n\nI have since been sick with worry every single time she goes to work. I can\u2019t sit back and pretend her work is risk-free anymore and it has caused a huge rift between us. I\u2019m constantly stressed about her getting hurt or even dying because of her job.\n\nI have asked her to stop working with venomous animals for the sake of her health. She has argued that this is her passion and likens her work to that of a police officer or firefighter; she accepts the risks of the job because she can save lives with her research. I agree with the sentiment but simply can\u2019t accept that she works in a dangerous field. I would feel the same way  if she was a police officer or firefighter.\n\nWe have had many fights about this and have hit a wall. She is not budging and neither am I. She claims that it is unfair and asshole-ish of me to ask her to give up her dream career, though she does understand my concerns.\n\nI don\u2019t know what to do or if I\u2019m being irrational so I need some help and outside opinions. Am I the jerk here? I fear that her job will be the death of her.\n\nAITA???\n\n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The author is a husband who wants his wife to quit her dangerous job. She works with venomous animals and got bitten, almost died. He's scared and it's causing marital issues.\n\nFirst, his intention is to protect her, which is understandable. But is he wrong? Well, she chose this career, right? She's passionate about it and makes a valid comparison to other high-risk jobs. The husband isn't asking her to leave her field entirely but just the dangerous part. But maybe he's infringing on her autonomy here. \n\nHe supported her before, but after the incident, he's pushing her to quit. She's not willing to give up her dream. Even though he's worried, forcing her to change her career could be seen as controlling. The key is whether he's overstepping by not respecting her choice despite the risks. \n\nAlso, the comparison to police or firefighters: they accept risks for the job. If he's okay with her being a nurse or something safer, but she's chosen a high-risk path, maybe it's her decision. The husband's fear is real, but he can't make her quit unless there are other factors like her not taking safety seriously. \n\nSo, the author's concern is valid, but his insistence on her quitting might be the issue. He's prioritizing his emotional well-being over her career, which she values. That could be where he's wrong. The answer might be A, but I'm a bit conflicted. However, since she's making an informed choice and he's not in a position to make that decision for her, maybe A is correct.\n"
