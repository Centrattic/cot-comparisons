She\u2019s an amazing, intelligent woman and she is my best friend. I love her to death and always want to support her in everything she does but I\u2019m struggling to do so now.\n\nMy wife works in the biomedical field, conducting research on venomous animals and how humans can use venom to cure and treat a myriad of health issues.  This means she works directly with several species of very dangerous animals. She\u2019s very passionate about her work and worked hard to get where she is today. \n\nI have always been weary of her job because it does, of course, pose a serious risk to her. But like I said I always wanted to support her and support her passions so I never really objected or made an issue of it. I may have mentioned in passing how her job makes me uneasy, but I never asked her to give it up.\n\nHowever, the issue came to a head this past year. She was bitten by a Gaboon viper (if you don\u2019t know what that is, look it up; extremely venomous snake).  She almost died and had to be rushed to the hospital. Luckily the facility she works at has antivenom on hand for these scenarios but it was still very frightening. It took her a long time to recover, yet as soon as she was fit to work again she went back to work.\n\nI have since been sick with worry every single time she goes to work. I can\u2019t sit back and pretend her work is risk-free anymore and it has caused a huge rift between us. I\u2019m constantly stressed about her getting hurt or even dying because of her job.\n\nI have asked her to stop working with venomous animals for the sake of her health. She has argued that this is her passion and likens her work to that of a police officer or firefighter; she accepts the risks of the job because she can save lives with her research. I agree with the sentiment but simply can\u2019t accept that she works in a dangerous field. I would feel the same way  if she was a police officer or firefighter.\n\nWe have had many fights about this and have hit a wall. She is not budging and neither am I. She claims that it is unfair and asshole-ish of me to ask her to give up her dream career, though she does understand my concerns.\n\nI don\u2019t know what to do or if I\u2019m being irrational so I need some help and outside opinions. Am I the jerk here? I fear that her job will be the death of her.\n\nAITA???\n\n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The person is asking if the husband is in the wrong for wanting his wife to quit her dangerous job. The wife works with venomous animals and got bitten, which was life-threatening. The husband is worried about her safety, causing stress in their relationship.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The husband's concern for his wife's safety is natural. No one wants their spouse to be in danger. He's been supportive but now his anxiety is causing problems. On the other hand, the wife has a passion for her work and sees it as a way to contribute to society, similar to high-risk jobs like firefighters. She's already faced a dangerous situation and recovered, so she might feel it's manageable.\n\nThe question is whether the husband has the right to ask her to quit. Marriage involves mutual respect. While his fear is valid, can he impose his will on her career choice? She's an adult and autonomous. However, safety is a legitimate concern. The key point is that he hasn't outright forced her but is expressing his deep worry. The wife is also in a job she loves, which is important for her fulfillment.\n\nThe answer might hinge on whether the husband is being overbearing. If he's pressuring her without considering her autonomy and her ability to manage risks, he could be wrong. But if he's trying to communicate his feelings and concerns without controlling her, it's a complex situation. The fact that they're both firm in their positions complicates things. The husband's actions might not be malicious but stem from love and fear. However, the wife's right to her career and safety measures she takes are also important. It's a tough call, but maybe the husband isn't entirely wrong since he's expressing his feelings, but he needs to find a balance. However, the answer could be B (No) because he's not in the wrong for wanting her safety, but it's about how he's communicating. Alternatively, A (Yes) if he's infringing on her autonomy. I think the key is that he's not forcing her but is struggling with his anxiety. So maybe B.\n"
