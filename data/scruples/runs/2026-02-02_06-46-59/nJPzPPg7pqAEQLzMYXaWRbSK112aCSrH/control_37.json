She\u2019s an amazing, intelligent woman and she is my best friend. I love her to death and always want to support her in everything she does but I\u2019m struggling to do so now.\n\nMy wife works in the biomedical field, conducting research on venomous animals and how humans can use venom to cure and treat a myriad of health issues.  This means she works directly with several species of very dangerous animals. She\u2019s very passionate about her work and worked hard to get where she is today. \n\nI have always been weary of her job because it does, of course, pose a serious risk to her. But like I said I always wanted to support her and support her passions so I never really objected or made an issue of it. I may have mentioned in passing how her job makes me uneasy, but I never asked her to give it up.\n\nHowever, the issue came to a head this past year. She was bitten by a Gaboon viper (if you don\u2019t know what that is, look it up; extremely venomous snake).  She almost died and had to be rushed to the hospital. Luckily the facility she works at has antivenom on hand for these scenarios but it was still very frightening. It took her a long time to recover, yet as soon as she was fit to work again she went back to work.\n\nI have since been sick with worry every single time she goes to work. I can\u2019t sit back and pretend her work is risk-free anymore and it has caused a huge rift between us. I\u2019m constantly stressed about her getting hurt or even dying because of her job.\n\nI have asked her to stop working with venomous animals for the sake of her health. She has argued that this is her passion and likens her work to that of a police officer or firefighter; she accepts the risks of the job because she can save lives with her research. I agree with the sentiment but simply can\u2019t accept that she works in a dangerous field. I would feel the same way  if she was a police officer or firefighter.\n\nWe have had many fights about this and have hit a wall. She is not budging and neither am I. She claims that it is unfair and asshole-ish of me to ask her to give up her dream career, though she does understand my concerns.\n\nI don\u2019t know what to do or if I\u2019m being irrational so I need some help and outside opinions. Am I the jerk here? I fear that her job will be the death of her.\n\nAITA???\n\n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the person who wrote the Reddit post is in the wrong for wanting his wife to quit her dangerous job. \n\nFirst, I need to understand both sides. The husband is worried about his wife's safety. She works with venomous animals and was almost killed by a snake bite. He's been supportive before but now can't handle the stress anymore. The wife, on the other hand, is passionate about her research and sees her job as important, comparing it to jobs like firefighters or police who also take risks.\n\nSo, the question is whether the husband is overstepping by asking her to leave her job. On one hand, he's concerned for her safety, which is a valid and caring reason. On the other hand, her job is her passion and she's made career achievements that she's worked hard for. \n\nI should consider their relationship dynamics. They've been together a long time, and he mentions she's his best friend. He wants to support her, but now his anxiety is causing a rift. The wife might feel that his request is undermining her autonomy and her career choices. \n\nIs it fair for him to ask her to quit? Well, he's not forcing her, just expressing his concerns. But she has a right to make her own decisions about her career and the risks she's willing to take. However, the husband's concern is also valid because he's worried about her safety and their relationship's well-being. \n\nIn relationships, compromise is key. Maybe the husband should try to find a middle ground, like her moving to a less dangerous role if possible, but not necessarily quitting entirely. The wife might need to take more precautions or consider the impact on their relationship. \n\nBut the main issue is whether he's in the wrong. If he's expressing his concerns and they're having open discussions, maybe he's not entirely wrong. However, if he's pressuring her to give up her passion without considering her perspective, that could be seen as selfish. \n\nThe answer might depend on cultural or personal values. Some might see the husband as loving and concerned, while others might think he's being overprotective. The Reddit community usually looks for balance between empathy and autonomy. \n\nIn the end, it's a tough call, but I think the husband's intentions are good, but he's not considering her autonomy enough. So maybe he's not entirely in the wrong, but there's room for both perspectives. The correct answer might be B (he's not in the wrong) because he's acting from a place of care, even if it's causing conflict. However, others might argue he's being irrational. But given the options, B seems more likely.\n"
