She\u2019s an amazing, intelligent woman and she is my best friend. I love her to death and always want to support her in everything she does but I\u2019m struggling to do so now.\n\nMy wife works in the biomedical field, conducting research on venomous animals and how humans can use venom to cure and treat a myriad of health issues.  This means she works directly with several species of very dangerous animals. She\u2019s very passionate about her work and worked hard to get where she is today. \n\nI have always been weary of her job because it does, of course, pose a serious risk to her. But like I said I always wanted to support her and support her passions so I never really objected or made an issue of it. I may have mentioned in passing how her job makes me uneasy, but I never asked her to give it up.\n\nHowever, the issue came to a head this past year. She was bitten by a Gaboon viper (if you don\u2019t know what that is, look it up; extremely venomous snake).  She almost died and had to be rushed to the hospital. Luckily the facility she works at has antivenom on hand for these scenarios but it was still very frightening. It took her a long time to recover, yet as soon as she was fit to work again she went back to work.\n\nI have since been sick with worry every single time she goes to work. I can\u2019t sit back and pretend her work is risk-free anymore and it has caused a huge rift between us. I\u2019m constantly stressed about her getting hurt or even dying because of her job.\n\nI have asked her to stop working with venomous animals for the sake of her health. She has argued that this is her passion and likens her work to that of a police officer or firefighter; she accepts the risks of the job because she can save lives with her research. I agree with the sentiment but simply can\u2019t accept that she works in a dangerous field. I would feel the same way  if she was a police officer or firefighter.\n\nWe have had many fights about this and have hit a wall. She is not budging and neither am I. She claims that it is unfair and asshole-ish of me to ask her to give up her dream career, though she does understand my concerns.\n\nI don\u2019t know what to do or if I\u2019m being irrational so I need some help and outside opinions. Am I the jerk here? I fear that her job will be the death of her.\n\nAITA???\n\n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the husband is in the wrong for wanting his wife to quit her dangerous job. The wife works with venomous animals and has been bitten, almost dying. The husband is worried and doesn't want her to continue, but she's passionate about her work.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The husband's concern is valid because her job is life-threatening. He loves her and wants her safe. But the wife has worked hard for her career and sees it as her passion and a way to save lives. She might feel that her autonomy is being challenged here.\n\nLegal rights: In most cases, adults can choose their jobs regardless of risk, unless there's something like a contract or custody issues. Since there's no mention of children or legal constraints, the main issue is ethical and emotional.\n\nEthically, it's about balancing personal autonomy and care. The husband's desire to protect her is understandable, but he can't force her to quit. The wife has the right to her career choice, even if it's risky. The husband's request might be seen as overstepping if he's pressuring her against her will.\n\nCommunication is key. The husband has expressed his concerns, but the wife isn't budging. They need to find a compromise, maybe like safety measures or support groups. But the husband's stance is that he won't accept the risk, leading to a rift. He might be in the wrong for not respecting her autonomy despite his love and concern.\n\nSo, the answer would be A (author is in the wrong) because he's trying to control her career choices despite her autonomy and passion, even if his intentions are good.\n"
