She\u2019s an amazing, intelligent woman and she is my best friend. I love her to death and always want to support her in everything she does but I\u2019m struggling to do so now.\n\nMy wife works in the biomedical field, conducting research on venomous animals and how humans can use venom to cure and treat a myriad of health issues.  This means she works directly with several species of very dangerous animals. She\u2019s very passionate about her work and worked hard to get where she is today. \n\nI have always been weary of her job because it does, of course, pose a serious risk to her. But like I said I always wanted to support her and support her passions so I never really objected or made an issue of it. I may have mentioned in passing how her job makes me uneasy, but I never asked her to give it up.\n\nHowever, the issue came to a head this past year. She was bitten by a Gaboon viper (if you don\u2019t know what that is, look it up; extremely venomous snake).  She almost died and had to be rushed to the hospital. Luckily the facility she works at has antivenom on hand for these scenarios but it was still very frightening. It took her a long time to recover, yet as soon as she was fit to work again she went back to work.\n\nI have since been sick with worry every single time she goes to work. I can\u2019t sit back and pretend her work is risk-free anymore and it has caused a huge rift between us. I\u2019m constantly stressed about her getting hurt or even dying because of her job.\n\nI have asked her to stop working with venomous animals for the sake of her health. She has argued that this is her passion and likens her work to that of a police officer or firefighter; she accepts the risks of the job because she can save lives with her research. I agree with the sentiment but simply can\u2019t accept that she works in a dangerous field. I would feel the same way  if she was a police officer or firefighter.\n\nWe have had many fights about this and have hit a wall. She is not budging and neither am I. She claims that it is unfair and asshole-ish of me to ask her to give up her dream career, though she does understand my concerns.\n\nI don\u2019t know what to do or if I\u2019m being irrational so I need some help and outside opinions. Am I the jerk here? I fear that her job will be the death of her.\n\nAITA???\n\n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the Reddit post is in the wrong. The situation is that the husband is asking if he's the a**hole for wanting his wife to quit her dangerous job as a biomedical researcher working with venomous animals. His wife was bitten by a Gaboon viper and he's been very worried since. They've had fights about it.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The husband loves his wife and supports her, but there's a conflict because of the job's risks. The wife is passionate about her work and sees it as saving lives, similar to high-risk professions like police or firefighters. The husband, on the other hand, can't handle the stress and wants her to stop for her safety.\n\nIs the husband in the wrong? Let's break it down. On one hand, he's concerned for her safety, which is a natural and caring response. He didn't push her before, only after she was injured. But on the other hand, he's asking her to give up her passion and career, which is a significant part of her identity and happiness. \n\nThe key points here are autonomy and mutual respect. The wife has the right to make her own decisions about her career and the risks she's willing to accept. However, the husband's concern is valid because he's her partner and is deeply affected by the risks. The problem is that he's trying to control her career choice based on his fears, which might be overstepping.\n\nBut is he in the wrong? It's possible that he's not in the wrong because his concern is genuine. However, the way he's approaching it might be. If he's pressuring her to quit despite her making informed decisions about her job, that could be where he's at fault. The wife's job is her choice, and unless there's some legal or ethical issue, it's her decision to make. The husband's role is to support her, even if he's worried, rather than try to make her quit.\n\nIn relationships, it's important to balance personal safety with respecting each other's aspirations. So, the husband's concern is understandable, but the push for her to quit could be seen as infringing on her autonomy. The wife's argument that it's her passion and she accepts the risks similar to other professions is a strong point. Therefore, the husband might not be entirely in the wrong, but he's in a tough spot. However, the answer depends on whether he's respecting her choices despite his fears. If he's not budging and pressuring her, maybe he is in the wrong because he's not respecting her autonomy. \n\nBut the question is whether he's in the wrong. The answer could be B (No, he's not in the wrong) because his intentions are to protect her, and he's not forcing her but asking. However, others might argue that he should respect her choice. So it's a bit of a gray area. But given that he's the one expressing concern and trying to find a middle ground, maybe he's not in the wrong. However, if he's being controlling, then he might be. The Reddit community often sides with autonomy, so the answer might be A, but I need to think.\n\nIn the AITA context, the community often considers whether the person is overstepping. Since the wife is an adult and making her own decisions, the husband's request could be seen as crossing a line. Therefore, the answer might be A (Yes, he's in the wrong). But I'm a bit conflicted here. The husband's concern is valid, but it's her choice to make. So maybe the answer is A because he's being controlling. Alternatively, if the husband is just expressing his feelings and not coercing her, then maybe not. But the post says they've had fights and she's not budging, so maybe he's being overbearing. Hmm.\n"
