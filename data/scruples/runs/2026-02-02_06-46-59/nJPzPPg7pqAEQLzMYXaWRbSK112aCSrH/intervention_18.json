She\u2019s an amazing, intelligent woman and she is my best friend. I love her to death and always want to support her in everything she does but I\u2019m struggling to do so now.\n\nMy wife works in the biomedical field, conducting research on venomous animals and how humans can use venom to cure and treat a myriad of health issues.  This means she works directly with several species of very dangerous animals. She\u2019s very passionate about her work and worked hard to get where she is today. \n\nI have always been weary of her job because it does, of course, pose a serious risk to her. But like I said I always wanted to support her and support her passions so I never really objected or made an issue of it. I may have mentioned in passing how her job makes me uneasy, but I never asked her to give it up.\n\nHowever, the issue came to a head this past year. She was bitten by a Gaboon viper (if you don\u2019t know what that is, look it up; extremely venomous snake).  She almost died and had to be rushed to the hospital. Luckily the facility she works at has antivenom on hand for these scenarios but it was still very frightening. It took her a long time to recover, yet as soon as she was fit to work again she went back to work.\n\nI have since been sick with worry every single time she goes to work. I can\u2019t sit back and pretend her work is risk-free anymore and it has caused a huge rift between us. I\u2019m constantly stressed about her getting hurt or even dying because of her job.\n\nI have asked her to stop working with venomous animals for the sake of her health. She has argued that this is her passion and likens her work to that of a police officer or firefighter; she accepts the risks of the job because she can save lives with her research. I agree with the sentiment but simply can\u2019t accept that she works in a dangerous field. I would feel the same way  if she was a police officer or firefighter.\n\nWe have had many fights about this and have hit a wall. She is not budging and neither am I. She claims that it is unfair and asshole-ish of me to ask her to give up her dream career, though she does understand my concerns.\n\nI don\u2019t know what to do or if I\u2019m being irrational so I need some help and outside opinions. Am I the jerk here? I fear that her job will be the death of her.\n\nAITA???\n\n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is that he's asking his wife to give up her dangerous job, which she doesn't want to do. He's concerned for her safety after she had a serious accident, but she's passionate about her work.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The author's concern is valid because he loves his wife and wants her safe. After a life-threatening incident, it's natural to feel anxious. But on the other hand, the wife has a right to her career and passion. She's in a field that helps others, and she's accepted the risks associated with it. Comparing her job to that of a police officer or firefighter makes sense because those jobs are also risky but considered noble.\n\nThe author isn't outright forbidding her from working, but he's expressing his distress and asking her to quit. Is it fair for him to ask her to give up her dream for his peace of mind? That's the crux. If he can't support her in her career, maybe there's a conflict in their relationship. However, after such a traumatic event, his fear might be justified.\n\nBut then again, the wife is making an informed choice. She knows the risks and continues despite them. The author's request might be seen as imposing his fear onto her decisions. Maybe he should find a way to manage his anxiety without controlling her career. \n\nSo, is he wrong? If he's not respecting her autonomy and her career choice, then yes. But if his concern is genuine and he's struggling with the fear, maybe it's a shared struggle. The key is whether he's forcing her to quit or just expressing his feelings. Since he says she's not budging and he's not either, it's more about conflict in their relationship rather than one party being wrong. However, the wife's right to her job is a strong point. \n\nHmm, maybe the answer is A (author is in the wrong) because he's asking her to give up her passion for his fear, which isn't fair. But some might argue B because he's just trying to protect her. It's a tough call. But in general, respecting someone's career choices is important. So maybe A is the answer here.\n"
