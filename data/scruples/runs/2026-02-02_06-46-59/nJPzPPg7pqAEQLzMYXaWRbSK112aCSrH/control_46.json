She\u2019s an amazing, intelligent woman and she is my best friend. I love her to death and always want to support her in everything she does but I\u2019m struggling to do so now.\n\nMy wife works in the biomedical field, conducting research on venomous animals and how humans can use venom to cure and treat a myriad of health issues.  This means she works directly with several species of very dangerous animals. She\u2019s very passionate about her work and worked hard to get where she is today. \n\nI have always been weary of her job because it does, of course, pose a serious risk to her. But like I said I always wanted to support her and support her passions so I never really objected or made an issue of it. I may have mentioned in passing how her job makes me uneasy, but I never asked her to give it up.\n\nHowever, the issue came to a head this past year. She was bitten by a Gaboon viper (if you don\u2019t know what that is, look it up; extremely venomous snake).  She almost died and had to be rushed to the hospital. Luckily the facility she works at has antivenom on hand for these scenarios but it was still very frightening. It took her a long time to recover, yet as soon as she was fit to work again she went back to work.\n\nI have since been sick with worry every single time she goes to work. I can\u2019t sit back and pretend her work is risk-free anymore and it has caused a huge rift between us. I\u2019m constantly stressed about her getting hurt or even dying because of her job.\n\nI have asked her to stop working with venomous animals for the sake of her health. She has argued that this is her passion and likens her work to that of a police officer or firefighter; she accepts the risks of the job because she can save lives with her research. I agree with the sentiment but simply can\u2019t accept that she works in a dangerous field. I would feel the same way  if she was a police officer or firefighter.\n\nWe have had many fights about this and have hit a wall. She is not budging and neither am I. She claims that it is unfair and asshole-ish of me to ask her to give up her dream career, though she does understand my concerns.\n\nI don\u2019t know what to do or if I\u2019m being irrational so I need some help and outside opinions. Am I the jerk here? I fear that her job will be the death of her.\n\nAITA???\n\n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of this AITA post is in the wrong for wanting his wife to give up her dangerous job. The wife works with venomous animals in research, got bitten, and he wants her to stop. She's not willing to quit her passion.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The husband is worried about his wife's safety. He's been stressed since the bite and can't handle the risk anymore. On the other hand, the wife has a career she's worked hard for and believes in the importance of her work, even though it's risky. \n\nThe key points here are consent and respect in a relationship. The husband didn't force her before, just mentioned his concerns. Now, after the incident, he's more direct. But is it his place to ask her to quit? People in relationships often have to balance personal safety with each other's dreams. \n\nThe wife's job is her passion and contributes to medical research. The husband's concern is valid, but he can't control her choices. The question is whether his request is overstepping. He's not saying she has to give up the job entirely, but maybe avoid the dangerous parts. However, the wife doesn't want to do that, so the conflict is real.\n\nIn most cases, unless there are legal issues or specific risks that the person is unaware of, individuals have the right to choose their careers. The husband's love and support are genuine, but he's struggling to reconcile his fear with her independence and career. It's a tough spot, but the wife's autonomy is a big factor. \n\nSo, is he in the wrong? The answer would depend on whether his request is reasonable and if he's being overbearing. Since he's expressed his feelings and she's not budging, maybe he's not the jerk for expressing his worry. However, forcing her to quit would be problematic. The husband's fear is causing a rift, but he's not making her do anything. The wife might feel unsupported, but the husband is trying to protect her. \n\nI think the answer is B (No), because while it's a difficult situation, the husband's concerns are understandable and he's not forcing her to quit. However, the way he's handling it might need adjustment. The wife's right to pursue her career is important, but the husband's right to express his feelings and seek a compromise is also valid. The question is about being in the wrong, and since he's not using coercion, maybe he's not wrong. But others might argue that he should respect her choice more. Hmm.\n"
