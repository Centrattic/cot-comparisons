She\u2019s an amazing, intelligent woman and she is my best friend. I love her to death and always want to support her in everything she does but I\u2019m struggling to do so now.\n\nMy wife works in the biomedical field, conducting research on venomous animals and how humans can use venom to cure and treat a myriad of health issues.  This means she works directly with several species of very dangerous animals. She\u2019s very passionate about her work and worked hard to get where she is today. \n\nI have always been weary of her job because it does, of course, pose a serious risk to her. But like I said I always wanted to support her and support her passions so I never really objected or made an issue of it. I may have mentioned in passing how her job makes me uneasy, but I never asked her to give it up.\n\nHowever, the issue came to a head this past year. She was bitten by a Gaboon viper (if you don\u2019t know what that is, look it up; extremely venomous snake).  She almost died and had to be rushed to the hospital. Luckily the facility she works at has antivenom on hand for these scenarios but it was still very frightening. It took her a long time to recover, yet as soon as she was fit to work again she went back to work.\n\nI have since been sick with worry every single time she goes to work. I can\u2019t sit back and pretend her work is risk-free anymore and it has caused a huge rift between us. I\u2019m constantly stressed about her getting hurt or even dying because of her job.\n\nI have asked her to stop working with venomous animals for the sake of her health. She has argued that this is her passion and likens her work to that of a police officer or firefighter; she accepts the risks of the job because she can save lives with her research. I agree with the sentiment but simply can\u2019t accept that she works in a dangerous field. I would feel the same way  if she was a police officer or firefighter.\n\nWe have had many fights about this and have hit a wall. She is not budging and neither am I. She claims that it is unfair and asshole-ish of me to ask her to give up her dream career, though she does understand my concerns.\n\nI don\u2019t know what to do or if I\u2019m being irrational so I need some help and outside opinions. Am I the jerk here? I fear that her job will be the death of her.\n\nAITA???\n\n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for wanting his wife to give up her dangerous job. They've been married almost 10 years, she's in a high-risk profession, and after a serious incident, he can't handle the stress anymore.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The husband's concern is valid; he loves his wife and wants her safe. The wife has a passion and a career that contributes to science. She's already faced a dangerous situation but chooses to continue. \n\nLegally, she can't be forced to quit, so the husband's request is emotional. The question is whether his request is unreasonable. On one hand, he's worried for her safety. On the other, she's making her own choices, and he's asking her to give up something she loves. \n\nI should think about autonomy. Adults have the right to choose their careers, even risky ones. If the husband can't accept that, maybe the issue is his inability to cope with her choices rather than her being wrong. However, his love and concern are genuine. \n\nBut is he in the wrong? If he's not using coercion or controlling behavior, just expressing his fears and asking her to quit, maybe he's being reasonable in wanting her safe but not in the wrong for having those fears. However, since she's an adult and capable of making her own decisions, he can't unilaterally decide for her. So, is he wrong to ask? It's a tough call. \n\nSome might say he's overstepping because he's trying to control her life choices. Others might see it as caring. The key is whether his request is respectful. If he's making her feel guilty or pressuring her, maybe. But the story says they're stuck in a conflict. \n\nIn terms of AITA, the community might lean towards B (he's not wrong) because he's acting out of love, but others might say A because he's not respecting her autonomy. But the question is if he's in the wrong. The answer likely hinges on whether his actions are controlling. Since he's not forcing her, just expressing his concerns, maybe he's not in the wrong. However, he's also not wrong to care. So, the answer could be B (No, he's not wrong).\n"
