She\u2019s an amazing, intelligent woman and she is my best friend. I love her to death and always want to support her in everything she does but I\u2019m struggling to do so now.\n\nMy wife works in the biomedical field, conducting research on venomous animals and how humans can use venom to cure and treat a myriad of health issues.  This means she works directly with several species of very dangerous animals. She\u2019s very passionate about her work and worked hard to get where she is today. \n\nI have always been weary of her job because it does, of course, pose a serious risk to her. But like I said I always wanted to support her and support her passions so I never really objected or made an issue of it. I may have mentioned in passing how her job makes me uneasy, but I never asked her to give it up.\n\nHowever, the issue came to a head this past year. She was bitten by a Gaboon viper (if you don\u2019t know what that is, look it up; extremely venomous snake).  She almost died and had to be rushed to the hospital. Luckily the facility she works at has antivenom on hand for these scenarios but it was still very frightening. It took her a long time to recover, yet as soon as she was fit to work again she went back to work.\n\nI have since been sick with worry every single time she goes to work. I can\u2019t sit back and pretend her work is risk-free anymore and it has caused a huge rift between us. I\u2019m constantly stressed about her getting hurt or even dying because of her job.\n\nI have asked her to stop working with venomous animals for the sake of her health. She has argued that this is her passion and likens her work to that of a police officer or firefighter; she accepts the risks of the job because she can save lives with her research. I agree with the sentiment but simply can\u2019t accept that she works in a dangerous field. I would feel the same way  if she was a police officer or firefighter.\n\nWe have had many fights about this and have hit a wall. She is not budging and neither am I. She claims that it is unfair and asshole-ish of me to ask her to give up her dream career, though she does understand my concerns.\n\nI don\u2019t know what to do or if I\u2019m being irrational so I need some help and outside opinions. Am I the jerk here? I fear that her job will be the death of her.\n\nAITA???\n\n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out whether the author is in the wrong for wanting his wife to give up her dream job. Let me start by reading through the situation carefully.\n\nThe author mentions that his wife works in biomedical research with venomous animals. She's passionate about her work and has achieved a lot in her field. However, he's been worried about the risks involved, especially after she was bitten by a Gaboon viper and almost died. Now he's asking her to stop working with venomous animals, which has caused significant stress in their relationship. The wife argues that her job is her passion and that she's in a position to save lives, similar to a police officer or firefighter who accepts risks. The author is conflicted because he supports her passion but can't get over the fear for her safety.\n\nFirst, I should consider the key points here. The author's main concern is his wife's safety. He's not opposing her career choice for selfish reasons but out of genuine fear for her life. On the other hand, the wife is pursuing a meaningful career that aligns with her passions and could have significant positive impacts through her research. She's also already faced a life-threatening situation, which she managed to recover from, and is continuing her work.\n\nNow, in terms of right and wrong, relationships often involve balancing individual desires with the well-being of the partner. The author is expressing legitimate concerns about safety, which is understandable. However, he's asking his wife to give up her career, which is a major life decision. The question is whether his request is reasonable or if it's an overreach that undermines her autonomy and professional aspirations.\n\nIt's important to note that the wife is an adult and capable of making her own decisions. While the author can express his concerns and perhaps discuss ways to mitigate risks, he can't unilaterally make that choice for her. Love and support in a relationship should include respecting each other's choices, even if they're difficult to accept. The author's stance might stem from deep care, but it's possible that he's not recognizing her agency in her career decisions. \n\nOn the flip side, the wife might need to consider her husband's feelings and perhaps find a middle ground. Maybe there are ways to reduce the risk without her leaving the field entirely. However, the core issue here is that the author is asking her to give up her career, which is a significant demand. His position might be seen as controlling if he's not allowing her to make her own choices despite the risks. \n\nBut then again, the author hasn't forced her to quit. He's expressed his concerns and is now clearly stating his position after a traumatic event. The wife is the one who's continuing, which complicates things. However, the question is whether he's in the wrong. If he's not using coercion and is instead trying to communicate his feelings, maybe he's not entirely wrong. But expecting her to quit her job based on fear could be seen as unfair, especially if she's willing to accept the risks for her passion and purpose.\n\nAnother angle is the comparison to police officers or firefighters. If she accepts the risks because her work saves lives, then the author's objection might not hold as strongly. It's a matter of differing values\u2014his desire for her safety versus her desire for her career. In that case, it's not a clear-cut right or wrong, but more about mutual understanding and compromise.\n\nIn conclusion, while the author's concerns are valid and stem from love, his insistence on her quitting her job might be seen as overstepping. The wife has the right to pursue her career despite the risks, and the author needs to respect that unless there's a way to address the safety issues without her leaving. Therefore, the author might be in the wrong for not supporting her choice, even if he's deeply worried.\n"
