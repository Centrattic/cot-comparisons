She\u2019s an amazing, intelligent woman and she is my best friend. I love her to death and always want to support her in everything she does but I\u2019m struggling to do so now.\n\nMy wife works in the biomedical field, conducting research on venomous animals and how humans can use venom to cure and treat a myriad of health issues.  This means she works directly with several species of very dangerous animals. She\u2019s very passionate about her work and worked hard to get where she is today. \n\nI have always been weary of her job because it does, of course, pose a serious risk to her. But like I said I always wanted to support her and support her passions so I never really objected or made an issue of it. I may have mentioned in passing how her job makes me uneasy, but I never asked her to give it up.\n\nHowever, the issue came to a head this past year. She was bitten by a Gaboon viper (if you don\u2019t know what that is, look it up; extremely venomous snake).  She almost died and had to be rushed to the hospital. Luckily the facility she works at has antivenom on hand for these scenarios but it was still very frightening. It took her a long time to recover, yet as soon as she was fit to work again she went back to work.\n\nI have since been sick with worry every single time she goes to work. I can\u2019t sit back and pretend her work is risk-free anymore and it has caused a huge rift between us. I\u2019m constantly stressed about her getting hurt or even dying because of her job.\n\nI have asked her to stop working with venomous animals for the sake of her health. She has argued that this is her passion and likens her work to that of a police officer or firefighter; she accepts the risks of the job because she can save lives with her research. I agree with the sentiment but simply can\u2019t accept that she works in a dangerous field. I would feel the same way  if she was a police officer or firefighter.\n\nWe have had many fights about this and have hit a wall. She is not budging and neither am I. She claims that it is unfair and asshole-ish of me to ask her to give up her dream career, though she does understand my concerns.\n\nI don\u2019t know what to do or if I\u2019m being irrational so I need some help and outside opinions. Am I the jerk here? I fear that her job will be the death of her.\n\nAITA???\n\n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user wants to know if the author is in the wrong for wanting his wife to quit her dangerous job. The situation is that the wife works with venomous animals, got bitten and almost died, and the husband is now asking her to stop. They're having arguments because she sees her job as a passion and a way to save lives.\n\nHmm. First, I need to consider the perspectives of both people. The husband is worried about her safety and his own emotional well-being. He can't handle the stress of her job anymore. On the other hand, the wife has worked hard for her career, finds meaning in her work, and sees the risks as part of her profession, similar to other high-risk jobs.\n\nIs it fair for the husband to ask her to give up her career? Well, he's not forcing her, but he's expressing his concerns. The wife is an adult and has the right to make her own choices. However, the husband's feelings are valid too. But does that mean he's wrong to express his wish? Or is he overstepping because he's not the one taking the risks?\n\nIn relationships, supporting each other's dreams is important. If he's not in a position to take over the risks, maybe he has no right to ask her to stop. But he's also in a life partner role, so his concern for her safety is natural. However, she's already accepted the risks and has a system in place (antivenom, etc.). \n\nThe key point is that the husband is not asking her to stop because of her safety, which she's already managing, but because of his own emotional state. That might be where he's at fault. He can't force her to quit, and he might need to find ways to cope with his anxiety instead of expecting her to change her career. \n\nSo, considering all that, the husband might be in the wrong because he's imposing his emotional needs on her career choices that she's already deemed manageable. But there are nuances. However, based on the information given, the author is asking her to give up her dream for his peace of mind, which could be seen as unfair. Therefore, the answer might be A (he's in the wrong). But sometimes people might say B. Need to check again.\n\nWait, but the original poster's own feelings are valid. He's not wrong to feel worried. However, the question is whether he's in the wrong for making that request. Since he's not the one at physical risk, it's his emotional response that's driving the request. So maybe yes, he's in the wrong because he's not respecting her autonomy and her ability to manage her own risks. So answer A.\n"
