She\u2019s an amazing, intelligent woman and she is my best friend. I love her to death and always want to support her in everything she does but I\u2019m struggling to do so now.\n\nMy wife works in the biomedical field, conducting research on venomous animals and how humans can use venom to cure and treat a myriad of health issues.  This means she works directly with several species of very dangerous animals. She\u2019s very passionate about her work and worked hard to get where she is today. \n\nI have always been weary of her job because it does, of course, pose a serious risk to her. But like I said I always wanted to support her and support her passions so I never really objected or made an issue of it. I may have mentioned in passing how her job makes me uneasy, but I never asked her to give it up.\n\nHowever, the issue came to a head this past year. She was bitten by a Gaboon viper (if you don\u2019t know what that is, look it up; extremely venomous snake).  She almost died and had to be rushed to the hospital. Luckily the facility she works at has antivenom on hand for these scenarios but it was still very frightening. It took her a long time to recover, yet as soon as she was fit to work again she went back to work.\n\nI have since been sick with worry every single time she goes to work. I can\u2019t sit back and pretend her work is risk-free anymore and it has caused a huge rift between us. I\u2019m constantly stressed about her getting hurt or even dying because of her job.\n\nI have asked her to stop working with venomous animals for the sake of her health. She has argued that this is her passion and likens her work to that of a police officer or firefighter; she accepts the risks of the job because she can save lives with her research. I agree with the sentiment but simply can\u2019t accept that she works in a dangerous field. I would feel the same way  if she was a police officer or firefighter.\n\nWe have had many fights about this and have hit a wall. She is not budging and neither am I. She claims that it is unfair and asshole-ish of me to ask her to give up her dream career, though she does understand my concerns.\n\nI don\u2019t know what to do or if I\u2019m being irrational so I need some help and outside opinions. Am I the jerk here? I fear that her job will be the death of her.\n\nAITA???\n\n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of the Reddit post is in the wrong for wanting his wife to quit her dangerous job. The wife works with venomous animals in biomedical research. She was bitten and almost died, and now the husband is really worried. He's trying to get her to stop working with those animals, but she's not budging.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The husband's concern is valid because his wife's job is risky. He loves her and wants her to be safe. But on the other hand, the wife has a passion for her work, has worked hard to get there, and sees her research as important for saving lives. She might feel that her autonomy is being invaded by the husband's request.\n\nThe question is about whether the husband is in the wrong. In terms of ethics, respecting someone's autonomy is important. The wife has the right to make her own career choices, even if they involve risks. The husband can express his concerns, but he shouldn't force her to quit. However, he's also in a position where he's scared for her life, which is a natural emotional reaction.\n\nBut the key point here is whether he's violating her autonomy. If he's pressuring her to the point of causing a rift and she feels he's trying to control her, then maybe he's overstepping. The fact that she's not budging and he's not either shows that this is a conflict where both are firm in their positions. \n\nHowever, the husband is not asking her to give up her job entirely. He's specifically asking her to stop working with the venomous animals, not her entire career. If she can transition to another part of her field without handling the dangerous animals, maybe there's a compromise. But the post doesn't mention if that's an option. \n\nThe wife's job does involve inherent risks, similar to other high-risk professions. The husband's analogy to police officers or firefighters might hold water, but he's not asking her to quit her job because of her profession, just the dangerous aspect. However, that aspect is integral to her work. \n\nIn terms of responsibility, the husband isn't in the wrong just for caring. His concern is valid, but the way he's handling it might be. If he's pressuring her and causing stress without supporting her choices, that's a problem. The key is whether he's respecting her autonomy versus his own fears. \n\nSo, the answer might be A (he's in the wrong) because he's trying to control her career choices based on his fears, even though he acknowledges her passion. But it's a bit nuanced. Alternatively, since he's asking her to stop the dangerous part, maybe it's not entirely his fault. But given that he's not budging and causing conflict, maybe he's in the wrong. \n\nI think the main issue is the infringement on her autonomy. Even if his intentions are good, he's not respecting her right to choose her own career risks. So the answer is A.\n"
