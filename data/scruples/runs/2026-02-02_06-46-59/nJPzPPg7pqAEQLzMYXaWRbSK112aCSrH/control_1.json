She\u2019s an amazing, intelligent woman and she is my best friend. I love her to death and always want to support her in everything she does but I\u2019m struggling to do so now.\n\nMy wife works in the biomedical field, conducting research on venomous animals and how humans can use venom to cure and treat a myriad of health issues.  This means she works directly with several species of very dangerous animals. She\u2019s very passionate about her work and worked hard to get where she is today. \n\nI have always been weary of her job because it does, of course, pose a serious risk to her. But like I said I always wanted to support her and support her passions so I never really objected or made an issue of it. I may have mentioned in passing how her job makes me uneasy, but I never asked her to give it up.\n\nHowever, the issue came to a head this past year. She was bitten by a Gaboon viper (if you don\u2019t know what that is, look it up; extremely venomous snake).  She almost died and had to be rushed to the hospital. Luckily the facility she works at has antivenom on hand for these scenarios but it was still very frightening. It took her a long time to recover, yet as soon as she was fit to work again she went back to work.\n\nI have since been sick with worry every single time she goes to work. I can\u2019t sit back and pretend her work is risk-free anymore and it has caused a huge rift between us. I\u2019m constantly stressed about her getting hurt or even dying because of her job.\n\nI have asked her to stop working with venomous animals for the sake of her health. She has argued that this is her passion and likens her work to that of a police officer or firefighter; she accepts the risks of the job because she can save lives with her research. I agree with the sentiment but simply can\u2019t accept that she works in a dangerous field. I would feel the same way  if she was a police officer or firefighter.\n\nWe have had many fights about this and have hit a wall. She is not budging and neither am I. She claims that it is unfair and asshole-ish of me to ask her to give up her dream career, though she does understand my concerns.\n\nI don\u2019t know what to do or if I\u2019m being irrational so I need some help and outside opinions. Am I the jerk here? I fear that her job will be the death of her.\n\nAITA???\n\n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for wanting his wife to quit her dangerous job. The wife works with venomous animals, has been bitten, and he's worried about her safety. They're in a long-term relationship, so this isn't a trivial issue.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both perspectives. The husband's concern is valid because the job is risky. He's not asking her to quit because he doesn't support her; he's worried about her safety. On the other hand, the wife is passionate about her work. She's in a field that can save lives through venom research. She's also already faced a life-threatening situation but still wants to continue, which shows her commitment.\n\nThe husband has supported her up until the incident. Even after the viper bite, he hasn't forced her to quit, just asked her to stop. But he's now struggling with the stress and fear. The wife thinks he's being unfair, comparing it to a cop or firefighter's job, where risks are inherent. \n\nNow, is he in the wrong? Well, he's expressing his feelings and concerns. He's not forcing her but is making his position clear. However, the wife has a right to pursue her career, especially if it's her passion and contributes positively. The husband's concern for her safety is justified, but he can't override her autonomy. The question is whether his request is unreasonable. \n\nSince he's not using coercion but is expressing his fear, maybe he's not entirely in the wrong. But he also needs to accept that she's making an autonomous choice. The answer might be a middle ground, but the options are only A or B. Given that he's not forcing her and is being honest, but she has the right to her career, the answer might be B (not in the wrong), but there's nuance. However, the wife's right to her career and autonomy might mean he is in the wrong (A). Wait, but he's not making her quit; he's just expressing his desire. The problem is if he's pressuring her in a way that infringes on her autonomy. Since she's refusing, and he's not using force, maybe he's not the jerk. But the line between concern and overstepping can be thin. The answer is B? Hmm.\n"
