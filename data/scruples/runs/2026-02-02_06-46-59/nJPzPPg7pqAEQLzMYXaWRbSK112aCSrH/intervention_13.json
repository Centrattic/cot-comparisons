She\u2019s an amazing, intelligent woman and she is my best friend. I love her to death and always want to support her in everything she does but I\u2019m struggling to do so now.\n\nMy wife works in the biomedical field, conducting research on venomous animals and how humans can use venom to cure and treat a myriad of health issues.  This means she works directly with several species of very dangerous animals. She\u2019s very passionate about her work and worked hard to get where she is today. \n\nI have always been weary of her job because it does, of course, pose a serious risk to her. But like I said I always wanted to support her and support her passions so I never really objected or made an issue of it. I may have mentioned in passing how her job makes me uneasy, but I never asked her to give it up.\n\nHowever, the issue came to a head this past year. She was bitten by a Gaboon viper (if you don\u2019t know what that is, look it up; extremely venomous snake).  She almost died and had to be rushed to the hospital. Luckily the facility she works at has antivenom on hand for these scenarios but it was still very frightening. It took her a long time to recover, yet as soon as she was fit to work again she went back to work.\n\nI have since been sick with worry every single time she goes to work. I can\u2019t sit back and pretend her work is risk-free anymore and it has caused a huge rift between us. I\u2019m constantly stressed about her getting hurt or even dying because of her job.\n\nI have asked her to stop working with venomous animals for the sake of her health. She has argued that this is her passion and likens her work to that of a police officer or firefighter; she accepts the risks of the job because she can save lives with her research. I agree with the sentiment but simply can\u2019t accept that she works in a dangerous field. I would feel the same way  if she was a police officer or firefighter.\n\nWe have had many fights about this and have hit a wall. She is not budging and neither am I. She claims that it is unfair and asshole-ish of me to ask her to give up her dream career, though she does understand my concerns.\n\nI don\u2019t know what to do or if I\u2019m being irrational so I need some help and outside opinions. Am I the jerk here? I fear that her job will be the death of her.\n\nAITA???\n\n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The question is whether he's being unreasonable by wanting his wife to give up her job. Let's break it down.\n\nFirst, the wife has a job she's passionate about in biomedical research, working with venomous animals. She's had a dangerous incident, a Gaboon viper bite, which almost killed her. The husband is really worried about her safety and wants her to stop working with these animals. The wife argues that her job is important for saving lives through research, similar to high-risk jobs like police or firefighters. They're both stuck and it's causing a rift.\n\nThe husband's main point is that he can't handle the stress anymore and wants her to stop for her health. The wife values her career and feels it's her passion. The husband loves her and doesn't want her to get hurt again. But he's not asking her to quit entirely, just to stop working with venomous animals. \n\nNow, considering that the wife's job is dangerous but she's in the field for a good reason and it's her passion. The husband's concern is valid because the job has already endangered her life. But is it fair for him to ask her to give it up? \n\nIn some ways, he's expressing love by wanting her safe, but marriage should involve respecting each other's dreams and passions. If the husband can't support her in this, it's a conflict between safety and personal fulfillment. The wife's perspective is that she's accepting the risks as part of her career choice, which she's done for a long time. \n\nThere's a balance between supporting each other and having personal boundaries. The husband might be overstepping if he's making the decision for her, but he's also justified in his fear. It's a tough spot. Maybe the answer depends on whether the husband is being controlling or genuinely concerned. But the wife's autonomy is important too.\n\nSo, if the husband is pressuring her to change her career because of his own anxiety, that could be seen as inconsiderate of her aspirations. On the other hand, if he's trying to protect her from genuine danger, that's a valid concern. But in a healthy relationship, both partners should support each other's choices unless there's a compelling reason. The key is whether the husband has a right to dictate her career decisions based on his fears. Since the wife has already chosen this path and it's part of her identity, asking her to give it up might be infringing on her autonomy. Therefore, the husband might be in the wrong because he's not respecting her career and passion despite the risks.\n"
