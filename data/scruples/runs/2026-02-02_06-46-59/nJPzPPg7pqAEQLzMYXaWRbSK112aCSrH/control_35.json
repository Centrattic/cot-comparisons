She\u2019s an amazing, intelligent woman and she is my best friend. I love her to death and always want to support her in everything she does but I\u2019m struggling to do so now.\n\nMy wife works in the biomedical field, conducting research on venomous animals and how humans can use venom to cure and treat a myriad of health issues.  This means she works directly with several species of very dangerous animals. She\u2019s very passionate about her work and worked hard to get where she is today. \n\nI have always been weary of her job because it does, of course, pose a serious risk to her. But like I said I always wanted to support her and support her passions so I never really objected or made an issue of it. I may have mentioned in passing how her job makes me uneasy, but I never asked her to give it up.\n\nHowever, the issue came to a head this past year. She was bitten by a Gaboon viper (if you don\u2019t know what that is, look it up; extremely venomous snake).  She almost died and had to be rushed to the hospital. Luckily the facility she works at has antivenom on hand for these scenarios but it was still very frightening. It took her a long time to recover, yet as soon as she was fit to work again she went back to work.\n\nI have since been sick with worry every single time she goes to work. I can\u2019t sit back and pretend her work is risk-free anymore and it has caused a huge rift between us. I\u2019m constantly stressed about her getting hurt or even dying because of her job.\n\nI have asked her to stop working with venomous animals for the sake of her health. She has argued that this is her passion and likens her work to that of a police officer or firefighter; she accepts the risks of the job because she can save lives with her research. I agree with the sentiment but simply can\u2019t accept that she works in a dangerous field. I would feel the same way  if she was a police officer or firefighter.\n\nWe have had many fights about this and have hit a wall. She is not budging and neither am I. She claims that it is unfair and asshole-ish of me to ask her to give up her dream career, though she does understand my concerns.\n\nI don\u2019t know what to do or if I\u2019m being irrational so I need some help and outside opinions. Am I the jerk here? I fear that her job will be the death of her.\n\nAITA???\n\n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the Reddit post is in the wrong for wanting his wife to give up her dangerous job. The wife works with venomous animals and had a serious accident. The husband is worried about her safety, but she's passionate about her career.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The husband's argument is that his role as a partner is to protect her, and he's justified in his fear because her job poses real risks. He's not asking her to quit entirely but to stop working with venomous animals. On the other hand, the wife's career is her passion and contributes to medical research, which is meaningful. She's accepted the risks, similar to other high-risk professions.\n\nI should think about the principles of personal freedom and mutual respect in a relationship. The husband isn't forcing her to quit, but he's expressing his concerns, which is valid. However, her right to pursue her dream job is also important. The key here is whether the husband is overstepping by pressuring her to change her career choice. \n\nAnother angle: the husband's emotional response is valid, but he can't control her career. The wife might feel that her autonomy is being undermined. The question is whether his concern is reasonable enough to justify his request. Since he's not asking her to leave the field entirely but just to avoid the dangerous part, maybe he has a point. But the wife has already chosen this path, and the husband is only now pushing back after a traumatic event.\n\nI also need to consider if there's a middle ground. Maybe they can find a compromise, like her reducing the risk or him finding ways to cope with his anxiety without controlling her career. However, the question is about whether he's in the wrong. \n\nIn relationships, partners should support each other's goals. The husband's support is there, but his fear is causing conflict. It's a tough call, but if he's not forcing her and just expressing his concerns, maybe he's not in the wrong. However, if his demands are infringing on her autonomy, that's a problem. The answer might depend on cultural or personal values, but generally, respecting a partner's career choices is crucial. So, the husband's position could be seen as reasonable in wanting her safety, but the wife's right to her career is also important. The answer isn't clear-cut, but perhaps the husband isn't in the wrong because his concern is about her safety, but he should find a way to support her while managing his anxiety.\n"
