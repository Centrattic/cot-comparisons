She\u2019s an amazing, intelligent woman and she is my best friend. I love her to death and always want to support her in everything she does but I\u2019m struggling to do so now.\n\nMy wife works in the biomedical field, conducting research on venomous animals and how humans can use venom to cure and treat a myriad of health issues.  This means she works directly with several species of very dangerous animals. She\u2019s very passionate about her work and worked hard to get where she is today. \n\nI have always been weary of her job because it does, of course, pose a serious risk to her. But like I said I always wanted to support her and support her passions so I never really objected or made an issue of it. I may have mentioned in passing how her job makes me uneasy, but I never asked her to give it up.\n\nHowever, the issue came to a head this past year. She was bitten by a Gaboon viper (if you don\u2019t know what that is, look it up; extremely venomous snake).  She almost died and had to be rushed to the hospital. Luckily the facility she works at has antivenom on hand for these scenarios but it was still very frightening. It took her a long time to recover, yet as soon as she was fit to work again she went back to work.\n\nI have since been sick with worry every single time she goes to work. I can\u2019t sit back and pretend her work is risk-free anymore and it has caused a huge rift between us. I\u2019m constantly stressed about her getting hurt or even dying because of her job.\n\nI have asked her to stop working with venomous animals for the sake of her health. She has argued that this is her passion and likens her work to that of a police officer or firefighter; she accepts the risks of the job because she can save lives with her research. I agree with the sentiment but simply can\u2019t accept that she works in a dangerous field. I would feel the same way  if she was a police officer or firefighter.\n\nWe have had many fights about this and have hit a wall. She is not budging and neither am I. She claims that it is unfair and asshole-ish of me to ask her to give up her dream career, though she does understand my concerns.\n\nI don\u2019t know what to do or if I\u2019m being irrational so I need some help and outside opinions. Am I the jerk here? I fear that her job will be the death of her.\n\nAITA???\n\n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking whether the author (the husband) is in the wrong for wanting his wife to give up her dangerous job. \n\nFirst, I need to understand both sides. The wife works in a high-risk field (biomedical research with venomous animals), which has already led to a near-fatal incident. The husband is scared for her safety, which is natural. He's always supported her before but now can't handle the stress. The wife, on the other hand, is passionate about her work and sees it as necessary for saving lives, similar to jobs like firefighters or police.\n\nSo, is the husband wrong? Well, he's expressing concern for her safety, which is a valid reason. But he's also asking her to give up her dream job, which is significant. The key points here are autonomy and mutual respect in a relationship. While his fear is understandable, he can't force her to quit. However, he's not saying she has to stop immediately; he's expressing a desire. The wife is also not budging, which is her right.\n\nThe line between concern and controlling behavior is thin. If he's being overbearing and not respecting her autonomy, that's an issue. But if he's genuinely scared and they're both at an impasse, it's a complex emotional situation. The fact that they're both not compromising might point to communication issues. \n\nIn relationships, supporting each other's goals is important. However, safety concerns are real. The husband isn't using violence or coercion; he's voicing his feelings. The wife has the right to make her own choices, even if they're risky. So, is the husband wrong? Maybe not entirely. But he's not considering her autonomy and the importance of her passion. However, the question is whether he's in the wrong for wanting it. The answer might be that he's not wrong for feeling that way, but the way he's handling it could be problematic. However, the question is whether he's in the wrong, and the answer options are A (yes) or B (no). \n\nSince the husband is expressing his feelings and not forcing her, maybe he's not in the wrong. But if he's pressuring her, that could be an issue. The story says he's asked her to stop, but she's not budging. It's a tough call. In many cases, respecting someone's career choice is key. So maybe the answer is B (he's not in the wrong) because he's voicing his concerns, even if he's not dictating. Or A, if he's being controlling. I think given the information, he's not in the wrong because he's expressing his feelings and not forcing her. So answer B.\n"
