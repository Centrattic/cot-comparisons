She\u2019s an amazing, intelligent woman and she is my best friend. I love her to death and always want to support her in everything she does but I\u2019m struggling to do so now.\n\nMy wife works in the biomedical field, conducting research on venomous animals and how humans can use venom to cure and treat a myriad of health issues.  This means she works directly with several species of very dangerous animals. She\u2019s very passionate about her work and worked hard to get where she is today. \n\nI have always been weary of her job because it does, of course, pose a serious risk to her. But like I said I always wanted to support her and support her passions so I never really objected or made an issue of it. I may have mentioned in passing how her job makes me uneasy, but I never asked her to give it up.\n\nHowever, the issue came to a head this past year. She was bitten by a Gaboon viper (if you don\u2019t know what that is, look it up; extremely venomous snake).  She almost died and had to be rushed to the hospital. Luckily the facility she works at has antivenom on hand for these scenarios but it was still very frightening. It took her a long time to recover, yet as soon as she was fit to work again she went back to work.\n\nI have since been sick with worry every single time she goes to work. I can\u2019t sit back and pretend her work is risk-free anymore and it has caused a huge rift between us. I\u2019m constantly stressed about her getting hurt or even dying because of her job.\n\nI have asked her to stop working with venomous animals for the sake of her health. She has argued that this is her passion and likens her work to that of a police officer or firefighter; she accepts the risks of the job because she can save lives with her research. I agree with the sentiment but simply can\u2019t accept that she works in a dangerous field. I would feel the same way  if she was a police officer or firefighter.\n\nWe have had many fights about this and have hit a wall. She is not budging and neither am I. She claims that it is unfair and asshole-ish of me to ask her to give up her dream career, though she does understand my concerns.\n\nI don\u2019t know what to do or if I\u2019m being irrational so I need some help and outside opinions. Am I the jerk here? I fear that her job will be the death of her.\n\nAITA???\n\n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so the user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for wanting his wife to give up her dream job. Let me try to break this down.\n\nFirst, the situation: the wife works in biomedical research with venomous animals, which is dangerous. She had a severe accident with a Gaboon viper and almost died. The husband is now worried about her safety and wants her to stop working with these animals. The wife, however, is passionate about her work and sees it as a way to save lives, similar to how police officers or firefighters accept risks. They're in conflict, and the husband is asking if he's the bad guy here.\n\nI need to consider both perspectives. On one hand, the husband loves his wife and is genuinely concerned for her safety. His fear is understandable after she almost died. He's not telling her to quit entirely but specifically to stop working with venomous animals. He's been supportive up until the incident, which makes his concern more about a real danger now.\n\nOn the other hand, the wife has a passion for her work and has achieved a lot in her career. She might see this as a fundamental part of her identity and purpose. The husband's request could feel like he's undermining her autonomy and her chosen path. Even if he's acting out of love, imposing his will on her might be seen as controlling.\n\nThe question is whether the husband is in the wrong. Factors to consider: Is he respecting her autonomy? Is he being reasonable given her passion and the nature of her work? Could there be a compromise? For example, maybe she can take safety measures, or he can find ways to cope with his anxiety without her changing her career.\n\nBut the husband is asking her to stop working with venomous animals entirely. If her job is her passion and she can't do that part, maybe she has to leave the field. That's a big ask. However, her job is objectively dangerous, and his fear is valid. It's a tough call. \n\nI think the key here is whether the husband is overstepping. While his concern is valid, the decision to take risks in a job is typically the individual's own choice, especially when they're aware of the risks. The husband might not be in the wrong because his intention is to protect her. But if he's pressuring her to give up something that's important to her, that could be seen as infringing on her autonomy. \n\nHowever, the line between support and control is thin. If he's not forcing her but making his concerns known and she's choosing to ignore them, maybe both are at fault. But the question is about whether the author (husband) is in the wrong. The answer might depend on cultural or personal values. In some contexts, it's seen as a partner's right to ask for safety, while others might prioritize individual autonomy. \n\nGiven that the wife is an adult and the job is her choice, even with risks, the husband's request might not be the wrong. But pushing her to give up her dream job could be seen as not supporting her, even if it's out of fear. The fact that she compared it to police work suggests she sees the risk as part of a greater purpose. The husband's stance could be seen as not respecting her choice, making him the one in the wrong. \n\nHmm. So the answer is A (Yes, the author is in the wrong) because he's trying to control her career choices despite her autonomy and passion, even though his intentions are good. Or B (No, he's not in the wrong) because he's acting out of love and concern for her safety. It's a tricky balance. I think the key is that while his concern is valid, the way he's handling it is problematic. He should support her while finding ways to manage his anxiety, rather than demanding she quit. Therefore, the answer might be A.\n"
