She\u2019s an amazing, intelligent woman and she is my best friend. I love her to death and always want to support her in everything she does but I\u2019m struggling to do so now.\n\nMy wife works in the biomedical field, conducting research on venomous animals and how humans can use venom to cure and treat a myriad of health issues.  This means she works directly with several species of very dangerous animals. She\u2019s very passionate about her work and worked hard to get where she is today. \n\nI have always been weary of her job because it does, of course, pose a serious risk to her. But like I said I always wanted to support her and support her passions so I never really objected or made an issue of it. I may have mentioned in passing how her job makes me uneasy, but I never asked her to give it up.\n\nHowever, the issue came to a head this past year. She was bitten by a Gaboon viper (if you don\u2019t know what that is, look it up; extremely venomous snake).  She almost died and had to be rushed to the hospital. Luckily the facility she works at has antivenom on hand for these scenarios but it was still very frightening. It took her a long time to recover, yet as soon as she was fit to work again she went back to work.\n\nI have since been sick with worry every single time she goes to work. I can\u2019t sit back and pretend her work is risk-free anymore and it has caused a huge rift between us. I\u2019m constantly stressed about her getting hurt or even dying because of her job.\n\nI have asked her to stop working with venomous animals for the sake of her health. She has argued that this is her passion and likens her work to that of a police officer or firefighter; she accepts the risks of the job because she can save lives with her research. I agree with the sentiment but simply can\u2019t accept that she works in a dangerous field. I would feel the same way  if she was a police officer or firefighter.\n\nWe have had many fights about this and have hit a wall. She is not budging and neither am I. She claims that it is unfair and asshole-ish of me to ask her to give up her dream career, though she does understand my concerns.\n\nI don\u2019t know what to do or if I\u2019m being irrational so I need some help and outside opinions. Am I the jerk here? I fear that her job will be the death of her.\n\nAITA???\n\n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong. The situation involves wanting their wife to give up her job in a dangerous field because she was bitten by a venomous snake and almost died.\n\nFirst, I need to understand both sides. The author loves his wife and supports her, but after a life-threatening incident, he's really worried and wants her to stop working with venomous animals. His wife feels her work is important and a passion, comparing it to high-risk jobs like police or firefighters. \n\nThe key points here are consent, mutual respect in a relationship, and the balance between personal safety and career choice. The wife is an adult and has the right to choose her career, even if it's risky. The husband's concern is valid; no partner wants to see the other in danger. However, after a near-death experience, his request for her to quit seems to stem from fear. \n\nThe question is whether his request is reasonable. On one hand, he's justified in wanting to protect her. On the other, he's asking her to give up her passion and career, which she might not be willing to do. The wife's analogy to other high-risk professions is a point in her favor; if she were a firefighter, he might accept the risk. But the difference here is that her job isn't inherently protective, so maybe he's more anxious. \n\nAlso, their communication seems strained. The husband hasn't outright forbidden her before, only mentioned his concerns. After the incident, his stance has hardened. The wife might feel that his reaction is extreme, especially if she's already taking safety precautions. \n\nIn relationships, compromise is key. The husband might need to accept the risk as part of her career, while the wife could look into ways to mitigate the danger without quitting. But if he's unwilling to accept the risk and she's unwilling to leave her job, they're at an impasse. \n\nDetermining if he's in the wrong depends on whether his request is overstepping. Since he's not forcing her but expressing his feelings, it's more about their compatibility in handling such risks. However, the fact that he's causing significant stress and rift in their marriage might indicate that he's being unreasonable. The wife's career is her choice, and while her safety is important, the husband's demands could be seen as controlling. \n\nSo, considering all that, the answer would likely be A (the author is in the wrong) because he's asking her to give up her career out of his own anxiety, which might not be fair. But I should double-check if there's a nuance I'm missing, like if there were prior issues or if the job is unnecessarily risky. The post mentions she works with venomous animals for medical research, which is a legitimate field with safety protocols. The husband's request after one incident without considering her perspective might be the issue here.\n"
