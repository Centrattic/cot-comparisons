She\u2019s an amazing, intelligent woman and she is my best friend. I love her to death and always want to support her in everything she does but I\u2019m struggling to do so now.\n\nMy wife works in the biomedical field, conducting research on venomous animals and how humans can use venom to cure and treat a myriad of health issues.  This means she works directly with several species of very dangerous animals. She\u2019s very passionate about her work and worked hard to get where she is today. \n\nI have always been weary of her job because it does, of course, pose a serious risk to her. But like I said I always wanted to support her and support her passions so I never really objected or made an issue of it. I may have mentioned in passing how her job makes me uneasy, but I never asked her to give it up.\n\nHowever, the issue came to a head this past year. She was bitten by a Gaboon viper (if you don\u2019t know what that is, look it up; extremely venomous snake).  She almost died and had to be rushed to the hospital. Luckily the facility she works at has antivenom on hand for these scenarios but it was still very frightening. It took her a long time to recover, yet as soon as she was fit to work again she went back to work.\n\nI have since been sick with worry every single time she goes to work. I can\u2019t sit back and pretend her work is risk-free anymore and it has caused a huge rift between us. I\u2019m constantly stressed about her getting hurt or even dying because of her job.\n\nI have asked her to stop working with venomous animals for the sake of her health. She has argued that this is her passion and likens her work to that of a police officer or firefighter; she accepts the risks of the job because she can save lives with her research. I agree with the sentiment but simply can\u2019t accept that she works in a dangerous field. I would feel the same way  if she was a police officer or firefighter.\n\nWe have had many fights about this and have hit a wall. She is not budging and neither am I. She claims that it is unfair and asshole-ish of me to ask her to give up her dream career, though she does understand my concerns.\n\nI don\u2019t know what to do or if I\u2019m being irrational so I need some help and outside opinions. Am I the jerk here? I fear that her job will be the death of her.\n\nAITA???\n\n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of the Reddit post is in the wrong for wanting his wife to quit her dangerous job. Let me try to break this down.\n\nFirst, the wife has a job in biomedical research with venomous animals, which is dangerous. She was bitten and almost died, but she continues. The husband supports her in general but is now worried about the risks. He's asked her to stop, but she won't. He's struggling because he can't be okay with the risk anymore, and it's causing marital problems.\n\nSo, is he in the wrong? Well, he's not forcing her to quit, just asking. He's voiced his concerns after a traumatic event. On one hand, he's a spouse who cares about her safety. On the other, he's trying to control her career choice. \n\nBut wait, the wife is an adult and her own person. Her job is her passion, and she's accepted the risks. The husband doesn't control her career decisions. Even if he's scared, he can't unilaterally decide that for her. He's not being irrational, but he's also not respecting her autonomy. \n\nThe key point is that the husband is expressing his concerns but not forcing her to quit. However, expecting her to give up her career because he's scared might be overstepping. The wife has her own right to take risks, especially when she's in a job that can have positive impacts. \n\nBut the husband's feelings are valid too. He's worried about her safety. But that doesn't mean he's wrong. It's a conflict between personal safety and career passion. The problem is that he's not the one to dictate her choices. So maybe he's not in the wrong for expressing his worries, but he's not considering her autonomy enough. \n\nWait, the question is whether he's in the wrong. The answer depends on whether it's his right to ask her to quit. Since he's not forcing her, but just asking, and she's not budging, maybe he's not in the wrong for having the concern. However, if he's pressuring her in a way that's controlling, that's different. But the post says they hit a wall. He's not forcing her, so maybe he's not wrong. But also, he's not respecting her autonomy. \n\nHmm. The answer might be a bit nuanced. But according to typical AITA logic, if someone is asking their partner to leave a dangerous job, that's often seen as controlling. However, if the partner is in a high-risk job and the spouse is genuinely scared, it's a tough spot. \n\nI think the answer here is that he's not in the wrong for expressing his concerns, but maybe he's not considering her autonomy enough. However, since he's not forcing her to quit, and the question is whether he's in the wrong, the answer might be B (No), but I'm a bit torn. But in the context of AITA posts, spouses asking partners to leave their jobs can be seen as jerks if they're not respecting the partner's choice. So maybe AITA would say he's the jerk, hence answer A. Wait, but he's not forcing her. He's just asking. But the wife is the one who's not budging. \n\nAlternatively, in the AITA context, if the husband is causing a rift and being controlling, he might be the AITA. But if he's genuinely scared for her life, some might see it as valid. It's a tough balance. The answer could go either way, but I think in many cases, the person asking their spouse to abandon their career for safety reasons is seen as the jerk, hence answer A. But I'm not 100% sure. Alternatively, the answer could be B if it's seen as reasonable concern. \n\nWait, the key is that the wife is in a job that she's passionate about and has her own reasons. The husband's fear is valid, but he can't make her quit. So he's not in the wrong for caring, but he's also not considering her autonomy. So maybe AITA would say he's not in the wrong for having the concern, but he's not considering her perspective enough. But the question is whether he's in the wrong. \n\nIn the AITA context, I think the community often sides with the person who's standing up for their own safety and autonomy. So if the husband is pressuring her, that could be seen as the jerk. However, if he's just expressing his concerns without forcing her, maybe not. But in this case, he's not forcing her but is stuck in a conflict. \n\nHmm. Maybe the answer is B (No), because his intentions are to protect her, and he's not forcing her to quit. However, the fact that he's pressuring her and causing conflict might make him the jerk. So maybe A. But I'm a bit confused. \n\nI think the answer is B (No), because he's not the one making her quit; he's just expressing his concerns. But the wife's autonomy is important. However, the husband's fear is valid. So the answer could be B, but I'm not sure. Alternatively, A because he's not respecting her choice. \n\nWait, the user is asking if he's in the wrong. If the answer is that he's not in the wrong for being concerned, then B. But if the answer is he is wrong for pressuring her, then A. \n\nIn the Reddit context, similar posts where a spouse wants the other to quit a dangerous job often result in the spouse being the AITA. For example, if someone works in a dangerous job and the partner wants them to quit, the partner is often seen as the jerk. So maybe the answer is A. \n\nBut in this case, the husband isn't forcing her; he's just asking. The wife is the one who's not giving in. So maybe the answer is B because he's not forcing her to quit. But if he's pressuring her, then maybe A. \n\nI think the answer is B because he's not in the wrong for having the concern, but the wife's autonomy is more important. However, the husband's actions are causing conflict. Hmm. \n\nAlternatively, the answer is A because he's trying to control her career. So the answer is A. \n\nWait, the question is whether he's in the wrong. So, if the community sees that he's trying to control her job and it's her choice, he's wrong. So answer A. But if it's seen as a valid concern, answer B. \n\nI think in this case, the answer is B. Because he's not forcing her to quit, but he's expressing his concerns. However, the wife is an adult and can make her own choices. But the husband's fear is valid. \n\nThis is a tough one. I think the answer is B (No), meaning he's not in the wrong for being concerned, but that's a bit of a toss-up. Alternatively, A (Yes) because he's not respecting her autonomy. \n\nBut given that he's not forcing her to quit and just wants her to give up the job for safety, and she's not budging, maybe it's not his fault. However, in AITA terms, maybe he's not the jerk. \n\nI think the answer is B. No, he's not in the wrong.\n"
