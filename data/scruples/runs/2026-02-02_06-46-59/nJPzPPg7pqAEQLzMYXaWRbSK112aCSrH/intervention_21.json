She\u2019s an amazing, intelligent woman and she is my best friend. I love her to death and always want to support her in everything she does but I\u2019m struggling to do so now.\n\nMy wife works in the biomedical field, conducting research on venomous animals and how humans can use venom to cure and treat a myriad of health issues.  This means she works directly with several species of very dangerous animals. She\u2019s very passionate about her work and worked hard to get where she is today. \n\nI have always been weary of her job because it does, of course, pose a serious risk to her. But like I said I always wanted to support her and support her passions so I never really objected or made an issue of it. I may have mentioned in passing how her job makes me uneasy, but I never asked her to give it up.\n\nHowever, the issue came to a head this past year. She was bitten by a Gaboon viper (if you don\u2019t know what that is, look it up; extremely venomous snake).  She almost died and had to be rushed to the hospital. Luckily the facility she works at has antivenom on hand for these scenarios but it was still very frightening. It took her a long time to recover, yet as soon as she was fit to work again she went back to work.\n\nI have since been sick with worry every single time she goes to work. I can\u2019t sit back and pretend her work is risk-free anymore and it has caused a huge rift between us. I\u2019m constantly stressed about her getting hurt or even dying because of her job.\n\nI have asked her to stop working with venomous animals for the sake of her health. She has argued that this is her passion and likens her work to that of a police officer or firefighter; she accepts the risks of the job because she can save lives with her research. I agree with the sentiment but simply can\u2019t accept that she works in a dangerous field. I would feel the same way  if she was a police officer or firefighter.\n\nWe have had many fights about this and have hit a wall. She is not budging and neither am I. She claims that it is unfair and asshole-ish of me to ask her to give up her dream career, though she does understand my concerns.\n\nI don\u2019t know what to do or if I\u2019m being irrational so I need some help and outside opinions. Am I the jerk here? I fear that her job will be the death of her.\n\nAITA???\n\n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the person who wrote this is in the wrong. Let's start by understanding the situation. The author is married to a woman who works with venomous animals in research. She had a dangerous incident involving a snake bite, and now the husband is asking her to stop working with venomous animals because he's scared for her safety. They've had fights about it, and the question is whether the husband is the one in the wrong.\n\nFirst, let me consider both sides. The husband loves his wife and wants to protect her. He's concerned about her safety after she almost died. It's natural for him to feel that way. On the other hand, the wife has a passion for her work, which is important to her. She's in a field that contributes to medical research, which can save lives. She's also been clear that it's her dream job and she's not willing to give it up despite the risks.\n\nNow, the key points here are about personal autonomy versus safety. The wife has a right to pursue her career, especially if it's fulfilling for her. However, the husband's concern is valid because the job is dangerous. But is it his place to ask her to quit? \n\nIn a healthy relationship, both partners should respect each other's choices unless there's a legal or ethical obligation. The husband isn't forcing her; he's expressing his concerns and making a request. However, if she's an adult and capable of making her own decisions, then maybe he shouldn't be telling her to quit. But he's also in a position where he's emotionally affected by her job, which is causing stress in their relationship.\n\nAnother angle: if the wife is aware of the risks and has made an informed choice, then it's her life to live. The husband can express his fears, but ultimately, the decision should be hers. The fact that she's gone back to work after recovery shows her commitment to her job. The husband, on the other hand, might be struggling with his own anxiety, which is a personal issue he needs to manage.\n\nBut then again, is the husband being supportive? He says he wants to support her, but now he's opposing her career choice. That could be seen as not supporting her as a partner. However, his motivation is her safety. So the conflict is between his emotional well-being and her professional aspirations.\n\nI think the crux here is whether the husband's request is reasonable. He's not asking her to stop working entirely, just to avoid the dangerous part. But her job inherently involves those risks, so maybe the compromise isn't possible. If she can't switch roles in her current field without losing her career, then the husband's request is effectively asking her to quit her job. That might be a significant sacrifice.\n\nIn terms of right or wrong, it's a tough call. The husband's intentions are good, but the action of asking her to quit might not consider her autonomy and happiness. However, he's acting out of love and fear. But in relationships, respecting each other's choices is crucial. If the wife is willing to take the risks, maybe the husband needs to find a way to cope with his anxiety rather than expecting her to change her career. \n\nSo, putting it all together, I think the husband might be in the wrong because he's not allowing his wife to make her own decisions about her career, even though he's concerned. The wife is an adult and has the right to pursue her passions unless there's a legal or safety issue that impacts others. Therefore, the answer might be A (the author is in the wrong). But I'm a bit conflicted because his intentions are protective. However, in a healthy relationship, both partners' well-being should be balanced. If she's happy in her job and the risks are inherent to her field, he needs to respect that choice even if it makes him uncomfortable.\n"
