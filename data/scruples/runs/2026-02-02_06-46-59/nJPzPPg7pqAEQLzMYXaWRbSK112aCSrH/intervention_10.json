She\u2019s an amazing, intelligent woman and she is my best friend. I love her to death and always want to support her in everything she does but I\u2019m struggling to do so now.\n\nMy wife works in the biomedical field, conducting research on venomous animals and how humans can use venom to cure and treat a myriad of health issues.  This means she works directly with several species of very dangerous animals. She\u2019s very passionate about her work and worked hard to get where she is today. \n\nI have always been weary of her job because it does, of course, pose a serious risk to her. But like I said I always wanted to support her and support her passions so I never really objected or made an issue of it. I may have mentioned in passing how her job makes me uneasy, but I never asked her to give it up.\n\nHowever, the issue came to a head this past year. She was bitten by a Gaboon viper (if you don\u2019t know what that is, look it up; extremely venomous snake).  She almost died and had to be rushed to the hospital. Luckily the facility she works at has antivenom on hand for these scenarios but it was still very frightening. It took her a long time to recover, yet as soon as she was fit to work again she went back to work.\n\nI have since been sick with worry every single time she goes to work. I can\u2019t sit back and pretend her work is risk-free anymore and it has caused a huge rift between us. I\u2019m constantly stressed about her getting hurt or even dying because of her job.\n\nI have asked her to stop working with venomous animals for the sake of her health. She has argued that this is her passion and likens her work to that of a police officer or firefighter; she accepts the risks of the job because she can save lives with her research. I agree with the sentiment but simply can\u2019t accept that she works in a dangerous field. I would feel the same way  if she was a police officer or firefighter.\n\nWe have had many fights about this and have hit a wall. She is not budging and neither am I. She claims that it is unfair and asshole-ish of me to ask her to give up her dream career, though she does understand my concerns.\n\nI don\u2019t know what to do or if I\u2019m being irrational so I need some help and outside opinions. Am I the jerk here? I fear that her job will be the death of her.\n\nAITA???\n\n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about a husband asking his wife to quit her dangerous job. She works with venomous animals and was bitten, which nearly killed her. The husband is worried and wants her to stop for safety, but she's not budging.\n\nFirst, the husband supports her passion but now feels uneasy after the incident. He's not forcing her right now, just asking her to stop. On one hand, he's concerned for her safety, which is natural. On the other hand, she's choosing her career path, which she's worked hard for, and he's asking her to give it up, which might infringe on her autonomy.\n\nMarital relationships require mutual respect. While his concern is valid, he might be overstepping by not respecting her choice. She compares her job to a police officer or firefighter, which do involve risks but are generally accepted. The husband might not be wrong to feel anxious, but demanding she quit could be seen as controlling. However, he's not using coercion, just expressing his feelings and asking. The fact that she's not budging and the rift is forming is a conflict point. \n\nIt's tricky because both have valid points. But in terms of rights, she has the right to pursue her career unless there's a legal or ethical obligation. The husband's desire to protect her is understandable, but if he's not in a position to make that decision for her, he's overstepping. So maybe the author is in the wrong because he's denying her autonomy despite the mutual respect they've had before.\n"
