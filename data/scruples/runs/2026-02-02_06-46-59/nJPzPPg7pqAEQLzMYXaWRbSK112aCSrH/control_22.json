She\u2019s an amazing, intelligent woman and she is my best friend. I love her to death and always want to support her in everything she does but I\u2019m struggling to do so now.\n\nMy wife works in the biomedical field, conducting research on venomous animals and how humans can use venom to cure and treat a myriad of health issues.  This means she works directly with several species of very dangerous animals. She\u2019s very passionate about her work and worked hard to get where she is today. \n\nI have always been weary of her job because it does, of course, pose a serious risk to her. But like I said I always wanted to support her and support her passions so I never really objected or made an issue of it. I may have mentioned in passing how her job makes me uneasy, but I never asked her to give it up.\n\nHowever, the issue came to a head this past year. She was bitten by a Gaboon viper (if you don\u2019t know what that is, look it up; extremely venomous snake).  She almost died and had to be rushed to the hospital. Luckily the facility she works at has antivenom on hand for these scenarios but it was still very frightening. It took her a long time to recover, yet as soon as she was fit to work again she went back to work.\n\nI have since been sick with worry every single time she goes to work. I can\u2019t sit back and pretend her work is risk-free anymore and it has caused a huge rift between us. I\u2019m constantly stressed about her getting hurt or even dying because of her job.\n\nI have asked her to stop working with venomous animals for the sake of her health. She has argued that this is her passion and likens her work to that of a police officer or firefighter; she accepts the risks of the job because she can save lives with her research. I agree with the sentiment but simply can\u2019t accept that she works in a dangerous field. I would feel the same way  if she was a police officer or firefighter.\n\nWe have had many fights about this and have hit a wall. She is not budging and neither am I. She claims that it is unfair and asshole-ish of me to ask her to give up her dream career, though she does understand my concerns.\n\nI don\u2019t know what to do or if I\u2019m being irrational so I need some help and outside opinions. Am I the jerk here? I fear that her job will be the death of her.\n\nAITA???\n\n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is that he wants his wife to give up her dream job because it's dangerous. She works with venomous animals and was even bitten, which almost killed her. They're now arguing about it.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The author's main concern is his wife's safety. He's worried about her getting hurt or dying because of her job. He loves her a lot and wants to protect her. That makes sense. But his wife sees her job as a passion and a way to contribute to important research. She compares it to jobs like police officers or firefighters, which are also risky but accepted in society. \n\nSo, the question is whether it's wrong for the husband to ask her to quit. On one hand, he's trying to protect her, which is a natural instinct for a spouse. On the other hand, he's asking her to give up her career and dreams, which is a significant sacrifice. \n\nI should think about consent and autonomy here. She chose this career path, right? After an accident that almost cost her life, the husband is now more vocal about his concerns. But he didn't stop her before, so maybe it's his reaction post-incident that's causing the conflict. Also, maybe he's being a bit controlling by dictating her career choices. \n\nBut then again, relationships involve compromise. If her job is causing so much stress and fear in the marriage, maybe they need to find a middle ground. But she's not willing to give it up entirely. \n\nIs it his place to decide what's best for her? Or should he support her even if he's worried? The line between support and overstepping might be thin here. \n\nAlso, comparing to police or firefighters: society accepts the risks in those jobs because of the public service. Maybe her job is similar. So if she's doing research that helps people, is it fair for him to ask her to stop when others in similar roles don't face such pressure? \n\nBut maybe her job is more dangerous than those. Or maybe the risk isn't comparable. It's a valid point both ways. \n\nThe husband's fear is real after she was bitten. But is that fear justifying controlling her career? It's possible he's being irrational now because of past trauma. \n\nIn terms of right or wrong, the answer might depend on cultural or personal values. Some might say he's being overprotective and not respecting her autonomy. Others might say he's being a caring spouse. \n\nI think the key here is that she's not a child. She's an adult making her own choices. Even though he's concerned, he can't force her to quit. So maybe he's not in the wrong for expressing his concerns, but he is in the wrong if he's pressuring her to give up her career against her will. \n\nBut the question is whether he's at fault. If the answer is A (yes) or B (no). Considering all that, maybe the author is not in the wrong because he's acting out of love and concern. But others might argue he is. Hmm. \n\nWait, the wife is the one who chose the career. The husband didn't push her into it. After the incident, he's expressing his fears. If she's still willing to take the risks, then it's her choice. So maybe the husband isn't in the wrong for wanting her to stay safe, but he is in the wrong if he's being controlling. \n\nIt's a tough call. The answer could go either way. But in similar scenarios, people often argue that wanting a partner to quit a dangerous job is controlling. So maybe AITA here is the husband? Or not?\n"
