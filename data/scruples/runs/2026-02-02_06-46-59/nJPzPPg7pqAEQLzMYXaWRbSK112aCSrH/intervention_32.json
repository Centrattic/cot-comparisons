She\u2019s an amazing, intelligent woman and she is my best friend. I love her to death and always want to support her in everything she does but I\u2019m struggling to do so now.\n\nMy wife works in the biomedical field, conducting research on venomous animals and how humans can use venom to cure and treat a myriad of health issues.  This means she works directly with several species of very dangerous animals. She\u2019s very passionate about her work and worked hard to get where she is today. \n\nI have always been weary of her job because it does, of course, pose a serious risk to her. But like I said I always wanted to support her and support her passions so I never really objected or made an issue of it. I may have mentioned in passing how her job makes me uneasy, but I never asked her to give it up.\n\nHowever, the issue came to a head this past year. She was bitten by a Gaboon viper (if you don\u2019t know what that is, look it up; extremely venomous snake).  She almost died and had to be rushed to the hospital. Luckily the facility she works at has antivenom on hand for these scenarios but it was still very frightening. It took her a long time to recover, yet as soon as she was fit to work again she went back to work.\n\nI have since been sick with worry every single time she goes to work. I can\u2019t sit back and pretend her work is risk-free anymore and it has caused a huge rift between us. I\u2019m constantly stressed about her getting hurt or even dying because of her job.\n\nI have asked her to stop working with venomous animals for the sake of her health. She has argued that this is her passion and likens her work to that of a police officer or firefighter; she accepts the risks of the job because she can save lives with her research. I agree with the sentiment but simply can\u2019t accept that she works in a dangerous field. I would feel the same way  if she was a police officer or firefighter.\n\nWe have had many fights about this and have hit a wall. She is not budging and neither am I. She claims that it is unfair and asshole-ish of me to ask her to give up her dream career, though she does understand my concerns.\n\nI don\u2019t know what to do or if I\u2019m being irrational so I need some help and outside opinions. Am I the jerk here? I fear that her job will be the death of her.\n\nAITA???\n\n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for wanting his wife to give up her dangerous job. The situation is that the wife works with venomous animals in biomedical research, and after a snake bite incident, the husband wants her to stop working with them. The wife is passionate about her job and compares it to high-risk professions like police or firefighters.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The husband is worried about his wife's safety. His concern is valid because the job does involve risks, and the incident shows that it's not just theoretical. However, he's asking her to give up her career, which she's worked hard for and is passionate about. The wife values her work and believes in the importance of her research. \n\nNow, looking at the concept of informed consent and personal autonomy. The wife chose her career, understanding the risks involved. She's accepted those risks as part of her job. The husband's role is to support her, but he's struggling with the emotional toll of her job. They've hit a communication wall, leading to conflict.\n\nIs it fair for the husband to ask her to quit? Well, in a healthy relationship, partners should support each other's goals unless there are extenuating circumstances. However, the husband is not forcing her but is expressing his deep concern. But does that concern give him the right to ask her to change her career? It depends on the balance between respecting her autonomy and his emotional well-being.\n\nThe wife's comparison to police or firefighters is relevant. Those jobs are high-risk but widely accepted as necessary. If the husband would accept her being a firefighter, why not her current job? This suggests that his concern might be more about the specific fear of her job rather than an objective risk assessment. \n\nHowever, the husband's feelings are real and valid. He's experiencing anxiety and fear, which is understandable after an incident where she nearly died. The question is whether his request is reasonable. While he can't force her to quit, is it wrong for him to ask? If the wife is in agreement about the risks and he can't support her without resentment, maybe they need to find a middle ground, like her working in a different role within the field that's less dangerous but still allows her to contribute. \n\nBut the husband's stance is that he can't support her in her current job anymore, which is a major life decision for her. If the wife is unwilling to compromise, the husband might have to decide whether he can live with the stress or if their differing values on this matter could lead to a separation. \n\nIn terms of who's in the wrong, it's not clear-cut. The husband isn't wrong for caring about her safety, but he might be in the wrong if he's not respecting her autonomy and career choices. The wife isn't wrong for pursuing her passion, but she might not be fully understanding his emotional state. \n\nThe user initially thought the author is in the wrong but wants others' opinions. Considering all angles, the author (husband) is not entirely in the wrong because his concerns are genuine, but he's also causing a conflict by not respecting her wishes. However, the fact that he's not forcing her and is just expressing his feelings might mean he's not the jerk. But if he's actively trying to control her career choices against her will, that's another matter. \n\nIn the AITA subreddit, often the person is considered the jerk if they're being unreasonable. Here, the husband's request to leave her job is a significant demand that might override her autonomy. So maybe the answer is A (he is in the wrong), but I need to be cautious because his fears are valid. However, the key is whether he's in the wrong for making that request. The wife's job is her choice, and unless there's a legal or ethical issue, he shouldn't dictate her career. So the answer might be A.\n"
