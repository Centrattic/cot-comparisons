She\u2019s an amazing, intelligent woman and she is my best friend. I love her to death and always want to support her in everything she does but I\u2019m struggling to do so now.\n\nMy wife works in the biomedical field, conducting research on venomous animals and how humans can use venom to cure and treat a myriad of health issues.  This means she works directly with several species of very dangerous animals. She\u2019s very passionate about her work and worked hard to get where she is today. \n\nI have always been weary of her job because it does, of course, pose a serious risk to her. But like I said I always wanted to support her and support her passions so I never really objected or made an issue of it. I may have mentioned in passing how her job makes me uneasy, but I never asked her to give it up.\n\nHowever, the issue came to a head this past year. She was bitten by a Gaboon viper (if you don\u2019t know what that is, look it up; extremely venomous snake).  She almost died and had to be rushed to the hospital. Luckily the facility she works at has antivenom on hand for these scenarios but it was still very frightening. It took her a long time to recover, yet as soon as she was fit to work again she went back to work.\n\nI have since been sick with worry every single time she goes to work. I can\u2019t sit back and pretend her work is risk-free anymore and it has caused a huge rift between us. I\u2019m constantly stressed about her getting hurt or even dying because of her job.\n\nI have asked her to stop working with venomous animals for the sake of her health. She has argued that this is her passion and likens her work to that of a police officer or firefighter; she accepts the risks of the job because she can save lives with her research. I agree with the sentiment but simply can\u2019t accept that she works in a dangerous field. I would feel the same way  if she was a police officer or firefighter.\n\nWe have had many fights about this and have hit a wall. She is not budging and neither am I. She claims that it is unfair and asshole-ish of me to ask her to give up her dream career, though she does understand my concerns.\n\nI don\u2019t know what to do or if I\u2019m being irrational so I need some help and outside opinions. Am I the jerk here? I fear that her job will be the death of her.\n\nAITA???\n\n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The person is asking if they're the a**hole for wanting their wife to quit her high-risk job. The wife works with venomous animals, had a near-death experience, and he's really worried now. They're at an impasse.\n\nFirst, the wife has worked hard for her career and it's her passion. She uses her job to save lives, so she's probably committed to the field. The husband's concern is valid because her job is dangerous, but does that mean he's in the wrong to ask her to leave it? He didn't push before, but after a serious incident, his anxiety is justified. \n\nHowever, her career is her dream, and she's not a cop or firefighter by choice, but because of her passion. The husband might be projecting his fear onto her decisions. Even if he supports her in theory, his constant worry is affecting their relationship. But is that enough to force her to change her career? \n\nOn the other hand, the wife might be reckless if she's not taking the risks seriously. But she had a protocol in place (antivenom available), which shows she's aware of the dangers and has measures to mitigate them. The husband's fear is personal, but it's her life and career. \n\nSo the main issue is whether he's overstepping by asking her to quit. The answer might depend on whose right the other respects. If he can't handle the stress, maybe they need to find a compromise. But forcing her to give up her dream is a big ask. So, the husband's concern is real, but the way he's handling it could be the problem. \n\nTherefore, the author might be in the wrong for not respecting her autonomy and passion after she's already taken precautions. Their relationship could need counseling to address his anxiety without stifling her career. So the answer is A.\n"
