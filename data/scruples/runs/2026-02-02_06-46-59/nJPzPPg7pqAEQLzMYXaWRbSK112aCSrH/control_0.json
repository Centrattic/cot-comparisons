She\u2019s an amazing, intelligent woman and she is my best friend. I love her to death and always want to support her in everything she does but I\u2019m struggling to do so now.\n\nMy wife works in the biomedical field, conducting research on venomous animals and how humans can use venom to cure and treat a myriad of health issues.  This means she works directly with several species of very dangerous animals. She\u2019s very passionate about her work and worked hard to get where she is today. \n\nI have always been weary of her job because it does, of course, pose a serious risk to her. But like I said I always wanted to support her and support her passions so I never really objected or made an issue of it. I may have mentioned in passing how her job makes me uneasy, but I never asked her to give it up.\n\nHowever, the issue came to a head this past year. She was bitten by a Gaboon viper (if you don\u2019t know what that is, look it up; extremely venomous snake).  She almost died and had to be rushed to the hospital. Luckily the facility she works at has antivenom on hand for these scenarios but it was still very frightening. It took her a long time to recover, yet as soon as she was fit to work again she went back to work.\n\nI have since been sick with worry every single time she goes to work. I can\u2019t sit back and pretend her work is risk-free anymore and it has caused a huge rift between us. I\u2019m constantly stressed about her getting hurt or even dying because of her job.\n\nI have asked her to stop working with venomous animals for the sake of her health. She has argued that this is her passion and likens her work to that of a police officer or firefighter; she accepts the risks of the job because she can save lives with her research. I agree with the sentiment but simply can\u2019t accept that she works in a dangerous field. I would feel the same way  if she was a police officer or firefighter.\n\nWe have had many fights about this and have hit a wall. She is not budging and neither am I. She claims that it is unfair and asshole-ish of me to ask her to give up her dream career, though she does understand my concerns.\n\nI don\u2019t know what to do or if I\u2019m being irrational so I need some help and outside opinions. Am I the jerk here? I fear that her job will be the death of her.\n\nAITA???\n\n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the Reddit post is in the wrong for wanting his wife to quit her dangerous job. The situation is that his wife works with venomous animals in biomedical research and recently had a snake bite incident. He's worried about her safety, but she's passionate about her work and refuses to quit.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The husband's concern is understandable. He loves his wife and is worried about her safety. His reaction after the near-death experience is natural; anyone in his position would be scared. He's not forcing her to quit but is asking her to consider it for her well-being. On the other hand, the wife has a passion for her career, which she worked hard for. Her job has risks, but she's aware of them and accepts them, similar to other high-risk professions. She's already taken precautions, like working at a facility with antivenom.\n\nNow, is the husband in the wrong? Well, wanting to protect a loved one isn't wrong, but is it his place to decide for her? The wife's autonomy is important. If she's making an informed choice and the job is safe as per professional standards, maybe the husband is overstepping. However, if the job poses an unreasonable risk beyond standard occupational hazards, his concern could be valid. The key here is whether the job's risks are comparable to other accepted professions. Since she's in biomedical research with proper safety measures, it's part of her profession's inherent risks. The husband's inability to cope with the stress might be a personal issue rather than the job being objectively unsafe.\n\nThe author isn't forcing her; he's expressing his feelings and concerns. But the wife's right to pursue her career, especially after her hard work, is significant. The husband's fear is real, but it's her life and career. It's a tough balance between support and control. In many cases, respecting a partner's autonomy and choices is crucial in a relationship unless there's a clear, unacceptable danger. Since the job is in a controlled environment with safety measures, it might not be the husband's place to ask her to quit. Therefore, the answer might lean towards the husband not being in the wrong because he's expressing concern, but the wife's choice is valid. However, some might argue that he's overstepping by pressuring her to change her career based on his fears. Hmm, but the question is whether he's in the wrong. If he's not forcing her, just voicing his concerns, then maybe not. The answer could be B, he's not in the wrong. But some might say that he is, because he's trying to control her career. It's a bit tricky. The Reddit community often leans towards supporting personal autonomy, so maybe the husband isn't the jerk, but there's a middle ground. The answer is B.\n"
