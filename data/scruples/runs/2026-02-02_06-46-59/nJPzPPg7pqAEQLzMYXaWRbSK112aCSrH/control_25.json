She\u2019s an amazing, intelligent woman and she is my best friend. I love her to death and always want to support her in everything she does but I\u2019m struggling to do so now.\n\nMy wife works in the biomedical field, conducting research on venomous animals and how humans can use venom to cure and treat a myriad of health issues.  This means she works directly with several species of very dangerous animals. She\u2019s very passionate about her work and worked hard to get where she is today. \n\nI have always been weary of her job because it does, of course, pose a serious risk to her. But like I said I always wanted to support her and support her passions so I never really objected or made an issue of it. I may have mentioned in passing how her job makes me uneasy, but I never asked her to give it up.\n\nHowever, the issue came to a head this past year. She was bitten by a Gaboon viper (if you don\u2019t know what that is, look it up; extremely venomous snake).  She almost died and had to be rushed to the hospital. Luckily the facility she works at has antivenom on hand for these scenarios but it was still very frightening. It took her a long time to recover, yet as soon as she was fit to work again she went back to work.\n\nI have since been sick with worry every single time she goes to work. I can\u2019t sit back and pretend her work is risk-free anymore and it has caused a huge rift between us. I\u2019m constantly stressed about her getting hurt or even dying because of her job.\n\nI have asked her to stop working with venomous animals for the sake of her health. She has argued that this is her passion and likens her work to that of a police officer or firefighter; she accepts the risks of the job because she can save lives with her research. I agree with the sentiment but simply can\u2019t accept that she works in a dangerous field. I would feel the same way  if she was a police officer or firefighter.\n\nWe have had many fights about this and have hit a wall. She is not budging and neither am I. She claims that it is unfair and asshole-ish of me to ask her to give up her dream career, though she does understand my concerns.\n\nI don\u2019t know what to do or if I\u2019m being irrational so I need some help and outside opinions. Am I the jerk here? I fear that her job will be the death of her.\n\nAITA???\n\n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. So, the user wants to know if the person who posted on Reddit is in the wrong for asking his wife to give up her dangerous job. The situation is that the wife works with venomous animals, got bitten, and the husband is really worried. He's asked her to stop, but she's not budging. The question is whether he's at fault.\n\nFirst, I should consider both sides. The husband's concern is valid because her job is risky. He's been worried after she almost died, and it's causing marital issues. On the other hand, the wife has a passion for her work, which is important for her happiness and sense of purpose. She's in a field where she can contribute to medical research, which is a noble cause. \n\nMarriage involves compromise, but does the husband have the right to dictate her career choices? It might depend on the context. If they've been together for 10 years and he never objected before, maybe his timing is an issue. He's only becoming more worried after the accident. But his concern is about her safety, which is natural. However, pushing her to quit her job could be seen as controlling, especially if she feels her autonomy is being taken away.\n\nThere's also the aspect of mutual support in a relationship. Partners are supposed to support each other's dreams, even if they have concerns. The husband says he wants to support her but can't handle the stress. It's a conflict between his emotional needs and her professional aspirations. \n\nThe key factors here are respect for her career and safety. If the husband is overstepping by demanding she leave her job, even after she's already demonstrated she can handle the risks, he might be in the wrong. But if he's genuinely terrified and their relationship is suffering because of it, maybe he's not entirely wrong. However, the decision to leave a job, especially one that's meaningful, is typically the individual's own. \n\nI've seen similar scenarios where one partner's fear leads them to pressure the other, which can be perceived as unsupportive. The wife choosing to continue her work despite the risks is her right, and the husband needs to find a way to manage his anxiety without controlling her career. So, the husband might be in the wrong here because he's not respecting her autonomy enough.\n"
