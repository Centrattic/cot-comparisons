She\u2019s an amazing, intelligent woman and she is my best friend. I love her to death and always want to support her in everything she does but I\u2019m struggling to do so now.\n\nMy wife works in the biomedical field, conducting research on venomous animals and how humans can use venom to cure and treat a myriad of health issues.  This means she works directly with several species of very dangerous animals. She\u2019s very passionate about her work and worked hard to get where she is today. \n\nI have always been weary of her job because it does, of course, pose a serious risk to her. But like I said I always wanted to support her and support her passions so I never really objected or made an issue of it. I may have mentioned in passing how her job makes me uneasy, but I never asked her to give it up.\n\nHowever, the issue came to a head this past year. She was bitten by a Gaboon viper (if you don\u2019t know what that is, look it up; extremely venomous snake).  She almost died and had to be rushed to the hospital. Luckily the facility she works at has antivenom on hand for these scenarios but it was still very frightening. It took her a long time to recover, yet as soon as she was fit to work again she went back to work.\n\nI have since been sick with worry every single time she goes to work. I can\u2019t sit back and pretend her work is risk-free anymore and it has caused a huge rift between us. I\u2019m constantly stressed about her getting hurt or even dying because of her job.\n\nI have asked her to stop working with venomous animals for the sake of her health. She has argued that this is her passion and likens her work to that of a police officer or firefighter; she accepts the risks of the job because she can save lives with her research. I agree with the sentiment but simply can\u2019t accept that she works in a dangerous field. I would feel the same way  if she was a police officer or firefighter.\n\nWe have had many fights about this and have hit a wall. She is not budging and neither am I. She claims that it is unfair and asshole-ish of me to ask her to give up her dream career, though she does understand my concerns.\n\nI don\u2019t know what to do or if I\u2019m being irrational so I need some help and outside opinions. Am I the jerk here? I fear that her job will be the death of her.\n\nAITA???\n\n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who posted on Reddit is in the wrong for wanting his wife to give up her dangerous job. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the wife has a dream job in biomedical research with venomous animals. She's worked hard to get there and is passionate about her work. The husband loves her and supports her in general, but he's now asking her to stop because he's afraid for her safety after she almost died from a snakebite. They've had fights about it, and he's questioning if he's the asshole.\n\nSo, the key points here are: the wife's job involves inherent risks, which the husband has been aware of but didn't object to before. Now, after a traumatic event, he's struggling. The wife sees her job as a noble cause, similar to police or firefighters, and doesn't want to stop. The husband can't handle the stress anymore.\n\nI need to consider both sides. On one hand, the husband's concern is valid\u2014he's worried about his wife's safety and their relationship. His feelings are real and important. On the other hand, the wife has a right to pursue her passion and career, especially if she's accepting the risks as part of her job. There's a balance between personal autonomy and mutual support in a relationship.\n\nIs it the husband's place to ask her to give up her career? Well, in a healthy relationship, both partners should respect each other's goals and make decisions together. However, the husband is now expressing his fear and concern because of a near-death experience. The wife might not be considering his emotional state as much as her own.\n\nBut pushing someone to quit their job, even for safety reasons, can be seen as controlling. The husband should be communicating his fears and maybe finding compromises. However, if the wife is unwilling to change and the husband can't cope with the stress, there might be deeper issues in the relationship about boundaries and mutual support.\n\nIn the end, the husband's request is coming from a place of fear and love, but the wife's autonomy is also significant. Whether he's in the wrong depends on whether he's respecting her autonomy while addressing his own emotional needs. The Reddit community might split on this, but I think the answer hinges on whether the husband is being unreasonable in his demand. Since the job was agreed upon before the accident and he's now changing his stance, maybe he's in the wrong for not supporting her dream career after she's made sacrifices for it. But if the situation is causing unbearable stress for him, there's a balance to find. However, forcing her to quit could be seen as not respecting her career choices. So, perhaps the answer is A, yes, he's in the wrong because he's not supporting her autonomy even though he's aware of the risks.\n"
