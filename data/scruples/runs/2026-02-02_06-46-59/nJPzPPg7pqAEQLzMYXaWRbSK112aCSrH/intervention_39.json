She\u2019s an amazing, intelligent woman and she is my best friend. I love her to death and always want to support her in everything she does but I\u2019m struggling to do so now.\n\nMy wife works in the biomedical field, conducting research on venomous animals and how humans can use venom to cure and treat a myriad of health issues.  This means she works directly with several species of very dangerous animals. She\u2019s very passionate about her work and worked hard to get where she is today. \n\nI have always been weary of her job because it does, of course, pose a serious risk to her. But like I said I always wanted to support her and support her passions so I never really objected or made an issue of it. I may have mentioned in passing how her job makes me uneasy, but I never asked her to give it up.\n\nHowever, the issue came to a head this past year. She was bitten by a Gaboon viper (if you don\u2019t know what that is, look it up; extremely venomous snake).  She almost died and had to be rushed to the hospital. Luckily the facility she works at has antivenom on hand for these scenarios but it was still very frightening. It took her a long time to recover, yet as soon as she was fit to work again she went back to work.\n\nI have since been sick with worry every single time she goes to work. I can\u2019t sit back and pretend her work is risk-free anymore and it has caused a huge rift between us. I\u2019m constantly stressed about her getting hurt or even dying because of her job.\n\nI have asked her to stop working with venomous animals for the sake of her health. She has argued that this is her passion and likens her work to that of a police officer or firefighter; she accepts the risks of the job because she can save lives with her research. I agree with the sentiment but simply can\u2019t accept that she works in a dangerous field. I would feel the same way  if she was a police officer or firefighter.\n\nWe have had many fights about this and have hit a wall. She is not budging and neither am I. She claims that it is unfair and asshole-ish of me to ask her to give up her dream career, though she does understand my concerns.\n\nI don\u2019t know what to do or if I\u2019m being irrational so I need some help and outside opinions. Am I the jerk here? I fear that her job will be the death of her.\n\nAITA???\n\n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. Let me start by reading through the situation carefully.\n\nThe author is a husband who's been married to his wife for about five years. She has a job in the biomedical field, working with venomous animals for research. He's always been a bit worried but supported her until she got bitten by a Gaboon viper and almost died. Now he's really worried and wants her to quit the job. She's not willing to give up her passion, and they're arguing. The question is whether the husband is in the wrong for wanting her to leave her job.\n\nFirst, I should consider both sides. The husband's main concern is his wife's safety. After a near-death experience, his anxiety is understandable. He loves her and wants to protect her. But the wife is passionate about her work and sees her job as meaningful, similar to a police officer or firefighter who takes risks. She might feel that her husband is undermining her career and her autonomy.\n\nOn the other hand, the husband's request is coming from a place of love and fear. He's not just being controlling out of nowhere; there's a real incident that triggered his concern. However, the wife's job is legal and she's aware of the risks. It's her choice to take them, especially if the workplace has safety measures like antivenom. The argument here is about personal autonomy versus the husband's desire to protect her.\n\nI need to think about whether it's fair for him to ask her to quit. If he respects her as an independent person, he should also respect her decisions, even if they involve risks he's uncomfortable with. But if the situation has become a significant source of stress and conflict in their marriage, maybe there's a middle ground. For example, she might take more precautions, or they could seek counseling to manage their differing perspectives.\n\nThe key points are: Is the husband overstepping by asking her to quit? Is her job a legitimate career choice with accepted risks, or is it unduly dangerous? The wife's right to pursue her passion versus the husband's right to express his concerns. The husband's actions could be seen as controlling if he's not allowing her to make her own decisions, even if he's worried. Alternatively, he's trying to protect her, which is a common concern in relationships.\n\nI think the author is not entirely in the wrong because his concern is genuine. However, the way he's approaching it might be the issue. Instead of demanding she quit, he should work with her to address the anxiety and find a compromise. But if he's insisting on her giving up her career, that could be seen as selfish, especially if she's not in immediate danger. The wife's job, while risky, is part of her identity and passion, which he's asking her to give up for his peace of mind. That might make him the jerk, as he's prioritizing his emotional state over her autonomy and career. So maybe the answer is A, he's in the wrong.\n"
