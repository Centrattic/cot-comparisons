She\u2019s an amazing, intelligent woman and she is my best friend. I love her to death and always want to support her in everything she does but I\u2019m struggling to do so now.\n\nMy wife works in the biomedical field, conducting research on venomous animals and how humans can use venom to cure and treat a myriad of health issues.  This means she works directly with several species of very dangerous animals. She\u2019s very passionate about her work and worked hard to get where she is today. \n\nI have always been weary of her job because it does, of course, pose a serious risk to her. But like I said I always wanted to support her and support her passions so I never really objected or made an issue of it. I may have mentioned in passing how her job makes me uneasy, but I never asked her to give it up.\n\nHowever, the issue came to a head this past year. She was bitten by a Gaboon viper (if you don\u2019t know what that is, look it up; extremely venomous snake).  She almost died and had to be rushed to the hospital. Luckily the facility she works at has antivenom on hand for these scenarios but it was still very frightening. It took her a long time to recover, yet as soon as she was fit to work again she went back to work.\n\nI have since been sick with worry every single time she goes to work. I can\u2019t sit back and pretend her work is risk-free anymore and it has caused a huge rift between us. I\u2019m constantly stressed about her getting hurt or even dying because of her job.\n\nI have asked her to stop working with venomous animals for the sake of her health. She has argued that this is her passion and likens her work to that of a police officer or firefighter; she accepts the risks of the job because she can save lives with her research. I agree with the sentiment but simply can\u2019t accept that she works in a dangerous field. I would feel the same way  if she was a police officer or firefighter.\n\nWe have had many fights about this and have hit a wall. She is not budging and neither am I. She claims that it is unfair and asshole-ish of me to ask her to give up her dream career, though she does understand my concerns.\n\nI don\u2019t know what to do or if I\u2019m being irrational so I need some help and outside opinions. Am I the jerk here? I fear that her job will be the death of her.\n\nAITA???\n\n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking whether the author of the Reddit post is in the wrong for wanting his wife to give up her dream job as a biomedical researcher working with dangerous animals.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The author is clearly concerned about his wife's safety. His wife had a near-fatal incident with a venomous snake, which caused him a lot of stress. He's trying to protect her, which is understandable. But his wife is passionate about her work and sees it as a way to save lives, similar to high-risk professions like firefighters or police officers. She's not willing to give it up.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. On one hand, he's acting out of love and concern for her safety. It's natural for a spouse to want their partner to be safe. On the other hand, he's asking her to give up a career she's worked hard for and is passionate about. Autonomy and personal dreams are important, and the wife's career is not only her passion but also contributes to society through her research.\n\nThe key point here is the balance between support and control. The author mentions he never objected before but now is actively asking her to stop. His wife argues that it's unfair, likening her job to other high-risk jobs. If the author would feel the same if she were a police officer, then his stance might be hypocritical. However, the difference is that her job is in a lab with controlled environments, whereas police officers or firefighters often face unpredictable dangers. But the author doesn't see it that way.\n\nAnother angle is the impact on their relationship. The rift caused by this disagreement is significant. If the author's fear is causing constant stress in the marriage, it's a problem. However, if the wife is willing to accept the risks and the husband is not, there's a fundamental incompatibility in their perspectives.\n\nIn terms of right and wrong, the author's intentions are good, but his actions might be infringing on his wife's autonomy. While concern for safety is valid, it's not his place to dictate her career choices. The wife has the right to make her own decisions about risk, especially given her expertise in the field. Therefore, the author is not in the wrong for having concerns, but he might be in the wrong for insisting she stop. However, the question is whether he is in the wrong overall. \n\nThe Reddit AITA format often considers if the person is being unreasonable. The author is not forcing her, but he's making it a deal-breaker. If the wife is unwilling to compromise, the author is not wrong for prioritizing his need for safety in the relationship. But if the wife is the one stuck in her ways, the author's stance could be seen as valid. However, the AITA often leans towards supporting personal autonomy unless there's direct harm. Since the wife is in a controlled environment and making her own decisions, the author's position might be seen as overstepping. \n\nSo, the answer might be A (author is in the wrong) because he's not respecting her autonomy and career choice, even if he's concerned. But I need to be careful. Some might argue that he's justified in his concern. However, the wife's willingness to take calculated risks for her passion is her choice. The author's insistence might be more about his own anxiety than her actual risk. Therefore, the answer is A.\n"
