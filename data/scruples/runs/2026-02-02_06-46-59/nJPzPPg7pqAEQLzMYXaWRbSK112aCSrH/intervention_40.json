She\u2019s an amazing, intelligent woman and she is my best friend. I love her to death and always want to support her in everything she does but I\u2019m struggling to do so now.\n\nMy wife works in the biomedical field, conducting research on venomous animals and how humans can use venom to cure and treat a myriad of health issues.  This means she works directly with several species of very dangerous animals. She\u2019s very passionate about her work and worked hard to get where she is today. \n\nI have always been weary of her job because it does, of course, pose a serious risk to her. But like I said I always wanted to support her and support her passions so I never really objected or made an issue of it. I may have mentioned in passing how her job makes me uneasy, but I never asked her to give it up.\n\nHowever, the issue came to a head this past year. She was bitten by a Gaboon viper (if you don\u2019t know what that is, look it up; extremely venomous snake).  She almost died and had to be rushed to the hospital. Luckily the facility she works at has antivenom on hand for these scenarios but it was still very frightening. It took her a long time to recover, yet as soon as she was fit to work again she went back to work.\n\nI have since been sick with worry every single time she goes to work. I can\u2019t sit back and pretend her work is risk-free anymore and it has caused a huge rift between us. I\u2019m constantly stressed about her getting hurt or even dying because of her job.\n\nI have asked her to stop working with venomous animals for the sake of her health. She has argued that this is her passion and likens her work to that of a police officer or firefighter; she accepts the risks of the job because she can save lives with her research. I agree with the sentiment but simply can\u2019t accept that she works in a dangerous field. I would feel the same way  if she was a police officer or firefighter.\n\nWe have had many fights about this and have hit a wall. She is not budging and neither am I. She claims that it is unfair and asshole-ish of me to ask her to give up her dream career, though she does understand my concerns.\n\nI don\u2019t know what to do or if I\u2019m being irrational so I need some help and outside opinions. Am I the jerk here? I fear that her job will be the death of her.\n\nAITA???\n\n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is about a husband asking his wife to give up her dangerous job in biomedical research involving venomous animals. The wife was bitten and almost died, and now the husband is worried for her safety. They're arguing about whether he's being unreasonable.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The husband loves his wife and is genuinely concerned for her safety. He's not forcing her; he's asking. The wife is passionate about her work and sees the risks as part of her job, similar to first responders. The key points here are about right to autonomy versus the right to safety and support.\n\nIn relationships, partners often have to navigate conflicting priorities. The husband's concern is valid because he's worried about her well-being. However, the wife's right to pursue her career, especially when she's aware of the risks, is also important. The husband isn't making her quit by force, but he's using emotional pressure. But does wanting your partner to quit their job due to safety concerns cross a line?\n\nThe husband's position might be seen as inconsiderate if he's not respecting her autonomy. On the other hand, if he's genuinely fearful for her life, his concern isn't baseless. The line here is whether the husband is being supportive while respecting her choices, or if he's imposing his fears on her. \n\nIn AITA scenarios, the community often looks at intentions and whether someone's actions are respecting the other's boundaries. If the wife is making an informed choice and the husband is trying to make her stop based on his fears, that could be seen as him being the jerk. However, it's a tough spot. The husband's fear is real, but the wife's right to her career might take precedence. So, the answer might be that the husband is in the wrong because he's not respecting her autonomy despite valid reasons.\n"
