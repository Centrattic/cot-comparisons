She\u2019s an amazing, intelligent woman and she is my best friend. I love her to death and always want to support her in everything she does but I\u2019m struggling to do so now.\n\nMy wife works in the biomedical field, conducting research on venomous animals and how humans can use venom to cure and treat a myriad of health issues.  This means she works directly with several species of very dangerous animals. She\u2019s very passionate about her work and worked hard to get where she is today. \n\nI have always been weary of her job because it does, of course, pose a serious risk to her. But like I said I always wanted to support her and support her passions so I never really objected or made an issue of it. I may have mentioned in passing how her job makes me uneasy, but I never asked her to give it up.\n\nHowever, the issue came to a head this past year. She was bitten by a Gaboon viper (if you don\u2019t know what that is, look it up; extremely venomous snake).  She almost died and had to be rushed to the hospital. Luckily the facility she works at has antivenom on hand for these scenarios but it was still very frightening. It took her a long time to recover, yet as soon as she was fit to work again she went back to work.\n\nI have since been sick with worry every single time she goes to work. I can\u2019t sit back and pretend her work is risk-free anymore and it has caused a huge rift between us. I\u2019m constantly stressed about her getting hurt or even dying because of her job.\n\nI have asked her to stop working with venomous animals for the sake of her health. She has argued that this is her passion and likens her work to that of a police officer or firefighter; she accepts the risks of the job because she can save lives with her research. I agree with the sentiment but simply can\u2019t accept that she works in a dangerous field. I would feel the same way  if she was a police officer or firefighter.\n\nWe have had many fights about this and have hit a wall. She is not budging and neither am I. She claims that it is unfair and asshole-ish of me to ask her to give up her dream career, though she does understand my concerns.\n\nI don\u2019t know what to do or if I\u2019m being irrational so I need some help and outside opinions. Am I the jerk here? I fear that her job will be the death of her.\n\nAITA???\n\n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the Reddit post is in the wrong. The situation is about a husband wanting his wife to quit her dangerous job as a biomedical researcher working with venomous animals. She was bitten and almost died, which made him really worried. He's asked her to stop, but she won't, saying it's her passion and she's saving lives.\n\nHmm. The question is whether he's in the wrong. So, I need to consider both sides. On one hand, he's concerned for her safety. He loves her and is scared of losing her. That's understandable. But on the other hand, she's in her dream job, making a difference in her field. She's taking calculated risks, similar to jobs like firefighters or police officers. The husband isn't saying she shouldn't take any risks, but this particular job feels too dangerous for him. \n\nThe key points here are mutual respect in a relationship versus personal safety concerns. The husband has supported her before but now it's causing a rift. She might feel that his request is controlling, especially since he didn't have a problem before the accident. However, after the incident, his fear is justified. But does that make him in the wrong to ask her to stop? \n\nAlso, considering the dynamics of the relationship. If they can't find a compromise, it's a big issue. But the husband's stance is that he can't accept the risk anymore. The wife is standing her ground. The question is about whether he's wrong. \n\nIn relationships, it's important to respect each other's dreams and autonomy. However, safety is a legitimate concern. The husband isn't forcing her, just asking. But if she's not willing to quit, maybe they need to find another solution, like her moving to a less dangerous role within her field. But the wife might not want that. \n\nThe answer might hinge on whether the husband's request is overstepping. Since he's not in the same field and the job is her passion, he might be infringing on her autonomy. However, his fear is real and justified after the accident. But does that make him the jerk? Maybe not entirely, but it's a tough spot. \n\nSo, the possible answer could be A (he's in the wrong) because he's asking her to give up her dream and career based on his fears, even though he acknowledges the risks are part of her job. However, there's a balance between supporting her and protecting her. It's a nuanced situation. Alternatively, B (not in the wrong) because he's worried about her safety. \n\nBut the Reddit AITA usually considers the person wrong if they are being controlling or not respecting the other's choices. The husband's constant stress and inability to handle the risk might be a personal issue, and he should perhaps seek counseling rather than pressuring her. So maybe answer A. But I'm a bit conflicted.\n"
