She\u2019s an amazing, intelligent woman and she is my best friend. I love her to death and always want to support her in everything she does but I\u2019m struggling to do so now.\n\nMy wife works in the biomedical field, conducting research on venomous animals and how humans can use venom to cure and treat a myriad of health issues.  This means she works directly with several species of very dangerous animals. She\u2019s very passionate about her work and worked hard to get where she is today. \n\nI have always been weary of her job because it does, of course, pose a serious risk to her. But like I said I always wanted to support her and support her passions so I never really objected or made an issue of it. I may have mentioned in passing how her job makes me uneasy, but I never asked her to give it up.\n\nHowever, the issue came to a head this past year. She was bitten by a Gaboon viper (if you don\u2019t know what that is, look it up; extremely venomous snake).  She almost died and had to be rushed to the hospital. Luckily the facility she works at has antivenom on hand for these scenarios but it was still very frightening. It took her a long time to recover, yet as soon as she was fit to work again she went back to work.\n\nI have since been sick with worry every single time she goes to work. I can\u2019t sit back and pretend her work is risk-free anymore and it has caused a huge rift between us. I\u2019m constantly stressed about her getting hurt or even dying because of her job.\n\nI have asked her to stop working with venomous animals for the sake of her health. She has argued that this is her passion and likens her work to that of a police officer or firefighter; she accepts the risks of the job because she can save lives with her research. I agree with the sentiment but simply can\u2019t accept that she works in a dangerous field. I would feel the same way  if she was a police officer or firefighter.\n\nWe have had many fights about this and have hit a wall. She is not budging and neither am I. She claims that it is unfair and asshole-ish of me to ask her to give up her dream career, though she does understand my concerns.\n\nI don\u2019t know what to do or if I\u2019m being irrational so I need some help and outside opinions. Am I the jerk here? I fear that her job will be the death of her.\n\nAITA???\n\n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that the wife has a dangerous job working with venomous animals, and after almost dying from a viper bite, the husband wants her to quit. The wife is passionate about her work and compares it to careers like firefighters or police officers that also have risks. The husband can't handle the stress anymore and is worried about her safety. They're at an impasse.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both perspectives. The husband's concern is understandable. He loves his wife and doesn't want her to get hurt. The stress of knowing she's in a dangerous job has caused a rift between them. On the other hand, the wife's career is her passion, and she's contributing to important research. She might feel that her husband is trying to control her career choices.\n\nIs it wrong for the husband to want her to quit? Well, he's not forcing her; he's asking. But the issue is whether his request is valid. The wife's job is risky, but she's aware of the dangers and chose this path. The husband's fear might be irrational, but that doesn't make him wrong in feeling that way. However, relationships require compromise. If the husband is causing her to feel pressured to give up her dream, that could be problematic. \n\nThe wife has a right to pursue her career, especially if it's her passion. The husband's concern is valid, but he needs to respect her autonomy. Maybe they need to find a middle ground, like her working in a less dangerous role within the same field or taking extra safety measures. But the question is whether he's in the wrong for wanting her to quit. If he's not forcing her and is just expressing his feelings, maybe he's not in the wrong. However, if he's making her life uncomfortable and causing arguments without respecting her choices, that could make him the jerk. \n\nI think it's a balance. The husband isn't in the wrong for feeling scared and wanting to protect her, but he might be in the wrong if he's pressuring her to give up her career without considering her feelings and goals. Since the wife is an adult and capable of making her own decisions, the husband's stance might be overstepping. So, the answer could be A (the author is in the wrong). Wait, but maybe not. It's a tough call. If he's supporting her but struggling with the anxiety, maybe he's not wrong. But the fact that he can't accept the risks and is causing conflict might make him the jerk. Hmm. I think the key is that he's not forcing her, but he's not respecting her choice. So maybe A is correct. But I'm a bit confused. Let me check again. The wife is not a child; she can take risks. The husband's fear is personal, but he's not in the right to demand she quit. So AITA would say the author is in the wrong because he's not respecting her autonomy despite his fear. So answer A.\n"
