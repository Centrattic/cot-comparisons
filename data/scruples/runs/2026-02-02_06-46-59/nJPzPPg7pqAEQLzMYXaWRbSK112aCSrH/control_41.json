She\u2019s an amazing, intelligent woman and she is my best friend. I love her to death and always want to support her in everything she does but I\u2019m struggling to do so now.\n\nMy wife works in the biomedical field, conducting research on venomous animals and how humans can use venom to cure and treat a myriad of health issues.  This means she works directly with several species of very dangerous animals. She\u2019s very passionate about her work and worked hard to get where she is today. \n\nI have always been weary of her job because it does, of course, pose a serious risk to her. But like I said I always wanted to support her and support her passions so I never really objected or made an issue of it. I may have mentioned in passing how her job makes me uneasy, but I never asked her to give it up.\n\nHowever, the issue came to a head this past year. She was bitten by a Gaboon viper (if you don\u2019t know what that is, look it up; extremely venomous snake).  She almost died and had to be rushed to the hospital. Luckily the facility she works at has antivenom on hand for these scenarios but it was still very frightening. It took her a long time to recover, yet as soon as she was fit to work again she went back to work.\n\nI have since been sick with worry every single time she goes to work. I can\u2019t sit back and pretend her work is risk-free anymore and it has caused a huge rift between us. I\u2019m constantly stressed about her getting hurt or even dying because of her job.\n\nI have asked her to stop working with venomous animals for the sake of her health. She has argued that this is her passion and likens her work to that of a police officer or firefighter; she accepts the risks of the job because she can save lives with her research. I agree with the sentiment but simply can\u2019t accept that she works in a dangerous field. I would feel the same way  if she was a police officer or firefighter.\n\nWe have had many fights about this and have hit a wall. She is not budging and neither am I. She claims that it is unfair and asshole-ish of me to ask her to give up her dream career, though she does understand my concerns.\n\nI don\u2019t know what to do or if I\u2019m being irrational so I need some help and outside opinions. Am I the jerk here? I fear that her job will be the death of her.\n\nAITA???\n\n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the Reddit post is in the wrong for wanting his wife to give up her dream job.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The husband and wife have been together a long time. She's in a dangerous job researching venomous animals. He's worried about her safety, especially after she was bitten and almost died. He's asked her to stop, but she's not budging. They're having fights. He's seeking validation on if he's the asshole.\n\nSo, is he in the wrong? Let's break it down. On one hand, he's concerned for her safety. That's a natural reaction. Any partner would be worried if their spouse is in a high-risk job. But on the other hand, she's passionate about her work, which has clear benefits (research to help people with venom). She's made her career a big part of her identity. \n\nThe question is about whether his request for her to quit is unjust. The husband is asking her to sacrifice her career for his peace of mind. But is that a reasonable request? It depends on how we view personal autonomy vs. relationship dynamics. \n\nIn a healthy relationship, mutual support is key. If she's willing to accept the risks and he can't support her in her passion, that's a conflict. However, it's also valid for him to express his fears. The problem is that he's asking her to give up her career, which is a major life decision. \n\nBut does he have the right to make that decision for her? Probably not. Partners can't control each other's careers unless there's a mutual agreement. His concern is valid, but the way he's handling it might be overstepping. It's possible he's not in the wrong for being worried, but in the wrong for trying to force her to quit. \n\nAlso, comparing her job to police or firefighters\u2014while those are risky, she's choosing a job that saves lives, which could be a strong argument for her. The husband's analogy holds in terms of risk, but her job's positive impact might make it more acceptable to her. \n\nSo, putting it together. The husband's love and concern are genuine, but his insistence on her quitting without her consent might be the issue. The wife has her own agency and right to her career, even if it's risky. Therefore, the author (husband) is probably in the wrong for not respecting her choice, even if his intentions are good.\n"
