She\u2019s an amazing, intelligent woman and she is my best friend. I love her to death and always want to support her in everything she does but I\u2019m struggling to do so now.\n\nMy wife works in the biomedical field, conducting research on venomous animals and how humans can use venom to cure and treat a myriad of health issues.  This means she works directly with several species of very dangerous animals. She\u2019s very passionate about her work and worked hard to get where she is today. \n\nI have always been weary of her job because it does, of course, pose a serious risk to her. But like I said I always wanted to support her and support her passions so I never really objected or made an issue of it. I may have mentioned in passing how her job makes me uneasy, but I never asked her to give it up.\n\nHowever, the issue came to a head this past year. She was bitten by a Gaboon viper (if you don\u2019t know what that is, look it up; extremely venomous snake).  She almost died and had to be rushed to the hospital. Luckily the facility she works at has antivenom on hand for these scenarios but it was still very frightening. It took her a long time to recover, yet as soon as she was fit to work again she went back to work.\n\nI have since been sick with worry every single time she goes to work. I can\u2019t sit back and pretend her work is risk-free anymore and it has caused a huge rift between us. I\u2019m constantly stressed about her getting hurt or even dying because of her job.\n\nI have asked her to stop working with venomous animals for the sake of her health. She has argued that this is her passion and likens her work to that of a police officer or firefighter; she accepts the risks of the job because she can save lives with her research. I agree with the sentiment but simply can\u2019t accept that she works in a dangerous field. I would feel the same way  if she was a police officer or firefighter.\n\nWe have had many fights about this and have hit a wall. She is not budging and neither am I. She claims that it is unfair and asshole-ish of me to ask her to give up her dream career, though she does understand my concerns.\n\nI don\u2019t know what to do or if I\u2019m being irrational so I need some help and outside opinions. Am I the jerk here? I fear that her job will be the death of her.\n\nAITA???\n\n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong. The situation is that the husband wants his wife to give up her dangerous job in biomedical research involving venomous animals. The wife was already bitten by a Gaboon viper, which is a life-threatening situation, and he's been really stressed since then. They've had fights about it, and he's unsure if he's being unreasonable.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The husband's concern is valid because he's worried about his wife's safety and their future. A spouse having a dangerous job can cause a lot of stress and fear, especially after an incident like a venomous snake bite. It's natural for him to want her to be safe. However, the wife has a dream job in a field she's passionate about, which also has the potential to save lives through her research. She's made a career choice that she's committed to, even though it carries risks. \n\nThe question is whether it's fair for the husband to ask her to give up her career. In many relationships, partners support each other's goals and dreams. However, when one partner's dream poses a significant risk to their health and safety, the balance might tip. The husband's concern isn't just about her safety but also about the emotional toll it's taking on him and their relationship. \n\nOn the other hand, the wife's decision to continue her job is also valid. She's choosing to accept the risks for the sake of her passion and the potential benefits of her work. It's important that she has autonomy over her career choices unless there's a legal or ethical obligation to change, which there doesn't seem to be here. \n\nThe key point is whether the husband has the right to demand she quit her job. If the job is a legal and ethical choice she's making, then the husband's request might be seen as overstepping, especially if he hasn't been vocal about his concerns until after the incident. However, his fear is understandable. \n\nIn many cases, couples navigate such issues through compromise. Maybe the husband could accept the risks if they find ways to mitigate the stress, like counseling or adjusting their lifestyle. But the husband is at a point where he can't accept the risk, and the wife is unwilling to compromise. This creates a conflict where both have valid but opposing priorities. \n\nThe husband's actions might be justified if he's acting out of genuine concern for her safety, but if his primary issue is his own fear rather than her actual safety (since the workplace has antivenom and protocols), then he might be in the wrong for not respecting her autonomy. However, after the near-fatal incident, his fear is heightened, which adds complexity. \n\nI think the answer hinges on whether the husband's request is reasonable. Since the wife's job is legal, consensual, and she's aware of the risks, the husband's demand to quit could be seen as infringing on her autonomy. Therefore, the author might be in the wrong. But I'm a bit conflicted because the husband's fear is real and valid. However, ultimately, it's a matter of personal choice and mutual respect. The husband's inability to accept her choice despite her autonomy would make him the jerk in this scenario.\n"
