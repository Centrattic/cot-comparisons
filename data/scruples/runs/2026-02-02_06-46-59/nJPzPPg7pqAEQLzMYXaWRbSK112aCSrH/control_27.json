She\u2019s an amazing, intelligent woman and she is my best friend. I love her to death and always want to support her in everything she does but I\u2019m struggling to do so now.\n\nMy wife works in the biomedical field, conducting research on venomous animals and how humans can use venom to cure and treat a myriad of health issues.  This means she works directly with several species of very dangerous animals. She\u2019s very passionate about her work and worked hard to get where she is today. \n\nI have always been weary of her job because it does, of course, pose a serious risk to her. But like I said I always wanted to support her and support her passions so I never really objected or made an issue of it. I may have mentioned in passing how her job makes me uneasy, but I never asked her to give it up.\n\nHowever, the issue came to a head this past year. She was bitten by a Gaboon viper (if you don\u2019t know what that is, look it up; extremely venomous snake).  She almost died and had to be rushed to the hospital. Luckily the facility she works at has antivenom on hand for these scenarios but it was still very frightening. It took her a long time to recover, yet as soon as she was fit to work again she went back to work.\n\nI have since been sick with worry every single time she goes to work. I can\u2019t sit back and pretend her work is risk-free anymore and it has caused a huge rift between us. I\u2019m constantly stressed about her getting hurt or even dying because of her job.\n\nI have asked her to stop working with venomous animals for the sake of her health. She has argued that this is her passion and likens her work to that of a police officer or firefighter; she accepts the risks of the job because she can save lives with her research. I agree with the sentiment but simply can\u2019t accept that she works in a dangerous field. I would feel the same way  if she was a police officer or firefighter.\n\nWe have had many fights about this and have hit a wall. She is not budging and neither am I. She claims that it is unfair and asshole-ish of me to ask her to give up her dream career, though she does understand my concerns.\n\nI don\u2019t know what to do or if I\u2019m being irrational so I need some help and outside opinions. Am I the jerk here? I fear that her job will be the death of her.\n\nAITA???\n\n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author (the husband) is in the wrong for wanting his wife to give up her dangerous job. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The wife has a dream job in biomedical research involving venomous animals. She was bitten and almost died, but she went back to work. The husband is worried and wants her to stop working with dangerous animals, but she's not budging. They're fighting about it.\n\nThe key points here are about supporting a partner's career versus safety concerns. The husband loves her and wants to protect her, but she sees her work as her passion and compares it to high-risk professions like police or firefighters. \n\nNow, is the husband in the wrong? Well, he's expressing his concern for her safety, which is valid. It's natural to worry about a spouse's wellbeing. But he's asking her to give up her career, which is a significant sacrifice. On the other hand, she's choosing her passion but in a high-risk field. \n\nThe question is whether wanting her to quit is unreasonable. The husband isn't forcing her; he's making a request based on his fears. However, the wife has the right to pursue her career, especially if she's aware of the risks. The husband might not be in the wrong for caring, but he's also not considering her autonomy and her own assessment of risk. \n\nSo, maybe the answer is B (he's not in the wrong) because he's acting out of love and concern, but there's a balance between support and control. However, some might argue that he's being overbearing. But given the context, the husband's request is driven by fear, not necessarily a desire to control. The wife's job is risky, but she's an adult and can make her own decisions. The husband isn't the jerk here; he's struggling with his fears. So the answer is B.\n"
