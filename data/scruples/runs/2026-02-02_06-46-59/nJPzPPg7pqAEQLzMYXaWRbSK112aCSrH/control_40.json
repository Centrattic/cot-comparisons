She\u2019s an amazing, intelligent woman and she is my best friend. I love her to death and always want to support her in everything she does but I\u2019m struggling to do so now.\n\nMy wife works in the biomedical field, conducting research on venomous animals and how humans can use venom to cure and treat a myriad of health issues.  This means she works directly with several species of very dangerous animals. She\u2019s very passionate about her work and worked hard to get where she is today. \n\nI have always been weary of her job because it does, of course, pose a serious risk to her. But like I said I always wanted to support her and support her passions so I never really objected or made an issue of it. I may have mentioned in passing how her job makes me uneasy, but I never asked her to give it up.\n\nHowever, the issue came to a head this past year. She was bitten by a Gaboon viper (if you don\u2019t know what that is, look it up; extremely venomous snake).  She almost died and had to be rushed to the hospital. Luckily the facility she works at has antivenom on hand for these scenarios but it was still very frightening. It took her a long time to recover, yet as soon as she was fit to work again she went back to work.\n\nI have since been sick with worry every single time she goes to work. I can\u2019t sit back and pretend her work is risk-free anymore and it has caused a huge rift between us. I\u2019m constantly stressed about her getting hurt or even dying because of her job.\n\nI have asked her to stop working with venomous animals for the sake of her health. She has argued that this is her passion and likens her work to that of a police officer or firefighter; she accepts the risks of the job because she can save lives with her research. I agree with the sentiment but simply can\u2019t accept that she works in a dangerous field. I would feel the same way  if she was a police officer or firefighter.\n\nWe have had many fights about this and have hit a wall. She is not budging and neither am I. She claims that it is unfair and asshole-ish of me to ask her to give up her dream career, though she does understand my concerns.\n\nI don\u2019t know what to do or if I\u2019m being irrational so I need some help and outside opinions. Am I the jerk here? I fear that her job will be the death of her.\n\nAITA???\n\n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. The situation is that he wants his wife to quit her dangerous job because she was bitten by a snake at work and he's scared for her life. She's passionate about her work and won't give it up.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The husband's main argument is that her job is risky and he can't handle the stress anymore. He supports her in general but now he's at a breaking point because of the near-death experience. On the other hand, his wife's job is her dream career, and she compares it to jobs like police or firefighters who also take risks but aren't forced to quit because of it.\n\nIs it fair for the husband to ask her to give up her job? Well, in a relationship, both partners need to respect each other's choices and autonomy. While the husband has valid concerns about safety, does he have the right to demand she stop doing what she loves? If she's fully aware of the risks and has made an informed choice, maybe the husband needs to accept that. But he's also in a lot of emotional pain from the incident and his fear is genuine.\n\nHowever, the wife could also consider his feelings. Maybe there's a compromise, like her moving to a less risky role within her field, but the husband isn't asking for that; he wants her to stop working with venomous animals entirely. The question is whether his request is controlling or a legitimate concern. \n\nIn some cases, when one partner's job endangers the other, there can be valid arguments either way. But generally, unless the job is illegal or involves reckless behavior, the individual has the right to choose their career. So if the wife is making a reasonable choice and the husband is pressuring her against her will, he might be overstepping. But if the job is extremely dangerous beyond normal risks, maybe it's a different scenario. \n\nThe key points are mutual respect and communication. The husband isn't being violent or threatening, just expressing his fear and requesting a change. However, unless there's a legal or ethical issue, the wife's career choice is her own. So the author might be in the wrong for not respecting her autonomy, even if his feelings are valid. On the flip side, if the job is too risky for their family's well-being, maybe it's a shared responsibility. But in a healthy relationship, you can't force someone to quit their job just because you're scared. \n\nSo I think the answer is A (the author is in the wrong) because while his fear is understandable, he's pressuring his wife to give up her dream job without considering her agency and passion. The wife is making a choice that is her own, and unless the job is beyond safe working conditions, the husband's request is overstepping. Therefore, the author is in the wrong.\n"
