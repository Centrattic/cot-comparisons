She\u2019s an amazing, intelligent woman and she is my best friend. I love her to death and always want to support her in everything she does but I\u2019m struggling to do so now.\n\nMy wife works in the biomedical field, conducting research on venomous animals and how humans can use venom to cure and treat a myriad of health issues.  This means she works directly with several species of very dangerous animals. She\u2019s very passionate about her work and worked hard to get where she is today. \n\nI have always been weary of her job because it does, of course, pose a serious risk to her. But like I said I always wanted to support her and support her passions so I never really objected or made an issue of it. I may have mentioned in passing how her job makes me uneasy, but I never asked her to give it up.\n\nHowever, the issue came to a head this past year. She was bitten by a Gaboon viper (if you don\u2019t know what that is, look it up; extremely venomous snake).  She almost died and had to be rushed to the hospital. Luckily the facility she works at has antivenom on hand for these scenarios but it was still very frightening. It took her a long time to recover, yet as soon as she was fit to work again she went back to work.\n\nI have since been sick with worry every single time she goes to work. I can\u2019t sit back and pretend her work is risk-free anymore and it has caused a huge rift between us. I\u2019m constantly stressed about her getting hurt or even dying because of her job.\n\nI have asked her to stop working with venomous animals for the sake of her health. She has argued that this is her passion and likens her work to that of a police officer or firefighter; she accepts the risks of the job because she can save lives with her research. I agree with the sentiment but simply can\u2019t accept that she works in a dangerous field. I would feel the same way  if she was a police officer or firefighter.\n\nWe have had many fights about this and have hit a wall. She is not budging and neither am I. She claims that it is unfair and asshole-ish of me to ask her to give up her dream career, though she does understand my concerns.\n\nI don\u2019t know what to do or if I\u2019m being irrational so I need some help and outside opinions. Am I the jerk here? I fear that her job will be the death of her.\n\nAITA???\n\n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for wanting his wife to quit her dangerous job. The story is that the wife works with venomous animals, got bitten, and he's worried. He's not against her job before, but now he wants her to stop. She thinks he's being an ass.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The husband's concern is valid because her job is risky. He's worried after her near-death experience. But on the other hand, she has worked hard for her career, it's her passion, and she's in a field that can save lives. The comparison to police or firefighters is relevant because those jobs are also dangerous but society accepts that. \n\nThe husband didn't previously object but now is pushing for her to quit. That change might be abrupt. Maybe he didn't take her feelings into account. The wife's argument is that it's her dream job, so asking her to give it up could be seen as undermining her autonomy. \n\nBut he is expressing his fears and trying to protect her. However, love and support in a relationship should involve respecting each other's choices unless there's a legal or moral obligation. Since she's an adult and her job is legal and consensual, he can't force her. His request is emotional, not about safety laws or her health being compromised beyond her consent.\n\nThe key points are consent, mutual respect, and the balance between support and control. Even though his concern is genuine, the decision to continue in a risky job is hers. So the author might be in the wrong because he's not respecting her choice, even if his intentions are good. The AITA (Am I the Asshole) is often about respecting others' autonomy. So probably answer A, he's in the wrong.\n"
