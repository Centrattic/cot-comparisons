She\u2019s an amazing, intelligent woman and she is my best friend. I love her to death and always want to support her in everything she does but I\u2019m struggling to do so now.\n\nMy wife works in the biomedical field, conducting research on venomous animals and how humans can use venom to cure and treat a myriad of health issues.  This means she works directly with several species of very dangerous animals. She\u2019s very passionate about her work and worked hard to get where she is today. \n\nI have always been weary of her job because it does, of course, pose a serious risk to her. But like I said I always wanted to support her and support her passions so I never really objected or made an issue of it. I may have mentioned in passing how her job makes me uneasy, but I never asked her to give it up.\n\nHowever, the issue came to a head this past year. She was bitten by a Gaboon viper (if you don\u2019t know what that is, look it up; extremely venomous snake).  She almost died and had to be rushed to the hospital. Luckily the facility she works at has antivenom on hand for these scenarios but it was still very frightening. It took her a long time to recover, yet as soon as she was fit to work again she went back to work.\n\nI have since been sick with worry every single time she goes to work. I can\u2019t sit back and pretend her work is risk-free anymore and it has caused a huge rift between us. I\u2019m constantly stressed about her getting hurt or even dying because of her job.\n\nI have asked her to stop working with venomous animals for the sake of her health. She has argued that this is her passion and likens her work to that of a police officer or firefighter; she accepts the risks of the job because she can save lives with her research. I agree with the sentiment but simply can\u2019t accept that she works in a dangerous field. I would feel the same way  if she was a police officer or firefighter.\n\nWe have had many fights about this and have hit a wall. She is not budging and neither am I. She claims that it is unfair and asshole-ish of me to ask her to give up her dream career, though she does understand my concerns.\n\nI don\u2019t know what to do or if I\u2019m being irrational so I need some help and outside opinions. Am I the jerk here? I fear that her job will be the death of her.\n\nAITA???\n\n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that the husband is asking if he's at fault for wanting his wife to quit her dangerous job. The wife works with venomous animals and had a near-death experience. He's really worried about her safety and doesn't want her to take such risks. She's passionate about her work and sees it as her dream job, comparing it to jobs like police or firefighters that also have risks.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The husband's concern is valid because he loves his wife and wants her to be safe. He's not just being a nagging partner; he's genuinely scared after her serious injury. On the other hand, the wife has worked hard to get to where she is in her career, and her job has a purpose of researching cures using venom. She might feel that her husband is undermining her autonomy and her choice to accept risks for the greater good.\n\nI should think about autonomy in relationships. In a healthy relationship, each person should have the right to make their own career decisions unless it's causing harm. The husband's request is that she give up her job for safety, but is that his place to make that decision for her? Even if he supports her in theory, asking her to quit because of his fear might be overstepping. However, he's also in a position where he's worried about their relationship and his own emotional well-being because of the stress.\n\nAnother angle is that he hasn't outright forced her; he's asking her to stop. But the problem is, he's not budging either. The wife is in a field where the risks are inherent and accepted. It's like saying a firefighter shouldn't become a firefighter because of the risks. The comparison she makes is valid. So, if the husband is pressuring her to leave a job she loves because of the risks, even if he's doing it out of love, is that fair? Or is he being irrational because he can't handle the stress of her job?\n\nAlso, maybe the husband hasn't considered other ways to mitigate the risk. For example, could they work together to find a safer role for her in the same field? Or maybe she could transition to a different position that's less dangerous but still in research? The fact that he's at a standstill suggests they haven't found a middle ground.\n\nBut the key point is whether he's in the wrong. The question is asking if he's the asshole. From a Reddit AITA perspective, people often side with autonomy unless there's a significant harm to others. Since the wife's job is her choice and she's accepting the risks, the husband might be infringing on her autonomy by pressuring her to quit. However, his concern is understandable. It's a tough balance between support and control.\n\nI think the answer hinges on whether the husband is respecting her autonomy. If he's not forcing her but expressing his fear and asking her to consider it, that's one thing. But if he's pressuring her to quit and creating a rift, that could be seen as inconsiderate. Since she's not budging and he's not either, maybe the fault isn't entirely on one side. But the question is specifically about the author being in the wrong. The wife's career is her own, and unless there's a direct danger to him, he might be overreaching by making the decision for her, even if it's out of love. So, probably the answer is A (Yes, the author is in the wrong) because he's trying to control her career choices based on his fears, not considering her autonomy and passion.\n"
