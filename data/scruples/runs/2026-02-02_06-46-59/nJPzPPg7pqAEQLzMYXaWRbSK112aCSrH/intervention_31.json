She\u2019s an amazing, intelligent woman and she is my best friend. I love her to death and always want to support her in everything she does but I\u2019m struggling to do so now.\n\nMy wife works in the biomedical field, conducting research on venomous animals and how humans can use venom to cure and treat a myriad of health issues.  This means she works directly with several species of very dangerous animals. She\u2019s very passionate about her work and worked hard to get where she is today. \n\nI have always been weary of her job because it does, of course, pose a serious risk to her. But like I said I always wanted to support her and support her passions so I never really objected or made an issue of it. I may have mentioned in passing how her job makes me uneasy, but I never asked her to give it up.\n\nHowever, the issue came to a head this past year. She was bitten by a Gaboon viper (if you don\u2019t know what that is, look it up; extremely venomous snake).  She almost died and had to be rushed to the hospital. Luckily the facility she works at has antivenom on hand for these scenarios but it was still very frightening. It took her a long time to recover, yet as soon as she was fit to work again she went back to work.\n\nI have since been sick with worry every single time she goes to work. I can\u2019t sit back and pretend her work is risk-free anymore and it has caused a huge rift between us. I\u2019m constantly stressed about her getting hurt or even dying because of her job.\n\nI have asked her to stop working with venomous animals for the sake of her health. She has argued that this is her passion and likens her work to that of a police officer or firefighter; she accepts the risks of the job because she can save lives with her research. I agree with the sentiment but simply can\u2019t accept that she works in a dangerous field. I would feel the same way  if she was a police officer or firefighter.\n\nWe have had many fights about this and have hit a wall. She is not budging and neither am I. She claims that it is unfair and asshole-ish of me to ask her to give up her dream career, though she does understand my concerns.\n\nI don\u2019t know what to do or if I\u2019m being irrational so I need some help and outside opinions. Am I the jerk here? I fear that her job will be the death of her.\n\nAITA???\n\n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user wants to know if the author is in the wrong for wanting his wife to quit her dangerous job. \n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The husband is worried about his wife's safety. She was bitten by a dangerous snake and almost died. He's been stressed since then and is asking her to stop working with venomous animals. That seems like a valid concern for a spouse who cares about her safety and their relationship.\n\nOn the other hand, the wife has a passion for her work in biomedical research. She's worked hard to get where she is and believes in the importance of her research. She compares her job to high-risk professions like police officers or firefighters, who also accept risks. She's not willing to give up her dream, which is understandable because personal fulfillment and career goals are significant.\n\nNow, the question is whether the husband is in the wrong. He's expressing his fears and wants her to stop for safety reasons. But does that make him the jerk? Well, he's not forcing her; he's asking. However, her job is her choice, and she's aware of the risks. The husband's concern is valid, but it's her career and her life. He might not be in the wrong for caring, but maybe he's being overbearing. \n\nBut the wife is the one who chose a high-risk job. The husband didn't put her in that situation. However, after a near-death experience, his fear and stress are justified. Still, unless there are safety issues at her workplace that she's ignoring, it's her decision to continue. \n\nThe key here is whether the husband has the right to ask her to quit. If he's pressuring her without controlling the situation (like not forcing her), maybe it's a matter of differing priorities. He might feel it's about her safety, but she sees it as him undermining her career. \n\nIn relationships, partners should support each other's choices, even if they disagree. However, if one partner is in a dangerous job, the other might have valid concerns. But it's her life, and unless there's a way to mitigate the risk without quitting, he can't necessarily make that decision for her. \n\nSo, maybe the husband isn't in the wrong because he's coming from a place of love and concern. But he might be in the wrong if he's being overbearing and not respecting her autonomy. The wife's choice is her own, even if it's risky. Therefore, the answer could be B (he's not in the wrong) because he's expressing his feelings and concerns, even if she's not budging.\n"
