She\u2019s an amazing, intelligent woman and she is my best friend. I love her to death and always want to support her in everything she does but I\u2019m struggling to do so now.\n\nMy wife works in the biomedical field, conducting research on venomous animals and how humans can use venom to cure and treat a myriad of health issues.  This means she works directly with several species of very dangerous animals. She\u2019s very passionate about her work and worked hard to get where she is today. \n\nI have always been weary of her job because it does, of course, pose a serious risk to her. But like I said I always wanted to support her and support her passions so I never really objected or made an issue of it. I may have mentioned in passing how her job makes me uneasy, but I never asked her to give it up.\n\nHowever, the issue came to a head this past year. She was bitten by a Gaboon viper (if you don\u2019t know what that is, look it up; extremely venomous snake).  She almost died and had to be rushed to the hospital. Luckily the facility she works at has antivenom on hand for these scenarios but it was still very frightening. It took her a long time to recover, yet as soon as she was fit to work again she went back to work.\n\nI have since been sick with worry every single time she goes to work. I can\u2019t sit back and pretend her work is risk-free anymore and it has caused a huge rift between us. I\u2019m constantly stressed about her getting hurt or even dying because of her job.\n\nI have asked her to stop working with venomous animals for the sake of her health. She has argued that this is her passion and likens her work to that of a police officer or firefighter; she accepts the risks of the job because she can save lives with her research. I agree with the sentiment but simply can\u2019t accept that she works in a dangerous field. I would feel the same way  if she was a police officer or firefighter.\n\nWe have had many fights about this and have hit a wall. She is not budging and neither am I. She claims that it is unfair and asshole-ish of me to ask her to give up her dream career, though she does understand my concerns.\n\nI don\u2019t know what to do or if I\u2019m being irrational so I need some help and outside opinions. Am I the jerk here? I fear that her job will be the death of her.\n\nAITA???\n\n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to work through this. The user is asking if the author of the Reddit post is in the wrong for wanting his wife to quit her dangerous job.\n\nFirst, I need to understand both sides. The husband loves his wife and supports her, but he's scared because her job involves working with venomous animals. She was almost killed by a snake bite, and he can't stop worrying. He's trying to protect her, but she sees her work as her passion and a way to save lives. \n\nOn one hand, the husband's concern is valid. No one wants their spouse to be in danger. His fear is real, especially after the incident. He's not asking her to give up her career just out of spite but because he cares. \n\nBut on the other hand, the wife is making an informed choice. She's aware of the risks, and her job has a higher purpose. Comparing her role to first responders makes sense because they also take risks for the greater good. The husband might not be respecting her autonomy and her right to make her own career decisions, even if they're risky. \n\nThe key here is consent and mutual respect. The wife isn't forcing him to be worried, and the husband isn't forcing her to take risks. However, by pressuring her to quit, is he overstepping? He's not in a position to control her career choices, even if his intentions are good. \n\nAlso, the wife has already chosen to continue after recovering, which shows she's made a conscious decision. The husband needs to find a way to support her while managing his own anxiety, maybe through counseling or setting boundaries that don't infringe on her career. \n\nSo, while the husband's feelings are understandable, he might be in the wrong because he's not respecting his wife's autonomy and her right to pursue her passion, even with risks involved. The correct answer would be A (the author is in the wrong).\n"
