She\u2019s an amazing, intelligent woman and she is my best friend. I love her to death and always want to support her in everything she does but I\u2019m struggling to do so now.\n\nMy wife works in the biomedical field, conducting research on venomous animals and how humans can use venom to cure and treat a myriad of health issues.  This means she works directly with several species of very dangerous animals. She\u2019s very passionate about her work and worked hard to get where she is today. \n\nI have always been weary of her job because it does, of course, pose a serious risk to her. But like I said I always wanted to support her and support her passions so I never really objected or made an issue of it. I may have mentioned in passing how her job makes me uneasy, but I never asked her to give it up.\n\nHowever, the issue came to a head this past year. She was bitten by a Gaboon viper (if you don\u2019t know what that is, look it up; extremely venomous snake).  She almost died and had to be rushed to the hospital. Luckily the facility she works at has antivenom on hand for these scenarios but it was still very frightening. It took her a long time to recover, yet as soon as she was fit to work again she went back to work.\n\nI have since been sick with worry every single time she goes to work. I can\u2019t sit back and pretend her work is risk-free anymore and it has caused a huge rift between us. I\u2019m constantly stressed about her getting hurt or even dying because of her job.\n\nI have asked her to stop working with venomous animals for the sake of her health. She has argued that this is her passion and likens her work to that of a police officer or firefighter; she accepts the risks of the job because she can save lives with her research. I agree with the sentiment but simply can\u2019t accept that she works in a dangerous field. I would feel the same way  if she was a police officer or firefighter.\n\nWe have had many fights about this and have hit a wall. She is not budging and neither am I. She claims that it is unfair and asshole-ish of me to ask her to give up her dream career, though she does understand my concerns.\n\nI don\u2019t know what to do or if I\u2019m being irrational so I need some help and outside opinions. Am I the jerk here? I fear that her job will be the death of her.\n\nAITA???\n\n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The question is whether the husband is in the wrong for wanting his wife to give up her dangerous job. \n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The wife has a passion for her work in biomedical research with venomous animals. She's already had a serious accident and is back to work. She sees her job as a calling that can save lives, comparing it to high-risk professions like police or firefighters. The husband, on the other hand, is deeply worried about her safety after the near-death experience. He's stressed every time she goes to work and can't support her anymore, leading to conflict.\n\nThe husband's main argument is that he can't live with the stress of her being in a dangerous job. He's not forcing her, but is asking her to quit for her safety. The wife argues that it's her dream job and she accepts the risks. \n\nNow, in terms of right or wrong. If the husband is making a request based on his feelings rather than her actual job requirements or safety regulations, maybe he's overstepping. However, he's expressing genuine concern for her well-being. But does he have the right to ask her to give up her career? That's the crux here. \n\nOn one hand, he's entitled to his feelings and safety concerns. On the other, she has her own autonomy and career aspirations. The husband isn't forcing her, just expressing what he wants. But if he's pressuring her to quit despite her own assessed risks and career goals, that could be seen as controlling. \n\nThe wife's job is legal and she's aware of the risks. Comparing her to a police officer or firefighter is valid because those jobs also have risks. If the husband can't accept that, maybe the issue is more about his emotional response than the actual objective danger. \n\nBut then again, if her job is causing the husband severe anxiety to the point of affecting their relationship, there's a balance to strike. However, the husband isn't the one at risk; she is. So he's prioritizing his emotional well-being over her career and autonomy. \n\nIn relationships, partners support each other's dreams unless there's a valid reason to intervene. Here, the husband's reasoning is based on fear and past trauma (the snake bite), which is understandable. But she's already taken the risk and chose to continue. \n\nIf the husband's concern is genuine and he's not being irrational, maybe he's not the jerk. But if he's being controlling or not respecting her autonomy despite valid career choices, then he is. \n\nSo the key points are: Is the husband's request reasonable? Does her job pose an objectively unacceptable risk? Since she's in a field that requires handling dangerous animals and has safety measures (antivenom), the risk is managed. The husband's emotional response is valid, but his request might be imposing his values over her career. \n\nTherefore, the husband might be in the wrong (A) because he's not respecting her career choices despite her managing the risks. However, if the job is too dangerous beyond acceptable norms, maybe not. But the scenario doesn't indicate that the job is reckless. She's in a field that inherently has risks, which she's aware of and accepts. So the husband's demand might be seen as overstepping.\n"
