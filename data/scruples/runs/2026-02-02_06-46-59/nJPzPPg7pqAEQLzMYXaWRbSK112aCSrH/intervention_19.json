She\u2019s an amazing, intelligent woman and she is my best friend. I love her to death and always want to support her in everything she does but I\u2019m struggling to do so now.\n\nMy wife works in the biomedical field, conducting research on venomous animals and how humans can use venom to cure and treat a myriad of health issues.  This means she works directly with several species of very dangerous animals. She\u2019s very passionate about her work and worked hard to get where she is today. \n\nI have always been weary of her job because it does, of course, pose a serious risk to her. But like I said I always wanted to support her and support her passions so I never really objected or made an issue of it. I may have mentioned in passing how her job makes me uneasy, but I never asked her to give it up.\n\nHowever, the issue came to a head this past year. She was bitten by a Gaboon viper (if you don\u2019t know what that is, look it up; extremely venomous snake).  She almost died and had to be rushed to the hospital. Luckily the facility she works at has antivenom on hand for these scenarios but it was still very frightening. It took her a long time to recover, yet as soon as she was fit to work again she went back to work.\n\nI have since been sick with worry every single time she goes to work. I can\u2019t sit back and pretend her work is risk-free anymore and it has caused a huge rift between us. I\u2019m constantly stressed about her getting hurt or even dying because of her job.\n\nI have asked her to stop working with venomous animals for the sake of her health. She has argued that this is her passion and likens her work to that of a police officer or firefighter; she accepts the risks of the job because she can save lives with her research. I agree with the sentiment but simply can\u2019t accept that she works in a dangerous field. I would feel the same way  if she was a police officer or firefighter.\n\nWe have had many fights about this and have hit a wall. She is not budging and neither am I. She claims that it is unfair and asshole-ish of me to ask her to give up her dream career, though she does understand my concerns.\n\nI don\u2019t know what to do or if I\u2019m being irrational so I need some help and outside opinions. Am I the jerk here? I fear that her job will be the death of her.\n\nAITA???\n\n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of the Reddit post is in the wrong for wanting his wife to give up her dangerous job. The wife works with venomous animals and had a serious accident, which caused him a lot of stress. He's conflicted between supporting her passion and his fear for her safety.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The wife chose this career path, which she's passionate about. It's her dream job, and she's worked hard for it. The husband has supported her up until now, only expressing his concerns passively. But after the viper bite incident, his fear has escalated, leading him to ask her to quit. \n\nThe key points here are autonomy and mutual respect in a relationship. While it's natural for someone to worry about their partner's safety, the husband is trying to make a decision for her. That could be seen as overstepping. However, the situation is real\u2014her job is risky, and he's genuinely scared. \n\nOn the other hand, the wife is in a field that can save lives, and she's likening her work to first responders. She's accepting the risks, which she has the right to do. The husband's request might be infringing on her personal freedom and career choices. \n\nBut relationships also involve compromise. If the stress is causing a rift, maybe they need to find a middle ground. Perhaps she could transition to a less dangerous role within the same field if possible. However, the husband's insistence without compromise might be the issue here. \n\nSo, is he in the wrong? It's a tough call. On one hand, he's expressing valid concerns as a partner. On the other, he's not respecting her autonomy. The line between support and control is thin here. I think the husband is being selfish by not considering her passion and the fact that she's accepting the risks. The answer would likely be A (he's in the wrong) because he's asking her to give up her career without mutual agreement or compromise. But maybe there's a middle ground, so I need to make sure. The wife's safety is important, but so is her right to choose her career. Since he's not budging and she's not willing to either, the problem isn't just on his side. However, in terms of who initiated the request, it's him, and that's where the conflict arises. So I lean towards A.\n"
