She\u2019s an amazing, intelligent woman and she is my best friend. I love her to death and always want to support her in everything she does but I\u2019m struggling to do so now.\n\nMy wife works in the biomedical field, conducting research on venomous animals and how humans can use venom to cure and treat a myriad of health issues.  This means she works directly with several species of very dangerous animals. She\u2019s very passionate about her work and worked hard to get where she is today. \n\nI have always been weary of her job because it does, of course, pose a serious risk to her. But like I said I always wanted to support her and support her passions so I never really objected or made an issue of it. I may have mentioned in passing how her job makes me uneasy, but I never asked her to give it up.\n\nHowever, the issue came to a head this past year. She was bitten by a Gaboon viper (if you don\u2019t know what that is, look it up; extremely venomous snake).  She almost died and had to be rushed to the hospital. Luckily the facility she works at has antivenom on hand for these scenarios but it was still very frightening. It took her a long time to recover, yet as soon as she was fit to work again she went back to work.\n\nI have since been sick with worry every single time she goes to work. I can\u2019t sit back and pretend her work is risk-free anymore and it has caused a huge rift between us. I\u2019m constantly stressed about her getting hurt or even dying because of her job.\n\nI have asked her to stop working with venomous animals for the sake of her health. She has argued that this is her passion and likens her work to that of a police officer or firefighter; she accepts the risks of the job because she can save lives with her research. I agree with the sentiment but simply can\u2019t accept that she works in a dangerous field. I would feel the same way  if she was a police officer or firefighter.\n\nWe have had many fights about this and have hit a wall. She is not budging and neither am I. She claims that it is unfair and asshole-ish of me to ask her to give up her dream career, though she does understand my concerns.\n\nI don\u2019t know what to do or if I\u2019m being irrational so I need some help and outside opinions. Am I the jerk here? I fear that her job will be the death of her.\n\nAITA???\n\n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the Reddit post (the husband) is in the wrong for wanting his wife to quit her dangerous job. The wife works with venomous animals in biomedical research, which is risky, and after a near-fatal incident, he wants her to stop. She refuses, saying it's her passion and she accepts the risks like other high-risk professions.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both perspectives. The husband's primary concern is his wife's safety and his emotional well-being. He's clearly traumatized by her job, especially after the viper bite. His fear is understandable; no one wants to lose their partner. But is it fair for him to ask her to quit something she's passionate about? \n\nOn the other hand, the wife has worked hard for her career and sees her work as meaningful. She compares her job to that of a police officer or firefighter, who also take risks. She might feel that her husband is not respecting her autonomy and career choices. \n\nThe key question here is whether the husband has the right to impose his fears on her. While his intentions are to protect her, marriage involves mutual respect and support. If she's making an informed choice to accept the risks of her job, he should respect that, even if it's hard for him. However, there's also the aspect of their relationship being strained. They need to find a balance where both feel heard and supported.\n\nBut what about the wife's responsibility? She should consider his feelings and maybe take safety measures to ease his anxiety. However, the husband's demand to quit might be overstepping if it's infringing on her independence. \n\nIn many cases, partners can't force each other to change careers unless there are specific circumstances (like legal issues, addiction, etc.). Since she's making an adult decision, even with risks, the husband's request might be seen as not respecting her autonomy. That said, he's not wrong in feeling anxious. But pushing her to quit could be where he's in the wrong. \n\nSo, the answer likely leans towards the husband being wrong (A) because he's asking her to give up her passions based on his fears, even though she's making a conscious choice. However, there's nuance here, and maybe a middle ground is needed. But according to the question, we have to choose between A or B. Given that, the husband is in the wrong for not respecting her career choice despite his concerns.\n"
