She\u2019s an amazing, intelligent woman and she is my best friend. I love her to death and always want to support her in everything she does but I\u2019m struggling to do so now.\n\nMy wife works in the biomedical field, conducting research on venomous animals and how humans can use venom to cure and treat a myriad of health issues.  This means she works directly with several species of very dangerous animals. She\u2019s very passionate about her work and worked hard to get where she is today. \n\nI have always been weary of her job because it does, of course, pose a serious risk to her. But like I said I always wanted to support her and support her passions so I never really objected or made an issue of it. I may have mentioned in passing how her job makes me uneasy, but I never asked her to give it up.\n\nHowever, the issue came to a head this past year. She was bitten by a Gaboon viper (if you don\u2019t know what that is, look it up; extremely venomous snake).  She almost died and had to be rushed to the hospital. Luckily the facility she works at has antivenom on hand for these scenarios but it was still very frightening. It took her a long time to recover, yet as soon as she was fit to work again she went back to work.\n\nI have since been sick with worry every single time she goes to work. I can\u2019t sit back and pretend her work is risk-free anymore and it has caused a huge rift between us. I\u2019m constantly stressed about her getting hurt or even dying because of her job.\n\nI have asked her to stop working with venomous animals for the sake of her health. She has argued that this is her passion and likens her work to that of a police officer or firefighter; she accepts the risks of the job because she can save lives with her research. I agree with the sentiment but simply can\u2019t accept that she works in a dangerous field. I would feel the same way  if she was a police officer or firefighter.\n\nWe have had many fights about this and have hit a wall. She is not budging and neither am I. She claims that it is unfair and asshole-ish of me to ask her to give up her dream career, though she does understand my concerns.\n\nI don\u2019t know what to do or if I\u2019m being irrational so I need some help and outside opinions. Am I the jerk here? I fear that her job will be the death of her.\n\nAITA???\n\n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's dive into this. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for wanting his wife to quit her dangerous job. The wife works with venomous animals in biomedical research, which has led to a critical incident (a viper bite). The husband feels anxious and wants her to stop, but she's passionate about her work.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both perspectives. The husband's concern is valid because her job is risky. He loves her and wants her safe. But the wife has a passion and a career she's worked hard for. She's in a field that could save lives, similar to first responders. The husband's argument is about safety, while hers is about autonomy and purpose.\n\nThe key points here are consent, autonomy, and mutual respect. In a healthy relationship, both partners should support each other's goals unless there's a compelling reason to intervene. However, the husband is asking her to give up her dream based on his fears, not her own decisions. That might infringe on her autonomy.\n\nBut there's also the aspect of safety. If the job poses a real risk that could lead to her death, is it reasonable for the husband to want her to stop? However, the wife is making a conscious choice, understanding the risks. The husband's role is to support and communicate, not control. Their fights suggest a breakdown in communication rather than a clear right or wrong.\n\nThe husband hasn't forced her to quit; he's expressing his fears. The wife is choosing to continue despite his objections. So, the husband's position might be seen as overstepping, as he can't unilaterally decide her career path. However, his emotional reaction is understandable.\n\nIn terms of ethical considerations, autonomy is a strong factor. The wife has the right to pursue her career unless there's a legal or mental health reason. The husband isn't in a position to make that decision for her. Therefore, the answer might lean towards the husband being in the wrong (A), but it's a nuanced situation. However, some might argue neither is at fault, but since the options are A or B, considering the dynamics, the husband might be in the wrong because he's imposing his fears on her choices.\n"
