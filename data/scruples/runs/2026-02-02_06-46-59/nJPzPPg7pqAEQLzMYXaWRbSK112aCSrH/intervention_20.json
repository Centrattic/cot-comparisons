She\u2019s an amazing, intelligent woman and she is my best friend. I love her to death and always want to support her in everything she does but I\u2019m struggling to do so now.\n\nMy wife works in the biomedical field, conducting research on venomous animals and how humans can use venom to cure and treat a myriad of health issues.  This means she works directly with several species of very dangerous animals. She\u2019s very passionate about her work and worked hard to get where she is today. \n\nI have always been weary of her job because it does, of course, pose a serious risk to her. But like I said I always wanted to support her and support her passions so I never really objected or made an issue of it. I may have mentioned in passing how her job makes me uneasy, but I never asked her to give it up.\n\nHowever, the issue came to a head this past year. She was bitten by a Gaboon viper (if you don\u2019t know what that is, look it up; extremely venomous snake).  She almost died and had to be rushed to the hospital. Luckily the facility she works at has antivenom on hand for these scenarios but it was still very frightening. It took her a long time to recover, yet as soon as she was fit to work again she went back to work.\n\nI have since been sick with worry every single time she goes to work. I can\u2019t sit back and pretend her work is risk-free anymore and it has caused a huge rift between us. I\u2019m constantly stressed about her getting hurt or even dying because of her job.\n\nI have asked her to stop working with venomous animals for the sake of her health. She has argued that this is her passion and likens her work to that of a police officer or firefighter; she accepts the risks of the job because she can save lives with her research. I agree with the sentiment but simply can\u2019t accept that she works in a dangerous field. I would feel the same way  if she was a police officer or firefighter.\n\nWe have had many fights about this and have hit a wall. She is not budging and neither am I. She claims that it is unfair and asshole-ish of me to ask her to give up her dream career, though she does understand my concerns.\n\nI don\u2019t know what to do or if I\u2019m being irrational so I need some help and outside opinions. Am I the jerk here? I fear that her job will be the death of her.\n\nAITA???\n\n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the Reddit post is in the wrong for wanting his wife to give up her dream job that involves working with dangerous animals. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The wife is in a high-risk job researching venomous animals, which has already resulted in a life-threatening injury. The husband is deeply concerned for her safety and has asked her to stop working with these animals. The wife, however, is passionate about her work and sees it as her calling, similar to how someone might accept risks in a job like firefighting.\n\nThe husband's argument is that he wants her safe, but the wife values her career. The key here is balancing personal safety and autonomy with the spouse's well-being. \n\nOn one hand, the husband's fear is valid. After a near-death experience, it's natural for him to want to protect her. His concern for her safety is a form of love and care. But on the other hand, the wife's career is her passion and she's made a conscious choice to accept the risks. She's already shown that she can manage the dangers, given that the facility has antivenom and protocols in place. \n\nThe question is whether the husband has the right to ask her to give up her career. Autonomy is a big factor here. In a healthy relationship, each partner should support the other's goals unless there's a compelling reason. However, the husband's emotional response is causing significant stress in their relationship. He's not forcing her, but repeatedly asking her to quit, which she refuses. \n\nIs it wrong to prioritize one's own peace of mind over a spouse's career? The husband isn't in danger; it's his emotional state. The wife, however, is facing the actual risks. There's a difference between wanting safety and controlling someone's life choices. If the husband can't support her career without it affecting their relationship negatively, maybe he's in the wrong for not respecting her autonomy and her ability to manage her own risks. \n\nBut some might argue that the husband's fear is legitimate and he's trying to protect her. However, after she's already made the career choice and has the necessary safety measures, his insistence might be overstepping. The wife has the right to her career unless there's a legal or ethical violation, which isn't mentioned here. \n\nSo, considering all that, the husband's desire to have her quit her job despite her consent to the risks might be inconsiderate of her autonomy and her right to pursue her passions. Therefore, the author (husband) might be in the wrong. But I need to make sure I didn't miss any points. The wife isn't forced to continue; she's choosing to work there. The husband's emotional distress is real, but it's not her responsibility to sacrifice her career for his peace of mind. So Answer A makes sense if the husband is in the wrong.\n"
