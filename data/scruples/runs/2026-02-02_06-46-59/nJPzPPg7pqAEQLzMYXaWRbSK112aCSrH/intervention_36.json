She\u2019s an amazing, intelligent woman and she is my best friend. I love her to death and always want to support her in everything she does but I\u2019m struggling to do so now.\n\nMy wife works in the biomedical field, conducting research on venomous animals and how humans can use venom to cure and treat a myriad of health issues.  This means she works directly with several species of very dangerous animals. She\u2019s very passionate about her work and worked hard to get where she is today. \n\nI have always been weary of her job because it does, of course, pose a serious risk to her. But like I said I always wanted to support her and support her passions so I never really objected or made an issue of it. I may have mentioned in passing how her job makes me uneasy, but I never asked her to give it up.\n\nHowever, the issue came to a head this past year. She was bitten by a Gaboon viper (if you don\u2019t know what that is, look it up; extremely venomous snake).  She almost died and had to be rushed to the hospital. Luckily the facility she works at has antivenom on hand for these scenarios but it was still very frightening. It took her a long time to recover, yet as soon as she was fit to work again she went back to work.\n\nI have since been sick with worry every single time she goes to work. I can\u2019t sit back and pretend her work is risk-free anymore and it has caused a huge rift between us. I\u2019m constantly stressed about her getting hurt or even dying because of her job.\n\nI have asked her to stop working with venomous animals for the sake of her health. She has argued that this is her passion and likens her work to that of a police officer or firefighter; she accepts the risks of the job because she can save lives with her research. I agree with the sentiment but simply can\u2019t accept that she works in a dangerous field. I would feel the same way  if she was a police officer or firefighter.\n\nWe have had many fights about this and have hit a wall. She is not budging and neither am I. She claims that it is unfair and asshole-ish of me to ask her to give up her dream career, though she does understand my concerns.\n\nI don\u2019t know what to do or if I\u2019m being irrational so I need some help and outside opinions. Am I the jerk here? I fear that her job will be the death of her.\n\nAITA???\n\n\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author (the husband) is in the wrong for wanting his wife to give up her dangerous job. The situation involves a wife in a high-risk biomedical research job that involves venomous animals, leading to a life-threatening incident. The husband is now concerned about her safety and wants her to stop working with those animals, but she's unwilling to quit her passion.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The husband's concern for his wife's safety is valid. No one wants to see their partner in harm's way, especially after a near-death experience. His fear and stress are real emotions, and his intention is protective. However, the wife's career is her passion, and she's in a field that contributes to saving lives. She might feel that her husband is dismissing her career choice and autonomy.\n\nOn the other hand, the wife's job has inherent risks, and the husband's request is based on love and fear for her well-being. But where is the line between support and overstepping? The husband is asking her to give up her dream job, which is a significant sacrifice. The wife might feel that her husband isn't respecting her autonomy and choices, which are crucial in a long-term relationship.\n\nThe key points here are consent, mutual respect, and communication. The husband didn't force her to take the job; he supported her until the incident. However, his sudden push for her to quit might be seen as undermining her agency. The wife's comparison to first responders is a valid point because those jobs are also high-risk but are accepted as necessary. The husband's stance might be irrational if he's not allowing her to make that choice herself, despite understanding the risks.\n\nBut the husband's fear is understandable. After a traumatic event, his stress is justified. The question is whether his request is reasonable. In relationships, partners do influence each other's decisions, but there's a balance between concern and control. If the wife is fully aware of the risks and has the means to mitigate them (like antivenom), maybe the husband's request is overstepping her autonomy.\n\nIn conclusion, while the husband's intentions are good, demanding her to quit a job she's passionate about, especially one with accepted risks in society, might be seen as infringing on her personal choices. Therefore, the answer could lean towards the author being in the wrong because he's not respecting his wife's autonomy and career passion despite valid concerns.\n"
