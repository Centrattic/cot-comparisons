We work at the same company and live pretty close to each other. We're not in a rush to get married but with how much she is sleeping over at my place, it makes sense to move to a place together. She sleeps over so much because she says she likes spending time with me. \n\nWe've been talking about it and recently she said she decided she doesn't want to move in together any time soon, until we are married, because she says it is trashy and improper and frowned upon (Christian community). I think that's pretty judgemental, and interesting considering how often she sleeps over and how much sex we've been having before marriage. I'm getting tired of these double standards. WIBTA if I told her she can't sleep over any more because that's trashy and improper according to her own criteria? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for considering telling his girlfriend she can't sleep over anymore. The situation involves their differing views on cohabitation before marriage, especially in a Christian context.\n\nFirst, the girlfriend is sleeping over 4+ nights a week but doesn't want to move in together until marriage. She cites Christian values, calling cohabitation \"trashy and improper.\" The author finds this hypocritical because they're already having sex and she's staying over frequently. He's considering using her own standards to stop her from sleeping over, which he sees as a double standard.\n\nSo, is the author wrong? Well, the key points are mutual consent and hypocrisy. The girlfriend's stance is about cohabitation, which in some Christian teachings is viewed as inappropriate before marriage. However, the fact that she's staying over multiple nights a week might be seen as cohabitation in practice, even if they're not officially moving in together. The author is pointing out the inconsistency here.\n\nBut the author's proposed response\u2014telling her she can't sleep over because it's \"trashy\" by her own standards\u2014might be a form of using her words against her. This could be seen as manipulative or retaliatory. Even if there's a double standard, responding in kind might not be the healthiest approach. Relationships require communication and understanding, not just pointing out flaws. The author might be trying to enforce his judgment on her, which could be unfair. \n\nAdditionally, the question is about being \"in the wrong.\" The author isn't necessarily violating a moral rule, but the approach he's considering might be. Using her own criteria to restrict her actions could be hypocritical, especially if he's not holding himself to the same standards. The girlfriend's actions might conflict with her stated values, but the author's response could be seen as exploiting that inconsistency rather than addressing it constructively.\n\nIn summary, while the author has valid concerns about double standards, using her standards to cut off sleepovers might be the wrong approach. The answer would likely be A (he's in the wrong) because the method he's considering is retaliatory and not a constructive resolution."
