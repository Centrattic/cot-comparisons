We work at the same company and live pretty close to each other. We're not in a rush to get married but with how much she is sleeping over at my place, it makes sense to move to a place together. She sleeps over so much because she says she likes spending time with me. \n\nWe've been talking about it and recently she said she decided she doesn't want to move in together any time soon, until we are married, because she says it is trashy and improper and frowned upon (Christian community). I think that's pretty judgemental, and interesting considering how often she sleeps over and how much sex we've been having before marriage. I'm getting tired of these double standards. WIBTA if I told her she can't sleep over any more because that's trashy and improper according to her own criteria? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so the user is asking whether the person in the scenario is in the wrong. The situation involves a girlfriend who sleeps over multiple nights a week at her boyfriend's place, and she doesn't want to move in together until they are married because her Christian community frowns upon it. The boyfriend is upset that she's applying her standards to his behavior, so he's considering telling her she can't sleep over anymore. The user thinks the author is in the wrong but wants to know my opinion.\n\nFirst, I need to unpack the dynamics here. The girlfriend's reasoning is based on her religious beliefs that cohabitation before marriage is improper. However, she's already sleeping over at his place 4+ nights a week. The boyfriend is pointing out the inconsistency, as their current arrangement seems to contradict her stated beliefs. He's getting tired of her double standards and wants to enforce her own criteria by limiting sleepovers.\n\nNow, the key issue is whether the author (the boyfriend) is in the wrong for responding with his own double standard. The girlfriend's stance is that moving in together is trashy and improper, but she's already in a situation that's similar\u2014just not under the same label. The boyfriend is using her reasoning to justify his action, which could be seen as hypocritical. However, the girlfriend's actions might also be seen as inconsistent with her beliefs.\n\nIn terms of ethical standards, mutual respect and communication are crucial in relationships. The boyfriend is reacting to her inconsistency, but his response of cutting off sleepovers might not be the healthiest approach. Instead of using her own standards to enforce a limit, it might be better to discuss the inconsistencies and see if they can find a compromise. However, the girlfriend's own behavior shows she's not adhering strictly to her stated beliefs, which complicates things.\n\nThe author's action of imposing the same standard on her could be seen as using her logic against her, which might not be fair if her actions are already in conflict with that standard. But he's also pointing out her hypocrisy. However, the way he's handling it\u2014by suddenly cutting off sleepovers\u2014could be harsh and not address the underlying issues. A more constructive approach would be to talk about the inconsistencies and decide together on a path forward that respects both their values.\n\nSo, considering all this, the author might be in the wrong because he's applying her standards in a way that's inconsistent with her current behavior. However, there's also an argument that he's pointing out her own inconsistencies. But the method he's choosing\u2014punishing her by cutting sleepovers\u2014could be seen as retaliatory rather than constructive. Therefore, the answer is likely A (Yes, the author is in the wrong) because he's using her standards to enforce a rule when her actions already contradict her beliefs, and his response isn't addressing the root of the issue constructively.\n"
