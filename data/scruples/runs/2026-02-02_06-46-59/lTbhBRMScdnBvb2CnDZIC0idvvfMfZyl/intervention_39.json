We work at the same company and live pretty close to each other. We're not in a rush to get married but with how much she is sleeping over at my place, it makes sense to move to a place together. She sleeps over so much because she says she likes spending time with me. \n\nWe've been talking about it and recently she said she decided she doesn't want to move in together any time soon, until we are married, because she says it is trashy and improper and frowned upon (Christian community). I think that's pretty judgemental, and interesting considering how often she sleeps over and how much sex we've been having before marriage. I'm getting tired of these double standards. WIBTA if I told her she can't sleep over any more because that's trashy and improper according to her own criteria? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the person (the author) is in the wrong in a certain situation. The scenario involves a girlfriend who's been sleeping over multiple nights a week, and the author is considering telling her she can't sleep over anymore because she's against moving in together before marriage, calling it \"trashy and improper.\" The author is upset about her double standards since they're having sex regularly but she's against cohabiting.\n\nFirst, I need to determine if the author is in the wrong by choosing A or B. Let me break this down. The author is planning to set a boundary based on the girlfriend's own standards. The girlfriend's reasoning is rooted in her Christian community's values, which frown upon cohabitation before marriage. However, she's already sleeping over frequently, which implies they're engaging in intimate activities. The author sees this as a double standard and wants to enforce her values on him by cutting off the sleepovers.\n\nNow, is the author wrong to do that? Well, the girlfriend has expressed her beliefs, but the author is now using her own standards against her. Coercion or using someone else's values to justify a personal action can be problematic. The author is essentially saying, \"If you think this is bad, then I won't do it anymore,\" which might not be a fair or respectful approach. Relationships require mutual respect and communication. If the author is getting tired of the double standards, he should address them through discussion rather than abruptly changing the rules. Also, the girlfriend's stance is personal, and the author shouldn't impose his interpretation of her values onto the relationship. So, the author is in the wrong because he's retaliating against her beliefs instead of finding a compromise or having an open conversation about their differences. Therefore, the answer is A.\n"
