We work at the same company and live pretty close to each other. We're not in a rush to get married but with how much she is sleeping over at my place, it makes sense to move to a place together. She sleeps over so much because she says she likes spending time with me. \n\nWe've been talking about it and recently she said she decided she doesn't want to move in together any time soon, until we are married, because she says it is trashy and improper and frowned upon (Christian community). I think that's pretty judgemental, and interesting considering how often she sleeps over and how much sex we've been having before marriage. I'm getting tired of these double standards. WIBTA if I told her she can't sleep over any more because that's trashy and improper according to her own criteria? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the question (the author) is in the wrong. The situation involves their girlfriend sleeping over multiple nights a week, and she doesn't want to move in together because of her Christian beliefs, calling it \"trashy\" and \"improper.\" The author is considering telling her she can't sleep over anymore, using her own criteria as a reason.\n\nFirst, I need to understand both sides. The girlfriend is against cohabitation before marriage but engages in other behaviors (sleeping over, having sex) that are typically associated with cohabitation. The author feels this is a double standard. The author then wants to use the same reasoning to stop her from sleeping over, which seems contradictory.\n\nThe key here is whether the author is being hypocritical. The author is using the same standards the girlfriend applies to cohabitation but against her sleeping over. But sleeping over multiple times a week is functionally similar to cohabiting, just not in the same place. So if the girlfriend's stance is against cohabitation, then the author is pointing out that her current behavior is also against her values. But the problem is that by stopping her from sleeping over, the author is essentially cutting off a significant part of their relationship. The author might be trying to enforce the same standards the girlfriend has, but in a way that's abrupt and might not consider the relationship's needs.\n\nAnother angle: the author is reacting to what they see as a double standard. The girlfriend's reasoning might be based on religious beliefs, but her actions don't align. The author's response is to apply her own rules to stop her from sleeping over, which could be seen as using her logic against her. However, the author is in a position to make such a decision because they're in a committed relationship. But is it fair? The author might be trying to address hypocrisy, but the method could be harsh, especially if the girlfriend is already committed to the relationship but just not ready to move in.\n\nThe author's motivation is also important. Are they trying to resolve the double standard, or are they using it as a way to pressure the girlfriend to move in? The question is whether the author is wrong for enforcing the girlfriend's own values if they don't agree with them. The author might be correct in pointing out hypocrisy, but the action of cutting off sleepovers without a compromise could be the issue. It's possible that the author is in the wrong because they're using the girlfriend's values against her in a way that disrupts their relationship, rather than discussing and finding a middle ground. Alternatively, the girlfriend's stance is problematic because her actions don't align with her beliefs, so the author is justified in challenging that.\n\nHmm. I think the author is in the wrong because they're using the girlfriend's own standards to cut off her presence in their life, which might be a form of punishment. The author should address the hypocrisy by discussing it with her rather than abruptly changing the terms of the relationship. The girlfriend's beliefs might be flawed, but the author's approach isn't constructive. So, the answer is A (Yes, the author is in the wrong).\n"
