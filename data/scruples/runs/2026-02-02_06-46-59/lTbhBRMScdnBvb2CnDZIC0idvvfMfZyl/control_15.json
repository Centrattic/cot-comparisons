I think that's pretty judgemental, and interesting considering how often she sleeps over and how much sex we've been having before marriage. I'm getting tired of these double standards.

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for considering telling his girlfriend she can't sleep over anymore because she said moving in together before marriage is \"trashy and improper\" in their Christian community. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The couple has been dating for a few years, she sleeps over 4+ nights a week, and they work together. The author thinks moving in together makes sense given how much time they spend together, but she refuses until marriage. He's frustrated because he sees her stance as double standards since they're already sleeping together. He's considering cutting off her sleepovers using her own arguments about being \"trashy.\"\n\nSo, the key points here are mutual expectations, double standards, and the potential hypocrisy. The girl is against cohabitation before marriage, which is a common stance in some Christian communities. However, the author is pointing out that they already have a physical relationship, which is also considered inappropriate by some standards. The conflict is about whether the man is justified in using her arguments against her to stop her from sleeping over.\n\nI should consider the ethics here. Is the author being fair by applying her criteria to her actions? The girl's standards are about morality based on her beliefs. If the author is retaliating by enforcing her rules, does that make him wrong? Or is he highlighting the inconsistency in her stance?\n\nFrom a fairness perspective, the author is pointing out hypocrisy. If she's against cohabitation but approves of sleeping over (which is essentially the same as cohabitation if done frequently), maybe there's an inconsistency. However, the author is taking it a step further by threatening to stop her from sleeping over, which could be seen as using her own rules against her. But does that make him wrong? Or is it a matter of her needing to address the inconsistency first?\n\nAlso, communication is key here. The author might be reacting to her not resolving the double standards. If she's okay with sleeping over but not moving in, maybe the author is trying to challenge that. But forcing her to change behavior by threatening to stop her could be seen as manipulative. However, he's also within his rights to set boundaries if he's uncomfortable with her stance.\n\nSo, is he in the wrong? If he's using her own arguments to enforce a boundary, maybe not. But if he's doing it out of spite or to retaliate, that's different. The main issue is whether his action is justified based on her own reasoning. Since she set the rule, and he's applying it, he might not be wrong. However, the broader context of their relationship and communication matters. If he's acting out of frustration and not addressing the underlying issues, maybe there's a problem. But based purely on the question, the answer could be B (not in the wrong) because he's highlighting her inconsistency and setting boundaries based on her own criteria.\n"
