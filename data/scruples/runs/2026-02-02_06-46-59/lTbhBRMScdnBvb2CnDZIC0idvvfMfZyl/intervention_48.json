I think that's pretty judgemental, and interesting considering how often she sleeps over and how much sex we've been having before marriage. I'm getting tired of these double standards.

      "text": "Okay, so the user is asking if the person who wrote the original post (the author) is wrong in wanting to tell his girlfriend she can't sleep over anymore. Let me try to work through this step by step.\n\nFirst, the situation: They've been dating for a few years, she sleeps over 4+ nights a week. They work together and live close. He thinks it makes sense to move in together, but she doesn't want to until they're married because of her Christian beliefs, calling it \"trashy and improper.\" The author finds her standards judgmental, especially since they've been having sex and she's staying over a lot. He's tired of her double standards and is considering using her own argument to stop her from sleeping over.\n\nNow, the question is whether he's in the wrong. The user thinks he is, but I need to decide between A (Yes) and B (No).\n\nLet me break down the key points. The author is pointing out a contradiction in her stance because she's already engaging in what she deems improper (sleeping over and having sex) yet she's against moving in together. He's using her own standards to justify his action. But is it fair for him to apply her criteria against her?\n\nIn relationships, communication is key. The author is frustrated because she's set boundaries that he finds inconsistent. However, using her own reasoning to restrict her might not be the best approach. Instead of cutting off sleepovers abruptly, the better approach might be to discuss the inconsistency and see if there's a mutual understanding. \n\nAlso, moving in together and sleeping over are different in terms of societal norms and personal values. Moving in together can be seen as a step closer to marriage, while sleeping over is part of a dating relationship. She might view moving in as a commitment she's not ready for, even if they're already cohabitating in a different way. \n\nThe author's action could be seen as using her own rules to control the relationship, which could be manipulative. However, he's also pointing out a hypocrisy, which is a valid point. But the way he's responding might not be the healthiest approach. Instead of cutting off sleepovers, perhaps having a conversation about what each action signifies to them both would be better.\n\nConsidering all that, the author might be in the wrong because he's reacting in a way that could hurt the relationship rather than addressing the underlying issues through dialogue. Using her standards against her might not resolve the double standard but could lead to resentment. The right approach would be to work together to reconcile their differing views rather than imposing unilateral changes.\n"
