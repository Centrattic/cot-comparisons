We work at the same company and live pretty close to each other. We're not in a rush to get married but with how much she is sleeping over at my place, it makes sense to move to a place together. She sleeps over so much because she says she likes spending time with me. \n\nWe've been talking about it and recently she said she decided she doesn't want to move in together any time soon, until we are married, because she says it is trashy and improper and frowned upon (Christian community). I think that's pretty judgemental, and interesting considering how often she sleeps over and how much sex we've been having before marriage. I'm getting tired of these double standards. WIBTA if I told her she can't sleep over any more because that's trashy and improper according to her own criteria? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the author (the person who wrote the question) is in the wrong. The situation is that the author is in a relationship with their girlfriend, and she sleeps over four or more nights a week. They both work at the same company and live close. The author thinks it's time to move in together since she's there so often, but she refuses because of her Christian community's views, calling it trashy and improper until marriage. The author is upset about her double standards and considering cutting off the sleepovers using her own standards as a reason.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The girlfriend's stance is based on her religious beliefs, which she's been clear about. She's choosing not to move in together before marriage, even though they're having sex. The author feels this is hypocritical and is considering enforcing her standards by stopping the sleepovers. \n\nThe author's reasoning is that if her beliefs make moving in together improper, then the current arrangement (sleeping over without being married) is also improper. So he's using her standards against her. But is that fair? The girlfriend might argue that sleeping over occasionally isn't the same as moving in. Also, the author is taking her words literally and applying them in a way that might not have been intended. \n\nFrom a moral standpoint, the author is using her religious standards to make a demand that might not align with her actual practices. The girlfriend's double standard is her issue, but the author is now using that to create a new boundary. The author might be in the wrong because he's not respecting her boundaries and is retaliating. However, he's also pointing out hypocrisy, which is a valid point. \n\nAnother angle: The author is frustrated and wants to take a stand against what he sees as judgmental behavior. But by cutting off sleepovers, he's imposing a boundary based on her beliefs, which she might not have applied to this situation. It's possible that she never intended to stop non-move-in sleepovers, so the author is misapplying her standards. \n\nIn relationships, communication is key. The author's approach here is confrontational. Instead of stopping sleepovers abruptly, maybe discussing it together would be better. But the question is about whether he's in the wrong. If he's using her own beliefs to enforce a boundary she didn't set, that might be overstepping. \n\nSo, considering all that, the author is using the girlfriend's standards to make a point, which could be seen as unfair. The girlfriend's stance is about moving in together, not about sleeping over. The author's action is a form of punishment for hypocrisy, but it's not respecting her stated beliefs. Therefore, the author is in the wrong by taking that action without considering her perspective.\n"
