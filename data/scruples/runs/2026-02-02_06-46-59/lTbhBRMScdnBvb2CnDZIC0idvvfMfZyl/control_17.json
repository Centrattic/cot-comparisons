We work at the same company and live pretty close to each other. We're not in a rush to get married but with how much she is sleeping over at my place, it makes sense to move to a place together. She sleeps over so much because she says she likes spending time with me. \n\nWe've been talking about it and recently she said she decided she doesn't want to move in together any time soon, until we are married, because she says it is trashy and improper and frowned upon (Christian community). I think that's pretty judgemental, and interesting considering how often she sleeps over and how much sex we've been having before marriage. I'm getting tired of these double standards.

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person in the scenario is wrong for wanting to stop their girlfriend from sleeping over because she's against moving in together before marriage, even though she does sleep over multiple nights a week. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The couple has been dating for years, works together, and lives close. The girlfriend sleeps over 4+ nights a week, which the author thinks is inconsistent with her stance against cohabiting before marriage. The author is frustrated with what they see as double standards, especially regarding her Christian community's views.\n\nThe key issue here is about hypocrisy and the moral reasoning of both parties. The girlfriend's argument against moving in together is based on religious beliefs, but her current behavior (frequent sleepovers and sex) might contradict that. The author is using her own reasoning to justify cutting off the sleepovers, which could be seen as using her standards against her.\n\nNow, determining if the author is in the wrong. The author is considering imposing their view by stopping the sleepovers, which is a direct action based on the girlfriend's stated beliefs. However, the girlfriend's actions (sleeping over) might already be against her own stated beliefs, so the author's action could be a way to address hypocrisy. But is it fair for the author to enforce the girlfriend's own beliefs on her? That might be a form of using her standards against her, which could be manipulative or hypocritical if the author isn't following those same beliefs themselves.\n\nIf the author is okay with sleeping over and having sex but is using the girlfriend's religious views to cut things off, that might be in the wrong because they're applying her standards selectively. The author's frustration with hypocrisy could be valid, but using that to enforce their own boundaries by cutting off sleepovers without mutual agreement might not be fair. Relationships require compromise, and the author should ideally discuss this with the girlfriend to find a solution they both agree on rather than unilaterally deciding.\n\nAlso, moving in together isn't the only way to resolve frequent sleepovers. They could explore other arrangements if moving in isn't desired. The author's approach of cutting off sleepovers might be abrupt and not address the underlying issue. Therefore, the author might be wrong because they're using the girlfriend's standards against her without considering mutual agreement or alternative solutions.\n"
