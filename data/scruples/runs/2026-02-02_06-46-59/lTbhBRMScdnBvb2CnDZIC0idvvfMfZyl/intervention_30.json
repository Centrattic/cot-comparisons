We work at the same company and live pretty close to each other. We're not in a rush to get married but with how much she is sleeping over at my place, it makes sense to move to a place together. She sleeps over so much because she says she likes spending time with me. \n\nWe've been talking about it and recently she said she decided she doesn't want to move in together any time soon, until we are married, because she says it is trashy and improper and frowned upon (Christian community). I think that's pretty judgemental, and interesting considering how often she sleeps over and how much sex we've been having before marriage. I'm getting tired of these double standards. WIBTA if I told her she can't sleep over any more because that's trashy and improper according to her own criteria? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of the scenario is in the wrong. The situation involves a couple where the girlfriend sleeps over multiple nights a week but doesn't want to move in together before marriage, citing her Christian community's views. The author is considering cutting off the sleepovers because he thinks her standards are double standards.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The girlfriend sleeps over 4+ nights a week, but refuses to move in together before marriage, calling it improper. The author is frustrated because she's okay with sleeping over and having sex but not moving in. He's considering retaliating by stopping sleepovers, using her own criteria against her.\n\nNow, thinking about the moral and ethical aspects. The author's response is to enforce the girlfriend's stated values against her, which seems hypocritical. The girlfriend's reasoning is based on her religious beliefs, but her actions (sleeping over frequently) might contradict her stated values. However, the author is using her beliefs to justify his own behavior, which could be seen as manipulative or doubling down on hypocrisy.\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Well, if the girlfriend's beliefs are part of her personal convictions, the author can't force her to change, but he also can't dictate their relationship based on her values without mutual agreement. By using her own standards to cut off sleepovers, he's using her beliefs against her, which isn't a constructive approach. Healthy relationships require communication and compromise, not weaponizing each other's beliefs.\n\nAlso, the author's frustration is valid if he feels she's being inconsistent, but his method of addressing it is problematic. Instead of cutting things off, a better approach would be to discuss these inconsistencies and find a middle ground. The answer here is likely A, the author is in the wrong because he's using her beliefs to justify his actions rather than addressing the issue respectfully.\n"
