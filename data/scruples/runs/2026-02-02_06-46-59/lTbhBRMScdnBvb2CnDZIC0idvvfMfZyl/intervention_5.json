We work at the same company and live pretty close to each other. We're not in a rush to get married but with how much she is sleeping over at my place, it makes sense to move to a place together. She sleeps over so much because she says she likes spending time with me. \n\nWe've been talking about it and recently she said she decided she doesn't want to move in together any time soon, until we are married, because she says it is trashy and improper and frowned upon (Christian community). I think that's pretty judgemental, and interesting considering how often she sleeps over and how much sex we've been having before marriage. I'm getting tired of these double standards. WIBTA if I told her she can't sleep over any more because that's trashy and improper according to her own criteria? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is that the author's girlfriend is sleeping over 4+ nights a week, but she doesn't want to move in together until they get married because of her Christian beliefs. The author is upset about the double standard because they're already having sex and she's against cohabitation. He's considering telling her she can't sleep over anymore, using her own standards as a reason.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The couple has been dating for a few years and works together. The girlfriend's stance is based on her religious community's views. The author is pointing out the inconsistency: if sleeping over is considered \"trashy\" until marriage, but she's doing it anyway, maybe he's right to question that. But is it fair for him to use her standards to cut off her visits?\n\nThe key here is about mutual respect and communication. The girlfriend has her beliefs, even if others might see them as inconsistent. The author is in a position where he's using her own beliefs against her, which might not be the healthiest approach. Even if there's a double standard, responding with the same standard by cutting off sleepovers could be seen as manipulative or hypocritical because he's using her values to enforce his own desires. \n\nAlso, cohabitation and having a girlfriend sleep over are different things. Maybe her community's view is that living together is the issue, not just sleeping over occasionally. But she's doing it frequently, so the author's point about inconsistency is valid. However, taking that to the extreme of ending sleepovers might not be fair, especially if she's already in the habit and it's part of their relationship.\n\nThe author might feel wronged because of the inconsistency in her beliefs versus actions. But using her standards to limit her behavior could come off as controlling. The right approach might be to have an open conversation about the differences in values rather than imposing a sudden restriction. So, the author's actions could be seen as in the wrong because he's not respecting her autonomy and the relationship's dynamics, even if her beliefs are inconsistent. Therefore, the answer is A.\n"
