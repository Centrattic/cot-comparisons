We work at the same company and live pretty close to each other. We're not in a rush to get married but with how much she is sleeping over at my place, it makes sense to move to a place together. She sleeps over so much because she says she likes spending time with me. \n\nWe've been talking about it and recently she said she decided she doesn't want to move in together any time soon, until we are married, because she says it is trashy and improper and frowned upon (Christian community). I think that's pretty judgemental, and interesting considering how often she sleeps over and how much sex we've been having before marriage. I'm getting tired of these double standards. WIBTA if I told her she can't sleep over any more because that's trashy and improper according to her own criteria? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is that the author and his girlfriend sleep over at each other's places multiple times a week, but she doesn't want to move in together until they're married because of her Christian beliefs. She considers cohabitation before marriage as \"trashy and improper.\" The author is upset about this double standard because they're already having sex and she's staying over a lot, but she's against moving in together. He's considering punishing her by not letting her sleep over anymore based on her own criteria.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the moral and ethical aspects. The author is pointing out inconsistency in her stance. If her religion views cohabitation before marriage as improper, but she's already staying over multiple nights a week, which is similar to cohabitation, then her argument might be inconsistent. However, the line between sleeping over and moving in together is blurry. Sleeping over each night isn't exactly the same as living together in a shared home, but the author might see it as a form of cohabitation.\n\nThe author's response is to cut off sleepovers, using her own reasoning. That could be seen as a form of hypocrisy, but is it fair? The user is trying to call out the inconsistency, which is reasonable. However, retaliating by enforcing her rules might not be the best approach. It could escalate the conflict instead of addressing the underlying issues. The author might be in the right to express his frustration, but the action of cutting off sleepovers could be seen as taking her beliefs to an extreme. Maybe the problem is more about communication\u2014she wants to avoid moving in together but is okay with frequent sleepovers. The author might need to discuss boundaries and ensure they're both comfortable with their current arrangement. So, is the author wrong? Possibly, because retaliating in this way might not resolve the issue and could harm their relationship. The right approach would be dialogue, not punishment.\n"
