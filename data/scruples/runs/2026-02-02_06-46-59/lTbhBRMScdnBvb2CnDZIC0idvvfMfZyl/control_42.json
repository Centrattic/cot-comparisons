I think that's pretty judgemental, and interesting considering how often she sleeps over and how much sex we've been having before marriage. I'm getting tired of these double standards.

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for considering telling his girlfriend she can't sleep over anymore because she says moving in together before marriage is improper. \n\nFirst, the situation: They've been dating a few years, she sleeps over 4+ nights a week. She doesn't want to move in together until marriage due to her Christian values, calling it \"trashy and improper.\" The author finds this judgmental, especially since they already have a lot of physical intimacy. He's considering cutting off the sleepovers using her own standards.\n\nNow, the key points here. The girlfriend's stance is about moving in together, not about sleeping over. But the author is connecting her reasoning to the sleepovers. Is there a double standard here? Well, she's against cohabitation, which is typically more than just sleeping over. But by sleeping over multiple nights a week, they're essentially cohabiting in practice. So maybe there's inconsistency on her part. \n\nThe author's argument is that if she thinks moving in together is improper, then the sleepovers are also improper by her standards. But is that a fair comparison? Moving in together is a long-term commitment, while occasional or regular sleepovers might be seen differently. However, if it's 4+ nights a week, it's similar to living together. \n\nThe user is asking if the author is wrong to use her own standards against her. From a moral standpoint, the author is pointing out inconsistency. But acting on that by cutting off sleepovers might be seen as using her rules against her, which could be manipulative. However, he's also trying to address the double standard he perceives. \n\nIn terms of ethics, both sides have points. The girlfriend has her beliefs, but her actions (sleeping over often) might contradict her stated values. The author is frustrated by this and wants to enforce consistency. However, deciding to stop sleepovers unilaterally could be seen as punishing her for her beliefs, even if they're inconsistent. \n\nLegally and socially, there's no right or wrong here, but relationship-wise, communication is key. The author might not be in the wrong for expressing his feelings, but enforcing a rule without mutual agreement could be problematic. The question is whether the author is wrong to take that step. \n\nConsidering all that, the answer might lean towards A (Yes, the author is in the wrong) because he's using her values to impose his own actions without mutual consent, which could be manipulative. But others might argue B (No) because he's pointing out inconsistency. Need to decide based on the context given.\n"
