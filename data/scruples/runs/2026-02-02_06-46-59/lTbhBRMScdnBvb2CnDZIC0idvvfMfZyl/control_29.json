We work at the same company and live pretty close to each other. We're not in a rush to get married but with how much she is sleeping over at my place, it makes sense to move to a place together. She sleeps over so much because she says she likes spending time with me. \n\nWe've been talking about it and recently she said she decided she doesn't want to move in together any time soon, until we are married, because she says it is trashy and improper and frowned upon (Christian community). I think that's pretty judgemental, and interesting considering how often she sleeps over and how much sex we've been having before marriage. I'm getting tired of these double standards. WIBTA if I told her she can't sleep over any more because that's trashy and improper according to her own criteria? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for considering telling their girlfriend she can't sleep over anymore. The situation involves their beliefs about cohabitation before marriage, especially given their Christian community's views.\n\nFirst, the girlfriend sleeps over 4+ nights a week but doesn't want to move in together until marriage. She cites it being \"trashy and improper\" for their community. The author is frustrated because she's already staying over so much and even having sex, yet she's against moving in. The author is considering using her own standards to deny her from sleeping over.\n\nI need to consider the ethical angle here. The author's action is retaliating with the same standards she's using. But is that fair? The girlfriend is applying a double standard\u2014she's okay with frequent visits but not moving in. The author wants to enforce her standards, which might not be appropriate.\n\nAlso, communication is key in relationships. The author should discuss this calmly instead of making a unilateral decision. Forcing someone to stop sleeping over could be seen as controlling, even if the girlfriend's stance is causing conflict. The author's motivation here is to hold her to her own standards, but using that against her might escalate tensions and isn't the best way to resolve differences.\n\nReligious values are personal, but they shouldn't be used to control the other person's behavior without mutual agreement. The author's approach might be seen as manipulative. Instead of cutting off visits, they should work together to find a compromise that respects both their values and needs.\n\nSo, the answer is A\u2014the author is in the wrong. Their approach is using her own standards against her, which isn't fair and could be harmful. They should focus on open communication rather than retaliation.\n"
