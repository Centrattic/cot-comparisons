We work at the same company and live pretty close to each other. We're not in a rush to get married but with how much she is sleeping over at my place, it makes sense to move to a place together. She sleeps over so much because she says she likes spending time with me. \n\nWe've been talking about it and recently she said she decided she doesn't want to move in together any time soon, until we are married, because she says it is trashy and improper and frowned upon (Christian community). I think that's pretty judgemental, and interesting considering how often she sleeps over and how much sex we've been having before marriage. I'm getting tired of these double standards. WIBTA if I told her she can't sleep over any more because that's trashy and improper according to her own criteria? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author of the scenario is in the wrong for considering telling his girlfriend she can't sleep over anymore because she previously said moving in together before marriage is \"trashy and improper\" in their Christian community. The key points here are the conflict over cohabitation versus sleeping over, and the author's decision to use her own standards against her.\n\nFirst, the girlfriend sleeps over 4+ nights a week. The author thinks it's logical to move in together, but she refuses because of her beliefs. The author is frustrated with her double standards, as she's sleeping over frequently but opposes moving in. He's considering cutting off sleepovers using her own reasoning. \n\nNow, the question is whether he's wrong to do that. From a moral standpoint, using someone's own beliefs against them to enforce a different behavior might be seen as hypocritical or manipulative. The girlfriend's stance is that cohabitation before marriage is improper, but she's already engaging in frequent overnight stays and sexual activity. The author's response is to apply her standards to limit her presence, which could be seen as taking her beliefs to an extreme that she didn't intend. \n\nHowever, the author is also reacting to what he perceives as inconsistency. He's not directly enforcing her rules, but using her reasoning to justify his own action. This could be a form of pointing out hypocrasy, but it might not be the most constructive approach. \n\nIn terms of right or wrong, the author's action is a response to her standards, but it's a bit of a trap. By enforcing her rules in a way that's inconvenient for her, he's punishing her for the standards she set. That could be seen as unfair, especially if the relationship dynamics change suddenly. The user initially thought the author is in the wrong, and I lean towards that too because it's using her beliefs against her in a way that may not resolve the underlying issues but instead create more conflict. \n\nSo the answer would be A (the author is in the wrong) because he's applying her standards inconsistently to control the situation, which might not address the core of their differences and could be seen as manipulative.\n"
