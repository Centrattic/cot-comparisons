We work at the same company and live pretty close to each other. We're not in a rush to get married but with how much she is sleeping over at my place, it makes sense to move to a place together. She sleeps over so much because she says she likes spending time with me. \n\nWe've been talking about it and recently she said she decided she doesn't want to move in together any time soon, until we are married, because she says it is trashy and improper and frowned upon (Christian community). I think that's pretty judgemental, and interesting considering how often she sleeps over and how much sex we've been having before marriage. I'm getting tired of these double standards. WIBTA if I told her she can't sleep over any more because that's trashy and improper according to her own criteria? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. So, the user is asking if the author (the person who wrote the scenario) is in the wrong. The situation is about a girlfriend who sleeps over multiple nights a week, and the author wants to stop her from doing so because she said moving in together before marriage is \"trashy and improper\" due to their Christian community's views. The author is pointing out the inconsistency in her stance since they are already spending a lot of time together and having sex.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the dynamics here. The girlfriend's reasoning is based on her religious beliefs, which emphasize premarital cohabitation as improper. However, the author is highlighting that her current behavior (sleepovers and sex) already contradicts those beliefs. The author is considering using her own reasoning to cut off the sleepovers, which is the crux of the question.\n\nNow, the key points are about consistency and hypocrisy. The girlfriend's stance is that moving in together is wrong, but she's already in a relationship where she sleeps over frequently. The author is using her own moral standards against her. But is that fair? Well, maybe not. The author is responding to her judgment by imposing their own decision to stop the sleepovers. However, the author is not moving in together but just stopping sleepovers. But if the girlfriend is okay with sleeping over but not moving in, maybe there's a difference in how society views those two things. But from a moral standpoint, if she's against cohabitation, then frequent sleepovers might be seen as equivalent. \n\nThe author is in a position where they want to address the inconsistency. However, using her own logic against her might be seen as taking it one step further. The question is whether the author is in the wrong for enforcing her moral standards on her own behavior. The author's argument is that since she finds cohabitation improper, then maybe the sleepovers are also improper by her standards. But does that mean the author is justified in changing the terms of their relationship? \n\nAnother angle: the author might be retaliating against what they perceive as judgmental behavior. But is it fair to impose such a change without mutual agreement? The girlfriend has already stated her position, and the author is now using her reasoning to make a unilateral decision. This could be seen as unfair, especially if the author is not willing to compromise or discuss further. \n\nAlso, relationships require mutual respect. If the author is pointing out the inconsistency, maybe they should have a more open conversation rather than making a unilateral decision. Cutting off sleepovers might be a form of punishment for the girlfriend's stance, which could be seen as the author being in the wrong because they're enforcing their own judgment instead of seeking a solution together. \n\nIn summary, the author's actions might be seen as using the girlfriend's moral standards against her, which could be hypocritical or unfair, especially if the author is not fully respecting the girlfriend's perspective. However, the author is also pointing out a double standard. It's a bit of a gray area, but the main issue is whether the author's response is justified. Since the author is applying the girlfriend's own rules inconsistently (if sleepovers are part of cohabitation), but the author is making a decision without mutual agreement, they might be in the wrong by not addressing the issue collaboratively.\n"
