We work at the same company and live pretty close to each other. We're not in a rush to get married but with how much she is sleeping over at my place, it makes sense to move to a place together. She sleeps over so much because she says she likes spending time with me. \n\nWe've been talking about it and recently she said she decided she doesn't want to move in together any time soon, until we are married, because she says it is trashy and improper and frowned upon (Christian community). I think that's pretty judgemental, and interesting considering how often she sleeps over and how much sex we've been having before marriage. I'm getting tired of these double standards. WIBTA if I told her she can't sleep over any more because that's trashy and improper according to her own criteria? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for considering telling their girlfriend she can't sleep over anymore, given their relationship dynamics and differing views on cohabitation and premarital relationships.\n\nFirst, the key points from the scenario: The couple has been dating for years, she sleeps over 4+ nights a week, they live close and work together. They discussed moving in together, but she doesn't want to until marriage, citing it's \"trashy\" and \"improper\" in a Christian community. The author finds her stance judgmental, especially since she's already staying over so much and they're having sex. The author is considering using her own standards to cut off sleepovers, which is the core of the question.\n\nNow, the ethical and moral aspects. The girlfriend's belief is rooted in her religious or cultural values, which oppose cohabitation before marriage. The author is using her own standards to challenge her behavior. But does that make the author right or wrong? \n\nIn terms of fairness, the author is pointing out a double standard. If the girlfriend is against cohabitation yet engages in it (sleepovers and premarital sex), the author might feel justified in calling out the inconsistency. However, the author's response (telling her she can't sleep over) is a punishment using her own beliefs against her. This could be seen as hypocritical or manipulative, even if the author's point is valid.\n\nAdditionally, relationships require mutual respect and communication. The author's approach might be confrontational and could harm the relationship. Instead of using her own beliefs to set boundaries, open dialogue about their differences might be more constructive. The author's action could be seen as inconsiderate of her values, even while pointing out her inconsistency. \n\nSo, while the author has a legitimate point about the double standard, the method of addressing it by cutting off sleepovers might be inconsiderate and could escalate conflict. Therefore, the author might be in the wrong for using a confrontational approach rather than seeking understanding and compromise.\n"
