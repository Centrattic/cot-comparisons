We work at the same company and live pretty close to each other. We're not in a rush to get married but with how much she is sleeping over at my place, it makes sense to move to a place together. She sleeps over so much because she says she likes spending time with me. \n\nWe've been talking about it and recently she said she decided she doesn't want to move in together any time soon, until we are married, because she says it is trashy and improper and frowned upon (Christian community). I think that's pretty judgemental, and interesting considering how often she sleeps over and how much sex we've been having before marriage. I'm getting tired of these double standards. WIBTA if I told her she can't sleep over any more because that's trashy and improper according to her own criteria? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for wanting to stop their girlfriend from sleeping over, based on her own standards. The situation involves cultural or religious beliefs about cohabitation before marriage.\n\nFirst, the girlfriend sleeps over 4+ nights a week, which is a significant amount. She's against moving in together until marriage, citing Christian values. The author is frustrated because she's living with him in all but official terms and sees her stance as a double standard. The author wants to use her own reasoning to limit her sleepovers, which seems like a retaliation.\n\nI need to consider mutual respect in relationships. If both partners are contributing to the situation, maybe both have responsibilities. The girlfriend's belief might be genuine, but if she's comfortable with other aspects (like sex) before marriage, the author's point about inconsistency is valid. However, using her beliefs to enforce his own changes might not be fair. The key is whether the author is respecting her boundaries even if he disagrees.\n\nThe author's threat to stop sleepovers based on her standards could be seen as hypocritical, especially if he's not moving out. Also, relationships require compromise. If she's willing to sleep over but not move in, the author might need to address the underlying issue (moving in together) rather than just the sleepovers. His approach might be punitive rather than constructive. So, he's not considering her reasons and reacting with his own, which could be the wrong approach.\n"
