I think that's pretty judgemental, and interesting considering how often she sleeps over and how much sex we've been having before marriage. I'm getting tired of these double standards.

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the person (the author) is in the wrong here. The situation is about a girlfriend who sleeps over 4+ nights a week at his place. They work together and live close. The author wants to move in together, but she says no until marriage because of her Christian community's views. The author is upset because she's sleeping over so much and having sex before marriage, which he sees as hypocritical. He's considering telling her she can't sleep over anymore based on her own standards.\n\nSo, the main issue is about double standards and whether the author is justified in cutting off her sleepovers. Let's break it down. The girlfriend's stance is that moving in together before marriage is improper, but she's already sleeping over frequently. The author is pointing out the inconsistency. He's not happy with the double standards and wants to enforce her own rules.\n\nIs the author wrong for doing that? Well, the question is whether he's in the wrong. On one hand, he's using her own reasoning against her, which could be seen as holding her to her stated values. On the other hand, relationships are about mutual respect and communication. If the girlfriend is the one setting the rules (no cohabitation until marriage), but is already engaging in other behaviors (sleeping over, sex) that might be against those same values, the author is pointing out her inconsistency. \n\nBut is it fair for him to impose his own judgment by cutting off her sleepovers? That could be seen as taking her moral stance literally. However, if the relationship is based on mutual agreement, and she's already going against her own stated values by sleeping over, then he's just holding her accountable. However, this might be seen as a bit of a trap\u2014using her own rules to limit her actions. \n\nAlso, the author might be feeling that the relationship is moving in a direction (cohabitation) she's not ready for, but she's still engaging in other aspects (sleepovers, sex) that he might consider part of the same context. The author's frustration is understandable, but is it his place to enforce her beliefs on her? Maybe not. It's her choice to sleep over, and if she's breaking her own rules, it's her inconsistency, not necessarily his. But by saying he won't let her sleep over anymore because of her own standards, he's imposing his will, which could be controlling. \n\nAlternatively, if they're both in agreement that they want to follow Christian values, but she's choosing to sleep over, he's just upholding the values she claims to hold. But maybe she's the one who's being inconsistent, so he's not in the wrong for pointing that out. However, relationships require compromise. If he's using her own standards to cut off something she wants, he's being hypocritical in a way, because he's applying her standards to her but maybe not to himself. \n\nWait, but the question is whether the author is in the wrong. If the author is using her own standards to limit her actions, is that fair? It might be a way to highlight her hypocrisy, but it's also setting boundaries based on her values. But is it his place to enforce that? Maybe not. Because she's the one who chose to sleep over, and he's the one who's supposed to be respecting her values. If he's enforcing her values on her, that's not his role. He should communicate his feelings and maybe reconsider the relationship if there's a fundamental disagreement. \n\nSo, the answer might be A (the author is in the wrong) because he's using her values to dictate her actions in a controlling way, rather than addressing the inconsistency through dialogue. Or B (not in the wrong) because he's pointing out her own hypocrisy. \n\nHmm. The key is whether it's his place to enforce her standards. Since she's the one who set the criteria, but is acting against it, maybe he's not in the wrong by pointing it out. However, making a unilateral decision to stop her from sleeping over could be seen as taking her moral stance to an extreme that's not necessary. It's possible he's overreacting by using her own words against her in a way that's not constructive. \n\nSo, considering all that, the answer is probably A. The author is in the wrong because he's using her standards to limit her without mutual agreement and it's not his role to enforce her values on her. Instead of cutting her off, he should communicate and resolve the underlying issues. So the answer is A.\n"
