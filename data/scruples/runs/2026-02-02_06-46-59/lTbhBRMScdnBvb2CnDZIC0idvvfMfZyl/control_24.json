      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The question is whether the author is in the wrong for telling their girlfriend she can't sleep over anymore, based on her own standards.\n\nFirst, the situation: They've been dating a few years. She sleeps over 4+ nights a week. They work together, so maybe proximity makes it easier. The author thinks moving in together is practical, but she doesn't want to because of her Christian community's views, calling it \"trashy and improper until married.\" The author is frustrated by her double standards since they already have a lot of physical intimacy. Now, the author is considering using her own arguments against her by saying she can't sleep over anymore because that's also against her standards.\n\nHmm. The key issue is about double standards. She's making a moral judgment about moving in together but is okay with sleeping over and having sex before marriage. The author is pointing out the inconsistency. But should the author use her logic to enforce a restriction?\n\nWell, if the author's argument is that her standards are being used to justify his actions, does that make sense? The problem is that the author is using her own moral framework against her. If she finds it hypocritical, maybe he's pointing out a flaw in her reasoning. But does that mean he's in the wrong to use her rules against her?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the author is right in highlighting the inconsistency and thus not in the wrong. However, enforcing a rule that he himself isn't following (since he's comfortable with the current arrangement) might be a conflict. Wait, but the author isn't moving in with her; he's just suggesting stopping sleepovers. But if he's okay with the current level of intimacy, maybe he's also being inconsistent. However, the question is about whether he's wrong to act on her standards.\n\nAnother angle: The author is trying to apply her own standards to her behavior. If her standard is that pre-marital cohabitation is wrong, and he's following her standard by stopping her from sleeping over, is he in the wrong? Or is he just applying her logic? But maybe the author is being hypocritical if he's okay with other aspects of their relationship that she considers improper. The user mentions they have a lot of sex before marriage, which she doesn't seem to oppose. So the author is pointing out that her standards are inconsistent. But if he's using her standards to restrict her, maybe that's a valid point, but does that make him in the wrong?\n\nAlso, the dynamic of the relationship is important. Changing the rules on sleepovers could be a sudden shift, causing conflict. The author's frustration is understandable, but using her own logic against her might not be the healthiest approach, even if it's logically consistent. However, the question is whether he's in the wrong. If the standards are hers, and he's applying them, maybe he's not wrong. But maybe he's wrong because it's a manipulation tactic. It's a bit of a gray area.\n\nIn terms of moral wrongdoing, if the author is enforcing her standards, he's not necessarily in the wrong. However, the context includes that they're both adults and the standards are her own. If he's using her beliefs to control the relationship, that could be problematic. But the user's question is about whether he's in the wrong. The answer might be B (No) because he's pointing out her inconsistency by applying her own standards, thereby not being in the wrong. Alternatively, maybe it's A (Yes) because it's using her beliefs against her, which is manipulative. But the user is asking for a yes or no based on the situation.\n\nAnother thought: If the author is following her logic, then he's not wrong. But if the logic is inconsistent, maybe he's right to challenge it. But the act of enforcing her standards could be seen as using her own words against her, which might not be fair. But again, if her standards are inconsistent, the author is showing that. It's a bit of a paradox. I think in this context, the answer would be B (No), because he's using her own standards to highlight inconsistency, and thus not in the wrong.\n"
