She sleeps over so much because she says she likes spending time with me. \n\nWe've been talking about it and recently she said she decided she doesn't want to move in together any time soon, until we are married, because she says it is trashy and improper and frowned upon (Christian community). I think that's pretty judgemental, and interesting considering how often she sleeps over and how much sex we've been having before marriage. I'm getting tired of these double standards.

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that they're in a relationship and have been sleeping over a lot, four or more nights a week. They work at the same company and live close. The girlfriend doesn't want to move in together until they get married because of her Christian beliefs, calling it \"trashy and improper.\" But the author is pointing out the double standards because they're already sleeping together a lot.\n\nFirst, the question is whether the author is in the wrong if they decide to stop letting her sleep over because of her own standards. The key here is about hypocrisy and mutual respect. The girlfriend is setting a boundary based on her beliefs, but she's also engaging in behavior (sleeping over and having sex) that she deems improper until marriage. The author is frustrated and wants to apply the same standard, hence the dilemma.\n\nSo, the author is reacting to her double standards. If he uses her own reasoning against her, is that fair? Well, in relationships, both parties should respect each other's boundaries. If she's uncomfortable with moving in together but is okay with sleeping over, there's a contradiction. The author is pointing out that inconsistency and wants to set a boundary based on her own beliefs. \n\nIs the author in the wrong for holding her to the same standards she's applying? That could be seen as hypocritical, but maybe the author is just trying to be consistent. However, relationships require communication and negotiation. If the author suddenly stops allowing her to sleep over without discussing it, that could be abrupt and hurtful. The right approach would be to talk through the issues and find a compromise, not to use her own words against her in a punitive way. \n\nBut the question is whether he's in the wrong by taking that stance. If he's using her standards to justify his actions, that's logical but might be seen as using her beliefs against her. However, if she's the one who brought up the double standards, then the author is just pointing out the inconsistency. Still, acting on it without mutual agreement could be problematic. \n\nIn terms of fairness, the author isn't in the wrong because he's responding to her own criteria. However, the way he enforces it could be harsh. But the question is about being in the wrong, not about the best approach. Since he's pointing out her inconsistency and applying her own standards, maybe he's not wrong. So the answer might be B (No), but I need to be careful. Alternatively, maybe the author is wrong because it's using her beliefs against her without considering her perspective. But she's the one who set the standards. Hmm. I think B makes sense here.\n"
