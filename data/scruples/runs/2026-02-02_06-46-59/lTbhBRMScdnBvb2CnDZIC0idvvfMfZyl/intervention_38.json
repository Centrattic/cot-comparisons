We work at the same company and live pretty close to each other. We're not in a rush to get married but with how much she is sleeping over at my place, it makes sense to move to a place together. She sleeps over so much because she says she likes spending time with me. \n\nWe've been talking about it and recently she said she decided she doesn't want to move in together any time soon, until we are married, because she says it is trashy and improper and frowned upon (Christian community). I think that's pretty judgemental, and interesting considering how often she sleeps over and how much sex we've been having before marriage. I'm getting tired of these double standards. WIBTA if I told her she can't sleep over any more because that's trashy and improper according to her own criteria? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person (the author) is in the wrong for considering telling his girlfriend she can't sleep over anymore. The main issue here is the conflict between their views on cohabitation before marriage, especially in the context of their Christian beliefs.\n\nFirst, the girlfriend sleeps over 4+ nights a week at the author's place. They work together and live close. The author thinks moving in together makes sense because of the frequency of her visits, but the girlfriend refuses because she believes it's improper and against their community's standards. The author is frustrated by what he sees as double standards since they're already having sex and she's sleeping over often, yet she's against moving in together. He's considering using her own reasoning to cut off the sleepovers.\n\nThe key points here are consent, mutual respect, and the implications of their actions. The girlfriend has made her stance clear: she doesn't want to cohabitate before marriage. The author, on the other hand, is using her \"double standards\" as a reason to limit her visits. But if he follows her reasoning strictly, he should be the one to set boundaries, not her. However, the author is using her own argument against her, which might be seen as manipulative or unfair. \n\nAlso, the author's frustration is understandable, but the solution he's considering (cutting off sleepovers) might not be fair. If the girlfriend is willing to sleep over but not move in, she's maintaining a boundary. The author's response could be seen as punishing her for her beliefs, rather than addressing the underlying issue. They need to communicate better and find a compromise, maybe adjusting the frequency of sleepovers to align with both their comfort levels. \n\nIn a healthy relationship, both partners should respect each other's boundaries and work towards a solution that's fair. The author is using her argument in a way that could be seen as hypocritical because he's enforcing a boundary she set, but in a way that might not align with her actual actions. However, the girlfriend's initial stance is also a bit contradictory if she's okay with frequent sleepovers but not cohabitation. \n\nUltimately, the author's approach could be seen as wrong because he's using her reasoning to impose a restriction without mutual agreement. It's more about respecting each other's values and finding a middle ground rather than using the other's beliefs as a weapon. So, the answer would be A (Yes, the author is in the wrong).\n"
