We work at the same company and live pretty close to each other. We're not in a rush to get married but with how much she is sleeping over at my place, it makes sense to move to a place together. She sleeps over so much because she says she likes spending time with me. \n\nWe've been talking about it and recently she said she decided she doesn't want to move in together any time soon, until we are married, because she says it is trashy and improper and frowned upon (Christian community). I think that's pretty judgemental, and interesting considering how often she sleeps over and how much sex we've been having before marriage. I'm getting tired of these double standards. WIBTA if I told her she can't sleep over any more because that's trashy and improper according to her own criteria? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author (the person in the \"What Would I Be The Asshole?\" scenario) is in the wrong for deciding to tell their girlfriend she can't sleep over anymore. The situation involves a long-term relationship where the couple works together and lives close, with the girlfriend sleeping over multiple nights a week. They're discussing moving in together, but she's against it until marriage due to her Christian beliefs, calling it \"trashy and improper.\" The author is frustrated by this double standard and wants to retaliate by stopping her from sleeping over, using her own criteria against her.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points here. The girlfriend's stance is based on her religious beliefs, which she holds as important. The author is pointing out the inconsistency between her beliefs and her actions (sleeping over and having sex before marriage). However, using her own standards to enforce changes in the relationship could be seen as manipulative or hypocritical.\n\nRelationships require mutual respect and compromise. The author is using the girlfriend's own values to justify their decision, but this might be a form of gaslighting or emotional manipulation. The girlfriend's choice to sleep over is based on her desire to spend time with the author, and if the author is now using her beliefs to cut off that access, it's a power play rather than a genuine respect for her values.\n\nAlso, the author's frustration is valid if they feel their partner is being judgmental. However, responding by enforcing her beliefs against her could backfire. It's about whether the author's approach is fair. Even if the girlfriend's stance is inconsistent, the author's method of addressing it by cutting off the relationship dynamic they both enjoy (sleepovers) might be seen as punitive.\n\nMoreover, the author is in a position where they can enforce this rule because they're the one offering the place to stay. The girlfriend might feel pressured, which could be emotionally abusive. Healthy relationships don't use each other's beliefs as weapons.\n\nSo, the author is trying to correct a perceived hypocrisy, but their method is likely harmful. The right approach would be to discuss boundaries and find a compromise rather than using the partner's beliefs to restrict their time together. Therefore, the author is in the wrong by taking a confrontational and manipulative approach instead of addressing the issue through open communication and mutual respect.\n"
