We work at the same company and live pretty close to each other. We're not in a rush to get married but with how much she is sleeping over at my place, it makes sense to move to a place together. She sleeps over so much because she says she likes spending time with me. \n\nWe've been talking about it and recently she said she decided she doesn't want to move in together any time soon, until we are married, because she says it is trashy and improper and frowned upon (Christian community). I think that's pretty judgemental, and interesting considering how often she sleeps over and how much sex we've been having before marriage. I'm getting tired of these double standards. WIBTA if I told her she can't sleep over any more because that's trashy and improper according to her own criteria? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the given scenario is in the wrong. The situation involves a girlfriend who sleeps over at the author's place 4+ nights a week. They're not in a rush to get married, but the girlfriend doesn't want to move in together soon because of her religious beliefs (Christian community) deeming it improper. The author is considering cutting off the sleepovers as a way to point out the double standard, since they're already having sex before marriage.\n\nFirst, I need to assess the ethical implications here. The author is reacting to what they perceive as a double standard. The girlfriend's stance is against cohabitation before marriage but is okay with sleeping over and having sex. The author is using her own standards to justify ending the sleepovers, which could be seen as holding her to her own stated values. However, that approach might not be the healthiest way to handle a relationship conflict.\n\nI should consider the principles of respect and communication. Even if someone's beliefs are flawed, confronting them by imposing consequences (like cutting off sleepovers) can be seen as manipulative or punitive. The author is using her own rules against her, which might not be fair. It's possible that the author is trying to highlight inconsistency, but the method could be problematic.\n\nAnother angle is the power dynamics in the relationship. The author is making a unilateral decision based on the girlfriend's stated values. That could be seen as controlling, especially if the girlfriend didn't expect her beliefs to be used against her in this way. The author might be overstepping by enforcing her interpretation of her partner's values.\n\nOn the other hand, the author has the right to set boundaries in a relationship. If the girlfriend's behavior is inconsistent with her stated values, the author might feel it's necessary to address it. However, the approach of suddenly cutting off sleepovers without open discussion might be harsh. A better approach would be to have a conversation about the inconsistencies and expectations.\n\nThe key here is whether the author's action is a justified response to a double standard or if it's an unfair application of the girlfriend's beliefs. The author's intention might be to encourage the girlfriend to recognize her own inconsistency, but doing so by imposing a punishment could damage the relationship's trust and mutual respect.\n\nIn conclusion, while there's an argument that the author is pointing out a legitimate issue, the method of enforcing a consequence based on the girlfriend's stated values could be seen as inconsiderate and disrespectful. The answer likely leans towards A, the author being in the wrong, because the approach is punitive and might not be the best way to resolve such a conflict.\n"
