We work at the same company and live pretty close to each other. We're not in a rush to get married but with how much she is sleeping over at my place, it makes sense to move to a place together. She sleeps over so much because she says she likes spending time with me. \n\nWe've been talking about it and recently she said she decided she doesn't want to move in together any time soon, until we are married, because she says it is trashy and improper and frowned upon (Christian community). I think that's pretty judgemental, and interesting considering how often she sleeps over and how much sex we've been having before marriage. I'm getting tired of these double standards. WIBTA if I told her she can't sleep over any more because that's trashy and improper according to her own criteria? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the situation is in the wrong when considering telling their girlfriend she can't sleep over anymore. The author's girlfriend sleeps over 4+ nights a week, works at the same company, and lives nearby. They're not rushing to marry but the author thinks moving in together makes sense. The girlfriend, however, says she doesn't want to move in until marriage because it's \"trashy and improper\" due to being Christian. The author finds this judgmental since she's already sleeping over and having sex before marriage. The author is considering using her own standards to cut off sleepovers.\n\nSo, the key points here are mutual expectations and consistency. The girlfriend values moving in together only after marriage but currently sleeps over frequently, which is close to cohabitation. The author is pointing out the inconsistency. The question is whether it's wrong for the author to enforce a change based on those standards.\n\nFirst, cohabitation versus sleeping over: sleeping over multiple nights a week might be considered similar to living together for some people, especially if it's regular and ongoing. The girlfriend's stance is that pre-marital cohabitation is improper, but she's already engaging in behavior that's close to that. The author is using her argument against her. \n\nFrom a moral standpoint, if the girlfriend's belief is that cohabitation is improper, then the author is applying the same standard. However, there's a difference between occasional visits and regular, long-term cohabitation. But in this case, the frequency is high enough that it might be seen as de facto cohabitation. \n\nThe author's decision to stop sleepovers could be seen as a form of holding the girlfriend accountable to her own standards, pointing out the inconsistency. But is it fair to use her argument against her? It could be seen as a bit of a trap because the author is using the girlfriend's own reasoning to justify a change in their behavior. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the author is trying to address the inconsistency in their relationship dynamics. If the girlfriend is uncomfortable with moving in together but is comfortable with frequent sleepovers, the author is challenging her to clarify her boundaries. \n\nHowever, the author might be overstepping by suddenly cutting off sleepovers, which could be a significant change in their relationship. The girlfriend might not have foreseen this consequence when setting her boundary. The author's action might be a way to force a situation where the girlfriend has to choose between moving in or adjusting her behavior. \n\nIn terms of fairness, the author is pointing out a double standard, which is valid. But enforcing a change based on that could be seen as manipulative if the author is not also willing to adjust their expectations. The key here is mutual understanding and communication. The author might be justified in expressing their frustration, but acting unilaterally without discussion could be problematic. \n\nSo, considering all that, the author is using the girlfriend's own standards to make a point, which is a valid approach, but whether it's right or wrong depends on the context. If the author is consistent and communicates clearly, it's more about addressing the inconsistency. But if the author is using this to control the situation without dialogue, it could be seen as wrong. \n\nI think the answer is A (Yes, the author is in the wrong) because the author is using the girlfriend's argument in a way that might be seen as manipulative, especially without mutual agreement. However, there's a valid point about inconsistency. But the action of cutting off sleepovers unilaterally without resolving the issue through communication might be considered wrong.\n"
