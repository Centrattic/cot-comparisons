We work at the same company and live pretty close to each other. We're not in a rush to get married but with how much she is sleeping over at my place, it makes sense to move to a place together. She sleeps over so much because she says she likes spending time with me. \n\nWe've been talking about it and recently she said she decided she doesn't want to move in together any time soon, until we are married, because she says it is trashy and improper and frowned upon (Christian community). I think that's pretty judgemental, and interesting considering how often she sleeps over and how much sex we've been having before marriage. I'm getting tired of these double standards. WIBTA if I told her she can't sleep over any more because that's trashy and improper according to her own criteria? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the author (the person who wrote the question) is in the wrong for considering telling their girlfriend she can't sleep over anymore, based on her own standards.\n\nFirst, the situation: They've been dating for years, she sleeps over 4+ nights a week. They work together and live nearby. The author wants to move in together, but the girlfriend doesn't want to because she thinks it's \"trashy\" and improper, especially in their Christian community. The author is frustrated by what they see as a double standard since she's already sleeping over and having sex before marriage. The author is considering cutting off the sleepovers using her own standards as a reason.\n\nSo, the key points here are about double standards and mutual respect. The girlfriend holds a standard against moving in before marriage, yet she's already engaging in behavior (sleeping over, having sex) that might be seen as part of the same issue. The author is pointing out that hypocrisy and using her reasoning to justify stopping the sleepovers.\n\nNow, is the author in the wrong? Well, acting on someone else's standards is tricky. The girlfriend's stance is based on religious or cultural beliefs. The author is using her own criteria to make a decision that affects her. But does that make the author wrong?\n\nOn one hand, the author has a right to set boundaries, especially if they feel their partner is being inconsistent. On the other hand, enforcing someone's standards on them might be overstepping. The author is essentially using her rules against her, which could be seen as manipulative or hypocritical themselves. Also, open communication is key in relationships. Instead of cutting off sleepovers abruptly, discussing the inconsistencies calmly might be better.\n\nThe author's frustration is valid\u2014they're pointing out a perceived inconsistency. But reacting by enforcing her own standards might escalate the conflict rather than resolve it. The right approach would be to talk about their values and find a middle ground, not to weaponize her beliefs against her.\n\nSo, the author's action might not be the right move, but it's not necessarily \"wrong\" in a moral sense. However, the question is about being in the wrong. Since using her standards to cut her off could be seen as using her own beliefs against her in a way that's not constructive, the answer might be that the author is in the wrong because it's a manipulative tactic. Alternatively, if the author is just calling out the hypocrisy, maybe not. But the action of cutting her off based on her standards is probably inconsiderate, hence the answer A.\n"
