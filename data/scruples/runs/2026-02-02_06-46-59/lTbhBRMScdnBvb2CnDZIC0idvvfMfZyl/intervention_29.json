We work at the same company and live pretty close to each other. We're not in a rush to get married but with how much she is sleeping over at my place, it makes sense to move to a place together. She sleeps over so much because she says she likes spending time with me. \n\nWe've been talking about it and recently she said she decided she doesn't want to move in together any time soon, until we are married, because she says it is trashy and improper and frowned upon (Christian community). I think that's pretty judgemental, and interesting considering how often she sleeps over and how much sex we've been having before marriage. I'm getting tired of these double standards. WIBTA if I told her she can't sleep over any more because that's trashy and improper according to her own criteria? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking whether the person in the scenario is in the wrong. The situation involves a girlfriend who sleeps over at her partner's place multiple times a week, and when the partner suggests moving in together, she refuses due to her Christian beliefs, considering it improper. The author is considering cutting off her sleepovers by applying her own standards, which he sees as double standards.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The girlfriend is against cohabitation before marriage but continues to sleep over frequently. The author is upset about this inconsistency. He's thinking of using her own argument (that it's trashy/improper) to stop her from sleeping over, which he sees as a double standard.\n\nNow, thinking about fairness and communication. The girlfriend might have her reasons based on her beliefs, but her actions don't align with her stated values. The author is frustrated and considering a reciprocal action. However, using her own reasoning against her might not be the healthiest approach. Instead, addressing the issue through open dialogue and understanding each other's perspectives could be better.\n\nAlso, the author's intent matters. If he's planning to cut off sleepovers to assert his point, it might come off as manipulative or retaliatory rather than resolving the underlying issue. It's possible he's right to feel she's inconsistent, but the method of confrontation could be problematic. The core issue is about mutual respect and finding a compromise that honors both their values and needs.\n\nIn terms of right or wrong, the author's plan to enforce her standards back on her is a form of applying the same logic she uses. However, it's important to consider whether this approach will resolve the conflict or escalate it. The girlfriend's stance might be based on deeper values, and the author's response could be seen as dismissive of her beliefs, even if he disagrees.\n\nSo, considering all this, the author's approach might be seen as inconsiderate, even if his frustration is valid. The right thing would be to communicate honestly and find a middle ground rather than using her own words against her. Therefore, the answer is likely A, the author is in the wrong.\n"
