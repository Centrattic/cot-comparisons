We work at the same company and live pretty close to each other. We're not in a rush to get married but with how much she is sleeping over at my place, it makes sense to move to a place together. She sleeps over so much because she says she likes spending time with me. \n\nWe've been talking about it and recently she said she decided she doesn't want to move in together any time soon, until we are married, because she says it is trashy and improper and frowned upon (Christian community). I think that's pretty judgemental, and interesting considering how often she sleeps over and how much sex we've been having before marriage. I'm getting tired of these double standards. WIBTA if I told her she can't sleep over any more because that's trashy and improper according to her own criteria? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author (the person in the \"We Are the Same\" situation) is in the wrong. The scenario is about whether telling his girlfriend she can't sleep over anymore is justified because he's upset about her double standards regarding moving in together.\n\nFirst, I need to look at both sides. The girlfriend sleeps over multiple times a week but doesn't want to move in together because of her Christian beliefs, calling it \"trashy and improper.\" The author is frustrated because she's already sleeping over a lot and having sex before marriage, yet she's against moving in together. He wants to set a boundary by blocking her sleepovers, using her own standards against her.\n\nThe key points here are consent and communication. The girlfriend has already chosen to sleep over frequently, which implies mutual agreement. If the author suddenly stops allowing it, that could be seen as a violation of trust or a power imbalance. The author is using her own standards to enforce a boundary that wasn't previously discussed. While he has a valid point about the double standard, cutting off sleepovers abruptly might not be the best approach. It could lead to resentment or confusion. The right approach would be to talk about the inconsistencies and see if they can both agree on boundaries that respect each other's values. Since the author is taking a unilateral decision based on her standards without mutual agreement, that might make him wrong. So the answer is likely A.\n"
