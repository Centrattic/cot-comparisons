We work at the same company and live pretty close to each other. We're not in a rush to get married but with how much she is sleeping over at my place, it makes sense to move to a place together. She sleeps over so much because she says she likes spending time with me. \n\nWe've been talking about it and recently she said she decided she doesn't want to move in together any time soon, until we are married, because she says it is trashy and improper and frowned upon (Christian community). I think that's pretty judgemental, and interesting considering how often she sleeps over and how much sex we've been having before marriage. I'm getting tired of these double standards. WIBTA if I told her she can't sleep over any more because that's trashy and improper according to her own criteria? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person in the scenario is in the wrong. The situation is about a couple who's been dating for a few years, and the girlfriend sleeps over 4+ nights a week. They work together and live close. The guy wants to move in together, but she says no until marriage because of her Christian community's views. He's upset about her double standards because she's already sleeping over a lot and having sex before marriage. He's considering telling her she can't sleep over anymore based on her own criteria.\n\nFirst, I need to assess if the author (the guy) is in the wrong. The key points here are mutual expectations and respect in a relationship. The girlfriend is setting boundaries based on her beliefs, even though her current behavior (sleeping over frequently and having sex) might contradict her stated values. The guy is reacting by wanting to enforce her own standards, which he perceives as hypocritical.\n\nIn relationships, it's important for both partners to communicate their values and work through disagreements. However, using someone else's beliefs against them in a way that's hypocritical or potentially manipulative could be problematic. If the guy is pointing out her inconsistency, that's one thing, but deciding to cut off sleepovers as a punishment based on her standards might not be the right approach. It could be seen as taking her words out of context or using her own standards against her, which could be unfair. Additionally, the girlfriend's stance might be based on personal or religious beliefs, even if she's not living up to them perfectly. The guy's reaction might be more about his own frustration with her double standards than a genuine attempt to respect her beliefs.\n\nAlso, moving in together is a significant step, and her not wanting to do it before marriage is her personal choice. The fact that she's already sleeping over a lot might be a separate issue, but the guy's response seems to be a direct challenge to her beliefs, which might not be constructive. It's important to consider that people can have evolving views and might not always act in a perfectly consistent manner. The guy's approach could lead to conflict rather than resolution.\n\nSo, the author is considering acting on what he sees as hypocrisy, but doing so might not address the underlying issues and could be seen as taking her stance too literally in a way that's not fair. The right approach would likely involve more open communication rather than a punitive action based on mutual inconsistencies.\n"
