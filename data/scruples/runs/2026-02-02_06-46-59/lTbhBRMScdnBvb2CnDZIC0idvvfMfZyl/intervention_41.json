We work at the same company and live pretty close to each other. We're not in a rush to get married but with how much she is sleeping over at my place, it makes sense to move to a place together. She sleeps over so much because she says she likes spending time with me. \n\nWe've been talking about it and recently she said she decided she doesn't want to move in together any time soon, until we are married, because she says it is trashy and improper and frowned upon (Christian community). I think that's pretty judgemental, and interesting considering how often she sleeps over and how much sex we've been having before marriage. I'm getting tired of these double standards. WIBTA if I told her she can't sleep over any more because that's trashy and improper according to her own criteria? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong. The situation is about a couple who have been dating for years, and the girlfriend sleeps over at the guy's place multiple nights a week. They work at the same company and live close. The guy wants to move in together, but the girlfriend says she doesn't want to cohabitate yet because she thinks it's improper in their Christian community. However, the guy is frustrated because she's already staying over a lot and having sex pre-marriage, which he feels is hypocritical. He's considering telling her she can't sleep over anymore using her own standards.\n\nThe user thinks the author is wrong, and I need to agree or disagree. Let's break it down. The key points are her religious beliefs about cohabitation versus her current behavior. She uses the argument that moving in together is improper until marriage, but she's already staying over frequently. The guy is pointing out the inconsistency. However, if he uses her own standards to cut off her sleepovers, that's using her logic against her. The question is whether that's wrong.\n\nFrom an ethical standpoint, using someone's own values against them can be a form of manipulation. Even if there's hypocrisy, retaliating in the same way might not be the healthiest approach. The boyfriend is in a position where he's pointing out her inconsistency, but his method of enforcing her standards could be seen as unfair. He's not in the wrong for pointing out hypocrisy, but using her beliefs to impose restrictions might cross a line. Relationships require communication and mutual respect. Instead of cutting off sleepovers unilaterally, discussing the issue and finding a compromise might be better. So, the author's action might be wrong because it's enforcing her standards without considering her current behavior. Therefore, the answer is A.\n"
