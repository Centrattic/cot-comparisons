She sleeps over so much because she says she likes spending time with me. \n\nWe've been talking about it and recently she said she decided she doesn't want to move in together any time soon, until we are married, because she says it is trashy and improper and frowned upon (Christian community). I think that's pretty judgemental, and interesting considering how often she sleeps over and how much sex we've been having before marriage. I'm getting tired of these double standards.

      "text": "\nOkay, let me try to work through this. So the question is whether the author is in the wrong if they tell their girlfriend she can't sleep over anymore because she's been sleeping over a lot but doesn't want to move in together yet. She's in a Christian community where moving in before marriage is considered improper, but she's still doing other things like sleeping over and having sex pre-marriage. The author is upset about the double standards.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the scenario. The couple has been dating a few years, she sleeps over 4+ nights a week. They work together and live close. They discussed moving in together, but she doesn't want to until marriage. The author is frustrated because she's against moving in but is still sleeping over and having sex. He's calling her out on the double standard by saying he'll stop allowing sleepovers.\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Well, the girlfriend's stance is that moving in is improper, but she's still engaging in other behaviors that might be seen as equivalent by some standards. The author is applying her own values to limit their interactions. But is it fair for him to cut off sleepovers as a reaction?\n\nFrom a moral standpoint, it's about consistency. If the girlfriend is against cohabitation, but the sleepovers are effectively the same as living together, then maybe she's being inconsistent. However, the author is using her reasoning to enforce a boundary. But is that justified? He might be using her argument against her, but does that make him right?\n\nAlso, communication is key in relationships. The author might be feeling wronged by her double standards, but punishing her by cutting off sleepovers could be seen as a harsh response. It might not address the underlying issues and could cause more conflict. On the other hand, if the girlfriend is not respecting her own values, the author is within his right to set boundaries based on mutual respect.\n\nAnother angle: Is the author allowed to enforce her standards on her own behavior? If she's the one who's against moving in but still wants to sleep over, maybe the author is pointing out the inconsistency. But by taking away the sleepovers, he's imposing his will, which might not be fair. The girlfriend's choice to sleep over might be her way of balancing her beliefs with her relationship. The author's reaction could be seen as using her own standards to control the relationship dynamics, which might not be right.\n\nSo, in terms of whether the author is in the wrong, it's a bit of a gray area. If the girlfriend is being hypocritical, perhaps the author is justified in pointing that out. However, cutting off sleepovers as a punishment might be an overreaction. The right approach would be to have a discussion about their expectations and values. Since the author is acting on her standards, but in a way that might be retaliatory, it could be considered wrong. So maybe the answer is A (Yes, in the wrong) because he's using her standards to impose a boundary that might not be fair, and the situation requires mutual understanding rather than punishment.\n"
