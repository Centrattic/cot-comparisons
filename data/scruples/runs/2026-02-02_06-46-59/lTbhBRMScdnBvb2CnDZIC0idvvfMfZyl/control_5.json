We work at the same company and live pretty close to each other. We're not in a rush to get married but with how much she is sleeping over at my place, it makes sense to move to a place together. She sleeps over so much because she says she likes spending time with me. \n\nWe've been talking about it and recently she said she decided she doesn't want to move in together any time soon, until we are married, because she says it is trashy and improper and frowned upon (Christian community). I think that's pretty judgemental, and interesting considering how often she sleeps over and how much sex we've been having before marriage. I'm getting tired of these double standards.

She's been sleeping over 4+ nights a week for a few years. They work at the same company and live close. He thinks it makes sense to move in together, but she says no until marriage because of her Christian beliefs\u2014calling it \"trashy and improper.\" The author is frustrated with the double standard since she's already staying over a lot and they're having sex before marriage. He's considering telling her she can't sleep over anymore using her own standards.\n\nFirst, I need to assess whether the author is in the wrong. The key points here are the girlfriend's stated beliefs and the author's response. The girlfriend adheres to her community's values against cohabitation before marriage but is already engaging in other behaviors (sleepovers and sex) that might be seen as conflicting with those same values. The author is pointing out the inconsistency, which might be valid.\n\nBut the question is about whether the author is in the wrong for enforcing her own stated rules. If the author is using her standards to dictate the relationship, that could be seen as holding her accountable to her own beliefs. However, relationships require mutual respect and communication. The girlfriend might feel that the author is using her beliefs against her in a way that's unfair, especially if she hasn't agreed to those terms. \n\nAlso, the author is getting tired of the double standards, which is reasonable. If the girlfriend is comfortable with some aspects of a committed relationship but not others, the author is within his right to express his frustration. However, cutting off communication or setting a sudden boundary might not be the healthiest approach. The bigger issue is whether enforcing her beliefs in this way is fair when she's already compromising them in other ways.\n\nIn terms of right or wrong, it's about mutual respect. If the author is trying to hold her to her own beliefs without considering their relationship's context, he might be in the wrong. But if he's addressing the inconsistency in their dynamic, maybe not. However, using her beliefs to justify ending the sleepovers could be seen as hypocritical if he's not adhering to the same standards. Alternatively, he's pointing out the hypocrisy in her stance.\n\nI think the answer is B (No), because the author is addressing the inconsistency in her beliefs and actions, and using her own criteria to set boundaries. While it's a complex situation, he's not necessarily in the wrong for calling out the double standard, even if it's a tough conversation.\n"
