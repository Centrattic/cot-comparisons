We work at the same company and live pretty close to each other. We're not in a rush to get married but with how much she is sleeping over at my place, it makes sense to move to a place together. She sleeps over so much because she says she likes spending time with me. \n\nWe've been talking about it and recently she said she decided she doesn't want to move in together any time soon, until we are married, because she says it is trashy and improper and frowned upon (Christian community). I think that's pretty judgemental, and interesting considering how often she sleeps over and how much sex we've been having before marriage. I'm getting tired of these double standards. WIBTA if I told her she can't sleep over any more because that's trashy and improper according to her own criteria? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author of the \"Would I Be Terrible for...\" scenario is in the wrong. The situation is about a couple where the girlfriend sleeps over frequently but doesn't want to move in together until marriage, citing Christian values. The author is considering cutting off the sleepovers because he finds her double standards hypocritical.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The girlfriend is sleeping over multiple nights a week, which is a form of cohabitation even if they don't live together. She's against moving in together until marriage, which she calls \"trashy and improper,\" but she's okay with the current setup. The author feels this is a double standard and wants to stop the sleepovers because he's tired of her judgmental stance. \n\nNow, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. The key points are mutual agreement and respect. The girlfriend has agreed to sleep over but hasn't wanted to commit to moving in together. The author is now using her own values against her to limit her time. But is that fair?\n\nIn relationships, communication is key. The author might be reacting to hypocrisy he perceives, but responding by cutting off sleepovers could be seen as a punishment or a lack of compromise. It's possible that the author isn't addressing the underlying issues (like the move-in decision) through dialogue but instead using her values to enforce his own actions. That could be seen as manipulative or unfair.\n\nAlso, the girlfriend's reasons are based on her religious beliefs, even if the author disagrees. The author's response might be valid in that he's pointing out inconsistency, but the way he's handling it could be problematic. Instead of enforcing a sudden stop to sleepovers, discussing the move-in topic again and finding a middle ground might be more constructive. \n\nOn the other hand, if the girlfriend is being hypocritical, the author has a right to express his feelings. However, using her own standards against her to limit her presence might not be the healthiest approach. It could lead to resentment on both sides.\n\nSo, considering all that, the author might be in the wrong because he's using her values to impose his own conditions rather than working through the situation with mutual respect and communication. The answer is likely A (Yes, the author is in the wrong).\n"
