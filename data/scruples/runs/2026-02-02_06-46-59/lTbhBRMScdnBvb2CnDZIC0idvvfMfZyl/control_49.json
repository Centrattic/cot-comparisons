      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for potentially telling his girlfriend she can't sleep over anymore, based on her own standards.\n\nFirst, the relationship context: They've been dating a few years, she sleeps over 4+ nights a week. They work at the same company and live close, so it's convenient. The main issue is her stance on moving in together before marriage, citing her Christian beliefs as \"trashy and improper,\" even though they're already sleeping together and she's there often. The author is frustrated by the double standard and wants to enforce her own standards by restricting her from sleeping over, which would be a significant change in their current arrangement.\n\nSo, the key points here are mutual expectations and consistency. She's against cohabitation but not against the other aspects of their relationship (sleeping together, spending time). The author is pointing out the inconsistency and wants to hold her to her own standards by limiting their time together. \n\nIs the author wrong? Well, manipulating someone's beliefs against them might not be the best approach. If he's using her standards to cut off her visits, that could be seen as using her own values against her, which might be unfair. Also, their relationship dynamics are already established with her sleeping over; changing that suddenly without addressing the underlying issues (like moving in together) could be harsh. The double standard is valid, but the solution of cutting her off might be reactive rather than constructive. They might need to communicate more about their long-term plans and compromise instead of using her beliefs as a weapon.\n\nAnother angle: The author's action could be seen as respecting her values by stopping the pre-marital cohabitation, but if the girlfriend isn't aware that this is the consequence of her stance, then it's a misunderstanding. The author might need to have a conversation to clarify, but taking action without discussion could be abrupt. The question is whether enforcing her standards in this way is fair. It's a bit of a trap because he's using her beliefs to enforce his own actions, which might not be the healthiest approach. So, the answer might lean towards the author being in the wrong because he's applying her standards in a way that's punitive rather than seeking a mutual solution.\n"
