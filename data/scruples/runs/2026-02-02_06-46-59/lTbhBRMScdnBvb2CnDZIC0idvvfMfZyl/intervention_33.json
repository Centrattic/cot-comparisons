We work at the same company and live pretty close to each other. We're not in a rush to get married but with how much she is sleeping over at my place, it makes sense to move to a place together. She sleeps over so much because she says she likes spending time with me. \n\nWe've been talking about it and recently she said she decided she doesn't want to move in together any time soon, until we are married, because she says it is trashy and improper and frowned upon (Christian community). I think that's pretty judgemental, and interesting considering how often she sleeps over and how much sex we've been having before marriage. I'm getting tired of these double standards. WIBTA if I told her she can't sleep over any more because that's trashy and improper according to her own criteria? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The situation is about a couple in a long-term relationship where the girlfriend sleeps over multiple nights a week. They work together and live nearby. The author is considering telling her she can't sleep over anymore because she refuses to move in together until marriage, citing Christian values about it being \"trashy and improper.\" The author is frustrated by what they see as a double standard since they're already having sex and sleeping over, which might also be considered improper before marriage in some Christian teachings.\n\nFirst, the key issue here is the moral or ethical standards each person is applying. The girlfriend's stance is that moving in together before marriage is frowned upon, but she's okay with sleeping over and having sex. The author is pointing out the inconsistency here and wants to enforce her own standards by cutting off sleepovers, which might be hypocritical because those activities are also premarital and could be seen as improper under the same values.\n\nThe author's reasoning is that if the girlfriend's standards are so strict, then the author should reciprocate by holding her to those standards, even if it's inconvenient. But is this fair? On one hand, the author is challenging the girlfriend's double standards by applying the same logic. On the other hand, the author is potentially cutting off a relationship aspect based on the girlfriend's stated values, which could be seen as using her own rules against her.\n\nNow, considering whether the author is in the wrong. If the author is acting out of frustration and trying to enforce the same standards the girlfriend set, it might be a form of passive-aggressive behavior rather than a constructive conversation. The author's action could be seen as a punitive measure rather than addressing the underlying issues, like communication about boundaries and expectations. \n\nAlso, the girlfriend's reasoning (Christian community's views) might not be absolute, and relationships often require compromise. The author might be overreacting by enforcing a strict rule without considering mutual understanding. However, the author is also pointing out hypocrisy, which is a valid critique. But enforcing a sudden change in behavior (no sleepovers) without discussing it further might not be the healthiest approach.\n\nIn terms of right and wrong, if the author is using the girlfriend's own standards to cut off the relationship, it's a bit of a logical move, but it could be seen as manipulative. The real issue is the double standard, and the author's reaction might not resolve that but instead escalate tension. The author might be in the wrong if they're not considering the broader context of their relationship and the girlfriend's reasons for her stance. Alternatively, if the author is just calling out the inconsistency, that's different from being wrong, but acting on it in a harsh way could be the issue.\n\nI think the author is in the wrong because they're using the girlfriend's standards against her in a way that could be seen as punitive rather than communicative. The proper approach would be to discuss boundaries and maybe reassess the relationship if there's a fundamental mismatch in values. Cutting off sleepovers as a direct consequence without addressing the underlying issues might not be the healthiest or most constructive solution.\n"
