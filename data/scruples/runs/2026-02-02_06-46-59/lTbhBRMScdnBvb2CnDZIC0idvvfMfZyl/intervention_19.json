I think that's pretty judgemental, and interesting considering how often she sleeps over and how much sex we've been having before marriage. I'm getting tired of these double standards.

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for considering telling his girlfriend she can't sleep over anymore because she doesn't want to move in together.\n\nFirst, the situation: They've been dating for years, she sleeps over 4+ nights a week, and he thinks moving in together makes sense. She refuses, citing her Christian community's values against cohabitation before marriage. He's frustrated because she's sleeping over and having sex, yet she doesn't want to move in together. He's using her own standards to argue against her current behavior.\n\nNow, the key points here. She's applying a double standard by using religious morals against moving in together but not against sleeping over and having sex. The author is pointing out that inconsistency. But the question is whether he's in the wrong for wanting to enforce her standards on her.\n\nFrom a moral standpoint, it's her stance that's causing the conflict. He's reacting to her inconsistency. If she's okay with sleeping over but not moving in, he's highlighting the hypocrisy. However, the author's action would be to stop allowing her to sleep over, which is a direct consequence of her own beliefs. But is he overstepping by applying her standards to her in this way?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the author is trying to use her standards against her to force a change. But if he's following her logic, then he's being consistent. However, the problem is that cohabitation and frequent overnight stays might be seen as similar in some contexts. If her community frowns on cohabitation before marriage, then she might view sleeping over multiple nights as equivalent to cohabitation. If that's the case, then the author is right to point out her inconsistency, but is it his place to enforce her standards on her?\n\nAnother angle: The author is using her own values against her to make a point. But is it fair to stop her from staying over because she doesn't want to move in together? If he's doing this to make her see the inconsistency, it's a form of holding her to her own beliefs. However, relationships require mutual respect and compromise. If he's punishing her for her stance, that could be seen as manipulative. However, if he's frustrated and wants to set boundaries based on her own criteria, maybe it's justified.\n\nBut the key is whether he's in the wrong. If he's applying her standards to her, and she's the one who raised the issue, then he's not necessarily wrong. However, the action of cutting off her sleepovers might be harsh. It could be seen as using her own rules against her in a way that's hurtful, even if he's pointing out the inconsistency.\n\nIn summary, the author is pointing out her double standard, which is valid. But enforcing her standards on her could be seen as using emotional manipulation. The user's initial thought is that the author is in the wrong, but considering the situation, maybe the author isn't in the wrong because the double standard is on her side. However, the action of cutting off sleepovers based on her own criteria might be a way to hold her accountable, which could be justified. But it's a complex situation with nuances. I think the answer is A (Yes, he's in the wrong) because his action might be seen as using her values against her in a way that's not respectful, even if he's pointing out the inconsistency. But maybe not. Alternatively, since she's the one with the double standard, he's not in the wrong. Hmm.\n"
