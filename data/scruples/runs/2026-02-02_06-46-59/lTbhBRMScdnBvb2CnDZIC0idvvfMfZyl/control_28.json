We work at the same company and live pretty close to each other. We're not in a rush to get married but with how much she is sleeping over at my place, it makes sense to move to a place together. She sleeps over so much because she says she likes spending time with me. \n\nWe've been talking about it and recently she said she decided she doesn't want to move in together any time soon, until we are married, because she says it is trashy and improper and frowned upon (Christian community). I think that's pretty judgemental, and interesting considering how often she sleeps over and how much sex we've been having before marriage. I'm getting tired of these double standards. WIBTA if I told her she can't sleep over any more because that's trashy and improper according to her own criteria? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the question is in the wrong. The situation involves a couple in a long-term relationship who work together and live near each other. The girlfriend sleeps over 4+ nights a week, but she's decided against moving in together until marriage, citing her Christian community's views that it's \"trashy and improper.\" The author feels this is hypocritical because she's already sleeping over and having sex pre-marriage, and he's considering cutting off her sleepovers based on her own standards.\n\nFirst, I need to assess if the author is in the wrong. The key points here are hypocrisy and communication. The author is pointing out a double standard in his girlfriend's reasoning. She argues against moving in together based on her beliefs, but her current behavior (sleeping over multiple nights a week) might contradict those beliefs. The author's response is to apply her own standards to limit her sleepovers, which could be seen as a retaliatory measure.\n\nIn terms of ethical considerations, it's important to look at mutual respect and understanding in relationships. The author is reacting to her stance, but using her own criteria against her might not be constructive. Relationships require compromise, and the author's decision to enforce a change without possibly addressing the underlying issues (like communication or differing values) could be problematic. \n\nAdditionally, the author is in a position where he's using her moral arguments against her, which might escalate conflicts rather than resolve them. It's possible that the girlfriend's beliefs are genuine, even if the author disagrees. However, the author's approach could be seen as dismissive of her feelings and might not consider her perspective fully. \n\nAnother angle is the power dynamic in the relationship. By threatening to stop the sleepovers, the author is imposing his will based on her own beliefs, which could be seen as manipulative or controlling. Healthy relationships involve discussion and finding middle ground, not using each other's values as weapons. \n\nThe author's reasoning is based on the girlfriend's inconsistency, but the real issue might be about whether their current arrangement aligns with both partners' values. If the girlfriend is uncomfortable with cohabitation but comfortable with frequent sleepovers, the author's approach might not address the root of the problem. Instead, a better solution might be to communicate openly and find a compromise that respects both their beliefs and needs. \n\nIn conclusion, while the author's perspective is valid in pointing out hypocrisy, his proposed action of cutting off sleepovers could be seen as taking her beliefs to an extreme that she might not have intended. This could lead to unnecessary conflict and might not be the best way to handle the situation. The key is whether the author's actions are respectful and considerate of the girlfriend's feelings and beliefs, which might not be the case here.\n"
