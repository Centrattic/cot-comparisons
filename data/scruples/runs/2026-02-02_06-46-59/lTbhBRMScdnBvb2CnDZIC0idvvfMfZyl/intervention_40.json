We work at the same company and live pretty close to each other. We're not in a rush to get married but with how much she is sleeping over at my place, it makes sense to move to a place together. She sleeps over so much because she says she likes spending time with me. \n\nWe've been talking about it and recently she said she decided she doesn't want to move in together any time soon, until we are married, because she says it is trashy and improper and frowned upon (Christian community). I think that's pretty judgemental, and interesting considering how often she sleeps over and how much sex we've been having before marriage. I'm getting tired of these double standards. WIBTA if I told her she can't sleep over any more because that's trashy and improper according to her own criteria? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for wanting to stop their girlfriend from sleeping over because of her own standards. \n\nFirst, the girlfriend sleeps over 4+ nights a week, which is a lot. They work together and live nearby. The author wants to move in together, but she refuses because she thinks it's improper in their Christian community. However, she's okay with sleeping over and having sex before marriage. The author is pointing out what they see as a double standard.\n\nThe question is whether the author is wrong to hold her to the same standards she's applying. The user thinks the author is in the wrong, but I need to evaluate. \n\nOn one hand, the author is challenging the girlfriend's double standards. If she considers cohabitation before marriage as trashy, then sleeping over multiple nights might be a step toward that. The author is using her own criteria against her, which could be seen as fair. \n\nOn the other hand, the author is making a decision based on the girlfriend's beliefs but without considering other factors. Maybe the girlfriend has her reasons for sleeping over but not moving in, like family expectations or personal boundaries. The author might be overreacting by using her standards to justify cutting off sleeping over, which could be seen as hypocritical or manipulative. \n\nBut the key point is the double standard. If the girlfriend is fine with sleeping over and having sex but not moving in, the author is pointing out inconsistency. However, the author is using her own standards to impose a change, which could be seen as valid if they're both aiming for the same standard. \n\nI think the author is not in the wrong because they're addressing the inconsistency. But maybe there's a better way to handle it than just cutting off sleepovers. Still, based on the situation, the answer might be B.\n"
