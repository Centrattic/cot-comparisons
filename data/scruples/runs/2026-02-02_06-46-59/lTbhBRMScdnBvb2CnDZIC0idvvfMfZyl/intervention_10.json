I think that's pretty judgemental, and interesting considering how often she sleeps over and how much sex we've been having before marriage. I'm getting tired of these double standards.

      "text": "Okay, let's try to work through this. The user is asking if the author (the person who posted the question) is in the wrong for considering telling his girlfriend she can't sleep over anymore. The situation is a bit complex.\n\nFirst, the couple has been dating for years and she sleeps over 4+ nights a week. They work together and live near each other. They're not in a hurry to get married. She's against moving in together until marriage because of Christian values, calling it \"trashy and improper.\" But she does sleep over often and they have sex before marriage. The author is frustrated with her double standards and wants to retaliate by cutting off the sleepovers, using her own reasoning against her.\n\nSo, the key points here are about consistency in values. The girlfriend is against cohabitation before marriage but is currently cohabiting (since she's there 4+ nights a week). The author is pointing out that her current behavior contradicts her stated values. If the author uses her reasoning to stop the sleepovers, is that wrong?\n\nI need to consider both sides. On one hand, the author is using her own standards against her, which might be hypocritical. But on the other hand, the girlfriend's behavior is also inconsistent with her beliefs. The author is responding to what he sees as hypocrisy. However, enforcing her standards on her might be a form of using her own reasoning against her, which could be seen as fair, but it could also be manipulative.\n\nAnother angle: communication. The couple has been talking about moving in together. Maybe the author should address the underlying issue of their differing views on cohabitation rather than using a tit-for-tat approach. By threatening to stop sleepovers because of her own standards, the author is imposing his decision based on her values, which might not resolve the deeper issue. This could lead to resentment or conflict.\n\nAlso, the question of whether it's the author's place to enforce her standards on her. The girlfriend is the one who set those standards, but the author is the one deciding to act on them. That could be seen as crossing a line if he's not consistent himself. If the author is okay with cohabitation before marriage but she isn't, he might be using her values to hurt her feelings or force a decision.\n\nIn terms of fairness, the author is pointing out hypocrisy, but using that as a reason to change the relationship dynamics might be punitive rather than constructive. The better approach might be to discuss their differences and see if they can find a compromise, rather than using a tactic that's based on her own reasoning against her.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the author might be in the wrong because he's using her standards to hurt her rather than working through the issues together. It's a form of emotional manipulation rather than addressing the problem healthily. Therefore, the answer would be A (Yes, the author is in the wrong).\n"
