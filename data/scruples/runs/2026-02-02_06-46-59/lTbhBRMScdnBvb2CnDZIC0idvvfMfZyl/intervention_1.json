      "text": "\nOkay, let me try to work through this. So, the question is whether the author is in the wrong if they tell their girlfriend she can't sleep over anymore, based on her own standards. Let's break it down.\n\nFirst, the context: They've been dating a few years, she sleeps over 4+ nights a week. They work together, live close. The author thinks moving in together makes sense, but she says she doesn't want to until marriage because of her Christian community's views, calling it trashy and improper. The author is frustrated because she's sleeping over a lot and having sex before marriage, yet she holds that moving in together is wrong. The author is considering using her own standards to stop her from sleeping over, hence the WIBTA (Would I Be A Twat) question.\n\nThe user thinks the author is in the wrong but is asking for my opinion. The options are A (yes, in the wrong) or B (no).\n\nSo, from a relationship ethics perspective, the key points are consent, mutual respect, and consistency. The girlfriend has set her own boundaries based on her beliefs but is currently engaging in behaviors (sleeping over, which leads to sex) that she's supposedly against. The author is pointing out the inconsistency and wants to apply her standards reciprocally.\n\nBut is the author justified in doing so? Well, the girlfriend is making a choice that conflicts with her stated values. The author is not imposing new rules but is instead challenging the double standard. However, the author is also in a relationship where both are engaging in these activities. The girlfriend might have her reasons for not moving in together despite the current cohabitation (sleeping over). Maybe she's not ready to commit to a more permanent arrangement, even if she's comfortable with the current level of intimacy.\n\nThe author's plan is to use her own criteria against her. But does that address the root issue? The girlfriend might see sleeping over as part of their dating routine, not cohabitation. Or maybe she's conflating different levels of commitment. The author could be right that there's a double standard, but reacting by cutting off sleepovers might be harsh. It might be more constructive to discuss the inconsistencies and see if there's a compromise rather than using her own standards as a weapon.\n\nAlso, in relationships, it's important to communicate and find mutual understanding. The author is frustrated, which is valid, but the approach of applying the same standards might be seen as confrontational rather than collaborative. It's possible that the girlfriend's stance is influenced by her community's norms, which she's trying to adhere to, but her actions show a different reality. The author's response might escalate tension rather than resolve it.\n\nSo, while the author isn't entirely wrong to point out the inconsistency, using the girlfriend's standards to enforce a change might be seen as using a technicality against her, which could be considered unfair. It's about how to handle the discrepancy respectfully. The author might be justified in wanting to discuss boundaries, but cutting off sleepovers without dialogue could be seen as a power move rather than a solution. Hence, the author might be in the wrong because they're not addressing the underlying issues but instead using the girlfriend's own words against her.\n"
