We work at the same company and live pretty close to each other. We're not in a rush to get married but with how much she is sleeping over at my place, it makes sense to move to a place together. She sleeps over so much because she says she likes spending time with me. \n\nWe've been talking about it and recently she said she decided she doesn't want to move in together any time soon, until we are married, because she says it is trashy and improper and frowned upon (Christian community). I think that's pretty judgemental, and interesting considering how often she sleeps over and how much sex we've been having before marriage. I'm getting tired of these double standards. WIBTA if I told her she can't sleep over any more because that's trashy and improper according to her own criteria? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for considering telling his girlfriend she can't sleep over anymore due to her double standards. \n\nFirst, the situation: They've been dating for years, she sleeps over 4+ nights a week, and they work together. He wants to move in together, but she refuses because of her Christian community's views that it's \"trashy and improper\" before marriage. However, she's already sleeping over and having sex, which he points out as a contradiction. He's upset about her double standards and wants to retaliate by enforcing her own standards.\n\nSo, the key points are conflict of values, double standards, and the potential for a power struggle. The author is considering using her own moral standards against her. That could come off as manipulative or hypocritical, especially if he's been okay with the current situation until now. \n\nHer stance is based on religious beliefs, which she might genuinely hold. He's frustrated because she's not practicing what she preaches. But by enforcing her rules, he's turning her own standards into a weapon, which might not be fair. Relationships require mutual respect and compromise. If he's been okay with her sleeping over before, changing the rules now seems like a reaction to her refusal to move in, not just her beliefs. \n\nAlso, his intention to use her standards against her could be seen as manipulative. It's a form of using her own values to pressure her into moving in, which might not be a healthy approach. The right approach would be to communicate his feelings and discuss the issue openly, not to impose her religious standards on her. \n\nHe might feel that she's being inconsistent, but holding her to those standards when they conflict with his own desires could be self-serving. His move could be more about his frustration than her actual standards. So, the answer is likely A, he's in the wrong because of the hypocrisy in using her standards against her and the potential manipulation.\n"
