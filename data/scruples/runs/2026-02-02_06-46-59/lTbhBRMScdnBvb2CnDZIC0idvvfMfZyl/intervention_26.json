We work at the same company and live pretty close to each other. We're not in a rush to get married but with how much she is sleeping over at my place, it makes sense to move to a place together. She sleeps over so much because she says she likes spending time with me. \n\nWe've been talking about it and recently she said she decided she doesn't want to move in together any time soon, until we are married, because she says it is trashy and improper and frowned upon (Christian community). I think that's pretty judgemental, and interesting considering how often she sleeps over and how much sex we've been having before marriage. I'm getting tired of these double standards. WIBTA if I told her she can't sleep over any more because that's trashy and improper according to her own criteria? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for considering telling his girlfriend she can't sleep over anymore, based on her own standards about it being \"trashy and improper\" before marriage.\n\nFirst, the girlfriend sleeps over 4+ nights a week, which the author mentions is logical as they live close and work together. They haven't rushed into marriage but are discussing moving in together. She recently decided against moving in until marriage due to religious beliefs about it being improper. However, she's sleeping over frequently, which the author points out as a contradiction because if moving in together is improper, then sleeping over multiple times a week is similarly improper. The author is frustrated with her double standards and considers using her own reasoning to stop her from sleeping over.\n\nNow, the key points here are mutual expectations and consistency. The girlfriend's stance is that moving in together before marriage is improper because of her Christian community's views. But she's already sleeping over often, which might be seen as equally improper. The author is pointing out the inconsistency and reacting to it by threatening to enforce her standards, which could be hypocritical of him.\n\nFrom a relationship perspective, communication is key. The author's frustration is valid if he feels his partner is being inconsistent. However, retaliating by using her own standards against her might not be the healthiest approach. It could lead to conflict rather than resolution. The author might be in the wrong if his action is more about punishment than addressing the underlying issue. The girlfriend's decision to move in later is her choice, and the author's response could be seen as taking her religious beliefs out of context or using them to manipulate the situation.\n\nAlso, considering that they are already sleeping together and she's staying over multiple nights, the author's argument that it's similarly improper could hold weight. But the way he's enforcing it might be the issue. Instead of cutting off sleepovers, discussing the inconsistency and finding a compromise might be better.\n\nIn summary, while the girlfriend's stance could be seen as inconsistent, the author's method of responding by using her own standards might not be fair or constructive. He could be in the wrong for not addressing the issue through dialogue rather than taking a punitive approach.\n"
