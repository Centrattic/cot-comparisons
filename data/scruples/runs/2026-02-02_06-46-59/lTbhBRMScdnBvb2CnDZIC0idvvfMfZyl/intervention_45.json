She sleeps over so much because she says she likes spending time with me. \n\nWe've been talking about it and recently she said she decided she doesn't want to move in together any time soon, until we are married, because she says it is trashy and improper and frowned upon (Christian community). I think that's pretty judgemental, and interesting considering how often she sleeps over and how much sex we've been having before marriage. I'm getting tired of these double standards.

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the WIBTA (Would I Be Terrible for...) post is in the wrong. The situation is about a girlfriend who sleeps over multiple nights a week, but she doesn't want to move in together until marriage because of her Christian values. The author is considering telling her she can't sleep over anymore based on her own standards.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The girlfriend is sleeping over 4+ nights a week, which implies they're having sex outside of marriage. The girl says it's improper to move in together before marriage, but she's okay with sleeping over. The author is frustrated by the double standard and wants to retaliate by cutting off sleepovers.\n\nSo the main issue here is hypocrisy. The author is pointing out that if the girlfriend's standards are against cohabitation before marriage, then sleeping over multiple nights a week and having sex is also against those standards. By that logic, the author is using her own criteria against her. But is that the right approach?\n\nThe author is in a relationship where they're both choosing to engage in behavior that the girlfriend now claims is improper. The author is upset because the girlfriend is applying her standards selectively. The question is whether the author is wrong for enforcing her standards in this way.\n\nFrom a moral standpoint, the author is pointing out inconsistency. However, relationships are based on mutual respect and communication. The author could be seen as being hypocritical too if they're okay with having sex before marriage but not with cohabitation. But the author is not the one applying the standards here; the girlfriend is. The author is just using her reasoning to justify ending the sleepovers.\n\nBut is that fair? The girlfriend may not have thought through the implications of her standards. If she's against premarital cohabitation but is okay with premarital sex, that's a contradiction. The author is highlighting this and is reacting to it. However, cutting off sleepovers entirely might be a harsh response, especially if the girlfriend feels that sleeping over is part of their relationship. \n\nAlternatively, the author could be in the right because they're challenging the girlfriend's double standards. But relationships require compromise. If the author is now enforcing the girlfriend's standards, it's a valid point, but communication is key. The author might be in a position where they can't reconcile their partner's values with their own actions. \n\nIn terms of being in the wrong, the author is using the girlfriend's own logic against her. The girlfriend's stance is controversial, but the author's action is a direct response to it. However, the author could be seen as being inconsiderate by suddenly cutting off sleepovers without addressing the underlying issues. The correct approach might be to have a conversation about the inconsistency rather than an ultimatum. \n\nSo, the author's action is a form of holding the girlfriend accountable, but it's done in a way that might not be constructive. Therefore, the author is in the wrong for not addressing the issue through communication and instead using the girlfriend's standards to dictate the terms unilaterally. The answer would be A.\n"
