We work at the same company and live pretty close to each other. We're not in a rush to get married but with how much she is sleeping over at my place, it makes sense to move to a place together. She sleeps over so much because she says she likes spending time with me. \n\nWe've been talking about it and recently she said she decided she doesn't want to move in together any time soon, until we are married, because she says it is trashy and improper and frowned upon (Christian community). I think that's pretty judgemental, and interesting considering how often she sleeps over and how much sex we've been having before marriage. I'm getting tired of these double standards. WIBTA if I told her she can't sleep over any more because that's trashy and improper according to her own criteria? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for considering telling his girlfriend she can't sleep over anymore. The situation involves their living arrangements and differing views on cohabitation before marriage, especially in a Christian community.\n\nFirst, the author is frustrated because his girlfriend sleeps over four or more nights a week but refuses to move in together before marriage, calling it improper. The author sees this as a double standard since they're already having sex and she's staying over frequently. He's considering using her own standards to stop her from sleeping over, which seems like a form of tit-for-tat.\n\nI need to analyze the dynamics here. The girlfriend's position is based on her religious beliefs, which she holds as important. The author feels her stance is judgmental and inconsistent because she's already engaging in activities that could be considered improper under the same standards. His response of enforcing her rules might be seen as hypocritical or retaliatory.\n\nThe key points are mutual expectations and respect. The author is using her reasoning against her, which could be seen as manipulative. Even if he's upset about the double standard, cutting her off entirely by not allowing sleepovers might escalate the conflict and not address the underlying issues. Communication is usually the better approach here. Instead of using her own standards to shut down the relationship, he should express his feelings and seek a compromise or understanding.\n\nAlso, considering the girlfriend's reasons, respecting her beliefs is important unless they cause harm. However, the author is not just respecting her beliefs but trying to enforce them against her actions, which is not fair. The double standard is real, but responding with punishment based on her criteria might not be the healthiest or most respectful approach.\n\nIn relationships, it's crucial to address misunderstandings and find middle ground. The author's threat to cut off sleepovers could be seen as holding the relationship hostage due to her stance. This might be an overreaction and not a mature way to handle the situation. The right approach would be to discuss the differences calmly, perhaps seeking couples counseling if needed, rather than using her beliefs against her.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the author is in the wrong because he's retaliating with her own standards, not addressing the issue constructively, and potentially using manipulation. The answer should be A (Yes, the author is in the wrong).\n"
