We work at the same company and live pretty close to each other. We're not in a rush to get married but with how much she is sleeping over at my place, it makes sense to move to a place together. She sleeps over so much because she says she likes spending time with me. \n\nWe've been talking about it and recently she said she decided she doesn't want to move in together any time soon, until we are married, because she says it is trashy and improper and frowned upon (Christian community). I think that's pretty judgemental, and interesting considering how often she sleeps over and how much sex we've been having before marriage. I'm getting tired of these double standards. WIBTA if I told her she can't sleep over any more because that's trashy and improper according to her own criteria? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the question is in the wrong. The situation is about a girlfriend who sleeps over multiple nights a week, and the author wants to stop allowing her to sleep over because she's against moving in together before marriage. The author finds her stance judgmental, given her current behavior.\n\nFirst, I need to determine if the author is in the wrong by choosing between A or B. The user thinks the author is in the wrong, but I need to evaluate the situation.\n\nThe key points: The girlfriend sleeps over frequently, the author feels it's logical to move in together, but she refuses due to religious reasons (Christian community) saying it's \"trashy\" and improper. The author wants to stop her from sleeping over, using her own standards against her.\n\nThe author's reasoning is that she's being hypocritical by sleeping over a lot and having sex before marriage but still opposing cohabitation. The author is frustrated by the double standards.\n\nIs the author justified in using her own standards against her? Well, the girlfriend's rules don't align with her actions. However, the author is taking a stance that might be harsh. The girlfriend might feel betrayed if the author suddenly enforces her standards. The author could be using her own beliefs against her, which might not be fair. Also, the author could be overreacting by cutting off sleepovers instead of discussing boundaries.\n\nBut then, the author is also in a position where they're both working together and living close. Cohabitation is a big step, and the girlfriend is setting a boundary. The author's response is to limit the current arrangement based on her standards. However, the author might be misinterpreting her standards or overreacting. Maybe the author should have had a conversation about compromise instead of using her beliefs against her.\n\nIn terms of right and wrong, the author is in a tough spot. But using the girlfriend's own standards to stop her from sleeping over could be seen as manipulative or using hypocrisy as a weapon. That's not a healthy approach. Instead of enforcing her rules, the author should communicate their feelings and find a mutual solution. So, the author is in the wrong (A) because they're using her beliefs against her in a way that's not constructive. The right approach would be to discuss the issue and find a middle ground rather than making a unilateral decision.\n"
