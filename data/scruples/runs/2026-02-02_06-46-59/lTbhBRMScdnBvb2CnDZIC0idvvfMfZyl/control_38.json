We work at the same company and live pretty close to each other. We're not in a rush to get married but with how much she is sleeping over at my place, it makes sense to move to a place together. She sleeps over so much because she says she likes spending time with me. \n\nWe've been talking about it and recently she said she decided she doesn't want to move in together any time soon, until we are married, because she says it is trashy and improper and frowned upon (Christian community). I think that's pretty judgemental, and interesting considering how often she sleeps over and how much sex we've been having before marriage. I'm getting tired of these double standards. WIBTA if I told her she can't sleep over any more because that's trashy and improper according to her own criteria? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about a girlfriend who sleeps over multiple nights a week, and they're considering moving in together. She doesn't want to move in yet because of her Christian community's views, but they've been having sex. The author is considering cutting off the sleepovers based on her own standards.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The girlfriend is making a moral judgment about cohabitation before marriage, calling it \"trashy and improper.\" However, the author points out the hypocrisy because she's already sleeping over frequently and they're having sex. The author is challenging her double standards by applying her own criteria to stop the sleepovers.\n\nIs the author in the wrong for doing that? Well, if someone sets a rule (like not moving in before marriage) but then another person is already engaging in other premarital activities (like frequent overnight stays and sex), pointing out the inconsistency isn't necessarily wrong. However, there's a nuance here. The girlfriend's stance is based on her beliefs, even if they seem inconsistent. The author's response could be seen as using her own standards against her, which might be a valid point for accountability but could also come off as confrontational or unfair.\n\nBut is the author's action (telling her not to sleep over) wrong? If the author is using her own criteria to justify cutting off the sleepovers, he's holding her to her stated beliefs. However, maybe the key issue is whether the author is respecting her autonomy. Even if her standards are inconsistent, she might still have the right to choose to sleep over despite her beliefs, especially if they're in a committed relationship. The author is enforcing a standard that might not be mutually agreed upon, potentially overstepping.\n\nAlternatively, the author could be pointing out hypocrisy, which is a fair critique, but using that as a reason to end the sleepovers might be a form of punishment or manipulation. It's a bit of a gray area. The author is not in the wrong for bringing up the inconsistency, but whether enforcing the sleepover ban is right depends on mutual respect. Since the girlfriend's reasons are about her community's views, the author might be reacting to perceived hypocrisy, but the action of cutting off sleepovers could be seen as dismissive of her feelings or a lack of communication. So, considering all that, the answer might be A (the author is in the wrong) because he's enforcing a rule based on her own standards, which she might not agree to now, leading to an unfair imposition. But maybe B, because he's pointing out her inconsistency. Hmm. I think the key is whether the author is applying her standards to their relationship, which they may not have agreed on. So the author might be in the wrong for not respecting her autonomy despite the inconsistency.\n"
