She sleeps over so much because she says she likes spending time with me. \n\nWe've been talking about it and recently she said she decided she doesn't want to move in together any time soon, until we are married, because she says it is trashy and improper and frowned upon (Christian community). I think that's pretty judgemental, and interesting considering how often she sleeps over and how much sex we've been having before marriage. I'm getting tired of these double standards.

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The situation is about a couple in a long-term relationship where the girlfriend sleeps over at the boyfriend's place multiple times a week. They both work at the same company and live close. The boyfriend wants to move in together, but the girlfriend refuses because she's from a Christian community that frowns upon cohabitation before marriage. She argues that moving in is \"trashy and improper,\" even though she's already sleeping over frequently. The boyfriend is frustrated by what he sees as double standards and is considering telling her she can't sleep over anymore, using her own logic.\n\nThe user asks if the author (the boyfriend) is in the wrong. The options are A (Yes) or B (No). \n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical angle. The girlfriend has her own beliefs about cohabitation, but she's already engaging in behavior that's similarly frowned upon in her community (sleeping over, having sex before marriage). The boyfriend is pointing out the inconsistency. However, taking her stance to its logical conclusion by cutting off sleepovers might be seen as hypocritical, but is he in the wrong for doing so?\n\nFrom a moral perspective, the boyfriend is using her own reasoning against her. If she believes that cohabitation is wrong, then by that logic, any premarital intimacy (including sleepovers and sex) should also be avoided. But since she's already doing those things, the boyfriend is highlighting her inconsistency. However, is it fair for him to impose his interpretation of her beliefs on her? He's not forcing her to move in; he's stopping her from sleeping over. But maybe the key issue is whether the boyfriend's action (cutting off sleepovers) is a form of manipulation or coercion based on her beliefs, rather than respecting mutual boundaries.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the boyfriend is justified in pointing out the hypocrisy. But if he's using her own standards to dictate the terms of their relationship, that could be problematic. Relationships require mutual respect and compromise. If she's not ready to move in together, maybe the solution is to find a middle ground, like both adjusting their expectations rather than using her standards to limit her current behavior.\n\nAnother angle: the boyfriend is getting tired of the double standards. By his logic, if she thinks cohabitation is wrong, then the sleepovers and sex should also be curtailed. But maybe she's prioritizing closeness in their relationship over her religious community's standards. The boyfriend's threat to cut off sleepovers is applying her standard to her, which might be a way of enforcing his own interpretation of her beliefs rather than respecting her agency in the matter.\n\nSo, is he in the wrong? If he's using her beliefs to control the relationship dynamics unilaterally, that could be wrong. However, if he's simply pointing out inconsistencies and setting boundaries based on her own criteria, maybe not. The line here is tricky. But since he's not just discussing but actually planning to enforce a change in their current arrangement based on her beliefs, that could be seen as using her standards against her, which might be unfair. Therefore, the answer might lean towards A (Yes, he's in the wrong) because he's applying her beliefs in a way that serves his own frustration without mutual agreement. But some might argue B (No) because he's consistent with her own standards. However, the key is whether he's respecting her autonomy. If she's already made a choice to sleep over despite her beliefs, imposing her standards on her might be violating her autonomy. Hence, A.\n"
