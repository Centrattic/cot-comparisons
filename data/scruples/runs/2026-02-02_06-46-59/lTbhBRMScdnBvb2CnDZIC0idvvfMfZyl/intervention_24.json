She sleeps over so much because she says she likes spending time with me. \n\nWe've been talking about it and recently she said she decided she doesn't want to move in together any time soon, until we are married, because she says it is trashy and improper and frowned upon (Christian community). I think that's pretty judgemental, and interesting considering how often she sleeps over and how much sex we've been having before marriage. I'm getting tired of these double standards. WIBTA if I told her she can't sleep over any more because that's trashy and improper according to her own criteria? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let me try to figure this out. So the situation is about a couple who have been dating for a few years. The girlfriend is staying over at the guy's place 4+ nights a week. They work together and live close. The guy thinks it makes sense to move in together, but the girlfriend says she doesn't want to cohabitate until marriage because it's \"trashy and improper,\" especially in their Christian community. The guy is upset about her double standards since they're already sleeping together and she's staying over so much. He's considering telling her she can't sleep over anymore based on her own standards.\n\nThe question is whether the author (the guy) is in the wrong if he does that. The user thinks he is, but wants to know if that's correct.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical and relational aspects here. The guy is using her own standards against her. She's against cohabitation but is already engaging in it. So if he says, \"Well, according to your beliefs, this is improper, so you can't do it anymore,\" is that fair?\n\nFrom a moral standpoint, the guy is pointing out inconsistency. If she holds a certain standard, then he's applying that standard. However, the issue is whether he has the right to enforce her standards on her. People can't force others to follow their beliefs unless there's a mutual agreement. In this case, she's the one who set the standard, but she's already not following it. The guy is using her own rules against her, which might be a form of hypocrisy, but is it wrong for him to do so?\n\nAnother angle: Relationships require compromise. Both partners need to respect each other's values. If she's okay with her current behavior but is against cohabitation, he might feel that's hypocritical. But if he enforces his interpretation of her values on her, is that respecting her autonomy? Or is he holding her accountable for her own stated beliefs?\n\nAlso, the guy might be frustrated and using this as a way to push for moving in together, which he wants. But if he's using her own standards to stop her from sleeping over, does that create a conflict? It might be a manipulation tactic. For example, if she says pre-marital cohabitation is wrong, but he's saying, \"Then you can't do this,\" which could be a way to control the relationship dynamics.\n\nOn the other hand, if he's pointing out her inconsistency, maybe he's being fair. But the problem is that relationships are about mutual respect. If he's going to impose her standards on her without considering her reasons, that's not respecting her. She might have other factors, like not wanting to move in together yet due to personal, financial, or other reasons beyond the religious aspect.\n\nMoreover, the guy is in a position where he's using her standards to justify his own action (stopping her from sleeping over). This could be seen as hypocritical because he's condoning their current behavior (sleeping together and cohabitation) but now wants to stop it based on her standards. That might not be fair because if he's okay with it, he shouldn't suddenly enforce her standards unless he's also willing to adjust his behavior.\n\nAnother point is that the girlfriend's stance on cohabitation is part of her personal beliefs, but she might not be aware of the inconsistency. The guy's action of enforcing her standards could be a way to make her reevaluate her own values. However, it's not the guy's place to police her beliefs unless they are mutual. If they have different values, it's up to each person to follow their own, unless they agree to compromise.\n\nIn summary, while the guy is pointing out a contradiction, using her standards against her might be unethical because it could be a form of control. The right approach would be to discuss the issue openly, understand her reasons, and find a compromise that works for both, rather than enforcing her standards unilaterally. Therefore, the guy might be in the wrong because he's not respecting her autonomy and using her own beliefs to manipulate the situation.\n"
