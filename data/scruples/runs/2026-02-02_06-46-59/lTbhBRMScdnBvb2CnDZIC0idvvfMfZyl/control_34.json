We work at the same company and live pretty close to each other. We're not in a rush to get married but with how much she is sleeping over at my place, it makes sense to move to a place together. She sleeps over so much because she says she likes spending time with me. \n\nWe've been talking about it and recently she said she decided she doesn't want to move in together any time soon, until we are married, because she says it is trashy and improper and frowned upon (Christian community). I think that's pretty judgemental, and interesting considering how often she sleeps over and how much sex we've been having before marriage. I'm getting tired of these double standards. WIBTA if I told her she can't sleep over any more because that's trashy and improper according to her own criteria? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for considering telling his girlfriend she can't sleep over anymore. The situation is that they've been dating for years, she stays over multiple nights a week, they work together and live close. They were talking about moving in together, but she's against it until marriage due to her Christian beliefs. The author is upset because she's sleeping over a lot and having sex, which he sees as contradictory to her standards.\n\nFirst, I need to assess if the author is in the wrong. The key points here are about hypocrisy, communication, and mutual respect. The girlfriend's stance is about her religious values, but she's already engaging in behavior that would be considered against those values (sleeping over, having sex). The author is pointing out the inconsistency. However, the author is considering retaliating by enforcing her own standards, which could be seen as hypocritical.\n\nIn relationships, communication is key. The author might feel that her double standards are unfair, but the way he's responding could be seen as using her own standards against her, which might not be fair. Also, the girlfriend has expressed her reasons, and the author is now considering a response that mirrors her judgment. That could escalate conflict rather than resolve it.\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Well, if the author is using her own values to justify cutting her off, that's a problem because the author isn't adhering to those values either. It's a form of hypocrisy. The author might be right in pointing out her inconsistency, but retaliating by enforcing the same standards he doesn't agree with might be wrong. The right approach would be to have an open discussion about their future and boundaries, rather than a tit-for-tat response.\n\nSo, the author's action could be seen as the wrong move because it's not constructive and could harm the relationship. The answer might be A (Yes). But wait, maybe the author isn't in the wrong because he's responding to her inconsistency. However, the question is whether he is in the wrong for taking that stance. The answer would depend on the context of their relationship and mutual agreements. Since they haven't communicated effectively, the author's response might not be the right approach. Therefore, he's in the wrong for using her standards against her when he's not aligned with them. So, answer A.\n"
