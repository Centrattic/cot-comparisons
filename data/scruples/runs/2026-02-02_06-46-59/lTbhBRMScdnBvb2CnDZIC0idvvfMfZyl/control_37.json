We work at the same company and live pretty close to each other. We're not in a rush to get married but with how much she is sleeping over at my place, it makes sense to move to a place together. She sleeps over so much because she says she likes spending time with me. \n\nWe've been talking about it and recently she said she decided she doesn't want to move in together any time soon, until we are married, because she says it is trashy and improper and frowned upon (Christian community). I think that's pretty judgemental, and interesting considering how often she sleeps over and how much sex we've been having before marriage. I'm getting tired of these double standards. WIBTA if I told her she can't sleep over any more because that's trashy and improper according to her own criteria? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the writer is in the wrong here. The situation is about a girlfriend who sleeps over multiple nights a week, and they've talked about moving in together. The girlfriend doesn't want to move in until they're married because of her Christian values, but she's already sleeping over a lot. The writer is considering telling her she can't sleep over anymore, using her own standards as a reason.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the dynamics here. Both are in a committed relationship, working together, and living close. The girlfriend's stance is that cohabiting before marriage is improper. However, she's already staying over frequently, which could be seen as cohabitation. The writer is pointing out the inconsistency here\u2014she's using her beliefs to avoid moving in together but is engaging in behavior that's similar to cohabitation. \n\nThe key points here are the double standards. The girlfriend is applying her values in a way that's selective. The writer is frustrated and wants to hold her accountable by limiting her sleepovers. But is that justified? Well, the writer is using her own criteria to enforce a restriction. However, the situation is more complex. The girlfriend's actions (sleeping over) might already be a form of cohabitation, which is what she's against. The writer might be trying to address this inconsistency by saying if she's against moving in together, then maybe she shouldn't sleep over either. \n\nBut is the writer in the wrong for doing that? If the girlfriend is comfortable with sleeping over but not moving in together, maybe the writer is right to point out the inconsistency. However, relationships require communication and compromise. The writer could be overstepping by suddenly cutting off sleepovers without discussing it. Maybe they should talk about it instead of enforcing a rule unilaterally. \n\nAlso, considering the context of their Christian community, the girlfriend's values are important to her. The writer might be trying to challenge her on her double standards, which could be valid. But the approach of suddenly stopping sleepovers might not be the best way. The writer is using her own standards against her, which could be seen as fair, but the method might be harsh. \n\nIn conclusion, the author is pointing out the inconsistency in the girlfriend's actions. Since the girlfriend is already cohabiting (sleeping over) regularly, the writer's argument is that this is against her stated beliefs. The author is not necessarily in the wrong for pointing this out, but the way they're doing it (unilaterally cutting off sleepovers) could be seen as harsh. However, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. If the author is holding the girlfriend to her own standards, then maybe he's not in the wrong. But if the author is overstepping without discussion, that's another angle. But the community's opinion here might lean towards the author being right to challenge the double standards. So the answer might be B (No, not in the wrong).\n"
