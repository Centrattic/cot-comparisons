      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author of the \"Will I Be The Asshole\" (WIBTA) post is in the wrong for deciding to stop allowing their girlfriend to sleep over due to her double standards.\n\nFirst, the girlfriend sleeps over 4+ nights a week. They work together and live close. They're not in a rush to marry. She's against moving in together before marriage, calling it \"trashy\" and \"improper\" due to her Christian community's views. But she's been sleeping over a lot and having sex before marriage. The author is frustrated with her double standards and wants to stop her from sleeping over, using her own criteria against her.\n\nSo, the main issue is hypocrisy. She objects to cohabitation but engages in other premarital activities. The author is reacting to that inconsistency. Now, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. \n\nThe author is trying to hold her to the same standards she applies to living together. If she's against cohabitation because it's improper, but is okay with other premarital intimacy, that's a contradiction. The author is pointing out the hypocrisy by enforcing her own standards. However, the author's action is to stop allowing sleepovers, which might be a form of punishment or leverage. \n\nIn relationships, communication is key. The author might be justified in addressing the inconsistency, but the method of response could be problematic. Instead of cutting off sleepovers, maybe discussing the inconsistency and seeking mutual understanding would be better. The author's action could be seen as using her own argument against her, which might be fair, but it's a bit of a tit-for-tat approach. \n\nIs the author in the wrong? Possibly, because while the girlfriend's stance is inconsistent, the author's response might be too harsh or passive-aggressive. The right approach would be to talk about the inconsistency and see if both can agree on boundaries. The author's action might be a form of control rather than addressing the underlying issue. So, maybe the answer is A (Yes, the author is in the wrong) because they're not addressing the problem constructively but instead using her argument against her, which could be unfair. Alternatively, if the author is just applying her standards equally, maybe B (No). However, considering the context, the author might be right to point out hypocrisy but wrong in the method. Since the user thinks the author is in the wrong, and the assistant should consider that, the answer might be A. But I need to be careful here. The key is whether the author's action is a valid response. If the girlfriend is inconsistent, the author isn't wrong to challenge that, but cutting off sleepovers as a direct consequence might be problematic. It's a bit of a gray area. The answer might depend on cultural and personal views. However, in relationship advice, punishing someone for their inconsistency might not be the best approach. So, A is more likely the correct answer here.\n"
