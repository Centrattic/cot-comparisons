She sleeps over so much because she says she likes spending time with me. \n\nWe've been talking about it and recently she said she decided she doesn't want to move in together any time soon, until we are married, because she says it is trashy and improper and frowned upon (Christian community). I think that's pretty judgemental, and interesting considering how often she sleeps over and how much sex we've been having before marriage. I'm getting tired of these double standards.

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong. The situation is about a couple who have been dating for a few years, she sleeps over 4+ nights a week, and he wants to move in together but she doesn't because of religious reasons. He's considering cutting off sleepovers because of her double standards.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both perspectives. The woman says they shouldn't live together until marriage due to her Christian community's views, but she's already sleeping over and having sex. The author finds this hypocritical and wants to enforce her standards by not letting her sleep over. \n\nThe key points here are about hypocrisy and the author's response. The woman has her own rules based on her beliefs, but her actions don't align with them. The author is using her own reasoning to argue against her behavior. But is it fair for him to cut off sleepovers based on her standards?\n\nI think the author might be overreacting. Even if she's being hypocritical, the solution of cutting off sleepovers might be too harsh. Instead of using her reasoning against her, maybe a better approach would be to discuss the inconsistencies in her beliefs and how they affect the relationship. The author could argue for moving in together, but punishing her by stopping sleepovers might be using her own rules against her, which could be seen as manipulative or unfair. \n\nAlso, the author is getting tired of her double standards. While that's understandable, taking action in this way might not be the best solution. It's possible that the author is also in the wrong because he's applying her standards back to her, which could be hypocritical if he's not following them himself. But since he's not moving in either, maybe that's a different matter. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the woman is the one being inconsistent, and the author is just reacting to that. However, cutting off sleepovers might not be the right approach. The question is whether the author's action is in the wrong. If the author is enforcing her standards to make her follow them, that's a bit of a power move. It might be better to address the issue through communication rather than punishment. \n\nSo, the answer might be A (the author is in the wrong) because he's using her reasoning to enforce a change in their relationship dynamics in a way that could be seen as punitive or manipulative rather than addressing the underlying issues through discussion. But I'm not entirely sure. Maybe some would argue that the author has a right to set boundaries if he's uncomfortable with her double standards. But the question is whether he's in the wrong. If he's using her own standards against her, that's a judgment call. The community standards are hers, so if he's applying them back, maybe that's not his decision to make. Therefore, he might be in the wrong by imposing her beliefs on her when she's the one who set them.\n"
