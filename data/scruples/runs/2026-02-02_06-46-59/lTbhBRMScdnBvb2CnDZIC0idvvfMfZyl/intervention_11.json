We work at the same company and live pretty close to each other. We're not in a rush to get married but with how much she is sleeping over at my place, it makes sense to move to a place together. She sleeps over so much because she says she likes spending time with me. \n\nWe've been talking about it and recently she said she decided she doesn't want to move in together any time soon, until we are married, because she says it is trashy and improper and frowned upon (Christian community). I think that's pretty judgemental, and interesting considering how often she sleeps over and how much sex we've been having before marriage. I'm getting tired of these double standards. WIBTA if I told her she can't sleep over any more because that's trashy and improper according to her own criteria? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the person (the author) is in the wrong for telling his girlfriend she can't sleep over anymore. The situation is that they've been dating for a few years, she sleeps over 4+ nights a week, they work together and live close. They were discussing moving in together but she changed her mind, citing her Christian community's views that it's improper to live together before marriage. The author finds this judgmental, especially since she's been sleeping over a lot. He's considering using her own standards to cut off the sleepovers.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The girlfriend has set a boundary about not moving in together until marriage, possibly due to religious beliefs. The author is pointing out the inconsistency because they're already spending a lot of time together, including sleeping over. The question is whether the author is justified in using her reasoning to enforce his own boundary.\n\nThe key points are mutual respect and communication. The girlfriend has her reasons, even if the author disagrees. The author is responding with a \"you said X, so I'll do Y\" approach. That might be seen as holding her to a standard she applied to others but not to herself. However, the author feels she's being judgmental about their current behavior, so he's retaliating by enforcing her own rules.\n\nBut is that fair? Holding someone to their own stated values can sometimes be a way to highlight inconsistencies, but it could also be a form of manipulation or a tit-for-tat. The author is using her reasoning to justify his action, which might be a way to address the double standard he perceives. However, the right approach would be to communicate his feelings and boundaries without necessarily using her own criteria against her. Instead of cutting off sleepovers abruptly, maybe discussing the impact on him and finding a compromise would be better.\n\nBut the question is about whether he's in the wrong. If he's enforcing her rules to address her inconsistency, does that make him wrong? Possibly, because it's not respecting her autonomy. Even if there's a double standard, retaliating might not be the right approach. The wrong in this scenario would be if he's being hypocritical or not addressing the issue constructively. If he's using her own words to hurt her or manipulate, that's problematic. Alternatively, if he's trying to make her aware of the inconsistency, it's a different angle.\n\nI think the author is in the wrong because he's using her values against her in a way that could be seen as manipulative or punitive. The better approach would be to express his feelings and work on a mutual solution rather than enforcing a sudden boundary based on her stated beliefs. So, answer A.\n"
