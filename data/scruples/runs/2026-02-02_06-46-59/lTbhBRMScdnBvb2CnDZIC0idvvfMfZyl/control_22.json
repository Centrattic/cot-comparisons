We work at the same company and live pretty close to each other. We're not in a rush to get married but with how much she is sleeping over at my place, it makes sense to move to a place together. She sleeps over so much because she says she likes spending time with me. \n\nWe've been talking about it and recently she said she decided she doesn't want to move in together any time soon, until we are married, because she says it is trashy and improper and frowned upon (Christian community). I think that's pretty judgemental, and interesting considering how often she sleeps over and how much sex we've been having before marriage. I'm getting tired of these double standards. WIBTA if I told her she can't sleep over any more because that's trashy and improper according to her own criteria? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person (the author) is in the wrong. The situation is about a girlfriend who's been sleeping over multiple nights a week, and now she doesn't want to move in together until they're married because of her Christian beliefs. The author is frustrated because she's been sleeping over a lot anyway, implying they've been having sex, and now she's calling that \"trashy.\" The author is considering telling her she can't sleep over anymore using her own standards.\n\nSo, first, I need to analyze the moral and ethical aspects here. The key points are the girlfriend's religious beliefs and the author's response. The girlfriend doesn't want to move in together until marriage, which she sees as proper. However, she's been sleeping over multiple nights, which in many Christian teachings, is considered inappropriate before marriage. The author is pointing out a double standard here. \n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong for using her own standards to cut off sleepovers. The author's action is based on her partner's stated beliefs. If the author does this, he's applying her judgment to their relationship. But is that fair? Well, the girlfriend is the one who has expressed these beliefs, so if the author is following through on her own standards, maybe it's not wrong. However, relationships require communication and mutual respect. The author might be reacting to a double standard by enforcing her own rules, but it's important to consider the context.\n\nThe girlfriend might have changed her stance over time, or maybe she's aware that sleeping over isn't in line with her beliefs but does it anyway. The author is pointing out the inconsistency. If the author decides to stop sleepovers, he's being consistent in applying her values. But is that the right approach? It might escalate the conflict. Alternatively, the author could be right to address the hypocrisy and set boundaries based on her partner's own moral framework.\n\nAnother angle: the author is not in the wrong because he's holding his partner accountable for her stated beliefs. If the girlfriend doesn't want to live together until marriage, but is already sleeping over frequently, the author is pointing out the inconsistency. By following her logic, he's not being hypocritical but highlighting the double standard. So, maybe the answer is B (No), the author is not in the wrong because he's responding to her own standards. However, it's also possible that the author is using her beliefs against her in a way that's not constructive. But given the information, the author's action is based on her own stated values, so he's not wrong.\n"
