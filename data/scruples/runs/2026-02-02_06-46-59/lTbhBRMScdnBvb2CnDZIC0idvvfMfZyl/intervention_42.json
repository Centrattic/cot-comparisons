We work at the same company and live pretty close to each other. We're not in a rush to get married but with how much she is sleeping over at my place, it makes sense to move to a place together. She sleeps over so much because she says she likes spending time with me. \n\nWe've been talking about it and recently she said she decided she doesn't want to move in together any time soon, until we are married, because she says it is trashy and improper and frowned upon (Christian community). I think that's pretty judgemental, and interesting considering how often she sleeps over and how much sex we've been having before marriage. I'm getting tired of these double standards. WIBTA if I told her she can't sleep over any more because that's trashy and improper according to her own criteria? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is about a couple who've been dating for a few years. The girlfriend sleeps over at his place multiple nights a week, and they work together and live close. The author wants to move in together, but she says no until they're married because of her Christian beliefs, calling it \"trashy and improper.\" The author is frustrated with her double standards and is considering cutting off the sleepovers using her own criteria.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze both sides. The girlfriend's stance is based on her religious beliefs, which she uses to justify not moving in together before marriage. However, she continues to sleep over and have sex, which might conflict with those same beliefs. The author feels this is a double standard and is upset about being judged by her standards. \n\nThe question is whether the author is wrong to use her beliefs against her to stop the sleepovers. On one hand, the author is pointing out the inconsistency. If her beliefs hold that cohabitation before marriage is improper, then sleeping over multiple nights a week (which is essentially cohabiting) would also be against that. So the author is highlighting a contradiction in her position. But is it fair for him to use her own beliefs to cut off something she's been doing all along?\n\nOn the other hand, the author is taking action based on the girlfriend's stated beliefs, which might not be the best approach. Instead of using her own beliefs as a weapon, maybe he should discuss the issue openly. The author is also in a position where he's not necessarily following the same standards, so if he's using her beliefs to enforce his own decisions, that's where the problem might be. \n\nBut the key here is whether the author is in the wrong. By using her beliefs to stop the sleepovers, he's applying a standard that she herself set. However, maybe he's not being fair because the situation is different\u2014sleeping over 4 nights a week isn't exactly the same as moving in together, even though it's similar. Plus, the fact that they've been having sex complicates things. If she's against cohabitation but not against the sexual aspect, then the author is pointing out the inconsistency. \n\nBut maybe the author is being hypocritical if he's not following the same standards. However, the main issue is whether he's wrong in enforcing her beliefs. Since he's not the one who set those beliefs, but she is, and he's using her own reasoning against her. That could be seen as a bit of a tactic, but if he's frustrated by her double standards, is it justified? \n\nI think the author is not in the wrong because he's calling out the inconsistency in her position. However, maybe the way he's doing it is hurtful. But the question is about being in the wrong, not about the method. So if her beliefs are against cohabitation before marriage, then continuing to sleep over is against that. Therefore, the author is using her own standard to stop something she's doing, which makes sense. So he's not in the wrong. Answer B.\n"
