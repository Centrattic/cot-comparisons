We work at the same company and live pretty close to each other. We're not in a rush to get married but with how much she is sleeping over at my place, it makes sense to move to a place together. She sleeps over so much because she says she likes spending time with me. \n\nWe've been talking about it and recently she said she decided she doesn't want to move in together any time soon, until we are married, because she says it is trashy and improper and frowned upon (Christian community). I think that's pretty judgemental, and interesting considering how often she sleeps over and how much sex we've been having before marriage. I'm getting tired of these double standards. WIBTA if I told her she can't sleep over any more because that's trashy and improper according to her own criteria? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong here. The situation is that the author and his girlfriend have been dating for a few years, and she sleeps over four or more nights a week. They work together and live close by. The guy thinks it makes sense to move in together, but the girlfriend is against it until they get married because she's in a Christian community where it's considered trashy and improper. The author wants to tell her she can't sleep over anymore, using her own standards, because of the double standards he perceives.\n\nFirst, I need to assess the context. The girlfriend's stance is based on religious beliefs, which she finds important enough to set a boundary. She's sleeping over a lot, but she still doesn't want to move in together before marriage. The author is frustrated because she's comfortable with sleeping over but not moving in, which he sees as a contradiction. He's considering using her own reasoning to cut off the sleepovers.\n\nThe key points here are mutual respect in relationships and the importance of communication. The author is trying to point out a double standard, which he's entitled to do, but the way he's approaching it might be problematic. Just because she's against cohabitation doesn't mean he can impose his own rules without discussion. Relationships require compromise and understanding both perspectives. The author's threat to stop the sleepovers because of her beliefs might be seen as a power move rather than a collaborative solution. It could be hurtful and counterproductive, as it doesn't address the underlying issues but instead uses her own reasoning against her. The right approach would be to have an open conversation about their differing values and find a middle ground, not to retaliate. So, the answer is likely A (author is in the wrong) because he's not respecting her boundaries and is using her beliefs to make a point, which isn't constructive.\n"
