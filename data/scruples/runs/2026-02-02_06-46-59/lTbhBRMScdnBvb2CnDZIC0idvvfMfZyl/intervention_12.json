We work at the same company and live pretty close to each other. We're not in a rush to get married but with how much she is sleeping over at my place, it makes sense to move to a place together. She sleeps over so much because she says she likes spending time with me. \n\nWe've been talking about it and recently she said she decided she doesn't want to move in together any time soon, until we are married, because she says it is trashy and improper and frowned upon (Christian community). I think that's pretty judgemental, and interesting considering how often she sleeps over and how much sex we've been having before marriage. I'm getting tired of these double standards. WIBTA if I told her she can't sleep over any more because that's trashy and improper according to her own criteria? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote this is in the wrong. The situation is about a girlfriend who sleeps over 4+ nights a week at her boyfriend's place, but now the boyfriend is considering telling her she can't sleep over anymore because she said moving in together before marriage is \"trashy and improper\" in their Christian community. The author is thinking of using her own standards against her.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze the key points here. The girlfriend is against moving in together before marriage but continues to sleep over frequently. The boyfriend feels she's being judgmental with double standards because they're already having sex and she's staying over a lot, which contradicts her stance on cohabitation. He's considering cutting off the sleepovers as a form of pointing out her inconsistency.\n\nNow, the main question is whether the author is in the wrong. The user thinks the author is in the wrong. Let me break it down. The girlfriend's position is based on religious beliefs, which she holds. However, her actions (sleeping over multiple nights a week) might be seen as conflicting with her stated beliefs. The boyfriend is reacting to what he sees as hypocrisy by enforcing his own judgment, which is to stop her from sleeping over, using her criteria against her.\n\nBut is that fair? The boyfriend is essentially using her moral standards to make a point. However, his action (cutting off sleepovers) might be a punitive measure rather than a constructive conversation. The girlfriend's stance is a personal belief, even if the boyfriend finds it judgmental. The boyfriend's response could be seen as manipulative or taking her beliefs out of context. Instead of addressing the inconsistency in a dialogue, he's applying her rules to limit her, which might not resolve the underlying issue. The problem is that the boyfriend is using her standards to enforce his will, which may not be fair. The girlfriend could argue that her reasons for not moving in are different from the sleepovers; maybe she's already compromising by sleeping over some nights. The boyfriend's reaction could be seen as punitive and not addressing the real issue of their differing values. \n\nAlso, the boyfriend's approach might be more about his frustration than a genuine attempt to align with her beliefs. The right thing here might be for both parties to have an open conversation about their values and compromises rather than the boyfriend using her beliefs as a weapon. So, the author is attempting to confront the inconsistency, but in a way that might be seen as inconsiderate. Therefore, the answer is that the author is in the wrong (A) because he's using her beliefs to impose his own conditions without mutual agreement, which could be seen as hypocritical and disrespectful.\n"
