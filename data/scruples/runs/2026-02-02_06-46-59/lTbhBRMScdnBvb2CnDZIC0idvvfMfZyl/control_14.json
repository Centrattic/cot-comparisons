      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if they're in the wrong for telling their girlfriend she can't sleep over anymore, based on her own standards.\n\nSo, the couple has been dating a few years, and she sleeps over 4+ nights a week. They work together and live close. The author thinks moving in together makes sense, but the girlfriend wants to wait until marriage because of her Christian beliefs. She says it's \"trashy and improper.\" The author is upset about her double standards since they're already having sex and she's over often, so they want to stop the sleepovers using her own logic.\n\nHmm. The key here is whether the author is applying her standards correctly. If she's against cohabitation but is okay with having sex before marriage, that's a double standard. But does the author have the right to use her standards to deny her the sleepovers? Well, maybe the author feels they need to be consistent, but the problem is that maybe the girlfriend's standards are about cohabitation specifically, not the act of sleeping together. For example, some religions consider sleeping in the same bed without being married as inappropriate, even if premarital sex is acceptable under certain circumstances. But in this case, the girlfriend is already having sex, so the author is pointing out that inconsistency.\n\nBut the question is about the author being in the wrong. The author is responding to the girlfriend's own standards. If she says it's improper to move in together, and the author is saying that if you follow her logic, then sleeping over 4+ nights a week is also improper, is that fair? Or is the author just trying to push for moving in by using her standards against her?\n\nWait, maybe the girlfriend's issue is not with sleeping over per se, but with the permanence of moving in together. Like, maybe she's okay with occasional visits but not with the regular, long-term cohabitation. So the author is conflating the two. If she's against cohabitation because it's like living in sin, but she's already doing it by sleeping over multiple nights, then the author might be correct in pointing out the inconsistency. However, the author is using her standards to cut off sleepovers, which might be inconsiderate if they were part of their relationship. \n\nOn the other hand, maybe the girlfriend's standards are based on a different context. For example, maybe she's okay with being intimate but not with sharing a household. The author is frustrated because she's not consistent, but if the author is okay with cohabitation and wants to move in together, then cutting off sleepovers might be a way to pressure her. However, the author is using her own reasoning against her, which could be seen as fair if the girlfriend is being inconsistent. But maybe the author is not in the wrong if the girlfriend is setting rules that she's not following. \n\nBut relationships require communication and negotiation. If the author is cutting off sleepovers because the girlfriend is against cohabitation, but the sleepovers are part of their current dynamic, does that mean the author is in the wrong? Or is the author trying to enforce mutual respect for each other's values? It's a bit of a gray area. The girlfriend might have different values, but the author is pointing out the contradiction. However, the author could also be using this as a way to end the relationship or force a move-in if they're not on the same page. \n\nI think the main point is about double standards. If the girlfriend is against cohabitation but is okay with regular sleepovers and intimacy, then the author is right to point that out. But if the author is using her standards to unilaterally decide the terms of their relationship without considering her reasons, maybe that's not fair. The answer likely depends on whether sleepovers are considered cohabitation. In some Christian communities, even regular sleepovers might be seen as akin to cohabitation. If that's the case, the author is using her own criteria, so maybe he's not in the wrong. But if the girlfriend is okay with the current arrangement despite her stated beliefs, the author might be justified in challenging her. \n\nAlternatively, the author could be in the wrong if he's being manipulative by taking her standards and applying them in a way that's not aligned with her actual beliefs. But the question is whether he is in the wrong in the eyes of the community. On Reddit, these questions often get a reaction based on the idea of challenging someone's standards if they're not being consistent. So the answer might be that the author is not in the wrong because he's pointing out her inconsistency.\n"
