We work at the same company and live pretty close to each other. We're not in a rush to get married but with how much she is sleeping over at my place, it makes sense to move to a place together. She sleeps over so much because she says she likes spending time with me. \n\nWe've been talking about it and recently she said she decided she doesn't want to move in together any time soon, until we are married, because she says it is trashy and improper and frowned upon (Christian community). I think that's pretty judgemental, and interesting considering how often she sleeps over and how much sex we've been having before marriage. I'm getting tired of these double standards. WIBTA if I told her she can't sleep over any more because that's trashy and improper according to her own criteria? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author of the scenario is in the wrong. The situation involves a couple in a long-term relationship where the girlfriend refuses to move in together before marriage, citing her Christian beliefs as being against it. However, she's been sleeping over multiple nights a week. The author is considering retaliating by stopping her from sleeping over, using her own standards to justify it.\n\nFirst, I need to assess if the author's actions would be wrong. The key points here are consent, respect for boundaries, and hypocrisy. The girlfriend has her own reasons for not moving in, but she's chosen to sleep over frequently. The author is now using her religious beliefs as a reason to cut off something she's already been doing. \n\nHypocrisy is a factor here. The girlfriend's actions (sleeping over so much) seem to contradict her stated beliefs. However, the author is now applying the same standards she uses to justify their own actions. But the author is also using that hypocrisy as a weapon. The question is whether it's fair to do that. \n\nThe author's retaliation might be a way to push back against the double standards, but cutting off sleepovers could be seen as punitive. The girlfriend might not have intended for the author to use her reasoning against her. The author's action could be seen as exploiting her own standards, which might not be fair. \n\nAlso, in relationships, communication is key. The author might be trying to address the hypocrisy, but doing so by suddenly changing the rules could be hurtful. It's about mutual respect. The author is in a position to enforce their own standards, but how they do it matters. Instead of using her reasoning to cut off sleepovers, maybe discussing the inconsistency and working towards a compromise would be better. \n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? By using the girlfriend's own standards against her, the author might be overstepping. Even if the girlfriend is being hypocritical, the author's action could be seen as taking it too far. The author is imposing their interpretation of her beliefs to end something she's been doing, which might not be fair. Therefore, the author is in the wrong.\n"
