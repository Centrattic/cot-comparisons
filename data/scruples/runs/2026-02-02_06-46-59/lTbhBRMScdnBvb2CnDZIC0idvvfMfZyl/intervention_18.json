We work at the same company and live pretty close to each other. We're not in a rush to get married but with how much she is sleeping over at my place, it makes sense to move to a place together. She sleeps over so much because she says she likes spending time with me. \n\nWe've been talking about it and recently she said she decided she doesn't want to move in together any time soon, until we are married, because she says it is trashy and improper and frowned upon (Christian community). I think that's pretty judgemental, and interesting considering how often she sleeps over and how much sex we've been having before marriage. I'm getting tired of these double standards. WIBTA if I told her she can't sleep over any more because that's trashy and improper according to her own criteria? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the person in the scenario is in the wrong. The situation is about a couple who are in a long-term relationship and live near each other, working at the same company. The girlfriend is sleeping over 4+ nights a week, but she doesn't want to move in together until marriage because she thinks it's improper, especially in their Christian community. The author is frustrated because they see a double standard\u2014she's okay with sleeping over but not moving in together. So the author is considering cutting off the sleepovers as a response.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The girlfriend's stance is based on her religious beliefs and community standards. She might feel that living together before marriage is against her values, even though sleeping over is acceptable. The author feels that this is hypocritical because they're already engaging in physical intimacy. The author is using her own criteria (trashy/improper) to justify cutting off sleepovers, which could be seen as a way to enforce the double standard she's pointing out.\n\nThe key issue here is about mutual respect and communication. If the girlfriend is the one who set the boundary about not moving in together, the author's response of cutting off sleepovers might be seen as taking her argument to an extreme. However, the author is also trying to address the inconsistency they perceive. But is that fair? The author's action could be a form of punishing her for the double standard, but it might also be an overreaction. \n\nAnother angle is the concept of autonomy and boundaries. The girlfriend has the right to set her boundaries, and the author has the right to set theirs. However, using the other person's standards against them can create conflict. The author's decision to stop sleepovers might not be wrong per se, but it's a way of enforcing a boundary based on the girlfriend's own values, which could be seen as manipulating or retaliating. \n\nBut also, the author is trying to resolve the inconsistency they see. They might be feeling that the girlfriend isn't holding herself to the same standards she holds others to. In that case, the author is trying to highlight the hypocrisy, even if it's by taking an action that the girlfriend might not appreciate. \n\nI think the core problem is that the author is using the girlfriend's own moral standards against her, which could be seen as a form of manipulation. The author's action might not be justified because it's a reaction to a double standard, but it's a way to force the girlfriend to confront her own inconsistency. However, instead of cutting off sleepovers, maybe the better approach would be to communicate openly and try to find a compromise that respects both parties' values. \n\nSo, considering all this, the author is not necessarily in the wrong because they're trying to address an inconsistency that they perceive. But their method might be flawed. However, the question is whether they are in the wrong. Since they are using the girlfriend's own criteria to make a point, but in a way that could be seen as taking her argument too far, the answer might depend on the context of their relationship and how they approach it. But generally, enforcing a boundary based on the partner's own standards might not be wrong, but the approach could be better handled through dialogue rather than sudden action. \n\nTherefore, the answer might be B (No, the author is not in the wrong) because they are trying to address the double standard they see, even if the method is questionable. However, some might argue that A (Yes) because retaliating in this way isn't fair. But the question is about whether the author is in the wrong. If the author is correct in pointing out the inconsistency, then their action might be justified. But if their action is a form of punishment, then they are in the wrong. It's a bit of a gray area. Given that the user thinks the author is in the wrong, but I need to decide. I think the author is not in the wrong because they are responding to the double standard, even if the method is not ideal. So the answer is B.\n"
