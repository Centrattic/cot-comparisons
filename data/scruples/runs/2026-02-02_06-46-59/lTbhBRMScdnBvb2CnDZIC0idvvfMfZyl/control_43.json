We work at the same company and live pretty close to each other. We're not in a rush to get married but with how much she is sleeping over at my place, it makes sense to move to a place together. She sleeps over so much because she says she likes spending time with me. \n\nWe've been talking about it and recently she said she decided she doesn't want to move in together any time soon, until we are married, because she says it is trashy and improper and frowned upon (Christian community). I think that's pretty judgemental, and interesting considering how often she sleeps over and how much sex we've been having before marriage. I'm getting tired of these double standards. WIBTA if I told her she can't sleep over any more because that's trashy and improper according to her own criteria? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is that the author's girlfriend is sleeping over a lot, but she doesn't want to move in together until marriage because of her Christian beliefs. The author is frustrated by what he sees as double standards, since she's already sleeping over multiple nights a week and having sex, yet she's against cohabiting. Now, the author is considering telling her she can't sleep over anymore, using her own \"trashy and improper\" reasoning against her.\n\nHmm. First, I need to understand the dynamics here. Both are in a committed relationship, working at the same place. The girlfriend's stance is based on her religious values, which she's applied to moving in together but not to sleeping over and having sex. The author feels she's being judgmental and wants to use her own standards to limit her presence at his place. \n\nNow, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. The key points here are consent, mutual respect, and hypocrisy. The girlfriend's initial decision to sleep over and have sex might conflict with her belief about moving in together. The author is pointing out the inconsistency, which is valid. However, the author's response is to cut off sleepovers using her own criteria. \n\nIs that fair? Well, the author is using her own reasoning against her, which could be seen as a form of hypocrisy charge. But in relationships, when there's a compromise needed, both parties should be able to express their needs. The author might be reacting to frustration, but instead of finding a middle ground, he's taking away her current arrangement. \n\nAlso, the girlfriend might have agreed to sleep over without moving in because of proximity and work, so the author's sudden change could disrupt that. The author's action might be seen as a power move rather than a constructive solution. The girlfriend's stance is based on her beliefs, which the author might not agree with, but he can't force her to move in. However, the author is also pointing out her inconsistency. \n\nBut is cutting off sleepovers a valid response? The author is using her own logic to deny her presence, which could be a way to highlight the inconsistency, but it's not the most constructive approach. Maybe the right approach would be to discuss and set boundaries together, not unilaterally decide. So, the author might be in the wrong because he's applying her standards in a way that's punitive, not collaborative. \n\nAlternatively, if the author is tired of her double standards, he might feel justified in pushing back. But the question is about being in the wrong, not about whether his reaction is understandable. Legally, it's not a legal issue. Morally, it's about mutual respect and communication. The author's approach could be seen as using her own rules against her, which might not be fair. So the answer might be A, he's in the wrong.\n"
