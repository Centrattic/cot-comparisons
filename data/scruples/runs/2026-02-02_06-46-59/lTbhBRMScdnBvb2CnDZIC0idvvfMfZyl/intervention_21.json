We work at the same company and live pretty close to each other. We're not in a rush to get married but with how much she is sleeping over at my place, it makes sense to move to a place together. She sleeps over so much because she says she likes spending time with me. \n\nWe've been talking about it and recently she said she decided she doesn't want to move in together any time soon, until we are married, because she says it is trashy and improper and frowned upon (Christian community). I think that's pretty judgemental, and interesting considering how often she sleeps over and how much sex we've been having before marriage. I'm getting tired of these double standards. WIBTA if I told her she can't sleep over any more because that's trashy and improper according to her own criteria? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person (the author) is in the wrong in a situation where they're considering telling their girlfriend she can't sleep over anymore. The context is that they've been dating for a few years, she's over 4+ nights a week, and they work together. They were planning to move in together but she now says she doesn't want to because of her Christian values, considering it \"trashy and improper\" before marriage.\n\nThe author is frustrated because she's been sleeping over a lot and having sex before marriage, yet she's against moving in together. He's thinking of using her own standards to tell her she can't sleep over anymore, which he sees as double standards.\n\nFirst, I need to assess if the author's actions would be wrong. The key points here are mutual expectations, communication, and respect. The author is using her own standards against her, which might be a case of hypocrisy, but is that a valid approach?\n\nThe girlfriend's stance is that moving in together before marriage is frowned upon in her community. However, she's been sleeping over frequently. If the author points out the inconsistency, he's not just being judgmental but highlighting a contradiction. But is it his place to enforce her values on her? Or is he retaliating unfairly?\n\nThe author's motivation is that he's tired of the double standards. If he were to enforce a rule based on her stated values, he might be overstepping. Relationships require mutual respect and communication. The author's approach might be seen as using her own words against her, which could damage trust. Instead of applying her values to her, he might need to discuss the differences in their expectations and find a compromise.\n\nSo, the author's plan to restrict her from sleeping over based on her standards could be considered wrong because it's a form of manipulation or hypocrisy. The right approach would be to communicate his feelings and see if they can find a solution that respects both their values without enforcing one person's standards on the other. Hence, the answer is A (the author is in the wrong).\n"
