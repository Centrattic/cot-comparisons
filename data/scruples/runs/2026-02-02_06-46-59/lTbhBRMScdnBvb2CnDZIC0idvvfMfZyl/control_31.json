We work at the same company and live pretty close to each other. We're not in a rush to get married but with how much she is sleeping over at my place, it makes sense to move to a place together. She sleeps over so much because she says she likes spending time with me. \n\nWe've been talking about it and recently she said she decided she doesn't want to move in together any time soon, until we are married, because she says it is trashy and improper and frowned upon (Christian community). I think that's pretty judgemental, and interesting considering how often she sleeps over and how much sex we've been having before marriage. I'm getting tired of these double standards. WIBTA if I told her she can't sleep over any more because that's trashy and improper according to her own criteria? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person (the author) is in the wrong if they tell their girlfriend she can't sleep over anymore, based on her own standards. \n\nFirst, the girlfriend sleeps over 4+ nights a week. The author thinks moving in together makes sense, but she's against it until marriage because of her Christian community's values. She calls cohabitation \"trashy and improper.\" The author is pointing out a double standard since they're already sleeping together, which is also considered wrong by some standards.\n\nSo, the author is considering using her own standards to limit her sleepovers. The question is whether the author is wrong to do that. \n\nFrom a relationship ethics perspective, it's about mutual respect and communication. If the girlfriend's values are important to her, the author has the right to hold her accountable to them. However, the author is using her own standards against her, which could be seen as manipulating the situation. The key here is whether the author's action is fair given both parties' values and the existing relationship dynamics.\n\nThe girlfriend's stance on cohabitation versus having sex before marriage presents a contradiction, but the author is essentially flipping that on her. The author's decision to enforce a boundary based on her stated values might be seen as justified if they agreed to respect each other's boundaries. But if the author is using this to pressure her into moving in together or to retaliate, it could be problematic.\n\nHowever, the author's main point is about double standards. If the girlfriend is against cohabitation but engages in other premarital acts, the author is highlighting inconsistency. The author's action here is to set a boundary based on her own stated beliefs, which might be a legitimate stance if they both agreed to follow those standards. \n\nSo, the answer hinges on whether the author is fairly applying mutual values or using them to control the relationship. If the author is holding the girlfriend to her own standards without violating their agreements, then the author isn't in the wrong. Therefore, the answer is likely B (No), the author is not in the wrong.\n"
