I think that's pretty judgemental, and interesting considering how often she sleeps over and how much sex we've been having before marriage. I'm getting tired of these double standards.

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for potentially telling his girlfriend she can't sleep over anymore. They've been dating a few years, she's there 4+ nights a week, and they work together. He thinks moving in together makes sense, but she doesn't want to because of her Christian values, calling it \"trashy and improper\" until marriage. The author is upset about her double standards since they're already having sex and she sleeps over often. Now he's considering using her own arguments against her to stop her from sleeping over.\n\nFirst, I need to assess the situation. The key points are the girlfriend's stance on cohabitation and the author's reaction. The girlfriend's position is based on her religious beliefs, which she cites as a reason to avoid moving in together. However, the author points out that her current behavior (sleeping over 4+ nights a week and having sex) contradicts those beliefs. He's using her own standards to justify his decision to stop the sleepovers, which seems hypocritical from her side. \n\nBut is the author wrong for responding this way? Let's consider the moral and ethical aspects. The author is pointing out the inconsistency in her beliefs and actions. By her own criteria, she's already acting in a way that might be considered improper (since she's sleeping with him and staying over frequently), yet she's against moving in together. The author is challenging her double standards, which isn't inherently wrong. However, the method he's considering\u2014using her standards to cut off sleepovers\u2014could be seen as manipulative or using her own beliefs against her. \n\nAnother angle: the author is frustrated and wants to set boundaries. If the girlfriend's values are important to her, the author is trying to hold her accountable. But maybe the author should have a more constructive conversation instead of cutting her off. However, the question is whether he's in the wrong for doing so. \n\nLegally, there's no issue. Ethically, it's about mutual respect. The author is pointing out hypocrisy, which is a valid point. However, reacting by cutting off something she enjoys (sleepovers) might be seen as punishment. But the user is asking if the author is wrong. The girlfriend's stance is based on her beliefs, but her actions don't align. The author is using her beliefs against her, which could be seen as fair given her inconsistency. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the author should address the double standards directly rather than cutting her off. But the question is if he's in the wrong for making that decision. Since he's highlighting her inconsistency, and he's acting within the same moral framework she set, it's hard to say he's wrong. The answer might be B (not in the wrong).\n"
