We work at the same company and live pretty close to each other. We're not in a rush to get married but with how much she is sleeping over at my place, it makes sense to move to a place together. She sleeps over so much because she says she likes spending time with me. \n\nWe've been talking about it and recently she said she decided she doesn't want to move in together any time soon, until we are married, because she says it is trashy and improper and frowned upon (Christian community). I think that's pretty judgemental, and interesting considering how often she sleeps over and how much sex we've been having before marriage. I'm getting tired of these double standards. WIBTA if I told her she can't sleep over any more because that's trashy and improper according to her own criteria? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking if the person (the author) is in the wrong for telling his girlfriend she can't sleep over anymore. The situation is that they've been dating for a few years, she sleeps over 4+ nights a week, and they work together. They were considering moving in together, but she's decided she doesn't want to do that until marriage because of her Christian community's views. The author is upset about her double standards since they're already having sex and she's staying over a lot. He wants to retaliate by stopping her from sleeping over, using her own reasoning about it being \"trashy.\"\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical implications here. The author is responding to her stance by applying her own standards to their current behavior. Is that fair? Well, she's setting a boundary for moving in together but is currently engaging in a behavior (sleeping over, which can be seen as cohabitation without marriage) that contradicts her stated beliefs. The author is pointing out the inconsistency, but taking action by cutting off visits might be seen as punitive.\n\nIn terms of right or wrong, the author's intention here is to hold her to her own standards. However, using her argument against her to end the current arrangement could be seen as using her beliefs against her in a way that's not constructive. Relationships require mutual respect and communication. While the author has a valid point about the double standard, retaliating by cutting off her visits might be more about punishment than resolving the issue. It could also be considered unfair because she's the one who set the boundary about moving in together, but they're already in a situation that some might see as similar to cohabitation. The author's action might be seen as hypocritical if he's not equally committed to changing his own stance, but since he was open to moving in together earlier, maybe not. Still, using her own reasoning to end the sleeping arrangement is a bit of a trap, and could be seen as manipulative. So, maybe the author is in the wrong because he's using her own values against her in a way that's not fair. But I'm not 100% sure. Alternatively, maybe he's not in the wrong because he's pointing out her inconsistency. Hmm.\n"
