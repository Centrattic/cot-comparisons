We work at the same company and live pretty close to each other. We're not in a rush to get married but with how much she is sleeping over at my place, it makes sense to move to a place together. She sleeps over so much because she says she likes spending time with me. \n\nWe've been talking about it and recently she said she decided she doesn't want to move in together any time soon, until we are married, because she says it is trashy and improper and frowned upon (Christian community). I think that's pretty judgemental, and interesting considering how often she sleeps over and how much sex we've been having before marriage. I'm getting tired of these double standards. WIBTA if I told her she can't sleep over any more because that's trashy and improper according to her own criteria? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for considering telling his girlfriend she can't sleep over anymore, based on her own standards.\n\nFirst, the girlfriend sleeps over 4+ nights a week. They both work at the same company and live nearby. The author thinks moving in together is logical, but she refuses because of her Christian beliefs, saying it's improper until marriage. However, she's been sleeping over a lot and having sex before marriage. The author is frustrated by the double standards.\n\nSo, the author is planning to use her own standards against her, saying if she thinks cohabitation is improper, then she shouldn't sleep over. But is the author wrong to do that? \n\nFrom a relationship standpoint, both partners should respect each other's boundaries. The girlfriend has set her own boundaries based on religion, but she's not adhering to them fully. The author is pointing out the inconsistency. However, using her standards to enforce his own actions (stopping her from sleeping over) could be seen as manipulative or hypocritical, especially if he's not following her standards (since they're already cohabiting in a way by sleeping together). \n\nAlso, the core issue seems to be about mutual respect and communication. Instead of retaliating, the author should address the inconsistency in her behavior and discuss the future of the relationship. The author's approach might be inconsiderate because it abruptly changes the dynamics without understanding her reasons. So, even if the author is frustrated, cutting off sleepovers suddenly could be seen as the wrong move. The answer might be A (Yes, the author is in the wrong) because he's using her standards against her in a way that's not constructive, and the right approach would be better communication rather than punishment.\n"
