We work at the same company and live pretty close to each other. We're not in a rush to get married but with how much she is sleeping over at my place, it makes sense to move to a place together. She sleeps over so much because she says she likes spending time with me. \n\nWe've been talking about it and recently she said she decided she doesn't want to move in together any time soon, until we are married, because she says it is trashy and improper and frowned upon (Christian community). I think that's pretty judgemental, and interesting considering how often she sleeps over and how much sex we've been having before marriage. I'm getting tired of these double standards. WIBTA if I told her she can't sleep over any more because that's trashy and improper according to her own criteria? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let me try to figure this out. The user is asking if the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong. The situation involves a couple where the girlfriend is sleeping over several nights a week, but she doesn't want to move in together before marriage because of her Christian beliefs, calling it \"trashy and improper.\" The author is considering telling her she can't sleep over anymore based on her own standards.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the moral and ethical angles here. The girlfriend is following her religious beliefs, which guide her to avoid cohabitation before marriage. However, she's been sleeping over multiple times a week, which could imply a level of physical intimacy beyond just sleeping. The author is frustrated with what he sees as double standards\u2014she's okay with being intimate but not with living together.\n\nThe key points are consent and mutual agreement. The relationship should be based on mutual respect and understanding. If the girlfriend is okay with her current situation and the author is not willing to compromise, that's a problem. The author's threat to stop allowing her to sleep over because of her beliefs could be seen as hypocritical or manipulative, especially since he's choosing to enforce her standards selectively. \n\nAlso, the author is using her own criteria against her, which might be a form of emotional manipulation. The girlfriend's stance is about cohabitation, not necessarily about sleeping over. Maybe she sees sleeping over as different from living together. The author is conflating the two, which might not be fair. \n\nAnother angle: the author is in a position where he's setting boundaries, but doing so in a way that's retaliatory. If the girlfriend is unwilling to move in together, perhaps the author should respect that and work within the boundaries she's set. By cutting off her sleepovers, he's imposing his own standards rather than finding a compromise. \n\nHowever, the author could argue that her actions don't align with her beliefs, so he's pointing out the inconsistency. But that's a different approach\u2014addressing the inconsistency rather than cutting off sleepovers. Using her beliefs to restrict their relationship in a way that she might not have intended could be seen as unfair.\n\nIn relationships, communication is key. The author might need to discuss his feelings and concerns directly rather than using her beliefs as a weapon. By threatening to stop sleepovers, he's not solving the problem but creating conflict. The girlfriend's stance is part of her values, and the author's reaction could be seen as invalidating her beliefs while also being inconsistent with his own actions (since he's okay with her sleeping over despite his own views on her double standards).\n\nSo, putting it all together, the author is likely in the wrong because he's using her beliefs against her in a way that's manipulative and not addressing the real issues through open communication. His approach could be seen as retaliatory and disrespectful of her values, even if those values seem inconsistent to him.\n"
