      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking if the author of the \"Would I Be Terrible for...\" scenario is in the wrong. The situation involves a girlfriend who sleeps over frequently but doesn't want to move in together until marriage, citing Christian values. The author is considering cutting off the sleepovers using her own standards.\n\nFirst, I need to understand both sides. The girlfriend sleeps over 4+ nights a week, which the author sees as a step toward moving in. She says she doesn't want to move in until marriage, calling it \"trashy\" and against Christian values. The author is frustrated by her double standards since they're already having sex and she's against cohabitation. He's threatening to stop sleepovers using her reasoning. \n\nSo, why would the author be in the wrong? Well, if he's using her standards against her, that might be hypocritical. He's essentially saying, \"You don't want to cohabitate until marriage, so I can't sleep over?\" But wait, the girl is the one sleeping over at his place. The author might be using her own values to impose his will, which could be manipulative. Also, the author is in a position where he's deciding to cut off the sleepovers, which might be a form of punishment for her stance. \n\nOn the other hand, the author is pointing out inconsistency in her beliefs. If she considers cohabitation before marriage improper, but engages in other activities like having sex, the author might feel justified in calling out the double standard. However, using that to cut off sleepovers entirely could be seen as holding her to a standard she didn't expect him to enforce so strictly. \n\nThe key here is consent and mutual agreement. The author is making a unilateral decision to change the living arrangement. They were discussing moving in together, but she decided against it. The author might feel that without a move-in date, the current sleepover situation is inconsistent with her values. But by enforcing his own rules based on her standards, he's not allowing for a compromise. \n\nMaybe the healthier approach would be to have a conversation about expectations, rather than using her reasoning to cut things off. The author's action might be more about asserting control rather than resolving the issue. So, he's using her own values as a weapon, which could be seen as in the wrong because it's not respecting her autonomy to make her own choices, even if they conflict with her stated beliefs. \n\nTherefore, the answer is likely A (Yes, the author is in the wrong) because he's applying her standards in a way that's punitive and not collaborative.\n"
