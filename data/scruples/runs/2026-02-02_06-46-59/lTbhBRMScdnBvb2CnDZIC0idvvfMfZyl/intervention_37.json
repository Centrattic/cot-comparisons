We work at the same company and live pretty close to each other. We're not in a rush to get married but with how much she is sleeping over at my place, it makes sense to move to a place together. She sleeps over so much because she says she likes spending time with me. \n\nWe've been talking about it and recently she said she decided she doesn't want to move in together any time soon, until we are married, because she says it is trashy and improper and frowned upon (Christian community). I think that's pretty judgemental, and interesting considering how often she sleeps over and how much sex we've been having before marriage. I'm getting tired of these double standards. WIBTA if I told her she can't sleep over any more because that's trashy and improper according to her own criteria? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of the WIBTA (Would I Be Terrible for...) post is in the wrong. The situation involves the author considering telling his girlfriend she can't sleep over anymore after she refuses to move in together. She's against moving in together due to her Christian beliefs, but they already sleep over multiple nights a week and have sex. The author is upset about her double standards and wants to retaliate by cutting off the sleepovers.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze the dynamics here. The girlfriend's stance is that moving in together before marriage is \"trashy\" and improper, but she's already staying over frequently. The author is frustrated with her inconsistency and wants to enforce her own standards. The key here is whether the author is justified in his action based on her stated beliefs.\n\nThe user thinks the author is in the wrong, but I need to decide. The girlfriend's beliefs might influence her decision-making, but if she's not holding herself to the same standards (sleeping over and having sex), then the author's point about double standards is valid. However, enforcing her standards on her might be a bit of a trap. The author is essentially using her own beliefs against her to control her behavior. \n\nBut is that fair? The author is reacting to hypocrisy, but the method of enforcing her beliefs by cutting off sleepovers could be seen as using her standards to hurt her. However, the author is also pointing out the inconsistency. The question is whether the author oversteps by making a rule based on her beliefs, especially if she isn't applying them consistently. \n\nThe author might be in the right to call out the double standards, but the action of cutting her off could be harsh. Alternatively, the girlfriend's stance is her personal choice, and the author shouldn't impose his own views on her. But since she's the one who brought up the standards, the author is using her own criteria against her. \n\nSo, considering the situation, the author is pointing out hypocrisy but is taking a punitive action based on her own beliefs. The key is whether the action is fair. Since the girlfriend isn't living up to her own standards, the author is justified in highlighting that. However, the act of cutting her off might be a reaction that the author is allowed to make, especially if he's tired of her double standards. But maybe the author is being a bit manipulative here, using her own beliefs to control her. \n\nHmm. I think the answer is A (author is in the wrong) because he's using her beliefs to enforce a rule that she's not applying to herself, which could be seen as hypocritical. But maybe not. Alternatively, the author is being consistent by holding her to the standards she set. The answer might depend on whether applying her own standards to her is valid. If her stance is that living together is improper, then he's pointing out that by sleeping over, she's already violating it. So, by cutting her off, he's enforcing her own values, which could be justified. But if he's doing it to punish her for not moving in, it's more about control. \n\nI'm a bit torn here. But considering that the author is reacting to her inconsistency and using her own standards against her, maybe the answer is A because he's using her beliefs punitively. Alternatively, if the girlfriend is inconsistent, then the author is justified in not wanting to comply with her double standards. The answer might depend on cultural context and personal boundaries. Since the user thinks the author is in the wrong, but I need to decide. I'm leaning towards A because the author is enforcing her beliefs in a way that's not fair, especially if she's already violating them. But maybe the answer is B because he's responding to her double standards. Hmm.\n"
