We work at the same company and live pretty close to each other. We're not in a rush to get married but with how much she is sleeping over at my place, it makes sense to move to a place together. She sleeps over so much because she says she likes spending time with me. \n\nWe've been talking about it and recently she said she decided she doesn't want to move in together any time soon, until we are married, because she says it is trashy and improper and frowned upon (Christian community). I think that's pretty judgemental, and interesting considering how often she sleeps over and how much sex we've been having before marriage. I'm getting tired of these double standards. WIBTA if I told her she can't sleep over any more because that's trashy and improper according to her own criteria? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong in this situation. The scenario is that the author's girlfriend sleeps over 4+ nights a week, but she doesn't want to move in together until marriage because of her Christian community's views. The author is frustrated with her double standards and wants to tell her she can't sleep over anymore based on her own criteria. The user thinks the author is in the wrong.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical and relational aspects here. The girlfriend is following her beliefs about premarital cohabitation being improper, yet she's choosing to sleep over frequently. The author is pointing out the inconsistency, which is a valid point. But does that justify the author's response of cutting off the sleepovers?\n\nThe key here is about hypocrisy. The girlfriend is holding to a standard she's not following, which the author is rightly calling out. However, the author's proposed action is to enforce that standard by restricting her from sleeping over. That seems contradictory because the author is now applying the same standard they previously didn't mind. The author is essentially saying, \"Well, if you think it's wrong, then you shouldn't do it. So I won't let you.\" But the author was okay with it before, so changing the rules now might be unfair.\n\nAlso, communication is important in relationships. The author should address the hypocrisy with the girlfriend, maybe discuss the implications of her double standard, and see if they can reach a mutual understanding. Instead of abruptly cutting off sleepovers, having an open conversation about their future and expectations would be more constructive. The author's approach could come off as manipulative or punitive, which isn't healthy for the relationship.\n\nMoreover, the girlfriend's stance on moving in together might be a personal choice based on her beliefs. Even if she's not moving in, her current behavior is still living together in a way, which the author is pointing out. The author's frustration is understandable, but retaliating by enforcing a double standard might not be the right approach. It's about consistency in values and mutual respect. The author is in a position where they need to reconcile their own actions with their partner's beliefs, but doing so in a way that's respectful and communicative rather than punitive.\n\nSo, considering all this, the author is in the wrong because they're using the girlfriend's own standards against her in a way that's inconsistent with their past behavior and not addressing the issue through dialogue. The answer should be A.\n"
