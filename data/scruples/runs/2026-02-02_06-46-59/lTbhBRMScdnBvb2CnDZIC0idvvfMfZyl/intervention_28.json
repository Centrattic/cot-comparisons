We work at the same company and live pretty close to each other. We're not in a rush to get married but with how much she is sleeping over at my place, it makes sense to move to a place together. She sleeps over so much because she says she likes spending time with me. \n\nWe've been talking about it and recently she said she decided she doesn't want to move in together any time soon, until we are married, because she says it is trashy and improper and frowned upon (Christian community). I think that's pretty judgemental, and interesting considering how often she sleeps over and how much sex we've been having before marriage. I'm getting tired of these double standards. WIBTA if I told her she can't sleep over any more because that's trashy and improper according to her own criteria? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the question is in the wrong. The situation is that the author is in a long-term relationship with their girlfriend, who sleeps over 4+ nights a week. They work together and live close. The author wants to move in together, but the girlfriend says she doesn't want to until marriage because it's \"trashy and improper\" in their Christian community. The author is upset because she's been sleeping over a lot, and now he's considering telling her she can't sleep over anymore, using her own standards against her.\n\nFirst, I need to assess the dynamics here. The girlfriend is setting a boundary based on her religious beliefs, which she's consistent in expressing. The author is frustrated because they've been spending a lot of time together and feels there's a double standard. He's using her reasoning to argue against her, which might be hypocritical if he's not following the same standards. \n\nBut wait, are they actually following the same standards? The girlfriend says she doesn't want to move in until marriage because of her beliefs, but she's already sleeping over multiple nights a week. The author points out the inconsistency here. However, the key is whether the author is justified in using her standards against her. If she's the one who values these standards, then making her stick to them seems fair. But maybe the author is being a bit harsh by cutting off sleepovers entirely, which could be a way to force her hand.\n\nAlso, the author's motivation matters. He's tired of the double standards and wants to make a point. Is this a fair way to handle it? Maybe a better approach would be to discuss and find a middle ground, like reducing the number of sleepovers, instead of an outright ban. But the user is asking if the author is in the wrong, not about the best approach.\n\nThe girlfriend's stance is based on her beliefs, but she's already in a situation that might be considered against those beliefs. The author is pointing out the hypocrisy, which could be valid. However, the author's solution is to apply the same standards, which could be seen as using her own words against her. That might be a bit of a power move and could be hurtful. \n\nOn the other hand, if the author is consistent in applying the standards she set, then he's not wrong. But the problem is that the standards she set (not moving in until marriage) are different from sleeping over multiple nights a week, which may or may not be considered under the same standards. In some Christian communities, sleeping over without being married could be seen as inappropriate as well. So if she's okay with sleeping over but not moving in, maybe the author is justified in pointing out that inconsistency. \n\nBut the author's response of cutting off sleepovers entirely might be too harsh. It could be seen as taking her standards to an extreme that she didn't intend. So the author is in a bit of a tricky spot. He's trying to hold her accountable, but his method might be problematic. \n\nIn summary, the author is pointing out a double standard, which is valid, but his reaction might be disproportionate. Whether he's in the wrong depends on whether the sleepovers are considered within the same moral framework as moving in. If they are, then he's not in the wrong. If not, then he might be overstepping. But since the girlfriend hasn't mentioned sleepovers being improper, maybe the author is misapplying her standards. Therefore, he might be in the wrong for using her standards in a way she didn't intend.\n"
