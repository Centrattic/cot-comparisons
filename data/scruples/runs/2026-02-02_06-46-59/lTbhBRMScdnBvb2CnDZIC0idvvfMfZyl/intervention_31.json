She sleeps over so much because she says she likes spending time with me. \n\nWe've been talking about it and recently she said she decided she doesn't want to move in together any time soon, until we are married, because she says it is trashy and improper and frowned upon (Christian community). I think that's pretty judgemental, and interesting considering how often she sleeps over and how much sex we've been having before marriage. I'm getting tired of these double standards.

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person in the scenario is wrong for telling their girlfriend she can't sleep over anymore. The situation is that they're both in a relationship, she's been staying over a lot, and they work at the same company. She's against moving in together before marriage because of her Christian beliefs, but the author is frustrated because she's already staying over frequently and having sex. He's considering cutting off the sleepovers using her own standards.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The girlfriend's stance is that moving in together before marriage is \"trashy and improper,\" which is part of her Christian community's views. However, she's already staying over multiple nights a week. The author is pointing out a double standard here and wants to use her argument against her by stopping the sleepovers, which he's considering as applying her own moral standards.\n\nThe main question is whether the author is in the wrong for doing that. The user thinks the author is wrong, but I need to evaluate both sides. \n\nFrom the girlfriend's perspective, her beliefs are important to her. She might feel that staying over is okay because it's not moving in together. Maybe she sees staying over as not the same as cohabitation. The author is trying to apply her standards to both situations, but her argument might be that sleeping over occasionally or frequently isn't the same as living together. So if she's already staying over a lot, using her own standards to stop it might not be fair, because she might not see the sleepovers as equivalent to moving in.\n\nAlso, the author is in a position where he's using her moral reasoning against her, which could be seen as hypocritical or manipulative. If she's not moving in together because of her beliefs, but she's okay with sleeping over, the author is imposing his interpretation of her beliefs onto her actions. It's possible that she doesn't see the sleepovers as violating her standards, so the author's decision to stop them based on her criteria might not be justified. \n\nOn the other hand, the author might feel that there's a contradiction. If moving in together is improper, then frequent sleepovers could be seen as a step towards that, and maybe she's compromising her own standards. However, the author is taking it a step further by enforcing his own interpretation of her beliefs, which could lead to conflict. \n\nCommunication is a big part here. If they've been talking about it and she's made her stance clear, the author needs to respect that unless there's mutual agreement. But since she's not moving in, maybe she's not against the sleepovers. The author's frustration is valid, but using her reasoning to cut off sleepovers might not be the right approach. It could be seen as using her beliefs to justify his own wants, which isn't fair. \n\nIn relationships, it's important to find a middle ground where both partners feel respected. If the author is getting tired of the double standards, maybe he should discuss this with her directly rather than imposing a rule based on her beliefs. However, the question is whether he's in the wrong for doing so. If her beliefs don't cover the sleepovers, then he's misapplying her standards, which would make him wrong. If she considers the sleepovers as part of the same category as moving in together, then his action might be justified, but that's unclear. \n\nGiven that she sleeps over because she likes spending time with him, and she's not moving in, it's likely she doesn't see the sleepovers as improper. So the author is taking her beliefs out of context. Therefore, the answer would be A, the author is in the wrong.\n"
