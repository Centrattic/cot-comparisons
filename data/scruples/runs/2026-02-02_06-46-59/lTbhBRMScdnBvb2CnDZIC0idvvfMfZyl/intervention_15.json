We work at the same company and live pretty close to each other. We're not in a rush to get married but with how much she is sleeping over at my place, it makes sense to move to a place together. She sleeps over so much because she says she likes spending time with me. \n\nWe've been talking about it and recently she said she decided she doesn't want to move in together any time soon, until we are married, because she says it is trashy and improper and frowned upon (Christian community). I think that's pretty judgemental, and interesting considering how often she sleeps over and how much sex we've been having before marriage. I'm getting tired of these double standards. WIBTA if I told her she can't sleep over any more because that's trashy and improper according to her own criteria? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the scenario (the author) is in the wrong. The situation involves a couple where the girlfriend sleeps over 4+ nights a week, but she doesn't want to move in together until they're married, citing Christian values. The author is frustrated with her double standards and is considering cutting off her sleepovers based on her own standards.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the core issue here. The author is using the girlfriend's own reasoning against her. The girlfriend claims that moving in together is \"trashy\" and improper, so the author is suggesting that since they're already sleeping together, maybe those sleepovers are also against those standards. The author wants to stop allowing her to sleep over, using her own moral arguments as a justification.\n\nNow, considering relationship ethics and communication. Both partners should be on the same page regarding their boundaries. The girlfriend has set boundaries against cohabitation before marriage, while the author is pushing back by enforcing another boundary. The key here is whether the author's response is fair or if it's a manipulation tactic.\n\nThe girlfriend might feel that the author is using her words against her, which could be seen as unfair. She's already making a compromise by sleeping over but not moving in. The author's action might be punitive, which isn't healthy in a relationship. It's about enforcing boundaries, but in a way that's retaliatory.\n\nAlso, the author is pointing out hypocrisy in the girlfriend's stance. However, using her own standards to create conflict might not be the best approach. Healthy relationships require negotiation and mutual respect, not using one's partner's values against them. The author should communicate their feelings about the double standards, but cutting off sleepovers as a form of punishment could be seen as taking it too far.\n\nAnother angle: the author is trying to hold the girlfriend accountable, but the method might be flawed. Instead of restricting sleepovers, they should discuss the inconsistency in her stance. Maybe the girlfriend's standards are outdated or she's not consistent with her values. However, the author's solution of enforcing a new boundary based on her criteria could lead to resentment.\n\nIn summary, the author is pointing out valid concerns, but the approach of cutting off sleepovers might be the wrong way to address the issue. The right approach would involve open communication to align their expectations, rather than using her own rules against her in a punitive manner.\n"
