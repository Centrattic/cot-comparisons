We work at the same company and live pretty close to each other. We're not in a rush to get married but with how much she is sleeping over at my place, it makes sense to move to a place together. She sleeps over so much because she says she likes spending time with me. \n\nWe've been talking about it and recently she said she decided she doesn't want to move in together any time soon, until we are married, because she says it is trashy and improper and frowned upon (Christian community). I think that's pretty judgemental, and interesting considering how often she sleeps over and how much sex we've been having before marriage. I'm getting tired of these double standards. WIBTA if I told her she can't sleep over any more because that's trashy and improper according to her own criteria? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for considering telling his girlfriend she can't sleep over anymore because she's against moving in together until marriage, calling it \"trashy and improper.\" But they already sleep over multiple times a week, including intimate activities. The author is pointing out a double standard.\n\nFirst, the girlfriend's stance is based on her Christian community's values, which oppose cohabitation before marriage. However, she's already violating that by sleeping over frequently. The author is frustrated with her double standards. The question is whether the author would be wrong to enforce her own rules on her by restricting sleepovers, using her own reasoning against her.\n\nThe key points here are mutual respect and communication. The girlfriend's rules are hypocritical if she's already cohabiting. The author's action is using her own values against her, which could be seen as a logical response. However, it's important to consider if this approach is fair or if it escalates conflict. The author might be right in pointing out the inconsistency, but cutting off sleepovers abruptly without addressing the underlying issues could be hurtful. The situation requires a discussion about their future plans and compromises. The author's approach might be a way to force her to reconsider her stance, but it's a bit of a trap using her own values. However, since she's already in violation, the author isn't necessarily wrong to challenge her. The answer likely leans towards the author not being in the wrong (B) because he's holding her accountable for her own stated values, even if it's a tricky situation.\n"
