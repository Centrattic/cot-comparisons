We work at the same company and live pretty close to each other. We're not in a rush to get married but with how much she is sleeping over at my place, it makes sense to move to a place together. She sleeps over so much because she says she likes spending time with me. \n\nWe've been talking about it and recently she said she decided she doesn't want to move in together any time soon, until we are married, because she says it is trashy and improper and frowned upon (Christian community). I think that's pretty judgemental, and interesting considering how often she sleeps over and how much sex we've been having before marriage. I'm getting tired of these double standards. WIBTA if I told her she can't sleep over any more because that's trashy and improper according to her own criteria? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of the \"Would I Be Terrible for...\" scenario is in the wrong. The situation is about a couple who live separately but she sleeps over 4+ nights a week. They work together and live close. The girlfriend doesn't want to move in together because she's from a Christian community that frowns upon cohabitation before marriage. The author is conflicted because she sleeps over a lot and they have sex, which he thinks is hypocritical. He's considering cutting off her sleepovers because she's using the same standards she applies to moving in together.\n\nFirst, I need to figure out if he's in the wrong. Let's break it down. The girlfriend has her reasons based on her beliefs. She's against moving in together but continues to sleep over, which he sees as a double standard. The author is frustrated and wants to enforce her own standards by stopping the sleepovers. \n\nBut is it fair for him to use her beliefs against her? If she's okay with sleeping over but not moving in, maybe he's misapplying her standards. Cohabitation and regular sleepovers might be seen as similar in some contexts, but maybe not the same in her culture. He's pointing out the inconsistency, but is it his place to enforce her beliefs on her? \n\nAlso, communication is key here. If they've discussed moving in together and she's firm on her stance, maybe the author is reacting out of frustration. However, cutting off sleepovers as a punishment might be a harsh move. Relationships require mutual respect, and he's using her own beliefs to justify his actions, which might not be fair. \n\nHe might be in the right to express his feelings about the inconsistency, but threatening to stop sleepovers based on her standards could be seen as manipulative. The key is whether he's respecting her boundaries while advocating for his own. If she's comfortable with the current arrangement, even if he sees it as inconsistent, he might be overstepping by changing the terms. \n\nSo, the answer might be that he's in the wrong because he's using her beliefs to justify a change in the relationship dynamics without mutual agreement. It's about respecting her autonomy while discussing differences.\n"
