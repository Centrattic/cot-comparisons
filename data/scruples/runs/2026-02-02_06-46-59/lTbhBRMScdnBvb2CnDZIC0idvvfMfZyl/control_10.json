We work at the same company and live pretty close to each other. We're not in a rush to get married but with how much she is sleeping over at my place, it makes sense to move to a place together. She sleeps over so much because she says she likes spending time with me. \n\nWe've been talking about it and recently she said she decided she doesn't want to move in together any time soon, until we are married, because she says it is trashy and improper and frowned upon (Christian community). I think that's pretty judgemental, and interesting considering how often she sleeps over and how much sex we've been having before marriage. I'm getting tired of these double standards. WIBTA if I told her she can't sleep over any more because that's trashy and improper according to her own criteria? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The author is in a relationship with his girlfriend, and she's been staying over at his place multiple times a week. They work together and live nearby. They're not rushing into marriage, but the author feels that moving in together would make sense given how often she stays over. However, she's decided not to move in together until marriage because of her Christian beliefs, calling it \"trashy and improper.\" The author finds this judgmental, especially since he sees their current arrangement (sleeping over, having sex) as conflicting with her values. He's considering cutting off the sleepovers using her own standards.\n\nFirst, I need to assess if the author would be in the wrong if he told her she can't sleep over anymore using her criteria. The key points here are mutual respect, consistency in values, and communication. The girlfriend's stance is based on religious beliefs, which she's vocal about. The author is pointing out a contradiction in her actions versus her beliefs. However, does that give him the right to impose his interpretation of her values on her actions?\n\nThe situation involves both personal boundaries and relationship dynamics. If the author's rationale is to hold her to her own stated standards, but in a way that might not have been discussed or agreed upon by both parties, he might be overstepping. Relationships require mutual agreement on terms and boundaries. If the girlfriend hasn't explicitly agreed that sleeping over is against her beliefs in the current context, then the author might be unilaterally changing the rules based on her past statements.\n\nAlso, the author's motivation is important. Is he trying to enforce her values on her, or is he highlighting inconsistencies? If he's using her own words against her without considering the nuances of her beliefs, it could be seen as manipulative or hypocritical. For example, she might believe that moving in together is improper, but sleeping over at his place is part of their relationship and they both agree on it. The author is now using her argument to limit her autonomy, which could be a breach of trust and mutual respect.\n\nIn terms of right and wrong, the author is in a position where he's choosing to act on her values in a way that affects their relationship dynamics without her consent. Even if he perceives hypocrisy, enforcing her standards on her might not be fair unless they've mutually agreed on those terms. The girlfriend has the right to her beliefs, but so does the author to his boundaries. However, changing the agreement without discussion could lead to resentment. The core issue here is about consistency and communication in the relationship. Since the author is using her own moral standards to impose restrictions, it's a matter of whether that's a valid approach. Given that she hasn't applied those standards to her current behavior, the author's action might be seen as taking her words out of context, thus making him the one in the wrong.\n"
