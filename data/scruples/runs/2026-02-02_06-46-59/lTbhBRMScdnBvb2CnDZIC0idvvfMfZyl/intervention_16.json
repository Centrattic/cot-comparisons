She sleeps over so much because she says she likes spending time with me. \n\nWe've been talking about it and recently she said she decided she doesn't want to move in together any time soon, until we are married, because she says it is trashy and improper and frowned upon (Christian community). I think that's pretty judgemental, and interesting considering how often she sleeps over and how much sex we've been having before marriage. I'm getting tired of these double standards.

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the question (the author) is in the wrong. The situation involves the author wanting to tell their girlfriend she can't sleep over anymore because she's against moving in together before marriage, even though they already do so frequently.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the context. The couple has been dating a few years, she stays over 4+ nights a week, they work together and live close. She doesn't want to move in together until marriage due to her Christian values, considering it improper. The author is frustrated by the double standard, as they're already cohabiting in a sense (sleeping over, having sex) but she won't commit to moving in together. The author is considering using her own standards to stop her from staying over, which seems like a tit-for-tat approach.\n\nThe key points here are about consent, mutual respect, and communication. The author is contemplating retaliating based on the girlfriend's own moral standards. But is that fair? If the girlfriend is the one who has set boundaries about moving in, but also engages in other behaviors that the author sees as conflicting, the author might be pointing out hypocrisy. However, using her rules against her to cut off sleepovers could be seen as manipulative or not addressing the real issue.\n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong. If the author is using her own stated values to impose a restriction, that might be hypocritical. The girlfriend's stance on moving in is about her beliefs, but the author is now applying those beliefs to a different aspect of their relationship. Also, moving in together is a significant step, and if she's against it, the author might want to address why they're not on the same page. Instead of cutting off sleepovers, maybe a better approach would be to have an open conversation about their differing values and future plans.\n\nThe author's frustration is valid, but punishing the girlfriend by cutting off sleepovers based on her own standards could be seen as using her values against her, which might not be fair. The author should address the issue directly, perhaps discussing the inconsistency of sleeping over multiple nights without moving in together, but doing so respectfully rather than retaliating. So, the answer would likely be that the author is in the wrong because they're using a confrontational tactic that doesn't resolve the underlying communication issues.\n"
