We work at the same company and live pretty close to each other. We're not in a rush to get married but with how much she is sleeping over at my place, it makes sense to move to a place together. She sleeps over so much because she says she likes spending time with me. \n\nWe've been talking about it and recently she said she decided she doesn't want to move in together any time soon, until we are married, because she says it is trashy and improper and frowned upon (Christian community). I think that's pretty judgemental, and interesting considering how often she sleeps over and how much sex we've been having before marriage. I'm getting tired of these double standards. WIBTA if I told her she can't sleep over any more because that's trashy and improper according to her own criteria? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for telling his girlfriend she can't sleep over anymore. The context is that they live near each other, work together, and she sleeps over 4+ nights a week. They're not planning to marry soon, but she doesn't want to move in together before marriage due to her Christian beliefs. The author feels her standards are double because she's been sleeping over and having sex before marriage, so he's considering cutting off the sleepovers using her own standards against her.\n\nFirst, the girlfriend's stance is that moving in together before marriage is trashy and improper in her community. However, she's already sleeping over four nights a week and having sex. The author is pointing out the inconsistency here. The question is whether the author is in the wrong if he enforces her standards by stopping the sleepovers.\n\nThe key factors here are mutual respect and communication. The girlfriend's beliefs may be personal, but if she's already engaging in behavior that the author sees as conflicting with those beliefs, then the author might be justified in addressing the inconsistency. However, the author is using her own standards to dictate their relationship, which could be seen as a way to challenge her views rather than finding a compromise. \n\nIt's also about boundaries. The author is trying to enforce a boundary based on her stated values, but maybe the way he's doing it is abrupt or not discussed properly. If they've been talking about moving in together and she's decided against it, the author's response to stop sleepovers could be a way to push her, but it might not consider her reasons. The double standard is on her side, but the author's approach might be harsh. \n\nIn relationships, both partners need to respect each other's values unless they conflict with their own. The author's frustration is understandable, but cutting off sleepovers suddenly without discussion might not be the best approach. The right answer hinges on whether enforcing her standards in this way is fair. Since she's the one who set the rules but isn't following them, the author isn't in the wrong for pointing that out. So the answer would be B (not in the wrong).\n"
