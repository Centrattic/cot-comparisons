We work at the same company and live pretty close to each other. We're not in a rush to get married but with how much she is sleeping over at my place, it makes sense to move to a place together. She sleeps over so much because she says she likes spending time with me. \n\nWe've been talking about it and recently she said she decided she doesn't want to move in together any time soon, until we are married, because she says it is trashy and improper and frowned upon (Christian community). I think that's pretty judgemental, and interesting considering how often she sleeps over and how much sex we've been having before marriage. I'm getting tired of these double standards. WIBTA if I told her she can't sleep over any more because that's trashy and improper according to her own criteria? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if they're in the wrong for telling their girlfriend she can't sleep over anymore because she's been doing it a lot but doesn't want to move in together yet. The girlfriend says she likes spending time with them, but she's against moving in because of her Christian community's views on premarital cohabitation. The author is frustrated because they see a double standard since they're already having sex and she's often at their place.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The couple works together and lives close. The girlfriend's reasoning is based on her beliefs about cohabitation being improper. The author is suggesting cutting off sleepovers because she herself is against cohabiting before marriage. But the girlfriend is already staying over multiple nights a week and having sex, which the author is pointing out as a contradiction.\n\nIs the author justified in their reaction? They might feel that the girlfriend's stance is hypocritical. If she's against cohabitation but is already effectively living with the author by staying over so much, the author's decision to stop allowing sleepovers could be seen as holding her to her own standards. However, the author should consider communication and mutual respect. Maybe the girlfriend has her own reasons for not moving in yet, like personal readiness or family expectations, even if she's comfortable with other aspects of the relationship. \n\nThe author's approach of using her own beliefs against her might be seen as manipulative or punitive. Instead of cutting off sleepovers abruptly, discussing the inconsistency and seeking a compromise might be more constructive. Also, considering that they have been talking about moving in together, the author's sudden decision could be hurtful if it's not based on a mutual agreement. \n\nBut the question is whether the author is in the wrong. From a fairness perspective, if the girlfriend's beliefs lead to double standards, the author has a right to be upset. However, the method of responding could matter. If the author is using her own values to enforce a change in their relationship dynamics, that might be valid, but it's important to approach it with understanding and dialogue rather than unilateral decisions. \n\nIn relationships, double standards can be tricky. The author is pointing out a possible inconsistency, and their frustration is understandable. But stopping sleepovers might be a harsh reaction without first discussing the issue. The key here is whether the author is respecting the girlfriend's boundaries while also addressing their own needs. If the author is feeling that the girlfriend isn't being consistent, they have a right to express that. However, enforcing a rule based on her beliefs without mutual consent could be problematic. \n\nSo, the answer might depend on how the author is approaching this. If they're using it as a way to call out hypocrisy and set boundaries, maybe they're not in the wrong. But if it's a punitive measure without considering the girlfriend's perspective, it could be. Since the situation involves a double standard in the girlfriend's own actions, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong. But the way they handle it is crucial. The question is whether the author is in the wrong in this scenario. Given that the author is challenging the inconsistency, I might lean towards answer B (No), but the method of enforcement without dialogue could be an issue. However, the user isn't being asked about the method but whether the action (telling her to stop sleeping over) is in the wrong. Since the girlfriend's own behavior contradicts her stated beliefs, the author isn't necessarily wrong to point that out and adjust their actions.\n"
