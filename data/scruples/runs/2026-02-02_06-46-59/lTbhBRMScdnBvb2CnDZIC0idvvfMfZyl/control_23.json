We work at the same company and live pretty close to each other. We're not in a rush to get married but with how much she is sleeping over at my place, it makes sense to move to a place together. She sleeps over so much because she says she likes spending time with me. \n\nWe've been talking about it and recently she said she decided she doesn't want to move in together any time soon, until we are married, because she says it is trashy and improper and frowned upon (Christian community). I think that's pretty judgemental, and interesting considering how often she sleeps over and how much sex we've been having before marriage. I'm getting tired of these double standards. WIBTA if I told her she can't sleep over any more because that's trashy and improper according to her own criteria? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author (the person writing the question) is in the wrong for wanting to tell their girlfriend she can't sleep over anymore. The context is that they're in a Christian community, and the girlfriend doesn't want to move in together until marriage. But she's been sleeping over 4+ nights a week, which the author finds hypocritical.\n\nFirst, the key points here are the girlfriend's stance against cohabitation before marriage and the author's frustration with her double standards. The author is considering using her own moral standards against her by cutting off the sleepovers, which he sees as equally improper. \n\nThe question is whether the author is wrong to do that. Let's consider the implications. The girlfriend is against cohabitation until marriage, but she's already sleeping over multiple nights a week. The author is pointing out the inconsistency. However, by cutting off sleepovers, he's taking a stand based on her own values. But is that fair?\n\nOn one hand, the author is holding her to her own standards. If she considers cohabitation (even if it's not living together but sleeping over) as improper, then the author is applying that logic to their current situation. On the other hand, the girlfriend's actions (sleeping over) and her stated beliefs (against cohabitation) are conflicting. The author's response is a consequence of her inconsistency.\n\nBut is it right for the author to enforce her standards on her? The author is using her own criteria to limit her behavior. However, this could be seen as a manipulation tactic, using her beliefs against her. The author's frustration is understandable, but punishing her by cutting off sleepovers might not be the healthiest approach. It could lead to resentment or further conflict.\n\nAlso, relationships require compromise. The author might be trying to get her to reconsider her stance by withdrawing something she values (sleepovers). But this could be seen as coercion. The girlfriend's unwillingness to move in together might stem from her beliefs, and the author's response might not address the root of the issue but instead escalate the conflict.\n\nIn terms of right or wrong, the author is pointing out hypocrisy, which is fair, but the method of addressing it (cutting off sleepovers) could be problematic. The author is not necessarily in the wrong for wanting to enforce consistency, but the approach might be. The girlfriend's stance is based on her beliefs, but the author is using those same beliefs to argue against her actions. There's a mix of moral judgment here. \n\nHowever, the author's action of stopping sleepovers is a form of punishment based on her standards. If the relationship is to be healthy, both parties need to communicate and find a middle ground. The author's approach might be seen as taking her words out of context or using them as leverage. So, the answer might lean towards the author being in the wrong because the method of enforcing her standards is confrontational and could harm the relationship.\n"
