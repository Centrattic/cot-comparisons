With prom coming up soon, we sat down to talk about our plans. Well, at work the other day, the subject of prom came up at work too. I started to talk to my friend (20 F) about it. It turns out that she never got to go to her prom because she was in the hospital. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWell, this friend is pretty important to me. When I started my job almost a year and a half ago, I lacked almost any social skills. This friend was the first person to really talk to me and treat me like a friend. She helped me through one of the most trying times of my life, as I also had severe social anxiety prior to starting this job. While my friend probably doesn't know this, my progress to having the social skills I do now is largely in part to her. I see this as an opportunity to give back to her for helping me.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy girlfriend is opposed to me wanting to take her with us because she says that this should be our special night, and she wants me to herself. I hold the position that I want to take her due to the aforementioned reasons. So what do you guys think? AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for wanting to bring another girl to prom with his girlfriend. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the situation: The author is 17, his girlfriend is 18, they've been dating almost a year. The author wants to bring his female friend, who missed her prom due to hospitalization, to the prom as a trio. The girlfriend is upset because she wants it to be their special night.\n\nSo, the main question is about the author's intentions and whether they're in the wrong. The author argues that his friend helped him a lot with social skills and he wants to give back. The girlfriend feels it's their special time. \n\nI need to consider relationship dynamics here. Prom is traditionally a couple's event, so bringing a third person might be seen as disrespectful or inconsiderate. The girlfriend's perspective is valid because she might feel her partner is prioritizing someone else over her. \n\nThe author's reasoning is about gratitude and helping a friend, but relationships often require balancing personal connections with the partner's needs. Even if the friend is important, the girlfriend's feelings matter. The key is whether the author considered his girlfriend's feelings first. \n\nI think the author didn't communicate well. He should have discussed the idea with his girlfriend before bringing it up at work. Also, bringing a third person to a couple's event can be problematic. Even if the intent is good, the impact on the girlfriend is significant. So, the author is in the wrong because he didn't prioritize his girlfriend's feelings and misread the nature of the event. Answer A.\n"
