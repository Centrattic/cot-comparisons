With prom coming up soon, we sat down to talk about our plans. Well, at work the other day, the subject of prom came up at work too. I started to talk to my friend (20 F) about it. It turns out that she never got to go to her prom because she was in the hospital. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWell, this friend is pretty important to me. When I started my job almost a year and a half ago, I lacked almost any social skills. This friend was the first person to really talk to me and treat me like a friend. She helped me through one of the most trying times of my life, as I also had severe social anxiety prior to starting this job. While my friend probably doesn't know this, my progress to having the social skills I do now is largely in part to her. I see this as an opportunity to give back to her for helping me.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy girlfriend is opposed to me wanting to take her with us because she says that this should be our special night, and she wants me to herself. I hold the position that I want to take her due to the aforementioned reasons. So what do you guys think? AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let me try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong for wanting to bring another girl to prom with his girlfriend. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The person is in a relationship with their girlfriend, and they want to invite their female friend to prom with them. The girlfriend is against it because she considers prom a special night for just the two of them. The friend, on the other hand, missed her prom due to being hospitalized, and the author feels a sense of gratitude because the friend helped them with social skills and overcoming anxiety.\n\nSo, the key points here are the girlfriend's perspective versus the author's reasons. The girlfriend wants the night to be exclusive to them, which is a valid concern. Prom is often seen as a significant event for couples, and having another person might make her feel like her partner isn't fully committed to her on that night. \n\nOn the other hand, the author has valid reasons too. The friend played a crucial role in their personal growth, and taking her to prom could be a way to honor that. The author isn't trying to replace or undermine the girlfriend but is looking to include someone who's important to them. However, the way the request is made might affect how it's received. The girlfriend might feel neglected or not a priority, which is a common issue in relationships when one partner wants to include others in important events.\n\nAnother angle is communication. The author mentioned talking to their friend at work, which led to the idea. It's possible that they didn't discuss this with their girlfriend beforehand, leading to the conflict. The girlfriend's opposition suggests that this was a surprise, which might not have been the best approach. In relationships, involving a partner in plans, especially major events like prom, is important for mutual understanding and respect.\n\nThe concept of \"being in the wrong\" here hinges on whether the author's actions are disrespectful to their girlfriend's feelings. While the author has good intentions, the girlfriend's feelings about the exclusivity of the event are equally valid. The author might need to find a compromise, like attending the prom with the friend separately or finding another way to celebrate the friend's prom experience without involving their girlfriend. However, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. If the girlfriend clearly opposes it and the author proceeds, that could be considered inconsiderate. But if the author is trying to find a respectful solution, maybe not. \n\nIn many cases, relationship advice emphasizes considering the partner's feelings and making them feel special. If the girlfriend is uncomfortable, the author might need to prioritize her feelings unless there's a way to include both parties without causing hurt. Since the author hasn't resolved the conflict yet, the situation is still open, but their initial desire to include the friend without the girlfriend's consent might be seen as inconsiderate. \n\nSo, based on the girlfriend's valid emotional needs and the potential for the author's actions to cause hurt, even with good intentions, the author might be in the wrong. However, there's also the aspect of the friend's situation. But since the conflict is between the author and the girlfriend, the answer leans towards AITA being the author.\n"
