With prom coming up soon, we sat down to talk about our plans. Well, at work the other day, the subject of prom came up at work too. I started to talk to my friend (20 F) about it. It turns out that she never got to go to her prom because she was in the hospital. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWell, this friend is pretty important to me. When I started my job almost a year and a half ago, I lacked almost any social skills. This friend was the first person to really talk to me and treat me like a friend. She helped me through one of the most trying times of my life, as I also had severe social anxiety prior to starting this job. While my friend probably doesn't know this, my progress to having the social skills I do now is largely in part to her. I see this as an opportunity to give back to her for helping me.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy girlfriend is opposed to me wanting to take her with us because she says that this should be our special night, and she wants me to herself. I hold the position that I want to take her due to the aforementioned reasons. So what do you guys think? AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for wanting to bring another girl to prom with his girlfriend. So the situation is that the author (17M) has been dating his girlfriend (18F) for almost a year. They're planning prom, but he wants to bring his friend (20F) because she missed her prom due to being in the hospital. The friend helped him a lot when he had social anxiety and lack of social skills. The girlfriend is upset because she wants the night to be special for just the two of them.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The author feels that inviting his friend is a way to thank her for her support. He's been helped by her, so he wants to give back. On the other hand, the girlfriend's perspective is that prom is a special night for the two of them, and she wants exclusivity. \n\nI should think about typical prom expectations. Prom is often seen as a couple's event, usually a private celebration. So bringing another person might disrupt that. However, the author's reasoning is about gratitude and reciprocity. The friend didn't have a prom experience, and this could be a way to make up for that. \n\nBut there's a potential issue here. The girlfriend might feel that her wishes are being overlooked. The author didn't consult her before making this decision. Even if there's a good reason, the girlfriend's feelings about the event being their special time are valid. The author might be prioritizing his friend's needs over his partner's expectations without considering her feelings. \n\nAnother angle: the author's actions could be seen as not respecting the girlfriend's boundaries. She might feel that he's not considering her perspective, which could lead to hurt feelings. The friend's situation is unfortunate, but prom is a personal event for the couple. The author should communicate better with his girlfriend to find a compromise, maybe having a different way to include his friend or making up for this later.\n\nAlso, cultural norms come into play. Prom is traditionally a couple's event, so bringing someone else might be unexpected and could make the girlfriend feel less valued. The author might not have considered that his girlfriend's feelings about exclusivity are important. \n\nIn terms of responsibility, the author started planning without discussing it with his girlfriend. He should have discussed the idea with her first to understand her feelings before forming his own opinion. Now, he's in a situation where he has to choose between his friend's gratitude and his girlfriend's expectations. \n\nThe key points are: Was the author wrong in not considering his girlfriend's feelings first? Or was he justified in wanting to give back to someone who helped him? \n\nI think the main issue here is communication. The author's intentions are good, but he didn't check in with his girlfriend first. The girlfriend's desire for the night to be special is valid. So, while the author's reasons are understandable, he might be in the wrong for not prioritizing his girlfriend's feelings. Therefore, the answer would be A (Yes, the author is in the wrong) because he didn't consider his partner's perspective and the traditional expectations of prom as a couple's event.\n"
