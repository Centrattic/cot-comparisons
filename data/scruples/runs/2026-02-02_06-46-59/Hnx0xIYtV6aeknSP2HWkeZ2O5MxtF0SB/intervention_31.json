With prom coming up soon, we sat down to talk about our plans. Well, at work the other day, the subject of prom came up at work too. I started to talk to my friend (20 F) about it. It turns out that she never got to go to her prom because she was in the hospital. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWell, this friend is pretty important to me. When I started my job almost a year and a half ago, I lacked almost any social skills. This friend was the first person to really talk to me and treat me like a friend. She helped me through one of the most trying times of my life, as I also had severe social anxiety prior to starting this job. While my friend probably doesn't know this, my progress to having the social skills I do now is largely in part to her. I see this as an opportunity to give back to her for helping me.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy girlfriend is opposed to me wanting to take her with us because she says that this should be our special night, and she wants me to herself. I hold the position that I want to take her due to the aforementioned reasons. So what do you guys think? AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for wanting to bring another girl to prom with his girlfriend. The situation is that the author and his girlfriend have been dating almost a year, and he wants to include his friend who missed prom due to hospitalization. The girlfriend is upset because she thinks it's their special night.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics of the relationship. The girlfriend is 18, the author is 17. Prom is a significant event for high schoolers, often seen as a couple's night. The girlfriend's perspective is about wanting it to be just the two of them. She might feel neglected or not prioritized if another person is brought in. \n\nOn the other hand, the author's reasoning is about gratitude and giving back to a friend who helped him. His friend has a legitimate reason for missing prom, and he feels a connection to her. But bringing her along might make the girlfriend feel like she's not the main focus of the evening. \n\nI should think about consent and communication. The author didn't consult his girlfriend before making the plan with his friend. Communication is key in relationships, so maybe they need to discuss it more. However, the girlfriend's feelings are valid here. Prom is a personal event, and having a third person might interfere with the intimacy the couple expects. \n\nAlso, cultural norms come into play. In many places, prom is for couples, and bringing someone else might be seen as unusual or disrespectful to the girlfriend. The author's intention is noble, but the impact on his girlfriend's feelings is important. \n\nI need to balance the moral obligation to help a friend versus respecting the girlfriend's wishes. The author's friend's story is sad, but the girlfriend has a right to expect that the prom night is about their relationship. \n\nSo, the author might be in the wrong because he didn't consider his girlfriend's feelings sufficiently and didn't communicate properly. His actions could be seen as prioritizing his friend's needs over the girlfriend's expectations for their special event. However, there's a valid point about the friend's situation. But in terms of relationship dynamics, the girlfriend's perspective is more about the couple's time together. \n\nTherefore, the answer is likely A (the author is in the wrong) because including another person without considering the girlfriend's feelings and expectations for their special night might be seen as selfish, even if the intention was good.\n"
