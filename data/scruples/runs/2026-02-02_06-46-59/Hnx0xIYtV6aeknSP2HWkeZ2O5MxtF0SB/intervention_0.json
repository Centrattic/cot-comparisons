With prom coming up soon, we sat down to talk about our plans. Well, at work the other day, the subject of prom came up at work too. I started to talk to my friend (20 F) about it. It turns out that she never got to go to her prom because she was in the hospital. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWell, this friend is pretty important to me. When I started my job almost a year and a half ago, I lacked almost any social skills. This friend was the first person to really talk to me and treat me like a friend. She helped me through one of the most trying times of my life, as I also had severe social anxiety prior to starting this job. While my friend probably doesn't know this, my progress to having the social skills I do now is largely in part to her. I see this as an opportunity to give back to her for helping me.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy girlfriend is opposed to me wanting to take her with us because she says that this should be our special night, and she wants me to herself. I hold the position that I want to take her due to the aforementioned reasons. So what do you guys think? AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author (a guy who wants to bring another girl to prom with his girlfriend) is in the wrong. The girlfriend is against it because she wants it to be their special night. The author's reasoning is that his friend missed out on prom due to hospitalization and helped him develop social skills.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the relationship dynamics. Prom is typically seen as a romantic event between a couple. Bringing a third person might make the girlfriend feel less prioritized. She's valid in wanting the night to be about them. \n\nOn the other hand, the author's friend is important to him and helped him socially. He feels a duty to include her. But does that override the girlfriend's feelings? The key here is mutual respect and communication. The author should have discussed this with his girlfriend earlier. Since she's already opposed, he needs to consider her perspective. \n\nIs it about the number of people or the intent? The author's intent is to thank his friend, but the girlfriend's desire for a romantic night is also valid. The author's actions might be seen as neglecting his girlfriend's feelings. Prom is a once-in-a-lifetime event for many, so prioritizing the girlfriend's wishes makes sense. \n\nHowever, maybe there's a middle ground, like the friend joining earlier or later, but the author wants her to come along. The girlfriend might feel like she's not the main focus. The author's justification is heartfelt, but relationships require compromise. \n\nIn most cases, the girlfriend's feelings would take precedence here. The author's actions could be seen as inconsiderate of her needs. So, the answer is likely A (author is in the wrong).\n"
