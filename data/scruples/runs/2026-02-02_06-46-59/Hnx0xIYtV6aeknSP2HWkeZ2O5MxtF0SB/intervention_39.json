With prom coming up soon, we sat down to talk about our plans. Well, at work the other day, the subject of prom came up at work too. I started to talk to my friend (20 F) about it. It turns out that she never got to go to her prom because she was in the hospital. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWell, this friend is pretty important to me. When I started my job almost a year and a half ago, I lacked almost any social skills. This friend was the first person to really talk to me and treat me like a friend. She helped me through one of the most trying times of my life, as I also had severe social anxiety prior to starting this job. While my friend probably doesn't know this, my progress to having the social skills I do now is largely in part to her. I see this as an opportunity to give back to her for helping me.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy girlfriend is opposed to me wanting to take her with us because she says that this should be our special night, and she wants me to herself. I hold the position that I want to take her due to the aforementioned reasons. So what do you guys think? AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong for wanting to bring another girl to prom with his girlfriend. Let me start by breaking down the situation. \n\nFirst, the user is a guy (17 M) who's been dating his girlfriend for almost a year. They're planning prom, and he wants to bring his friend (20 F) because she missed her prom due to being in the hospital. This friend helped him a lot when he started his job, improving his social skills and dealing with anxiety. His girlfriend is upset because she wants prom to be their special night, not a group event.\n\nHmm, the question is whether he's in the wrong. Let's consider both sides. On one hand, the girlfriend's perspective: prom is a significant event she expected to be just the two of them. Bringing another person might make her feel like she's not a priority, or that the date isn't exclusive. Trust and comfort in the relationship could be at stake here. If he's bringing his friend, maybe she's worried about other people's attention or how it might affect their dynamic.\n\nOn the other hand, the author feels he's doing something kind for his friend who helped him. He values her friendship a lot and wants to give back. He might see this as a way to honor her, not as a betrayal. But is that a valid reason?\n\nI need to think about social norms. Prom is typically a date between two people. Inviting a third person, even a friend, could be seen as undermining the girlfriend's expectations. The girlfriend's feelings are valid here. If he doesn't consider her feelings and insists on bringing the friend despite her objections, that could be seen as inconsiderate or even selfish. \n\nBut maybe the author is in a position where he's trying to do good by his friend. However, relationships require balancing different aspects. The girlfriend's need for a special, private night might take precedence over the friend's past experiences. The author should have considered how this would affect his girlfriend before making the suggestion. \n\nAlso, the girlfriend's perspective is important. She might feel neglected or that her partner isn't prioritizing their relationship. If the author insists, it could lead to hurt feelings or mistrust. The friend's situation is unfortunate, but prom is a current event, while the friend's missed prom is in the past. The author could find another way to show gratitude, maybe a separate gesture, rather than including her in a date night.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the author's intention is good, but the action might be inconsiderate to his girlfriend's feelings. The answer would likely be A (the author is in the wrong) because he's disregarding his girlfriend's wishes for their special night, even with good intentions.\n"
