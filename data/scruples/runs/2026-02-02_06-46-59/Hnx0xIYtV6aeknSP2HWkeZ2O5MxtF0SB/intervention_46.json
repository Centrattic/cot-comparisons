With prom coming up soon, we sat down to talk about our plans. Well, at work the other day, the subject of prom came up at work too. I started to talk to my friend (20 F) about it. It turns out that she never got to go to her prom because she was in the hospital. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWell, this friend is pretty important to me. When I started my job almost a year and a half ago, I lacked almost any social skills. This friend was the first person to really talk to me and treat me like a friend. She helped me through one of the most trying times of my life, as I also had severe social anxiety prior to starting this job. While my friend probably doesn't know this, my progress to having the social skills I do now is largely in part to her. I see this as an opportunity to give back to her for helping me.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy girlfriend is opposed to me wanting to take her with us because she says that this should be our special night, and she wants me to herself. I hold the position that I want to take her due to the aforementioned reasons. So what do you guys think? AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for wanting to bring another girl to prom with his girlfriend. The situation is that the author and his girlfriend have been dating almost a year. The author's friend, who is a girl, never went to prom because she was in the hospital. The friend helped him a lot with social skills and overcoming anxiety. He wants to take her along as a way to give back.\n\nSo, the girlfriend is upset because she wants it to be their special night. The question is whether the author is in the wrong.\n\nHmm. First, I need to consider the dynamics here. The main parties are the author, his girlfriend, and the female friend. The author's intention is noble\u2014he wants to include someone who helped him and who missed out on prom. But the girlfriend might feel that prom is a traditional couples' event and feels left out if another person is brought in.\n\nI think the key points here are communication and the girlfriend's feelings. The author's reasoning is about gratitude and repayment, but the girlfriend's perspective is about the significance of prom as a couple's event. The author might be overlooking her feelings, even if his intentions are good. \n\nIn relationships, considering the partner's feelings is important. Even if the author's actions are well-meaning, not taking the girlfriend's perspective into account could be seen as inconsiderate. The girlfriend might feel that the author is prioritizing his friend over their relationship, even if that's not the intention.\n\nOn the other hand, the author is trying to do something kind for a friend who supported him. But bringing someone to a traditionally intimate event like prom can create tension. The author might need to find another way to honor his friend without compromising the girlfriend's expectations. Maybe suggest an alternative, like a separate celebration for the friend, but not include her in the prom date.\n\nThe answer might be A (author is in the wrong) because the girlfriend's feelings are valid, and the author didn't consider how she might feel about including another person in their special night. Even with good intentions, not considering the partner's perspective can lead to the wrong in the situation.\n"
