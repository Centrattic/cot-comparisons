With prom coming up soon, we sat down to talk about our plans. Well, at work the other day, the subject of prom came up at work too. I started to talk to my friend (20 F) about it. It turns out that she never got to go to her prom because she was in the hospital. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWell, this friend is pretty important to me. When I started my job almost a year and a half ago, I lacked almost any social skills. This friend was the first person to really talk to me and treat me like a friend. She helped me through one of the most trying times of my life, as I also had severe social anxiety prior to starting this job. While my friend probably doesn't know this, my progress to having the social skills I do now is largely in part to her. I see this as an opportunity to give back to her for helping me.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy girlfriend is opposed to me wanting to take her with us because she says that this should be our special night, and she wants me to herself. I hold the position that I want to take her due to the aforementioned reasons. So what do you guys think? AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the question is in the wrong. The situation is about wanting to bring another girl to prom with his girlfriend. Let me break down the details.\n\nThe guy is 17, his girlfriend is 18, and they've been dating almost a year. The friend in question is 20 and a close friend. The friend missed her prom due to hospitalization, and the author wants to include her as a way to give back. The girlfriend is upset because she wants the night to be special just for them.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the girlfriend's perspective. Prom is a significant event for many high school students, often seen as a special, intimate night. The girlfriend might feel that having another person there would detract from that experience. Trust and mutual respect are crucial in a relationship. The girlfriend's feelings about her partner spending the night with another girl could be hurt or neglected.\n\nOn the other hand, the author's intention is to thank a friend who helped him a lot. He values this friendship highly and sees this as a way to reciprocate the support he received. His friend didn't get to go to prom, so he wants to include her. The question is whether this is a valid reason that justifies going against his girlfriend's wishes.\n\nNow, thinking about relationship dynamics. Communication is key here. The author might have discussed this with his girlfriend, but if the girlfriend is clearly against it, the author needs to consider her feelings. Even if the intention is good, the action could be seen as disregarding his girlfriend's needs. The girlfriend's opposition is about wanting their special night, which is a valid concern.\n\nAnother angle: in relationships, partners often have expectations about exclusivity, especially in important events. Bringing another girl might be perceived as not prioritizing the girlfriend's feelings. The author's justification is based on gratitude towards a friend, but relationships also require balancing personal relationships with the partner's needs.\n\nIs there a middle ground? Maybe the author could have found another way to celebrate with his friend without involving the prom. For example, a separate event or just a heartfelt gesture. The fact that the friend didn't go to prom could be acknowledged in another manner.\n\nAlso, the age difference might play a role. The friend is 20, which is legal, but the girlfriend is 18. The author is 17. The age aspect might not be the main issue here, but it's worth noting that the friend is an adult, which could influence perceptions.\n\nIn terms of right or wrong, the author's actions might be seen as inconsiderate of his girlfriend's feelings. Even if his intent is noble, he's not considering her perspective. The girlfriend's feelings are valid, and the author should prioritize her needs in this situation. The friendship is important, but the romantic relationship's expectations need to be respected.\n\nSo, considering all angles, the author is in the wrong (A) because he's not respecting his girlfriend's wishes for their special night, even though his intentions are good. The answer would be A.\n"
