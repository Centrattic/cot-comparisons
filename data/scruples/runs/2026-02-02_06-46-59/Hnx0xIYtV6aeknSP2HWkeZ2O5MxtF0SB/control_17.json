With prom coming up soon, we sat down to talk about our plans. Well, at work the other day, the subject of prom came up at work too. I started to talk to my friend (20 F) about it. It turns out that she never got to go to her prom because she was in the hospital. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWell, this friend is pretty important to me. When I started my job almost a year and a half ago, I lacked almost any social skills. This friend was the first person to really talk to me and treat me like a friend. She helped me through one of the most trying times of my life, as I also had severe social anxiety prior to starting this job. While my friend probably doesn't know this, my progress to having the social skills I do now is largely in part to her. I see this as an opportunity to give back to her for helping me.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy girlfriend is opposed to me wanting to take her with us because she says that this should be our special night, and she wants me to herself. I hold the position that I want to take her due to the aforementioned reasons. So what do you guys think? AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the question is in the wrong for wanting to bring another girl to prom with his girlfriend. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The guy is 17, his girlfriend is 18, and they've been dating almost a year. He wants to take his friend, a girl who never went to prom and helped him a lot, to the prom with them. His girlfriend is upset because she wants it to be their special night.\n\nHmm. So the main issue is whether inviting a third person is appropriate. The guy's reasoning is that his friend helped him a lot, especially with social anxiety, and he wants to honor that. But the girlfriend feels it's supposed to be their night.\n\nI should consider both perspectives. From the guy's side, promoting gratitude and acknowledging someone who supported him is positive. But from the girlfriend's perspective, she might feel neglected or that her feelings aren't being prioritized. Relationships often require compromise. \n\nIs there a standard expectation about prom? Typically, prom is a couple's event. Bringing a third person could disrupt that dynamic. The girlfriend's feelings are valid because she might see it as a breach of their special time together. \n\nBut the guy is also trying to do something kind for a friend. However, in a relationship, certain decisions can affect the partner's comfort and expectations. The key here is communication. Did they discuss this before, or was it a last-minute decision? The girlfriend was opposed when the idea came up, so maybe the guy didn't consider her feelings enough beforehand.\n\nAlso, the friend's perspective isn't mentioned. Is the friend okay with being a third wheel? If she's not, that's another problem. But the question is about the guy being in the wrong in the relationship context.\n\nUltimately, even if the guy's intentions are good, the action might be inconsiderate to his girlfriend's feelings. The girlfriend has the right to expect that certain events are couple-focused. So the answer might lean towards AITA being the guy, hence he's in the wrong. But maybe it's a nuanced situation.\n\nWait, but he mentions he was helped by the friend, so is that a valid reason? Maybe, but relationships require mutual respect. If he didn't check with his girlfriend first, that's a problem. The girlfriend's reaction is a sign that she values the couple's time. So, the answer might be A (he is in the wrong) because he didn't prioritize his girlfriend's feelings enough. But maybe it's not entirely wrong. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, some might argue that it's not his fault because he's also trying to do something good. However, the core of the issue is how his action affects the relationship. If the girlfriend is upset, he needs to address that. The right approach would be to find a compromise, like inviting the friend to a different event, but since he's already set on prom, he's causing conflict. Therefore, the answer is AITA. So, answer A.\n"
