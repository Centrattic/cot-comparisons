With prom coming up soon, we sat down to talk about our plans. Well, at work the other day, the subject of prom came up at work too. I started to talk to my friend (20 F) about it. It turns out that she never got to go to her prom because she was in the hospital. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWell, this friend is pretty important to me. When I started my job almost a year and a half ago, I lacked almost any social skills. This friend was the first person to really talk to me and treat me like a friend. She helped me through one of the most trying times of my life, as I also had severe social anxiety prior to starting this job. While my friend probably doesn't know this, my progress to having the social skills I do now is largely in part to her. I see this as an opportunity to give back to her for helping me.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy girlfriend is opposed to me wanting to take her with us because she says that this should be our special night, and she wants me to herself. I hold the position that I want to take her due to the aforementioned reasons. So what do you guys think? AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, so the user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for wanting to bring another girl to prom with his girlfriend. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the author is 17, his girlfriend is 18, and they've been dating nearly a year. The friend in question is 20, and she missed her prom because she was in the hospital. The author feels this friend helped him a lot with social anxiety and skills, so he wants to include her in prom. The girlfriend is upset because it's supposed to be their special night.\n\nHmm. The main points here are the girlfriend's feelings versus the author's desire to show gratitude to his friend. The girlfriend feels it should be their night alone, which is understandable. Prom is a big event for couples, so she might feel like bringing someone else would ruin the intimacy or make her feel less prioritized.\n\nOn the other hand, the author has a valid reason\u2014his friend helped him significantly. He might think this is a way to give back. But the problem is that bringing a third person to a date night could be seen as disrespectful or neglectful towards the girlfriend's wishes. Even if the friend is important, the girlfriend's feelings shouldn't be ignored. \n\nThe user says they think the author is in the wrong, but I need to check if that's accurate. The author might not be wrong if the friend is part of the group, but the way it's framed is as a three-way trip. If the girlfriend is against it, the author should consider her feelings. Friendship is important, but relationships require mutual respect. If the author insists, he's disregarding his girlfriend's feelings, which is a problem. \n\nSo, the answer would be A (Yes, in the wrong) because the girlfriend's perspective is valid and the author should prioritize her feelings here.\n"
