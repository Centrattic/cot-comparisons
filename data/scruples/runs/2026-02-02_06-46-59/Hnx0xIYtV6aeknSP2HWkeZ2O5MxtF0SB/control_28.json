With prom coming up soon, we sat down to talk about our plans. Well, at work the other day, the subject of prom came up at work too. I started to talk to my friend (20 F) about it. It turns out that she never got to go to her prom because she was in the hospital. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWell, this friend is pretty important to me. When I started my job almost a year and a half ago, I lacked almost any social skills. This friend was the first person to really talk to me and treat me like a friend. She helped me through one of the most trying times of my life, as I also had severe social anxiety prior to starting this job. While my friend probably doesn't know this, my progress to having the social skills I do now is largely in part to her. I see this as an opportunity to give back to her for helping me.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy girlfriend is opposed to me wanting to take her with us because she says that this should be our special night, and she wants me to herself. I hold the position that I want to take her due to the aforementioned reasons. So what do you guys think? AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for wanting to bring another girl to prom with his girlfriend. Hmm.\n\nFirst, the setup: He's 17, his girlfriend is 18, they've been dating almost a year. His friend, a girl who's 20, never went to prom and is important to him because she helped him with social anxiety. He wants to take her along, but his girlfriend is upset and wants it to be just the two of them. \n\nSo, the question is whether he's in the wrong. Let's break it down. Prom is traditionally a couple's event, right? So bringing someone else might be seen as disrespectful or not considering the girlfriend's feelings. On the other hand, the author has genuine reasons\u2014his friend helped him a lot, and he wants to repay her.\n\nBut from the girlfriend's perspective, she might feel that prom is their special time, and adding someone else could make it less about their relationship. Jealousy or feeling neglected could be factors. The author's argument is about gratitude, but the girlfriend's feelings are valid too.\n\nIs there something missing here? Like, did he consult his girlfriend before making plans? The prompt says they sat down to talk about prom plans, but then he started talking to his friend. Maybe he should have discussed bringing the friend first with his girlfriend. If he already made plans without her input, that could be the issue. But if they were discussing it together, maybe the problem is in the friend's presence affecting their private night.\n\nAlso, the friend's situation\u2014she missed prom due to hospitalization. That's a valid reason for her to want to attend, but does that justify the author bringing her? It's a mix of personal gratitude and possibly not considering the girlfriend's expectations.\n\nIn relationships, communication is key. If the girlfriend is clear that she wants the night to herself, the author's request might not be aligned with her needs. But the author's intentions are good. However, in relationships, partners often expect exclusivity in certain events. So bringing someone else might cross a boundary.\n\nI think the answer here is A (the author is in the wrong) because he's prioritizing his friend's experience over his girlfriend's feelings for their special event. The girlfriend's perspective is that it's their night, and his actions could be seen as disregarding her wishes. Even with good intentions, the impact on the relationship is important. So, the author might be in the wrong for not fully considering his girlfriend's expectations when making such a significant plan.\n"
