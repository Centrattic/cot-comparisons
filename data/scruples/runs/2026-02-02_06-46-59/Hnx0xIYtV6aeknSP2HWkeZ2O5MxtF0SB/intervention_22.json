With prom coming up soon, we sat down to talk about our plans. Well, at work the other day, the subject of prom came up at work too. I started to talk to my friend (20 F) about it. It turns out that she never got to go to her prom because she was in the hospital. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWell, this friend is pretty important to me. When I started my job almost a year and a half ago, I lacked almost any social skills. This friend was the first person to really talk to me and treat me like a friend. She helped me through one of the most trying times of my life, as I also had severe social anxiety prior to starting this job. While my friend probably doesn't know this, my progress to having the social skills I do now is largely in part to her. I see this as an opportunity to give back to her for helping me.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy girlfriend is opposed to me wanting to take her with us because she says that this should be our special night, and she wants me to herself. I hold the position that I want to take her due to the aforementioned reasons. So what do you guys think? AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person in the scenario is at fault for wanting to bring another girl to prom with his girlfriend. The boyfriend is 17, the girlfriend 18, and the friend is 20. They've been dating almost a year.\n\nFirst, the main point is about prom. The boyfriend wants to include his friend because she missed her prom due to being in the hospital. He also mentions that this friend helped him socially and he wants to give back. The girlfriend feels this is their special night and wants him to herself.\n\nSo, the key issue here is communication and boundaries in a relationship. In many relationships, especially in high school or early college, there's an expectation that major events like prom are exclusive to the couple. The girlfriend's perspective is that this is a significant event for them, and bringing another person might make her feel excluded or that her feelings aren't respected.\n\nOn the other hand, the boyfriend is trying to acknowledge the friend's importance in his life and wants to do something kind for her. He's trying to balance his gratitude and the desire to include someone who helped him. However, relationships often require compromise and considering the partner's feelings. The girlfriend's reaction is valid because she might see this as a breach of the mutual understanding that prom is a couple's event. \n\nThe boyfriend should have discussed this with his girlfriend earlier, perhaps before making plans, to understand her perspective. Since the girlfriend is already opposed, it's a communication issue. He might be overlooking her feelings by not seeing the importance of the night being exclusive. \n\nSo, the boyfriend is in the wrong because he didn't consider the girlfriend's feelings first and didn't check if bringing a third person was acceptable in their relationship. The friend's situation is important, but the girlfriend's feelings about their special night are equally important. The boyfriend needs to find a way to honor his friend without compromising his relationship. \n\nTherefore, the answer is A.\n"
