With prom coming up soon, we sat down to talk about our plans. Well, at work the other day, the subject of prom came up at work too. I started to talk to my friend (20 F) about it. It turns out that she never got to go to her prom because she was in the hospital. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWell, this friend is pretty important to me. When I started my job almost a year and a half ago, I lacked almost any social skills. This friend was the first person to really talk to me and treat me like a friend. She helped me through one of the most trying times of my life, as I also had severe social anxiety prior to starting this job. While my friend probably doesn't know this, my progress to having the social skills I do now is largely in part to her. I see this as an opportunity to give back to her for helping me.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy girlfriend is opposed to me wanting to take her with us because she says that this should be our special night, and she wants me to herself. I hold the position that I want to take her due to the aforementioned reasons. So what do you guys think? AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for wanting to bring another girl to prom with his girlfriend. So, the situation is that the author (17M) and his girlfriend (18F) are planning to go to prom, but he wants to bring his female friend (20F) too. The friend never went to prom because she was in the hospital, and he feels she helped him a lot with social skills and he wants to give back. The girlfriend is upset because she wants the night to be special just for them.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The author's intention is to include a close friend who's been supportive, which is understandable. But the girlfriend is feeling left out because she expects a romantic occasion. The key points are the friend's situation and the girlfriend's feelings. \n\nProm is typically a romantic event, so bringing someone else might disrupt that. But the friend's absence from prom due to hospitalization is a valid reason. However, is it appropriate to include a third person in a romantic setting? The girlfriend's feelings are valid because she might feel neglected or that the priority is shifting. \n\nThe author's reasoning is about gratitude, but the girlfriend's perspective is about the significance of the event. There's a conflict between personal gratitude and the girlfriend's expectations. The author might not have considered how his action affects his girlfriend's emotional state. \n\nIn relationships, communication is key. The author should have discussed this with his girlfriend earlier to understand her feelings. By bringing up the idea without her being aware before, he might have overlooked her perspective. Even if his intentions are good, the impact on the girlfriend is negative. \n\nSo, the author's action is causing hurt to his girlfriend, even if he has good intentions. The wrong here isn't about the friend but about the girlfriend's feelings being disregarded. Therefore, the answer is A.\n"
