With prom coming up soon, we sat down to talk about our plans. Well, at work the other day, the subject of prom came up at work too. I started to talk to my friend (20 F) about it. It turns out that she never got to go to her prom because she was in the hospital. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWell, this friend is pretty important to me. When I started my job almost a year and a half ago, I lacked almost any social skills. This friend was the first person to really talk to me and treat me like a friend. She helped me through one of the most trying times of my life, as I also had severe social anxiety prior to starting this job. While my friend probably doesn't know this, my progress to having the social skills I do now is largely in part to her. I see this as an opportunity to give back to her for helping me.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy girlfriend is opposed to me wanting to take her with us because she says that this should be our special night, and she wants me to herself. I hold the position that I want to take her due to the aforementioned reasons. So what do you guys think? AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user wants to know if the author is in the wrong for wanting to bring another girl to prom with his girlfriend. The scenario is that the author is 17, his girlfriend is 18, and they've been dating almost a year. The friend in question is 20 and missed her prom due to being in the hospital. The friend helped the author a lot with social skills and anxiety, so he wants to take her along as a way to give back. The girlfriend is upset because it's supposed to be their special night.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics. Prom is typically a romantic event, so bringing another person might interfere with that. The girlfriend's perspective is valid because she expects it to be their special night. The author's reasoning is about gratitude towards the friend, which is understandable, but how does that affect the girlfriend?\n\nThe girlfriend is the author's significant other, so her feelings matter. Even if the friend is important, the girlfriend's exclusion might feel like a betrayal. The author's actions could be seen as prioritizing the friend over his partner, which can strain the relationship. However, the author's intention is to give back, not to ignore the girlfriend. But intentions don't always negate the impact.\n\nAnother angle: communication. Did they discuss this? The girlfriend is opposed, so the author's plan might not consider her feelings adequately. Even if the friend is important, the girlfriend's feelings are equally important. The author might be in the wrong because he's not respecting her boundaries for their special occasion. Prom is a rite of passage, and bringing another person could make it less special for the girlfriend.\n\nBut maybe the author didn't realize the depth of the girlfriend's feelings. However, the girlfriend's objection is clear, so the author should take that seriously. The friend's situation is sad, but the prom is a personal event between the couple. The author's solution might be a compromise, like taking the friend to a different event, but not prom itself. \n\nSo, considering all that, the author's decision to bring the friend could be seen as inconsiderate towards the girlfriend's feelings and expectations for their prom night. Therefore, the answer might be A (Yes, the author is in the wrong).\n"
