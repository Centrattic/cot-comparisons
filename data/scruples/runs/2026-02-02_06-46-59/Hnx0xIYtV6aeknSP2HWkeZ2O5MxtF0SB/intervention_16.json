With prom coming up soon, we sat down to talk about our plans. Well, at work the other day, the subject of prom came up at work too. I started to talk to my friend (20 F) about it. It turns out that she never got to go to her prom because she was in the hospital. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWell, this friend is pretty important to me. When I started my job almost a year and a half ago, I lacked almost any social skills. This friend was the first person to really talk to me and treat me like a friend. She helped me through one of the most trying times of my life, as I also had severe social anxiety prior to starting this job. While my friend probably doesn't know this, my progress to having the social skills I do now is largely in part to her. I see this as an opportunity to give back to her for helping me.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy girlfriend is opposed to me wanting to take her with us because she says that this should be our special night, and she wants me to herself. I hold the position that I want to take her due to the aforementioned reasons. So what do you guys think? AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the \"Am I the Asshole?\" post is in the wrong for wanting to take another girl with them and their girlfriend to prom.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The author is 17, male, and has been dating his girlfriend for almost a year. His friend, a 20-year-old female, is important to him because she helped him when he had social anxiety and lack of social skills. She never went to prom because she was in the hospital. Now, he wants to take her to prom with his girlfriend, but the girlfriend is against it, wanting the night to be special just for them.\n\nSo the question is: is the author in the wrong? The user thinks he is, but wants confirmation.\n\nLet me break it down. The key points are the girlfriend's feelings versus the author's intentions. The girlfriend feels it's their special night. The author feels it's a way to give back to his friend. \n\nFrom a relationship perspective, bringing a third person to a date, especially a romantic one like prom, can be problematic. Prom is typically a couple's event. The girlfriend likely expected it to be just the two of them. The author's action might be seen as disrespectful to her feelings and the nature of the event. \n\nHowever, the author has valid reasons regarding his friend. His friend did a lot for him, and he wants to make up for her missing prom. But there might be alternative ways to do that without involving his girlfriend. Maybe a separate event or a different kind of gesture.\n\nThe girlfriend's opposition is about wanting the night to be theirs. Prom is a significant event, and couples usually plan these together. The author's decision to bring another person could be seen as disregarding her feelings and the usual social expectations of the event. \n\nOn the other hand, the author might argue that his intentions are good. But in relationships, how actions affect the partner is crucial. Even if the intention is good, if the action causes hurt, it's still a problem. The girlfriend's feelings are valid here.\n\nAnother angle: the age difference. The friend is 20, which is three years older than the author. The girlfriend is 18. The age difference might not be an issue, but it's worth noting. The friend is not a peer in the same way as the author's girlfriend, being an older friend. But regardless, bringing her to prom could still be an issue.\n\nPossible solutions: The author could have discussed other ways to honor his friend's absence without involving the girlfriend. Maybe a separate dinner or activity, or just a symbolic gesture. Since the girlfriend is against it, the author's insistence might be seen as prioritizing his friend's experience over his partner's feelings.\n\nIn conclusion, while the author has good intentions towards his friend, the action of taking her to prom with his girlfriend is likely inconsiderate of the girlfriend's feelings and the nature of prom as a couple's event. Therefore, the author is in the wrong.\n"
