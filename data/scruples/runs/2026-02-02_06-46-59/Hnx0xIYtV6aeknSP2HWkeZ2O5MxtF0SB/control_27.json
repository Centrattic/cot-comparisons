With prom coming up soon, we sat down to talk about our plans. Well, at work the other day, the subject of prom came up at work too. I started to talk to my friend (20 F) about it. It turns out that she never got to go to her prom because she was in the hospital. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWell, this friend is pretty important to me. When I started my job almost a year and a half ago, I lacked almost any social skills. This friend was the first person to really talk to me and treat me like a friend. She helped me through one of the most trying times of my life, as I also had severe social anxiety prior to starting this job. While my friend probably doesn't know this, my progress to having the social skills I do now is largely in part to her. I see this as an opportunity to give back to her for helping me.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy girlfriend is opposed to me wanting to take her with us because she says that this should be our special night, and she wants me to herself. I hold the position that I want to take her due to the aforementioned reasons. So what do you guys think? AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for wanting to bring another girl to prom with his girlfriend. Hmm. So the situation is that the author (17M) and his girlfriend (18F) are planning prom. The author's friend (20F), who he's close to and who helped him a lot socially, never went to prom because she was in the hospital. He wants to take her along, but his girlfriend is upset because she wants the night to be special just for them.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The girlfriend and the author have been dating for almost a year, which is a significant time. Prom is a big event, often seen as a milestone in high school, and it's common for couples to want it to be exclusive. The girlfriend's reaction is understandable because she might feel that bringing another person, especially a girl, could make her feel less special or included. \n\nOn the other hand, the author is arguing that this friend is important to him. The friend helped him a lot when he was struggling with social anxiety and building social skills. He wants to give back by including her in this event. The author's intention is to show gratitude, which is a noble sentiment. However, the key issue here is whether including the friend is a breach of trust or respect towards the girlfriend.\n\nNow, I should think about the nature of the relationship. If the author and girlfriend have established that prom is a couple's event, then bringing someone else could be seen as disregarding her feelings and the expectations of the relationship. The girlfriend's perspective is that it's their special night, so the author's desire to include his friend might be seen as selfish or inconsiderate. \n\nBut wait, the author's friend is a girl. There's a potential for jealousy or misinterpretation here. Even if the author's intentions are pure, the girlfriend might perceive it as him wanting to show her off or not valuing their time together. The girlfriend's reaction might be based on insecurity or the expectation that prom should be a two-person event. \n\nThe author is trying to balance his gratitude towards his friend with his commitment to his girlfriend. The question is whether the girlfriend's feelings are valid in this context. Relationship experts often say that considering a partner's feelings is crucial. Even if the author's reasoning is logical, he needs to prioritize his partner's emotional well-being. \n\nAlso, there's the aspect of consent. The friend hasn't been consulted yet. The author is planning to bring her without her knowledge, which could be another point of contention. But the main issue here is the girlfriend's objection. \n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? It depends on how the situation is viewed. If the girlfriend's feelings are valid and the author's actions are causing her distress without a strong justification, then the author might be in the wrong. However, if the author is genuinely trying to do something good for someone who helped him, maybe it's a matter of communication and compromise. But the question is about whether he's in the wrong, not if there's a solution. \n\nIn many cases, when a partner's feelings are hurt by the other's actions, the person acting is seen as being in the wrong if they don't consider their partner's perspective. The author's action, while well-intentioned, might be inconsiderate of his girlfriend's feelings. Therefore, the answer might be A (the author is in the wrong) because he's prioritizing his friend's inclusion over his girlfriend's emotional needs in this context. However, some might argue it's a complex situation where both sides have valid points. But the question is a yes/no, so AITA usually leans towards the person whose actions caused the conflict being in the wrong. \n\nAnother angle: The girlfriend is within her rights to want the night to be just for them. The author's plan could be seen as not respecting her wishes. The answer is likely A.\n"
