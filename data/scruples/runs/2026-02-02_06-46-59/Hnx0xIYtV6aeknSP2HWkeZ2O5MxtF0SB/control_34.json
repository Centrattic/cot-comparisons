With prom coming up soon, we sat down to talk about our plans. Well, at work the other day, the subject of prom came up at work too. I started to talk to my friend (20 F) about it. It turns out that she never got to go to her prom because she was in the hospital. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWell, this friend is pretty important to me. When I started my job almost a year and a half ago, I lacked almost any social skills. This friend was the first person to really talk to me and treat me like a friend. She helped me through one of the most trying times of my life, as I also had severe social anxiety prior to starting this job. While my friend probably doesn't know this, my progress to having the social skills I do now is largely in part to her. I see this as an opportunity to give back to her for helping me.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy girlfriend is opposed to me wanting to take her with us because she says that this should be our special night, and she wants me to herself. I hold the position that I want to take her due to the aforementioned reasons. So what do you guys think? AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong for wanting to bring another girl to prom with his girlfriend. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The author is a guy who's been dating his girlfriend for almost a year. They're both teenagers, 17 and 18. He has a female friend he's really close to, who helped him during a tough time with social anxiety. This friend missed her prom due to being in the hospital. He wants to take her to prom as a way to give back. His girlfriend is upset because she wants it to be their special night.\n\nNow, the key points here are the relationship dynamics. The girlfriend might feel that prom is a significant event meant for couples, and having someone else there could make her feel excluded. The author, on the other hand, has a strong bond with his friend and sees this as a chance to repay her support. \n\nBut there's a potential issue here. In a romantic relationship, partners usually expect exclusivity and that their partner's time and attention during such events would be focused on them. Bringing another person, especially a close female friend, might be perceived as a breach of that expectation. The girlfriend's perspective is valid because she's likely invested in the idea of a romantic, couple-oriented event. The author's intention is noble, but it's possible he didn't consider how this might affect his girlfriend's feelings. \n\nAnother angle: The author might not have communicated his reasons clearly. If he had explained the significance of his friendship and how it helped him, maybe they could have found a compromise. However, the request to bring someone else to their prom could be seen as disregarding her feelings without considering the impact on their relationship. \n\nAlso, cultural norms around prom often emphasize it as a romantic event. While that's not a universal rule, it's a common expectation. The girlfriend's reaction is likely based on feeling that the event is about their relationship. The author's motivation is good, but actions in relationships need to consider both parties' feelings. \n\nSo, is the author wrong? He's not malicious, but his actions could be hurtful. The girlfriend's feeling of being prioritized is important. Even if his intentions are positive, not considering her perspective might make him at fault here. Relationships require mutual respect and understanding, so maybe the author should have discussed this more and found a solution that respects both their needs.\n"
