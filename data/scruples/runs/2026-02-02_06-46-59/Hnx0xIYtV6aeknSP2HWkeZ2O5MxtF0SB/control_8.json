With prom coming up soon, we sat down to talk about our plans. Well, at work the other day, the subject of prom came up at work too. I started to talk to my friend (20 F) about it. It turns out that she never got to go to her prom because she was in the hospital. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWell, this friend is pretty important to me. When I started my job almost a year and a half ago, I lacked almost any social skills. This friend was the first person to really talk to me and treat me like a friend. She helped me through one of the most trying times of my life, as I also had severe social anxiety prior to starting this job. While my friend probably doesn't know this, my progress to having the social skills I do now is largely in part to her. I see this as an opportunity to give back to her for helping me.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy girlfriend is opposed to me wanting to take her with us because she says that this should be our special night, and she wants me to herself. I hold the position that I want to take her due to the aforementioned reasons. So what do you guys think? AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The guy is asking if he's in the wrong for wanting to bring his friend to prom with him and his girlfriend. His girlfriend is upset because she wants prom to be their special night. The friend missed out on prom because she was in the hospital, and he feels she helped him a lot with social skills and anxiety.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The girlfriend's perspective is that prom is a significant event in a relationship, and she might feel excluded or that her partner isn't prioritizing her. On the other hand, the guy wants to include someone who supported him through a tough time, which shows gratitude. But prom is typically a couple's event. \n\nIs there a cultural norm here? In many places, prom is a time for couples to celebrate together. Bringing a third person might be seen as unusual and could make the girlfriend feel less valued. The guy's intention is good, but the impact on his girlfriend's feelings is important. Trust and communication are key in relationships. He should have discussed this with his girlfriend earlier rather than waiting until she's already opposed. \n\nSo, even though his motives are to thank his friend, he might be in the wrong because he didn't consider how his girlfriend would feel and because prom is traditionally a couple's event. The answer might be A, but I'm not 100% sure. Alternatively, if the girlfriend didn't have an issue with it, maybe not. But since she is opposed, he needs to respect her feelings. So likely A.\n"
