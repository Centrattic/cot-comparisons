With prom coming up soon, we sat down to talk about our plans. Well, at work the other day, the subject of prom came up at work too. I started to talk to my friend (20 F) about it. It turns out that she never got to go to her prom because she was in the hospital. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWell, this friend is pretty important to me. When I started my job almost a year and a half ago, I lacked almost any social skills. This friend was the first person to really talk to me and treat me like a friend. She helped me through one of the most trying times of my life, as I also had severe social anxiety prior to starting this job. While my friend probably doesn't know this, my progress to having the social skills I do now is largely in part to her. I see this as an opportunity to give back to her for helping me.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy girlfriend is opposed to me wanting to take her with us because she says that this should be our special night, and she wants me to herself. I hold the position that I want to take her due to the aforementioned reasons. So what do you guys think? AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong. The situation is that the author (17M) wants to bring his friend (20F) to prom with him and his girlfriend (18F). The girlfriend is against it because she wants the night to be special for just the two of them. The author argues that his friend helped him a lot and he wants to give back to her.\n\nHmm. So, the main issue here is about respecting the girlfriend's feelings versus the author's desire to include a close friend. Let's break it down. \n\nFirst, prom is typically seen as a romantic event between a couple. Inviting another person could disrupt that dynamic. The girlfriend's perspective is valid because she's expecting a special night with her partner. She might feel hurt or disrespected if another person is brought along. \n\nOn the other hand, the author has a strong bond with his friend and feels a sense of gratitude. He might believe that this gesture is important for the friend's happiness. However, the key here is communication and mutual respect. The author should have considered his girlfriend's feelings before making such a decision. Even if the friend is important, the girlfriend's objection indicates that this is a deal-breaker for her. \n\nIn relationships, compromise is essential. The author is prioritizing his obligation to a friend over his girlfriend's wishes, which could be seen as selfish. The girlfriend might feel that her feelings aren't being considered, especially since the event is traditionally for couples. The author's justification, while heartfelt, doesn't address his girlfriend's valid concerns. \n\nSo, even though the author's intentions are good, the action of inviting the friend without considering the girlfriend's feelings first makes him at fault. The right approach would have been to discuss and find a solution that respects both parties, maybe like attending separately or another gesture. Therefore, the author is in the wrong.\n"
