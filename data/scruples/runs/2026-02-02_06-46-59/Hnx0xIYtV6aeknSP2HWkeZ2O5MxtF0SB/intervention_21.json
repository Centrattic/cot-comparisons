With prom coming up soon, we sat down to talk about our plans. Well, at work the other day, the subject of prom came up at work too. I started to talk to my friend (20 F) about it. It turns out that she never got to go to her prom because she was in the hospital. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWell, this friend is pretty important to me. When I started my job almost a year and a half ago, I lacked almost any social skills. This friend was the first person to really talk to me and treat me like a friend. She helped me through one of the most trying times of my life, as I also had severe social anxiety prior to starting this job. While my friend probably doesn't know this, my progress to having the social skills I do now is largely in part to her. I see this as an opportunity to give back to her for helping me.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy girlfriend is opposed to me wanting to take her with us because she says that this should be our special night, and she wants me to herself. I hold the position that I want to take her due to the aforementioned reasons. So what do you guys think? AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for wanting to bring another girl to prom with his girlfriend. The situation is that the author is 17, his girlfriend is 18, and they've been dating almost a year. The friend in question is 20, and she missed her prom due to hospitalization. The author feels this friend helped him a lot with social skills and wants to include her as a way of giving back.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the girlfriend's perspective. She's upset because prom is supposed to be their special night. Prom is a significant event for couples, so her feeling that it's their moment makes sense. The author might think he's being kind to his friend, but bringing someone else could make the girlfriend feel less prioritized. \n\nThen there's the friend's situation. She missed her prom, and the author wants to give her a chance. But does that justify bringing her to his prom with his girlfriend? It might be seen as a way to honor her, but it could also be a breach of trust with the girlfriend. The key here is whether the couple discusses and agrees on plans together. Since they had a conversation about prom plans and the girlfriend expressed opposition, the author should respect her feelings. \n\nAlso, the age difference between the author and the friend (2 years) isn't that significant, but the main issue is the girlfriend's comfort. The author's justification is about gratitude, but relationships require mutual consideration. The girlfriend's desire for a private night is valid, and the author's actions might undermine that. \n\nI think the author is in the wrong because he's ignoring his girlfriend's feelings to accommodate a friend. Even if his intentions are good, the girlfriend's perspective matters more in this context. The right approach would be to find another way to include the friend, like a separate event, but not disrupt the couple's prom night.\n"
