With prom coming up soon, we sat down to talk about our plans. Well, at work the other day, the subject of prom came up at work too. I started to talk to my friend (20 F) about it. It turns out that she never got to go to her prom because she was in the hospital. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWell, this friend is pretty important to me. When I started my job almost a year and a half ago, I lacked almost any social skills. This friend was the first person to really talk to me and treat me like a friend. She helped me through one of the most trying times of my life, as I also had severe social anxiety prior to starting this job. While my friend probably doesn't know this, my progress to having the social skills I do now is largely in part to her. I see this as an opportunity to give back to her for helping me.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy girlfriend is opposed to me wanting to take her with us because she says that this should be our special night, and she wants me to herself. I hold the position that I want to take her due to the aforementioned reasons. So what do you guys think? AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong for wanting to bring another girl to prom with his girlfriend. \n\nFirst, there's the core issue: the boyfriend wants to take a friend who missed her prom to the event with his girlfriend. The girlfriend is upset because she thinks it's their special night and wants it to be just the two of them.\n\nI need to consider both parties' perspectives. The boyfriend argues that his friend helped him a lot, both socially and through his anxiety. He sees this as a way to give back. On the other hand, the girlfriend feels that prom is a significant event for their relationship, and including another person might make her feel excluded or less prioritized.\n\nFrom a relationship standpoint, communication is key. The boyfriend should have discussed this with his girlfriend beforehand to understand her feelings. However, he did mention they had a conversation about prom plans. The girlfriend's main concern is about it being their \"special night,\" which is a common sentiment. Prom is often seen as a couple's event, so adding someone else might be perceived as a breach of that unspoken expectation.\n\nBut then there's the context of the friend's situation. She missed her prom due to hospitalization, and the boyfriend feels a strong sense of gratitude. That adds a layer where the friend's personal history is a factor. However, the boyfriend's relationship with his girlfriend is a two-person dynamic, and introducing a third person could create tension or jealousy, even if unintended.\n\nThe key here is whether the boyfriend's actions were considerate of his girlfriend's feelings. If he had discussed it with her and she was okay with it, then it wouldn't be an issue. But since she's opposed, he needs to weigh his friend's needs against his partner's feelings. Bringing in another person might not be fair to his girlfriend, even if the intention is good. In a relationship, partners often expect certain events to be exclusive to each other unless mutually agreed. \n\nSo, while the boyfriend's intent is positive, the outcome might hurt his girlfriend's feelings. The girlfriend's perspective is valid because she expects the night to be special for their relationship. The boyfriend might be in the wrong if he proceeds without addressing her concerns adequately. However, if they can find another way to include his friend, like attending a different event or doing something else, that might resolve the issue without damaging the relationship. But as it stands, the girlfriend's feelings are valid, and the boyfriend's action could be seen as prioritizing his friend over his partner's expectations, which might make him at fault.\n"
