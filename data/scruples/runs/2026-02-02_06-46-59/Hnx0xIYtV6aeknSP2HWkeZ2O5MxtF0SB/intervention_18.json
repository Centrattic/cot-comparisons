With prom coming up soon, we sat down to talk about our plans. Well, at work the other day, the subject of prom came up at work too. I started to talk to my friend (20 F) about it. It turns out that she never got to go to her prom because she was in the hospital. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWell, this friend is pretty important to me. When I started my job almost a year and a half ago, I lacked almost any social skills. This friend was the first person to really talk to me and treat me like a friend. She helped me through one of the most trying times of my life, as I also had severe social anxiety prior to starting this job. While my friend probably doesn't know this, my progress to having the social skills I do now is largely in part to her. I see this as an opportunity to give back to her for helping me.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy girlfriend is opposed to me wanting to take her with us because she says that this should be our special night, and she wants me to herself. I hold the position that I want to take her due to the aforementioned reasons. So what do you guys think? AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person (the author) is in the wrong for wanting to bring another girl to prom with his girlfriend. The situation is that the author is 17, his girlfriend is 18, and they've been dating almost a year. The friend in question is 20, and she missed her prom due to hospitalization. The friend helped the author a lot with social anxiety and work, so he wants to include her as a way of giving back.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the girlfriend's perspective. She wants prom to be their special night and feels left out by the idea of bringing another girl. Prom is typically a romantic event, so including someone else might make her feel that her partner isn't prioritizing their relationship. The author might think he's showing gratitude to his friend, but the girlfriend might see it as a betrayal or lack of consideration for their relationship.\n\nOn the other hand, the author's intention is to thank a significant friend who supported him during a hard time. He values her friendship highly. However, relationships require mutual respect and consideration. The girlfriend's feelings are valid because she might feel that the author is including someone else in a special event meant for the two of them.\n\nThe key here is whether the author considered his girlfriend's feelings before making the request. If he didn't communicate properly or dismissed her concerns, that's a problem. But if he tried to explain his reasons and they couldn't reach a compromise, the situation becomes more nuanced. However, the girlfriend's primary concern is about the exclusivity of their special night, which is a legitimate emotional need in a relationship.\n\nIn most cases, bringing a third person to a romantic event without the partner's consent can be seen as inconsiderate, even if the intention is positive. The author's actions could undermine the girlfriend's need for a romantic experience, leading to hurt feelings. Therefore, the author might be in the wrong because he's prioritizing his friendship over his partner's emotional needs in this context, unless there's a clear mutual agreement. Since the girlfriend is opposed, and the author's explanation doesn't address her feelings directly, it's likely he's in the wrong here.\n"
