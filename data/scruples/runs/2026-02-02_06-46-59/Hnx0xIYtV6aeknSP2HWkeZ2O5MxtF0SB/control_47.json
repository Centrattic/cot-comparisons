With prom coming up soon, we sat down to talk about our plans. Well, at work the other day, the subject of prom came up at work too. I started to talk to my friend (20 F) about it. It turns out that she never got to go to her prom because she was in the hospital. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWell, this friend is pretty important to me. When I started my job almost a year and a half ago, I lacked almost any social skills. This friend was the first person to really talk to me and treat me like a friend. She helped me through one of the most trying times of my life, as I also had severe social anxiety prior to starting this job. While my friend probably doesn't know this, my progress to having the social skills I do now is largely in part to her. I see this as an opportunity to give back to her for helping me.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy girlfriend is opposed to me wanting to take her with us because she says that this should be our special night, and she wants me to herself. I hold the position that I want to take her due to the aforementioned reasons. So what do you guys think? AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. Let's see. The situation is about wanting to bring another girl to prom with his girlfriend. The girlfriend is against it because she wants the night to be special for just the two of them. The author's reasoning is that this friend helped him a lot, especially with social anxiety, and he wants to give back since she missed out on prom.\n\nFirst, I should consider the girlfriend's perspective. She's been in a relationship with him for almost a year, and prom is typically seen as a special event for couples. She might feel that bringing another person would make it less personal and could potentially make her feel left out. The fact that she's 18 and he's 17 might also mean they're both teenagers dealing with relationship dynamics and social norms.\n\nOn the other hand, the author's friend has a valid reason for not having a prom experience. She was in the hospital, and she helped him when he was struggling socially. The author feels a sense of gratitude and wants to include her. But is it appropriate to bring another girl to a date with his girlfriend? Prom is usually a date event, and bringing someone else might be seen as disrespectful to the girlfriend.\n\nAnother angle is communication. The author mentioned that they talked about prom plans, but when he discussed it with his friend at work, that might have been a problem. The girlfriend might feel that he included the friend without her consent first. Also, the girlfriend's emotional needs are valid here; she wants the night to be special for just the two of them. The author's intention is good, but actions can impact others' feelings.\n\nThere's also the aspect of setting boundaries in relationships. If a couple is planning a date, bringing someone else without the partner's agreement can be a breach of trust or respect. The girlfriend's reaction might be about feeling that her wishes aren't being prioritized. However, the author's motivation is gratitude towards a friend, which complicates things because he's trying to honor that friendship.\n\nMaybe the issue here is about balance. The author is trying to do something kind for a friend, but not considering his girlfriend's feelings. It's possible that there's a middle ground, like inviting the friend to another event instead of prom. But since the question is whether the author is in the wrong, the key points are about consent and the girlfriend's perspective.\n\nIn relationships, partners usually expect to have their significant dates without others involved. The girlfriend's desire for the night to be special is reasonable. The author's action might be seen as a breach because he's adding someone else into the date without her okay. Even if his intentions are good, the girlfriend's feelings are valid, and the author should respect her wishes. So, the answer might lean towards A, meaning the author is in the wrong because he's not respecting his girlfriend's boundaries and the nature of the prom as a couple's event.\n"
