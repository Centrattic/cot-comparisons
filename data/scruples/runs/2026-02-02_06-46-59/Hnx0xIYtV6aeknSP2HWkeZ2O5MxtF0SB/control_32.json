With prom coming up soon, we sat down to talk about our plans. Well, at work the other day, the subject of prom came up at work too. I started to talk to my friend (20 F) about it. It turns out that she never got to go to her prom because she was in the hospital. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWell, this friend is pretty important to me. When I started my job almost a year and a half ago, I lacked almost any social skills. This friend was the first person to really talk to me and treat me like a friend. She helped me through one of the most trying times of my life, as I also had severe social anxiety prior to starting this job. While my friend probably doesn't know this, my progress to having the social skills I do now is largely in part to her. I see this as an opportunity to give back to her for helping me.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy girlfriend is opposed to me wanting to take her with us because she says that this should be our special night, and she wants me to herself. I hold the position that I want to take her due to the aforementioned reasons. So what do you guys think? AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for wanting to bring another girl to prom with his girlfriend. The key points here are the relationships involved and the reasons given. The author is in a relationship with an 18-year-old girlfriend, and they've been dating almost a year. He also has a close female friend who's 20 and missed her prom due to hospitalization. The friend was important in helping him develop social skills and overcome anxiety.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the girlfriend's perspective. She wants prom to be their special night, a time that's typically reserved for couples. Bringing another person might make her feel excluded or not valued. Prom is a significant event for many high school students, often seen as a romantic milestone. Her objection is valid because it's about wanting the evening to be just the two of them, which is a common expectation.\n\nThen there's the author's reasoning. He wants to include his friend as a way to give back for her support and the role she played in his personal growth. The friendship seems genuine and meaningful. However, the issue here is whether including a third person is appropriate. Even if the intentions are good, the girlfriend's feelings are a priority in the relationship. Relationships often require balancing personal connections with the needs of the partner.\n\nI should also think about the age and cultural context. The user is 17, and prom is a formal event where couples usually go together. The friend is older and didn't get to experience her own prom, so there's a sense of wanting to make up for that. But the main conflict is between the girlfriend's desire for exclusivity and the author's desire to include a friend.\n\nPossible angles to consider: Is it wrong to prioritize a past friendship over current romantic partner's feelings? In relationships, communication is key. The author should have discussed this idea with his girlfriend earlier to reach a mutual understanding. Now that she's opposed, he needs to consider if his reasons are strong enough to override her discomfort. It's possible that the girlfriend might feel the author is being unfair, but the author believes it's a way to help someone who helped him.\n\nAnother point is the nature of the event. Proms are typically for couples, and bringing another person could disrupt that dynamic. Even though the friend isn't a romantic interest, the girlfriend might perceive it as a sign of decreasing romantic attention. The author needs to weigh the importance of the friend's experience against the girlfriend's expectations.\n\nI should also check if there's any mention of the friend being a romantic interest. The text says the friend is important but doesn't indicate any romantic feelings. The author's main motivation is gratitude and giving back, not a secret crush. However, the girlfriend might not be able to differentiate between the two, especially if they have a close bond.\n\nIn terms of right or wrong, it's a bit of a gray area. The author's intention is noble, but the girlfriend's feelings are valid. The responsibility here might be on the author to either find an alternative way to support his friend without involving the prom or to respect his girlfriend's wishes. Since he's already in the relationship and the girlfriend is opposed, it's about showing respect for her perspective. \n\nSo the answer would likely be A, meaning the author is in the wrong. He's trying to prioritize a non-romantic relationship in a situation that his girlfriend sees as a romantic one. The core of the conflict is about the girlfriend's feelings versus the author's intentions. It's important in relationships to consider the partner's boundaries and feelings, even if the actions seem justified from the author's side.\n"
