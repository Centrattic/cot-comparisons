With prom coming up soon, we sat down to talk about our plans. Well, at work the other day, the subject of prom came up at work too. I started to talk to my friend (20 F) about it. It turns out that she never got to go to her prom because she was in the hospital. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWell, this friend is pretty important to me. When I started my job almost a year and a half ago, I lacked almost any social skills. This friend was the first person to really talk to me and treat me like a friend. She helped me through one of the most trying times of my life, as I also had severe social anxiety prior to starting this job. While my friend probably doesn't know this, my progress to having the social skills I do now is largely in part to her. I see this as an opportunity to give back to her for helping me.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy girlfriend is opposed to me wanting to take her with us because she says that this should be our special night, and she wants me to herself. I hold the position that I want to take her due to the aforementioned reasons. So what do you guys think? AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for wanting to bring another girl to prom with his girlfriend. The situation involves a boyfriend and girlfriend who've been dating almost a year. The boyfriend wants to include his female friend because she missed prom due to hospitalization and she helped him with social skills. The girlfriend is upset because she wants it to be their special night.\n\nFirst, consider the girlfriend's perspective. Prom is a significant event in many people's lives, often seen as a romantic milestone. She might feel that including another person could dilute the experience or make her feel less important. The fact that they've been dating a year suggests they might expect a certain level of exclusivity in such events. Her opposition could stem from feeling neglected or not being prioritized.\n\nOn the other hand, the boyfriend's reasoning is based on gratitude. His friend helped him during a tough time, and he wants to give back. The friend also hasn't been to prom, which adds to the justification. However, the core issue here is about the girlfriend's feelings versus the boyfriend's desire to include someone else. \n\nIn relationships, communication and compromise are key. The boyfriend might not have considered how his actions could affect his girlfriend's feelings. Even if the friend's situation is valid, the boyfriend should prioritize his partner's perspective in this scenario. The girlfriend's desire for a special night is personal and valid, and the boyfriend's choice to include another person might come off as dismissive of her feelings. \n\nSo, while the boyfriend's intentions are noble, the action of including another girl without considering his girlfriend's feelings might be seen as inconsiderate. Therefore, he's in the wrong.\n"
