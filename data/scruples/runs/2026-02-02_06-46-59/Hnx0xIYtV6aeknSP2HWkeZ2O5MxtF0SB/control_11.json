With prom coming up soon, we sat down to talk about our plans. Well, at work the other day, the subject of prom came up at work too. I started to talk to my friend (20 F) about it. It turns out that she never got to go to her prom because she was in the hospital. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWell, this friend is pretty important to me. When I started my job almost a year and a half ago, I lacked almost any social skills. This friend was the first person to really talk to me and treat me like a friend. She helped me through one of the most trying times of my life, as I also had severe social anxiety prior to starting this job. While my friend probably doesn't know this, my progress to having the social skills I do now is largely in part to her. I see this as an opportunity to give back to her for helping me.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy girlfriend is opposed to me wanting to take her with us because she says that this should be our special night, and she wants me to herself. I hold the position that I want to take her due to the aforementioned reasons. So what do you guys think? AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is that the guy (17 M) wants to bring his friend (20 F) to prom with him and his girlfriend. The girlfriend is against it because she wants the night to be special just for them. The friend never went to prom because she was in the hospital, and he feels grateful because she helped him with his social anxiety.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the girlfriend's perspective. She's been in a relationship with him for almost a year. Prom is a big event, usually a special night for couples. She's asking for their night to be just the two of them. Bringing another person, especially a friend who's not part of the relationship, could be seen as a betrayal or not respecting her feelings. \n\nOn the other hand, the guy is motivated by gratitude. His friend was instrumental in helping him develop social skills and overcome anxiety. The friend didn't have a prom experience, so he wants to give back by including her. That's a genuine sentiment. But the key issue is whether his actions are respectful towards his girlfriend's wishes.\n\nThe problem is balancing his gratitude for his friend with the expectations of a romantic partner. The girlfriend's main issue is that she wants the night to be exclusive to them. The guy's action might be seen as prioritizing his friendship over his girlfriend's needs in this instance. \n\nI should also think about the dynamics. The friend is important to him, but inviting her without the girlfriend's consent might not be considerate. Even if the friend is close, the girlfriend's feelings are valid. The guy should have discussed this with his girlfriend earlier to find a compromise. Maybe suggesting a different way to honor his friend, like a separate event or just attending as a couple and then doing something else with his friend. \n\nAnother angle: Prom is a traditional event for couples. Including a third person could create discomfort or awkwardness for everyone involved. The girlfriend's opposition is about the exclusivity of the night. The guy's reasoning is noble but might not take into account the girlfriend's emotional needs. \n\nSo, considering both sides, the author might be in the wrong because he's disregarding his girlfriend's clear request for an exclusive date. Even though his intentions are good, respecting a partner's wishes in a close relationship is important. The answer might lean towards A (yes, he's in the wrong) because he's not respecting her feelings, even if his motives are positive.\n"
