With prom coming up soon, we sat down to talk about our plans. Well, at work the other day, the subject of prom came up at work too. I started to talk to my friend (20 F) about it. It turns out that she never got to go to her prom because she was in the hospital. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWell, this friend is pretty important to me. When I started my job almost a year and a half ago, I lacked almost any social skills. This friend was the first person to really talk to me and treat me like a friend. She helped me through one of the most trying times of my life, as I also had severe social anxiety prior to starting this job. While my friend probably doesn't know this, my progress to having the social skills I do now is largely in part to her. I see this as an opportunity to give back to her for helping me.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy girlfriend is opposed to me wanting to take her with us because she says that this should be our special night, and she wants me to herself. I hold the position that I want to take her due to the aforementioned reasons. So what do you guys think? AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that he wants to bring another girl with him and his girlfriend to prom. His girlfriend is against it because she wants it to be a special night just for the two of them. The author argues that the friend he wants to bring never got to go to her prom because she was in the hospital, and that this friend helped him a lot when he had social anxiety, so he wants to give back.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the girlfriend's perspective. Prom is usually a romantic event, and wanting it to be just the two of them makes sense. She might feel like bringing another person could take attention away from their relationship, maybe even make her feel like she's not the priority. That's a valid concern.\n\nOn the other hand, the author's reasons for wanting to bring the friend are also valid. The friend helped him through a tough time, and he wants to show gratitude. The friend missed out on prom due to hospitalization, so this could be a way to include her in a meaningful event. The author might feel that this act of kindness is important and that his girlfriend needs to understand his motives.\n\nNow, thinking about communication. The author and his girlfriend had a discussion about prom plans. The girlfriend expressed her desire for it to be their special night, so he should take that into account. The question is whether his reasons for wanting to bring the friend outweigh her feelings. Maybe there's a middle ground, like having a separate time to celebrate with the friend, but the author hasn't mentioned that.\n\nAnother angle is the potential impact on the relationship. If the girlfriend feels that her feelings were disregarded, it could lead to resentment. The author might be making a mistake by not prioritizing his partner's wishes, even if his intentions are good. However, if he can explain the significance of including his friend and ensure the girlfriend still feels it's a special night, maybe a compromise is possible.\n\nAlso, the friend's perspective isn't fully known. If the friend is okay with just attending without being treated as a date or third wheel, maybe it's less of an issue. But the way the author phrases it suggests he wants to take her along with them, which might imply a more active presence, which the girlfriend might not be comfortable with.\n\nIn terms of social norms, prom is typically a couple's event. Including a third person could make it awkward for everyone involved. The girlfriend's desire for it to be special might be about intimacy and a shared experience without others. The author's reasoning is about gratitude and giving back, which is noble, but perhaps he's not considering how this might affect his relationship with his girlfriend.\n\nSo, weighing both sides: the author's intentions are good, but he might be overlooking his girlfriend's feelings. The girlfriend is in a position where she wants the night to be for them, which is a natural expectation. The author's actions could be seen as not respecting her feelings if he proceeds without addressing her concerns adequately. However, if he can find a way to honor both his friend's experience and his girlfriend's wishes, that would be ideal. But based on the information given, the author is in the wrong because he's prioritizing his own actions over his partner's stated desires without sufficient resolution of the conflict.\n"
