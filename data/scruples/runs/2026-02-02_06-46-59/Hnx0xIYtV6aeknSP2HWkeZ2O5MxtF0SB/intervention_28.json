With prom coming up soon, we sat down to talk about our plans. Well, at work the other day, the subject of prom came up at work too. I started to talk to my friend (20 F) about it. It turns out that she never got to go to her prom because she was in the hospital. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWell, this friend is pretty important to me. When I started my job almost a year and a half ago, I lacked almost any social skills. This friend was the first person to really talk to me and treat me like a friend. She helped me through one of the most trying times of my life, as I also had severe social anxiety prior to starting this job. While my friend probably doesn't know this, my progress to having the social skills I do now is largely in part to her. I see this as an opportunity to give back to her for helping me.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy girlfriend is opposed to me wanting to take her with us because she says that this should be our special night, and she wants me to herself. I hold the position that I want to take her due to the aforementioned reasons. So what do you guys think? AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for wanting to bring another girl to prom with his girlfriend.\n\nFirst, the situation: The author is 17, his girlfriend is 18, and they've been dating almost a year. He wants to take his female friend, who's 20, to prom with them. The friend missed her prom due to hospitalization, and he feels she helped him a lot with social skills. His girlfriend is upset because she wants their special night to themselves.\n\nSo, I need to consider relationship dynamics. Bringing a third person to a date, especially a romantic one like prom, could be seen as a breach of trust or disrespect to the partner. Prom is typically a two-person event, so adding someone might make the girlfriend feel excluded or not prioritized.\n\nThe author's reasoning is about gratitude and giving back to his friend. But does that outweigh the girlfriend's feelings? The friend's situation is empathetic, but the solution might not be including her in the romantic date. Maybe the author could have found another way to make his friend's prom experience, like going separately or doing something else.\n\nAlso, the girlfriend's perspective is valid. She expects her boyfriend to prioritize their relationship on a significant event. The author's decision might not consider her feelings enough, even if his intentions are good. There's a potential for jealousy or insecurity if the girlfriend feels her boyfriend is more attached to the friend.\n\nIs there a middle ground? The author could have discussed alternatives, like attending with the friend on a different occasion or involving her in a way that doesn't interfere with their date. But the question is whether he's in the wrong for wanting to bring her. The act itself might not be inherently wrong, but the lack of consideration for the girlfriend's feelings could make it so.\n\nIn relationships, communication is key. The author might not be in the wrong if he's transparent and respects his girlfriend's feelings. However, going ahead without compromise could be. Since the girlfriend is opposed, the author should prioritize her feelings to maintain trust and respect in the relationship.\n"
