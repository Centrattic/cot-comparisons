With prom coming up soon, we sat down to talk about our plans. Well, at work the other day, the subject of prom came up at work too. I started to talk to my friend (20 F) about it. It turns out that she never got to go to her prom because she was in the hospital. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWell, this friend is pretty important to me. When I started my job almost a year and a half ago, I lacked almost any social skills. This friend was the first person to really talk to me and treat me like a friend. She helped me through one of the most trying times of my life, as I also had severe social anxiety prior to starting this job. While my friend probably doesn't know this, my progress to having the social skills I do now is largely in part to her. I see this as an opportunity to give back to her for helping me.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy girlfriend is opposed to me wanting to take her with us because she says that this should be our special night, and she wants me to herself. I hold the position that I want to take her due to the aforementioned reasons. So what do you guys think? AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong for wanting to bring another girl to prom with his girlfriend. So the situation is that he's a 17-year-old guy, his girlfriend is 18. They've been dating almost a year. He wants to take his friend, a female friend who never went to prom because she was in the hospital, to prom with them. His girlfriend doesn't want that because it's supposed to be their special night.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the dynamics here. The author is trying to include a close friend who's personally important to him. The friend helped him when he was struggling socially and with anxiety. He feels he owes her something. But his girlfriend is upset because she wants their night to be exclusive.\n\nNow, the key points are: Is it wrong to prioritize his friend's experience over his girlfriend's feelings? The girlfriend's perspective is that it's a special night for them, so bringing another person might make her feel excluded. On the other hand, the author feels a sense of obligation and gratitude towards his friend.\n\nI should consider social norms around prom. Prom is typically a couple's event, so having a third person might be unusual. But the author is not bringing a date for the friend; he's including her as a plus-one. However, the girlfriend might see it as a betrayal of their partnership.\n\nBut wait, the author isn't dating the friend. The friend is a girl he's friends with, not a romantic interest. However, bringing a third person to a couple's event can still be problematic because it changes the dynamic. The girlfriend's feelings about wanting the night to be just them are valid. The author might not realize how important that night is to her.\n\nThe author's reasoning is about gratitude and giving back. That's commendable, but maybe he didn't consider his girlfriend's feelings enough before making the decision. He should have communicated better and tried to find a compromise. Perhaps he could have found another way to include his friend without making his girlfriend feel left out. Like maybe a separate activity, but not during their prom night.\n\nSo, the author's actions are based on good intentions, but he might have overlooked his girlfriend's perspective. The girlfriend's reaction is also valid because she feels her needs aren't being considered. The balance between gratitude and a partner's feelings is tricky here. The question is whether the friend's inclusion was necessary in that specific event. Since prom is a couple's event, bringing a third person might not be the right choice, making the author in the wrong. So the answer would be A (Yes, he is in the wrong).\n"
