With prom coming up soon, we sat down to talk about our plans. Well, at work the other day, the subject of prom came up at work too. I started to talk to my friend (20 F) about it. It turns out that she never got to go to her prom because she was in the hospital. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWell, this friend is pretty important to me. When I started my job almost a year and a half ago, I lacked almost any social skills. This friend was the first person to really talk to me and treat me like a friend. She helped me through one of the most trying times of my life, as I also had severe social anxiety prior to starting this job. While my friend probably doesn't know this, my progress to having the social skills I do now is largely in part to her. I see this as an opportunity to give back to her for helping me.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy girlfriend is opposed to me wanting to take her with us because she says that this should be our special night, and she wants me to herself. I hold the position that I want to take her due to the aforementioned reasons. So what do you guys think? AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for wanting to bring another girl to prom with his girlfriend. The situation is that he and his girlfriend are planning prom, but he wants to include his friend who missed her prom due to being in the hospital. His girlfriend is upset because she wants it to be their special night.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The author has been dating his girlfriend for almost a year. Prom is typically seen as a romantic event, so the girlfriend's desire for it to be just the two of them is understandable. The author, however, wants to include a close friend who helped him through a tough time. The friend is important to him and contributed significantly to his social growth.\n\nNow, the key points: The author's intention is to thank his friend and give back for her support. But the girlfriend feels it should be their special night. The question is whether the author is in the wrong by prioritizing his friend's inclusion over his girlfriend's wishes.\n\nI should think about boundaries in relationships. While friendships are important, prom is generally a date event. The girlfriend's feelings about wanting the night to themselves are valid. The author is making a request that affects his girlfriend's experience, so he should consider her perspective. \n\nHowever, the author's reasoning is about gratitude and giving back. But does that justify going against his girlfriend's wishes? It might depend on communication. Did he discuss this with her before making plans? The scenario says they talked about plans, but maybe he didn't adequately address her feelings. \n\nAlso, bringing another girl to a date night could be seen as disregarding the girlfriend's expectations. Even if the friend is important, the girlfriend might feel it's a breach of trust or a lack of consideration. \n\nIn relationships, compromise is key. The author might need to find a middle ground, like attending the prom with the friend another way, but if the girlfriend is firmly against it, the author might need to respect her wishes. \n\nSo, is he in the wrong? If he's going ahead despite her clear objections, then yes. But if he's trying to find a solution that honors both parties, maybe not. However, the way the question is framed, the author is choosing to go ahead, which could be seen as not respecting her feelings enough. Therefore, the answer might be A (yes, the author is in the wrong).\n"
