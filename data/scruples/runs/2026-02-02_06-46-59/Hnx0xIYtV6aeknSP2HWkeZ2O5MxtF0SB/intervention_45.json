With prom coming up soon, we sat down to talk about our plans. Well, at work the other day, the subject of prom came up at work too. I started to talk to my friend (20 F) about it. It turns out that she never got to go to her prom because she was in the hospital. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWell, this friend is pretty important to me. When I started my job almost a year and a half ago, I lacked almost any social skills. This friend was the first person to really talk to me and treat me like a friend. She helped me through one of the most trying times of my life, as I also had severe social anxiety prior to starting this job. While my friend probably doesn't know this, my progress to having the social skills I do now is largely in part to her. I see this as an opportunity to give back to her for helping me.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy girlfriend is opposed to me wanting to take her with us because she says that this should be our special night, and she wants me to herself. I hold the position that I want to take her due to the aforementioned reasons. So what do you guys think? AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that the guy (17 M) wants to bring his friend (20 F) with him and his girlfriend (18 F) to prom. The girlfriend is against it because she wants it to be a special night for just the two of them. The author argues that the friend helped him a lot, especially with social skills and during a tough time, so he wants to include her as a way of giving back.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the girlfriend's perspective. Prom is typically a significant event for couples, often seen as a romantic night. If the girlfriend feels that having another person there would make it less special for them, her feelings are valid. She might feel excluded or that her partner isn't prioritizing their relationship.\n\nOn the other hand, the author's reasoning is about gratitude towards his friend. He mentions that this friend helped him when he was struggling socially and with anxiety. Including her could be a way to honor that friendship and support her, considering she missed out on prom herself. However, the problem here is that he's a minor (17) and the friend is an adult (20), which might complicate things. But the main issue is the conflict between his friend's needs and his girlfriend's expectations.\n\nIs it wrong to want to include a friend out of gratitude? It depends on how it affects the relationship. The girlfriend's objection is about the intimacy of the event. If the author insists on bringing the friend despite her discomfort, that could be seen as dismissive of her feelings. The key point is whether he's respecting his girlfriend's wishes. Since she's expressed that she wants it to be their special night, bringing another person might not be considerate of her feelings. The author might be prioritizing his friendship over his partner's emotional needs in this specific instance.\n\nAlso, there's the aspect of communication. The author should have discussed this with his girlfriend earlier if he was considering bringing the friend. Since he talked about it at work, maybe there was a lack of communication beforehand. The girlfriend's opposition is a valid reaction because it's her event as well, and she might feel that her partner isn't considering her feelings.\n\nSo, while the author has a good intention, the action of wanting to bring the friend might be inconsiderate of his girlfriend's wishes. Therefore, he might be in the wrong because he's not prioritizing his girlfriend's feelings in this situation, even if his motives are noble.\n"
