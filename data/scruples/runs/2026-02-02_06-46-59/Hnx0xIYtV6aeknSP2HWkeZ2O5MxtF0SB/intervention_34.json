With prom coming up soon, we sat down to talk about our plans. Well, at work the other day, the subject of prom came up at work too. I started to talk to my friend (20 F) about it. It turns out that she never got to go to her prom because she was in the hospital. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWell, this friend is pretty important to me. When I started my job almost a year and a half ago, I lacked almost any social skills. This friend was the first person to really talk to me and treat me like a friend. She helped me through one of the most trying times of my life, as I also had severe social anxiety prior to starting this job. While my friend probably doesn't know this, my progress to having the social skills I do now is largely in part to her. I see this as an opportunity to give back to her for helping me.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy girlfriend is opposed to me wanting to take her with us because she says that this should be our special night, and she wants me to herself. I hold the position that I want to take her due to the aforementioned reasons. So what do you guys think? AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for wanting to bring another girl to prom with his girlfriend. The situation is that the author's friend, a female coworker, never went to prom and missed out because of being in the hospital. The friend helped him a lot, especially with social anxiety. The author wants to include her in the prom night as a way to give back, but his girlfriend is upset, wanting it to be a special night just for the two of them.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the girlfriend's perspective. Prom is traditionally a significant, romantic event for couples. The girlfriend might feel that having another person there would detract from the intimacy and make her feel less prioritized. She's been in a relationship for almost a year, so she might have certain expectations about how prom should be spent. Her feelings of wanting it to be their special night are valid and should be taken seriously.\n\nOn the other hand, the author's friend has a valid reason for not having a prom experience. The friend played a crucial role in helping the author develop social skills and overcome anxiety, making this a way to reciprocate kindness. However, bringing a third person into a romantic event can be complicated. The author might not realize the impact this has on his girlfriend. \n\nNow, considering the dynamics here: the author is 17 and his girlfriend is 18. At that age, relationships are still developing, and communication is key. The author's intention to include a friend is good, but the way it's presented might come off as neglecting his girlfriend's feelings. The girlfriend's opposition indicates she feels her needs are being overlooked. \n\nThe core issue here is about balancing the needs and feelings of both parties. The author might not be in the wrong if his intentions are genuine, but he's failing to consider his girlfriend's perspective adequately. It's possible that a compromise could be found, but the main question is whether the author is in the wrong for wanting to bring the friend in the first place. \n\nIn many cases, bringing a third person to a romantic event without considering the partner's feelings can be seen as inconsiderate, even if the intentions are good. The girlfriend's priority is the romantic aspect, which is a key element of prom. The author's friend's situation is unfortunate, but there might be other ways to include her without affecting the couple's plans. \n\nTherefore, while the author's motives are noble, the action of including another person without addressing his girlfriend's concerns might be inconsiderate. So the answer would lean towards A (the author is in the wrong), because he is prioritizing his friend's experience over his girlfriend's desire for a romantic evening, without adequately addressing her feelings.\n"
