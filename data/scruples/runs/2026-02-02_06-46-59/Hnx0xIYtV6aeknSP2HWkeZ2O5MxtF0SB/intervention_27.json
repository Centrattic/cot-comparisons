With prom coming up soon, we sat down to talk about our plans. Well, at work the other day, the subject of prom came up at work too. I started to talk to my friend (20 F) about it. It turns out that she never got to go to her prom because she was in the hospital. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWell, this friend is pretty important to me. When I started my job almost a year and a half ago, I lacked almost any social skills. This friend was the first person to really talk to me and treat me like a friend. She helped me through one of the most trying times of my life, as I also had severe social anxiety prior to starting this job. While my friend probably doesn't know this, my progress to having the social skills I do now is largely in part to her. I see this as an opportunity to give back to her for helping me.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy girlfriend is opposed to me wanting to take her with us because she says that this should be our special night, and she wants me to herself. I hold the position that I want to take her due to the aforementioned reasons. So what do you guys think? AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for wanting to bring another girl to prom with his girlfriend. So the situation is that the author is 17, his girlfriend is 18, and they've been dating almost a year. His friend, a girl he really values, didn't get to go to prom because she was in the hospital. He wants to include her as a way to give back because she helped him with his social anxiety. His girlfriend is upset because she wants it to be their special night.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The main issue is about respect for the girlfriend's feelings versus the author's desire to include a friend. The girlfriend might feel that prom is a significant event for their relationship, and bringing another girl could make her feel less prioritized. On the other hand, the author sees this as a way to repay a friend who supported him a lot.\n\nI should think about communication. Did the author discuss this with his girlfriend before making plans? The article mentions they talked about their plans, but maybe the author didn't fully consider her perspective. The girlfriend's concern is valid because prom is traditionally a romantic event. The author's reasoning is about gratitude, but maybe he didn't realize how this could affect his girlfriend's feelings.\n\nAnother angle is the nature of the relationship. If they're exclusive, bringing another girl could be seen as problematic, even if it's just as a friend. The girlfriend might feel insecure or that her partner isn't respecting their romantic time. The author's friend might also have mixed feelings, though the scenario doesn't mention her reaction.\n\nEthically, it's about balancing different values: gratitude towards a friend versus respect for the partner's emotional needs. The author might be prioritizing his own sense of obligation to the friend, but that doesn't necessarily mean he's in the wrong. However, relationships require compromise, and the girlfriend's feelings shouldn't be dismissed. The key is whether the author considered her perspective adequately.\n\nAlso, cultural context: prom is a big deal for many high schoolers. Including someone else could disrupt that. The author's intention is good, but intentions don't always align with the impact. The girlfriend's reaction is a valid emotional response. The author might need to find a middle ground, like attending separately but still supporting his friend in another way.\n\nIn terms of right or wrong, it's a bit nuanced. The author might not be entirely at fault because he's trying to do something kind for a friend who helped him. However, the girlfriend's needs are also important. The wrong here could be on the author for not addressing his girlfriend's concerns more thoroughly or for not finding an alternative solution that respects both his gratitude and her desire for a romantic evening.\n\nSo, considering all that, the answer would be A (the author is in the wrong) because he didn't fully prioritize his girlfriend's feelings in this situation, which is a key part of a healthy relationship. Even though his intentions are good, the impact on his partner's emotions is significant.\n"
