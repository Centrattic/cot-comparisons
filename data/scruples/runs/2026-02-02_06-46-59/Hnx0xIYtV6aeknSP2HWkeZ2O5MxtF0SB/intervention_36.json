With prom coming up soon, we sat down to talk about our plans. Well, at work the other day, the subject of prom came up at work too. I started to talk to my friend (20 F) about it. It turns out that she never got to go to her prom because she was in the hospital. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWell, this friend is pretty important to me. When I started my job almost a year and a half ago, I lacked almost any social skills. This friend was the first person to really talk to me and treat me like a friend. She helped me through one of the most trying times of my life, as I also had severe social anxiety prior to starting this job. While my friend probably doesn't know this, my progress to having the social skills I do now is largely in part to her. I see this as an opportunity to give back to her for helping me.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy girlfriend is opposed to me wanting to take her with us because she says that this should be our special night, and she wants me to herself. I hold the position that I want to take her due to the aforementioned reasons. So what do you guys think? AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for wanting to bring another girl (his friend) to prom with his girlfriend. The girlfriend is upset because she wants it to be a special night just for the two of them. The author justifies it by saying his friend helped him a lot and missed prom due to being in the hospital.\n\nFirst, the key points here are consent and communication. The author didn't discuss this with his girlfriend before talking to his friend. He mentions that his friend was important in his life and helped him through social anxiety. However, the girlfriend's feelings about the prom being their special night are valid. Prom is typically seen as a romantic event between couples, so bringing a third person might be seen as inconsiderate. \n\nThe author didn't consult his girlfriend first, which could be a big issue. Even if the friend is close, the girlfriend's perspective is that this is their time. The fact that the friend didn't get to go to prom might seem like a reason to include her, but prom is usually a two-person event. There's also the aspect of social norms\u2014bringing a third person to a date could be seen as not respecting the girlfriend's wishes. \n\nHowever, the author's intentions are to repay his friend's support. But he should have discussed this with his girlfriend first. Since he didn't, and she's upset, it's possible that he's in the wrong because he didn't consider her feelings and the significance of the event to her. The answer leans towards AITA (Am I the A**hole?), so the author is likely in the wrong here.\n"
