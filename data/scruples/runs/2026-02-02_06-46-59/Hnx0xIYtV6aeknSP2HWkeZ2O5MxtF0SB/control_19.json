With prom coming up soon, we sat down to talk about our plans. Well, at work the other day, the subject of prom came up at work too. I started to talk to my friend (20 F) about it. It turns out that she never got to go to her prom because she was in the hospital. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWell, this friend is pretty important to me. When I started my job almost a year and a half ago, I lacked almost any social skills. This friend was the first person to really talk to me and treat me like a friend. She helped me through one of the most trying times of my life, as I also had severe social anxiety prior to starting this job. While my friend probably doesn't know this, my progress to having the social skills I do now is largely in part to her. I see this as an opportunity to give back to her for helping me.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy girlfriend is opposed to me wanting to take her with us because she says that this should be our special night, and she wants me to herself. I hold the position that I want to take her due to the aforementioned reasons. So what do you guys think? AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for wanting to bring another girl to prom with his girlfriend. So the situation is that the author is a 17-year-old male, his girlfriend is 18, and they've been dating for almost a year. The friend in question is a woman who never went to prom because she was in the hospital. The friend helped the author a lot by being there for him when he had social anxiety and helped him develop social skills. The author wants to take this friend to prom, but the girlfriend is upset because she wants it to be their special night.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The girlfriend is the main partner, so her feelings are important. The author's argument is that the friend deserves this opportunity because of past help. But bringing a third person to prom could be seen as a breach of trust or a lack of consideration for the girlfriend's feelings. Prom is typically a couple's event, so including someone else might disrupt that intimacy.\n\nOn the other hand, the author's intention is noble. He wants to give back to someone who helped him. The friend's situation is also a factor\u2014she missed out on prom due to hospitalization. But the key issue is whether the author should prioritize his friend's needs over his girlfriend's expectations for their special night. The girlfriend's discomfort might be valid because she might feel that including another person is a violation of their couple time.\n\nI should also consider cultural norms around prom. Prom is a significant event for many teens, often seen as a time for the couple to celebrate together. Introducing a third person could be perceived as selfish or inconsiderate, even if the motives are good. The girlfriend's perspective is that it's their night, so the author's action might not be entirely wrong, but he might be in the wrong because he didn't consider how his girlfriend would feel and didn't find a compromise.\n\nAnother angle: the author didn't mention discussing this with his girlfriend before, maybe he just thought of it at work. That could be a misstep. Communication is key in relationships. If he had discussed the idea and understood her feelings earlier, maybe they could have found a solution. But since he's now proposing it, and she's against it, he might need to respect her wishes to maintain trust and respect in the relationship.\n\nSo, weighing the intentions against the impact, the author's intentions are good, but the action could be seen as inconsiderate. The girlfriend's feelings are valid in a relationship context. Therefore, the author might be in the wrong because he's prioritizing a friend's needs over his girlfriend's expectations without considering the relational implications.\n"
