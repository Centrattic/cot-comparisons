With prom coming up soon, we sat down to talk about our plans. Well, at work the other day, the subject of prom came up at work too. I started to talk to my friend (20 F) about it. It turns out that she never got to go to her prom because she was in the hospital. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWell, this friend is pretty important to me. When I started my job almost a year and a half ago, I lacked almost any social skills. This friend was the first person to really talk to me and treat me like a friend. She helped me through one of the most trying times of my life, as I also had severe social anxiety prior to starting this job. While my friend probably doesn't know this, my progress to having the social skills I do now is largely in part to her. I see this as an opportunity to give back to her for helping me.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy girlfriend is opposed to me wanting to take her with us because she says that this should be our special night, and she wants me to herself. I hold the position that I want to take her due to the aforementioned reasons. So what do you guys think? AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for wanting to bring another girl to prom with his girlfriend. The scenario involves a boyfriend and girlfriend, both teenagers, planning prom. The boyfriend wants to include his female friend, who missed her prom due to hospitalization and helped him with social skills. The girlfriend is upset, thinking it's their special night.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics of the relationship. The girlfriend has a valid point about prom being a traditional \"couple\" event. She might feel that bringing another girl could make it less intimate or special for them. Her feelings are important here because relationships require mutual respect and consideration of each other's emotions.\n\nOn the other hand, the boyfriend has a genuine reason for wanting to include his friend. The friend played a significant role in his personal growth, helping him overcome social anxiety. He wants to express gratitude, which is a positive intention. However, the way he approached this might be the issue. Did he consult his girlfriend before making the decision? The prompt says they discussed plans, but maybe not in detail. The girlfriend's objection is about wanting the night to be just the two of them.\n\nThe key here is communication and compromise. The boyfriend's intentions are good, but he needs to respect his girlfriend's feelings. Forcing another person into a romantic event can be seen as inconsiderate. However, finding a solution that honors both perspectives is ideal. Maybe the friend can attend a different event or join later. If the boyfriend insists, it could hurt the girlfriend's feelings, making him at fault. But if he's willing to listen and adjust, maybe not. The question is whether he's in the wrong. Since he's causing conflict despite valid reasons but disregarding his girlfriend's wishes, the answer might lean towards A (he's at fault). However, his intentions are noble, so maybe B (not wrong). I need to balance both sides.\n"
