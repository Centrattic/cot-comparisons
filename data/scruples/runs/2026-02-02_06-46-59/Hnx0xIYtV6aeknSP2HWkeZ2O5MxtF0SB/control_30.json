With prom coming up soon, we sat down to talk about our plans. Well, at work the other day, the subject of prom came up at work too. I started to talk to my friend (20 F) about it. It turns out that she never got to go to her prom because she was in the hospital. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWell, this friend is pretty important to me. When I started my job almost a year and a half ago, I lacked almost any social skills. This friend was the first person to really talk to me and treat me like a friend. She helped me through one of the most trying times of my life, as I also had severe social anxiety prior to starting this job. While my friend probably doesn't know this, my progress to having the social skills I do now is largely in part to her. I see this as an opportunity to give back to her for helping me.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy girlfriend is opposed to me wanting to take her with us because she says that this should be our special night, and she wants me to herself. I hold the position that I want to take her due to the aforementioned reasons. So what do you guys think? AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the question is in the wrong for wanting to bring another girl to prom with his girlfriend.\n\nSo the setup is: He's 17, his girlfriend is 18, they've been dating almost a year. His friend, a 20-year-old woman, didn't get to go to prom because she was in the hospital. He feels she's important to him because she helped him when he had social anxiety and improved his social skills. He wants to take her to prom as a way of giving back. His girlfriend is upset because she wants it to be their special night. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the girlfriend's perspective. She's expecting a romantic night, just the two of them. Bringing another person might make her feel like he's prioritizing someone else over her. That's a valid concern. Prom is often seen as a significant event for couples, so her feeling hurt makes sense.\n\nThen there's the author's reasoning. He's trying to show gratitude and kindness to a friend who helped him a lot. He values their friendship, which is understandable. But the question is whether that's an acceptable reason to include another person in what's typically a couple's event.\n\nPossible angles to consider: \n\n1. Is the friend his girlfriend's friend too? If not, it might seem like he's bringing someone without considering her. \n\n2. The age difference: the friend is older than both of them. Maybe the girlfriend sees this as him being more interested in an older woman, which could cause jealousy.\n\n3. The main issue is consent and communication. Did he check with his girlfriend before making plans to bring someone else? It sounds like he considered it, but maybe didn't get her approval first. \n\nAlso, the friend's situation is sad\u2014she missed prom. But does that justify including her in his prom plans with his girlfriend? Maybe there's a way to honor her situation without compromising his relationship's expectations.\n\nAnother point: The author's explanation about his friend helping him is heartfelt. But relationships require mutual respect. If the girlfriend feels this is important to her, her feelings might take precedence unless he can find a middle ground.\n\nPossible solutions: Maybe the author could invite the friend to a different event, or have a separate time to celebrate with her, instead of taking her to prom with his girlfriend. But since he's already asked, the girlfriend's objection is valid.\n\nSo, the author might be in the wrong because he's not respecting his girlfriend's wishes for a private night. Even if his intentions are good, the girlfriend's feelings are important in the relationship. The key here is whether the action of bringing someone else is considerate towards his partner's needs.\n"
