With prom coming up soon, we sat down to talk about our plans. Well, at work the other day, the subject of prom came up at work too. I started to talk to my friend (20 F) about it. It turns out that she never got to go to her prom because she was in the hospital. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWell, this friend is pretty important to me. When I started my job almost a year and a half ago, I lacked almost any social skills. This friend was the first person to really talk to me and treat me like a friend. She helped me through one of the most trying times of my life, as I also had severe social anxiety prior to starting this job. While my friend probably doesn't know this, my progress to having the social skills I do now is largely in part to her. I see this as an opportunity to give back to her for helping me.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy girlfriend is opposed to me wanting to take her with us because she says that this should be our special night, and she wants me to herself. I hold the position that I want to take her due to the aforementioned reasons. So what do you guys think? AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking if the person is in the wrong for wanting to bring another girl to prom with his girlfriend. Let's break down the details.\n\nFirst, the scenario: the user is 17, his girlfriend is 18, they've been dating almost a year. He wants to take his female friend, who's 20 and never went to prom because she was hospitalized. The friend helped him when he had social anxiety and lacked social skills. Now he wants to take her to prom as a way to give back. The girlfriend is upset because she wants the prom to be their special night.\n\nSo, the main issue here is whether inviting another person to a couple's event is appropriate. Let's consider the girlfriend's perspective. Prom is traditionally a romantic event for couples. If she's expecting it to be just the two of them, bringing a third person might feel like a breach of trust or a lack of consideration. The boyfriend is justified in wanting to thank his friend, but does that outweigh the girlfriend's feelings?\n\nThe user's argument is that the friend helped him significantly, and he wants to give back. However, relationships require communication and mutual respect. The girlfriend's feelings are valid here. Even if the intention is good, the boyfriend might not have considered how this would affect his girlfriend. The key point is that the girlfriend is opposed, so the boyfriend should prioritize her feelings unless there's an agreement otherwise. \n\nAlso, the friend not having gone to prom before is a unique situation, but it's the girlfriend's first prom as well. The boyfriend might be trying to balance both, but he needs to address the girlfriend's concerns first. It's possible he didn't check with her before making plans with the friend. \n\nIn relationships, respecting each other's needs is crucial. While the intention was good, not considering the girlfriend's perspective could lead to hurt feelings. The answer likely leans towards the author being in the wrong because he's prioritizing his friend's needs over his girlfriend's expectations without resolving the conflict first.\n"
