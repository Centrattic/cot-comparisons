With prom coming up soon, we sat down to talk about our plans. Well, at work the other day, the subject of prom came up at work too. I started to talk to my friend (20 F) about it. It turns out that she never got to go to her prom because she was in the hospital. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWell, this friend is pretty important to me. When I started my job almost a year and a half ago, I lacked almost any social skills. This friend was the first person to really talk to me and treat me like a friend. She helped me through one of the most trying times of my life, as I also had severe social anxiety prior to starting this job. While my friend probably doesn't know this, my progress to having the social skills I do now is largely in part to her. I see this as an opportunity to give back to her for helping me.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy girlfriend is opposed to me wanting to take her with us because she says that this should be our special night, and she wants me to herself. I hold the position that I want to take her due to the aforementioned reasons. So what do you guys think? AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the person who wrote this is in the wrong. The situation is about wanting to bring a female friend to prom with their girlfriend. The user is 17, their girlfriend is 18, and the friend is 20. The friend didn't get to go to prom because she was in the hospital. The friend helped the user when they were struggling with social anxiety and social skills.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the girlfriend's perspective. She wants the prom to be a special, intimate night with just the two of them. That's understandable because prom is often seen as a significant event in a relationship. She might feel that including another person, even if it's a friend, could take away from that experience. Jealousy or insecurity might be factors here, especially if the girlfriend feels less included or if there's any history of tension between her and the friend.\n\nOn the other hand, the user argues that bringing the friend is a way to give back for the support they received. The friend helped them during a tough time, and they want to express gratitude. This is a noble intention, and the user might feel that it's important to acknowledge the friend's impact on their life. However, the user is trying to balance their personal gratitude with the expectations of their romantic partner.\n\nNow, considering the dynamics here. The user's request could be seen as a conflict between personal values and relationship expectations. The girlfriend might feel that the user is prioritizing a friendship over the romantic relationship, even if that's not the case. It's possible that the user didn't communicate their reasons clearly enough to the girlfriend, leading to misunderstanding.\n\nAnother angle is the social norms around prom. Typically, prom is a two-person event, so adding a third person might disrupt the usual experience. The girlfriend's opposition might stem from the fact that it's not just about the event but also about the social expectations and how others might perceive it. The user might not have considered how their girlfriend feels about being in a group of three, which could make her feel excluded or even embarrassed in front of others.\n\nAdditionally, the user's age (17) and the girlfriend's age (18) might influence their perspectives. The girlfriend might be more mature in handling such situations, or maybe she's just more invested in making prom a romantic experience. The user might need to recognize that while their intentions are good, the girlfriend's feelings are equally valid.\n\nBut then again, the user's reasons are rooted in gratitude and a genuine desire to help a friend who missed out on a key experience. The friend's situation is unique, having been in the hospital, so the user might see this as an opportunity to make up for that. However, the user needs to weigh this against the girlfriend's feelings. It's possible that there's a solution where both parties can be satisfied, like finding another way to include the friend, such as a group activity after prom, but going to prom as a trio might not be the best approach.\n\nIn terms of fault, the user might be in the wrong if they are prioritizing their desire to include the friend without fully considering the girlfriend's perspective. Relationships require compromise, and if the girlfriend clearly opposes the idea, the user might need to respect that to maintain harmony. However, if the user can find a middle ground or if the girlfriend is being unreasonable, the fault might lie elsewhere. But given the information, the user's actions could be seen as inconsiderate of the girlfriend's feelings, making them at fault.\n"
