With prom coming up soon, we sat down to talk about our plans. Well, at work the other day, the subject of prom came up at work too. I started to talk to my friend (20 F) about it. It turns out that she never got to go to her prom because she was in the hospital. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWell, this friend is pretty important to me. When I started my job almost a year and a half ago, I lacked almost any social skills. This friend was the first person to really talk to me and treat me like a friend. She helped me through one of the most trying times of my life, as I also had severe social anxiety prior to starting this job. While my friend probably doesn't know this, my progress to having the social skills I do now is largely in part to her. I see this as an opportunity to give back to her for helping me.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy girlfriend is opposed to me wanting to take her with us because she says that this should be our special night, and she wants me to herself. I hold the position that I want to take her due to the aforementioned reasons. So what do you guys think? AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for wanting to bring another girl to prom with his girlfriend. The situation is that the author and his girlfriend are planning to go to prom together. The author has a female friend who missed her prom because she was in the hospital, and he wants to include her. The girlfriend is upset because she wants the night to be special just for the two of them.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The author is in a relationship, and his girlfriend feels that including another person is taking away from their special time. On the other hand, the author has a close friend who he feels has helped him a lot, and he wants to give back by including her in the prom experience.\n\nSo, the key points are: the girlfriend's feelings about wanting the night to be exclusive, and the author's desire to include a friend out of gratitude. The question is whether the author is wrong for wanting to do this.\n\nI think this is a classic case of conflicting expectations within a relationship. The girlfriend likely sees prom as a significant milestone that should be shared only between the couple. The author, however, values his friendship and wants to honor that. The problem arises because the author didn't consult his girlfriend first and is now trying to include someone else without considering her feelings.\n\nFrom the girlfriend's perspective, it's natural to feel that the prom should be their special night. If the author had discussed this idea with her earlier, maybe they could have found a compromise. But since he waited until he was talking to his friend at work and then proposed it, it might come off as dismissive of her feelings. \n\nOn the other hand, the author's intentions are noble\u2014wanting to include a friend who helped him. However, relationships require consideration of both partners' feelings. The author may not be malicious, but his actions could be seen as not respecting his girlfriend's wishes. The main issue is communication. If the author had discussed this with his girlfriend before making the decision, there might have been a way to address her concerns. \n\nIn terms of right or wrong, it's a bit of a gray area. The author's intentions are good, but the way he approached the situation might have been inconsiderate. The girlfriend's feelings are valid, and the author should have prioritized her perspective. So, I think the answer is that the author is somewhat in the wrong because he didn't communicate properly and included the friend without considering his girlfriend's feelings first. But it's not a clear-cut yes or no. However, based on typical expectations in relationships, the answer would lean towards A, the author is in the wrong.\n"
