With prom coming up soon, we sat down to talk about our plans. Well, at work the other day, the subject of prom came up at work too. I started to talk to my friend (20 F) about it. It turns out that she never got to go to her prom because she was in the hospital. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWell, this friend is pretty important to me. When I started my job almost a year and a half ago, I lacked almost any social skills. This friend was the first person to really talk to me and treat me like a friend. She helped me through one of the most trying times of my life, as I also had severe social anxiety prior to starting this job. While my friend probably doesn't know this, my progress to having the social skills I do now is largely in part to her. I see this as an opportunity to give back to her for helping me.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy girlfriend is opposed to me wanting to take her with us because she says that this should be our special night, and she wants me to herself. I hold the position that I want to take her due to the aforementioned reasons. So what do you guys think? AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for wanting to bring another girl to prom with his girlfriend. So the setup is the author is a guy, 17, girlfriend is 18, and he wants to bring his female friend, 20, who missed her prom because of the hospital. The friend was a big help to him when he was struggling with social skills and anxiety.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the girlfriend's perspective. She wants the prom to be their special night and doesn't want to share him. The author thinks he's doing the right thing by giving back to his friend. But bringing another girl to prom with the girlfriend could be seen as a breach of trust or respect for the girlfriend's feelings. \n\nProm is typically a romantic event, so the girlfriend's expectation of it being a two-person thing is understandable. The author's friend might not have bad intentions, but including her could make the girlfriend feel neglected or like her partner isn't prioritizing her. \n\nAlso, the author's reasoning is about gratitude, but he needs to consider if his actions are respecting his girlfriend's feelings. The friend's absence from prom is a personal history, but the author's solution might not be the one his girlfriend wants. The key here is about communication and mutual respect. If the girlfriend is opposed, then the author might be in the wrong for not valuing her feelings over his intentions.\n\nSo, even though the author has good intentions, the girlfriend's feelings are important in a relationship. The decision to include another person in a romantic event can be seen as disregarding the partner's needs. Therefore, the answer might be A, the author is in the wrong.\n"
