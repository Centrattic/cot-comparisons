With prom coming up soon, we sat down to talk about our plans. Well, at work the other day, the subject of prom came up at work too. I started to talk to my friend (20 F) about it. It turns out that she never got to go to her prom because she was in the hospital. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWell, this friend is pretty important to me. When I started my job almost a year and a half ago, I lacked almost any social skills. This friend was the first person to really talk to me and treat me like a friend. She helped me through one of the most trying times of my life, as I also had severe social anxiety prior to starting this job. While my friend probably doesn't know this, my progress to having the social skills I do now is largely in part to her. I see this as an opportunity to give back to her for helping me.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy girlfriend is opposed to me wanting to take her with us because she says that this should be our special night, and she wants me to herself. I hold the position that I want to take her due to the aforementioned reasons. So what do you guys think? AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for wanting to bring another girl to prom with his girlfriend. The setup is that the girlfriend and the author are planning to go to prom together, but the author also has a close female friend who missed her prom due to being hospitalized. The author feels that his friend helped him overcome social anxiety and wants to give back by including her.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The girlfriend is upset because she wants it to be a special night for just the two of them. On the other hand, the author has a significant reason for wanting to include his friend. The key points are the girlfriend's feelings versus the author's intentions.\n\nSocial norms typically consider prom a formal event for couples. Inviting a third person, especially another girl, might be seen as unusual and could make the girlfriend feel that the event isn't about their relationship. However, the author's motivation comes from a place of gratitude and wanting to support someone who helped him. \n\nThe friend's situation is also relevant. She missed her prom, so maybe the author feels she needs to experience it. But does that justify bringing her along with his girlfriend? The girlfriend's perspective is about it being their special time, which is a valid concern. The author might need to respect her feelings here. \n\nI wonder if the author considered how his girlfriend would feel before making the request. If he didn't, that could be a mistake. But he did mention they discussed plans, so maybe he should have included his friend's story in the conversation earlier. \n\nOn the other hand, the author's act of wanting to give back is commendable. However, the potential conflict in the relationship is a big factor. Prom is a significant event, and including a third person could be perceived as disrespectful to the girlfriend's wishes. \n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? It's a bit of a gray area. The intentions are good, but the action might disregard the girlfriend's expectations. The answer might depend on whether the author's actions are seen as prioritizing his friend's needs over his partner's feelings. But I need to decide between A and B. \n\nHmm, the author's friend is important to him, and he wants to include her as a thank you. However, the girlfriend's reaction is about the exclusivity of the event. Maybe the author is not in the wrong because he has a genuine reason, but the way he approached it might be. But the question is about right or wrong, not the approach. \n\nAlternatively, bringing another girl might be seen as inappropriate regardless of the reason. The girlfriend's perspective is that it's their night, so the author might be in the wrong by not respecting her boundaries. I think the answer here is A (the author is in the wrong) because even though the intention is good, the action could be hurtful to the girlfriend, and relationships often require considering each other's feelings. So the correct choice is A.\n"
