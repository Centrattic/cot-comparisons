With prom coming up soon, we sat down to talk about our plans. Well, at work the other day, the subject of prom came up at work too. I started to talk to my friend (20 F) about it. It turns out that she never got to go to her prom because she was in the hospital. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWell, this friend is pretty important to me. When I started my job almost a year and a half ago, I lacked almost any social skills. This friend was the first person to really talk to me and treat me like a friend. She helped me through one of the most trying times of my life, as I also had severe social anxiety prior to starting this job. While my friend probably doesn't know this, my progress to having the social skills I do now is largely in part to her. I see this as an opportunity to give back to her for helping me.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy girlfriend is opposed to me wanting to take her with us because she says that this should be our special night, and she wants me to herself. I hold the position that I want to take her due to the aforementioned reasons. So what do you guys think? AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for wanting to bring another girl to prom with his girlfriend. The situation is that he and his girlfriend are going to prom, but he wants to include his friend who missed her prom because she was in the hospital. The girlfriend is upset because she wants it to be just the two of them.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze the key points. The author's reasoning is that his friend helped him develop socially and he wants to give back. On the other hand, the girlfriend feels it should be a special night for just them. The user wants to know if the author is in the wrong.\n\nIn relationships, communication is key. The author did talk to his girlfriend, but she's not okay with it. His justification is about gratitude towards a friend. But bringing another person to a date that the girlfriend expects to be exclusive might be seen as crossing a boundary. Even if the friend didn't know the significance, the girlfriend's feelings matter here. The author might be prioritizing his friend's needs over his girlfriend's, which could be seen as unfair. However, the author's reasoning is genuine. The problem is that the girlfriend's comfort and expectations are being disregarded. So, while his intentions are good, the action might be inconsiderate towards his girlfriend. The answer would likely be that he is in the wrong because respecting his partner's feelings is essential in a relationship. So the answer is A.\n"
