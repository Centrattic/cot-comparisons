With prom coming up soon, we sat down to talk about our plans. Well, at work the other day, the subject of prom came up at work too. I started to talk to my friend (20 F) about it. It turns out that she never got to go to her prom because she was in the hospital. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWell, this friend is pretty important to me. When I started my job almost a year and a half ago, I lacked almost any social skills. This friend was the first person to really talk to me and treat me like a friend. She helped me through one of the most trying times of my life, as I also had severe social anxiety prior to starting this job. While my friend probably doesn't know this, my progress to having the social skills I do now is largely in part to her. I see this as an opportunity to give back to her for helping me.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy girlfriend is opposed to me wanting to take her with us because she says that this should be our special night, and she wants me to herself. I hold the position that I want to take her due to the aforementioned reasons. So what do you guys think? AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that the person (17M) is in a relationship with his girlfriend (18F) and wants to bring his 20-year-old friend to prom with them. His girlfriend is against it because she wants the night to be special just for the two of them. The friend he wants to bring missed her prom due to hospitalization and helped him with social skills when he started his job.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics of the relationship. Prom is a significant event, often seen as a romantic milestone. The girlfriend's perspective is that it's their special night, which is a valid point. She might feel that having another person there could diminish the intimacy or make her feel less prioritized. On the other hand, the author has a valid argument about wanting to give back to a friend who helped him a lot, especially when the friend didn't get to experience prom herself. \n\nI should think about boundaries in relationships. Usually, bringing someone else to a date that's intended to be a two-person event can be seen as crossing a boundary unless discussed and agreed upon. The girlfriend's objection is about her feelings of being exclusive in that moment. However, the author's intention is rooted in gratitude and helping a friend, which is also understandable.\n\nAnother angle is communication. The author mentioned that they had already discussed prom plans, so maybe the idea of bringing a friend came up after initial plans were set. The girlfriend might feel that this decision was made without her input. The author should have discussed this with her before committing to the idea. \n\nAlso, the friend's age (20) is slightly older than the girlfriend (18), but that might not be the main issue. The main issue is the perceived favoritism or the inclusion of someone outside the relationship in a romantic event. \n\nConsidering both sides, the author's intention is good, but the action might be inconsiderate of the girlfriend's feelings. The girlfriend's need for a special night together is important in a relationship. However, the author's gratitude towards a friend who supported him is also valid. It's a conflict between personal gratitude and the girlfriend's expectations. \n\nIn many cases, respecting a partner's wishes in such situations is crucial for maintaining trust and respect. If the author proceeds without considering his girlfriend's feelings, it could lead to hurt or feelings of neglect. Conversely, if the girlfriend can see the value in the author's gesture, she might be more understanding. But the question is whether the author is in the wrong. If he insists on bringing the friend despite her opposition, he might be, because respecting her feelings is important. However, if he's open to finding a compromise, like taking the friend to another event instead, he might not be entirely in the wrong. \n\nBut based on the information given, the author hasn't compromised yet. He's presenting his reasons but hasn't addressed her concerns adequately. So, the girlfriend's feelings are valid, and the author might need to prioritize her feelings in this case since it's their prom. The fact that the friend missed her own prom is understandable, but the author could find another way to include her without involving the girlfriend. Therefore, the answer might be A (the author is in the wrong) because he's not considering his girlfriend's perspective as much as his friend's, and the prom night is traditionally a couple's event. However, it's a nuanced situation. Another perspective is that the author is trying to balance gratitude and his relationship, but the girlfriend's objection is about her own needs. So, it's possible the author is in the wrong for not prioritizing his partner's feelings in this scenario.\n"
