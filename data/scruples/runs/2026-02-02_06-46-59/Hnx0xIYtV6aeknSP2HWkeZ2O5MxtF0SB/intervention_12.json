With prom coming up soon, we sat down to talk about our plans. Well, at work the other day, the subject of prom came up at work too. I started to talk to my friend (20 F) about it. It turns out that she never got to go to her prom because she was in the hospital. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWell, this friend is pretty important to me. When I started my job almost a year and a half ago, I lacked almost any social skills. This friend was the first person to really talk to me and treat me like a friend. She helped me through one of the most trying times of my life, as I also had severe social anxiety prior to starting this job. While my friend probably doesn't know this, my progress to having the social skills I do now is largely in part to her. I see this as an opportunity to give back to her for helping me.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy girlfriend is opposed to me wanting to take her with us because she says that this should be our special night, and she wants me to herself. I hold the position that I want to take her due to the aforementioned reasons. So what do you guys think? AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the \"Am I the Asshole?\" scenario is in the wrong for wanting to bring another girl to prom with his girlfriend. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the guy and his girlfriend have been dating almost a year. Prom is a big event for couples, usually meant to be a special, intimate time. The guy wants to invite his female friend who missed prom due to hospitalization. The friend helped him a lot when he was struggling with social anxiety, so he wants to give back.\n\nThe girlfriend is upset because she wants the night to be just the two of them. The guy feels it's important to include his friend for gratitude and support. Now, the question is whether the guy is wrong.\n\nHmm. On one hand, the guy's intention is commendable. He's trying to be kind and repay a friend. But prom is traditionally a couple's event. Including another person might make the girlfriend feel neglected or not prioritized. Relationships require considering each other's feelings. If the girlfriend is clearly against it, the guy should probably respect her wishes.\n\nThe guy's argument is about giving back, but he's putting his friend in a position where she might be the third wheel or cause tension between the couple. Also, bringing another girl to a prom with his girlfriend could be seen as not respecting the girlfriend's desire for exclusivity. Even if the friend is just a companion, it changes the dynamic of the event.\n\nSo, while the guy's motives are good, the action might be inconsiderate of his girlfriend's feelings. The girlfriend has a valid point about wanting the night to be special for them. The guy should have discussed this more carefully and maybe found another way to support his friend without compromising the couple's plans.\n"
