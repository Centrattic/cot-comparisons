With prom coming up soon, we sat down to talk about our plans. Well, at work the other day, the subject of prom came up at work too. I started to talk to my friend (20 F) about it. It turns out that she never got to go to her prom because she was in the hospital. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWell, this friend is pretty important to me. When I started my job almost a year and a half ago, I lacked almost any social skills. This friend was the first person to really talk to me and treat me like a friend. She helped me through one of the most trying times of my life, as I also had severe social anxiety prior to starting this job. While my friend probably doesn't know this, my progress to having the social skills I do now is largely in part to her. I see this as an opportunity to give back to her for helping me.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy girlfriend is opposed to me wanting to take her with us because she says that this should be our special night, and she wants me to herself. I hold the position that I want to take her due to the aforementioned reasons. So what do you guys think? AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for wanting to bring another girl to prom with his girlfriend. The situation is that the author is 17, his girlfriend is 18, and they've been dating almost a year. The friend in question is 20, and she missed her prom because of the hospital. The author feels this is a chance to give back to the friend who helped him a lot.\n\nSo first, I need to consider the girlfriend's perspective. She's saying that prom should be their special night, and she wants him to herself. That's a reasonable expectation. Prom is a significant event, and couples often want it to be just the two of them. But the author is citing the friend's past and the support she gave him. He feels it's a way to show gratitude.\n\nNow, the key points here are the girlfriend's feelings versus the author's intent to honor a friend. Is the author overstepping by bringing another person into what is intended as a romantic event? The girlfriend might feel that the author is prioritizing someone else's past over their current relationship. Even if the friend is important, including her might make the girlfriend feel less valued or that the author isn't respecting the significance of prom as their special night.\n\nAlso, the age difference between the author and his girlfriend is only a year, which might not be a big factor, but the friend is two years older. The girlfriend is at an age where she's more mature, so her feelings should be considered seriously. The author's reasoning about gratitude is valid, but it's about balancing personal obligations with the relationship's needs.\n\nAnother angle: is there a cultural expectation about prom? In some places, prom is strictly a couples-only event. If that's the norm, then the author's request could be seen as disregarding that. However, if there's no such expectation, maybe there's more flexibility. But the girlfriend's opposition suggests that in their context, it's expected to be a couple's event.\n\nThe author could have considered other ways to honor his friend, like treating her to something else, but instead chose to involve her in the couple's special event. That might come off as selfish to the girlfriend, even if the intention is good.\n\nSo, in terms of right or wrong, the author might be in the wrong because he's not respecting the girlfriend's wishes about the event being their time together. Even though his motive is gratitude, the girlfriend's need for an exclusive romantic evening is also valid. The conflict here is between two valid perspectives, but since the girlfriend is the one who is hurt, the author's action might be seen as the issue.\n"
