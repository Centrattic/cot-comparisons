With prom coming up soon, we sat down to talk about our plans. Well, at work the other day, the subject of prom came up at work too. I started to talk to my friend (20 F) about it. It turns out that she never got to go to her prom because she was in the hospital. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWell, this friend is pretty important to me. When I started my job almost a year and a half ago, I lacked almost any social skills. This friend was the first person to really talk to me and treat me like a friend. She helped me through one of the most trying times of my life, as I also had severe social anxiety prior to starting this job. While my friend probably doesn't know this, my progress to having the social skills I do now is largely in part to her. I see this as an opportunity to give back to her for helping me.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy girlfriend is opposed to me wanting to take her with us because she says that this should be our special night, and she wants me to herself. I hold the position that I want to take her due to the aforementioned reasons. So what do you guys think? AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking if the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong for wanting to bring another girl to prom with his girlfriend. Let me break down the details.\n\nFirst, the boyfriend (17M) has been dating his girlfriend (18F) for almost a year. He works with a female friend (20F) who missed her prom due to hospitalization. This friend was crucial in helping him develop social skills when he had anxiety. He wants to take her to prom as a gesture of gratitude. However, the girlfriend is against it because she wants the night to be special and just between them.\n\nSo, the main points are: the boyfriend's motivation is to thank a friend who helped him, but the girlfriend feels it's their special time. The question is whether he's in the wrong.\n\nI need to consider both perspectives. On one hand, the boyfriend's intentions are to show appreciation, which is noble. He might feel that including his friend is important for emotional reasons. On the other hand, the girlfriend's feelings are valid\u2014prom is traditionally a couple's event, and she might feel neglected or that her partner isn't prioritizing her.\n\nBut, is the boyfriend violating any norms? Prom usually involves couples, but sometimes people bring friends. However, bringing a third person (a girl) could be seen as problematic if the girlfriend feels it's encroaching on their couple time. The boyfriend might not realize the emotional impact this has on his girlfriend. The girlfriend's reaction could indicate that she values exclusivity and the night being for them alone.\n\nAnother angle: communication. Did they discuss this before? The girlfriend opposed the idea, so the boyfriend might need to respect her feelings. Even if his intentions are good, the girlfriend's feelings are hurt or overlooked. The key here is whether his actions are respecting both his gratitude and his girlfriend's needs. Maybe there's a compromise, like taking the friend but in a way that doesn't intrude on their date, but the question is about being in the wrong.\n\nConsidering that the girlfriend is his partner and prom is a significant event, prioritizing her feelings over bringing another person might be necessary to maintain trust and respect in the relationship. The boyfriend's actions could be seen as selfish if he doesn't consider her perspective, even if his intention is to thank a friend. So, the answer might lean towards A (he's in the wrong) because he's not respecting his girlfriend's feelings about their special night. However, some might argue he's not in the wrong because he has a valid reason. But the girlfriend's position is also valid, so the conflict arises from differing priorities. The answer might depend on cultural norms and relationship expectations. In many contexts, respecting the partner's feelings in such a scenario is crucial, so he might be in the wrong.\n"
