With prom coming up soon, we sat down to talk about our plans. Well, at work the other day, the subject of prom came up at work too. I started to talk to my friend (20 F) about it. It turns out that she never got to go to her prom because she was in the hospital. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWell, this friend is pretty important to me. When I started my job almost a year and a half ago, I lacked almost any social skills. This friend was the first person to really talk to me and treat me like a friend. She helped me through one of the most trying times of my life, as I also had severe social anxiety prior to starting this job. While my friend probably doesn't know this, my progress to having the social skills I do now is largely in part to her. I see this as an opportunity to give back to her for helping me.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy girlfriend is opposed to me wanting to take her with us because she says that this should be our special night, and she wants me to herself. I hold the position that I want to take her due to the aforementioned reasons. So what do you guys think? AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the person asking the \"Am I the Asshole\" question is in the wrong for wanting to bring another girl to prom with his girlfriend. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the situation: the person is a 17-year-old male in a relationship with his 18-year-old girlfriend for almost a year. He wants to take his female friend, who's 20 and missed her prom due to hospitalization, to prom with them. The friend is important because she helped him when he had social anxiety and was struggling socially. His girlfriend doesn't want to share the night and is upset about it.\n\nSo, the main conflict here is between the girlfriend's desire for a private, special night and the boyfriend's intention to include someone who helped him. Let me think about the key points.\n\n1. **Respecting the Girlfriend's Feelings:** The girlfriend is the partner, and her feelings about the prom being their special night are valid. She's the one he's in a committed relationship with, so her desire for exclusivity makes sense. If he's going to prioritize someone else's needs over her comfort, that could be a problem.\n\n2. **Intentions Matter:** The author's intention is to give back to the friend who helped him. That's a noble reason, but does that justify going against his girlfriend's wishes? The friend might not need to be included in such a personal event.\n\n3. **Communication:** The author mentioned discussing prom plans with his girlfriend, but he also talked about it at work with the friend. Maybe there was a lack of communication about why he wanted to bring her. If he had explained his reasons more clearly from the start, maybe they could have found a compromise.\n\n4. **Prom Traditions:** Prom is typically a couple's event. Bringing another person might disrupt the traditional dynamic and make the girlfriend feel less prioritized. However, some people might have different traditions or be okay with group events. But since the girlfriend is against it, that's a personal boundary he's crossing.\n\n5. **Social Norms and Expectations:** In many cultures, bringing a third person to a couple's event like prom can be seen as inconsiderate, especially if it's the partner's main request. The girlfriend might feel that her partner isn't respecting her in the relationship.\n\n6. **Friend's Perspective:** The friend didn't get to go to prom, but is that a valid reason for the couple to include her? The author's friend might not expect to be taken to prom, especially since she's not in a relationship with him. It could be about his own guilt or desire to make up for her missing out, but it's not the friend's right to be included in his relationship event.\n\n7. **Balance of Relationships:** While the friend was instrumental in helping him, the girlfriend is his partner. The author might be confusing gratitude towards a friend with the expectations of a romantic relationship. He needs to prioritize his partner's feelings in this case.\n\n8. **Possible Compromise:** Instead of bringing the friend to prom, maybe they could do something else together, like a separate event or just a dinner. That way, he can honor his friend without conflicting with his girlfriend's wishes.\n\nConsidering all these points, the main issue is about respect for the girlfriend's feelings versus the author's desire to honor his friend. While the author has valid reasons, the girlfriend's right to have a special night with her partner is more central in a romantic relationship. The author might be in the wrong because he's prioritizing a friend's unspoken needs over his girlfriend's expressed wishes. The key here is that in a relationship, the partner's preferences should take precedence in such personal decisions unless there's a clear, mutually agreed-upon plan.\n"
