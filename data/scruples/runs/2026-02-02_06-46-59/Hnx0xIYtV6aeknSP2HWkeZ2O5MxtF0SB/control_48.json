With prom coming up soon, we sat down to talk about our plans. Well, at work the other day, the subject of prom came up at work too. I started to talk to my friend (20 F) about it. It turns out that she never got to go to her prom because she was in the hospital. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWell, this friend is pretty important to me. When I started my job almost a year and a half ago, I lacked almost any social skills. This friend was the first person to really talk to me and treat me like a friend. She helped me through one of the most trying times of my life, as I also had severe social anxiety prior to starting this job. While my friend probably doesn't know this, my progress to having the social skills I do now is largely in part to her. I see this as an opportunity to give back to her for helping me.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy girlfriend is opposed to me wanting to take her with us because she says that this should be our special night, and she wants me to herself. I hold the position that I want to take her due to the aforementioned reasons. So what do you guys think? AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the situation is in the wrong (AITA) for wanting to bring another girl to prom with his girlfriend.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the scenario. The person is a 17-year-old boy with a girlfriend. His friend, a 20-year-old woman, never went to prom because she was in the hospital. He's close to her because she helped him with social anxiety and social skills when he started his job. Now he wants to take her to prom as a way of showing gratitude. His girlfriend is upset because she wants the prom to be just about them.\n\nI need to consider both perspectives. The boyfriend's reasoning is about gratitude and helping his friend, but his girlfriend feels it's their special night. Prom is typically a romantic event, so bringing a third person might be seen as a breach of trust or not respecting the girlfriend's feelings.\n\nBut then, the friend isn't a romantic interest, just a close friend. The boyfriend's intention is to give back. However, in a relationship, such decisions might require considering the partner's feelings first. The girlfriend's concern is valid because prom is a significant event for couples. The boyfriend might be prioritizing his friendship over the relationship's needs here.\n\nI should also think about cultural expectations. In many cases, prom is about the couple. The boyfriend's action might be perceived as disregarding the girlfriend's wishes. Even though his intentions are good, the impact on his girlfriend is important. The girlfriend might feel neglected or that her feelings aren't being respected.\n\nAnother angle: communication. Did they discuss this before? The girlfriend opposed it, so maybe the boyfriend should have considered her feelings more before making the request. The friend's situation is tragic, but the boyfriend could have found another way to show appreciation without involving the girlfriend. Maybe a different gesture instead of taking her to prom with them.\n\nAlso, the age difference. The friend is 20, which is a bit older than the boyfriend. While that's not illegal, it might add a layer of concern for the girlfriend. But the main issue isn't the age, it's the inclusion of another person in what's supposed to be a romantic event.\n\nIn conclusion, while the boyfriend has valid reasons, the girlfriend's perspective is equally important. Bringing the friend might not be the wrong thing entirely, but it's a conflict between his gratitude and the girlfriend's desire for a special night. The answer could be nuanced, but given the prompt asks for AITA, the more likely answer is that the author is in the wrong because he's prioritizing his friend's needs over his girlfriend's feelings in a significant event. So answer A.\n"
