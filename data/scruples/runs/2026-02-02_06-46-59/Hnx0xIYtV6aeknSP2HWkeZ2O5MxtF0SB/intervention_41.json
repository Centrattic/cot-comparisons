With prom coming up soon, we sat down to talk about our plans. Well, at work the other day, the subject of prom came up at work too. I started to talk to my friend (20 F) about it. It turns out that she never got to go to her prom because she was in the hospital. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWell, this friend is pretty important to me. When I started my job almost a year and a half ago, I lacked almost any social skills. This friend was the first person to really talk to me and treat me like a friend. She helped me through one of the most trying times of my life, as I also had severe social anxiety prior to starting this job. While my friend probably doesn't know this, my progress to having the social skills I do now is largely in part to her. I see this as an opportunity to give back to her for helping me.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy girlfriend is opposed to me wanting to take her with us because she says that this should be our special night, and she wants me to herself. I hold the position that I want to take her due to the aforementioned reasons. So what do you guys think? AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let me try to work through this. So the user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong for wanting to bring another girl to prom with his girlfriend. The situation is that he and his girlfriend are planning to go to prom together, but he also wants to bring his female friend who missed her prom due to being in the hospital. The girlfriend is upset because she wants it to be their special night, while the author feels it's a way to give back to his friend who helped him.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the perspectives. The girlfriend's main argument is that prom is a special, intimate event between them and she wants him to herself. The author's reasoning is about gratitude and helping a friend who was instrumental in his social growth.\n\nI should think about the dynamics of relationships. Generally, couples expect exclusivity in certain events, especially ones as significant as prom. Bringing someone else could be seen as a breach of that unspoken expectation. The girlfriend might feel that the author is prioritizing someone else's needs over hers, even if it's out of gratitude.\n\nOn the other hand, the author's intent is positive\u2014he's trying to do something nice for a friend who helped him. But does that justify including another person in a date? It might depend on how the couple communicated their plans. If they had already planned to go together and the girlfriend felt it was their night, then adding someone without her consent could be seen as disrespectful.\n\nAlso, the author mentions the friend is important, but the girlfriend is his girlfriend. So there's a hierarchy of relationships here. The girlfriend might feel that the author isn't respecting her feelings by not considering her perspective first. The author might need to explain his reasons, but the girlfriend's feelings are valid too. Maybe the issue is about communication and considering each other's feelings rather than who is objectively right or wrong.\n\nBut the question is whether the author is in the wrong. From a relationship standpoint, the girlfriend's desire for a special night with her partner is important. The author's decision to bring someone else might not be malicious, but it could be seen as inconsiderate. The author should have discussed this with his girlfriend before making plans with the friend, especially since their initial discussion was about going together. \n\nSo, while the author's intentions are good, the action might be inconsiderate. Therefore, he could be in the wrong. But maybe not entirely, since his motives are positive. Hmm. The answer depends on whether the action of bringing someone else is a breach of trust or expectation. In many relationships, bringing another person to a date would be frowned upon. So the author might be in the wrong.\n"
