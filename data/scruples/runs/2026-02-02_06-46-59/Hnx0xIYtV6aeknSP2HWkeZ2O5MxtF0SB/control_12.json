With prom coming up soon, we sat down to talk about our plans. Well, at work the other day, the subject of prom came up at work too. I started to talk to my friend (20 F) about it. It turns out that she never got to go to her prom because she was in the hospital. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWell, this friend is pretty important to me. When I started my job almost a year and a half ago, I lacked almost any social skills. This friend was the first person to really talk to me and treat me like a friend. She helped me through one of the most trying times of my life, as I also had severe social anxiety prior to starting this job. While my friend probably doesn't know this, my progress to having the social skills I do now is largely in part to her. I see this as an opportunity to give back to her for helping me.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy girlfriend is opposed to me wanting to take her with us because she says that this should be our special night, and she wants me to herself. I hold the position that I want to take her due to the aforementioned reasons. So what do you guys think? AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story about wanting to bring another girl to prom with his girlfriend is in the wrong. The options are A (yes) or B (no). \n\nFirst, the situation: The guy is in a committed relationship with his girlfriend for almost a year. They're planning prom, and he wants to include his female friend who never went to prom and helped him a lot. The girlfriend is upset because she wants it to be their special night.\n\nI need to consider the dynamics here. The key points are the relationship between the author and his girlfriend, the role of the friend, and the reasons for wanting to include her. \n\nThe friend is important because she helped him with social anxiety and was a big support. He wants to give back. But the girlfriend feels it's their special time. The question is whether his actions cross a line.\n\nIn relationships, communication is key. The girlfriend's feelings are valid; she might feel that prom is a significant milestone they should share exclusively. On the other hand, the author's intention is to honor a friend who helped him. \n\nBut bringing another person to a date that's traditionally between the couple can be seen as a breach of trust or consideration. Even if the friend isn't a romantic interest, the girlfriend might feel her needs are being overlooked. The author should have discussed this with the girlfriend earlier and considered her perspective more carefully. \n\nThe fact that they already had a disagreement shows a lack of prior communication. The author might not be in the wrong entirely because his motives are good, but he didn't prioritize his girlfriend's feelings. The girlfriend's desire for a special night is important in a relationship. So, the author's decision to include the friend without fully considering the girlfriend's perspective could be seen as inconsiderate. \n\nTherefore, the answer might lean towards A (he's in the wrong) because the girlfriend's feelings were not adequately considered, even if his intentions were good.\n"
