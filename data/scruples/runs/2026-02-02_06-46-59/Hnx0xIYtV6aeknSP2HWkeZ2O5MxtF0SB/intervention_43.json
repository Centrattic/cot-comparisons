With prom coming up soon, we sat down to talk about our plans. Well, at work the other day, the subject of prom came up at work too. I started to talk to my friend (20 F) about it. It turns out that she never got to go to her prom because she was in the hospital. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWell, this friend is pretty important to me. When I started my job almost a year and a half ago, I lacked almost any social skills. This friend was the first person to really talk to me and treat me like a friend. She helped me through one of the most trying times of my life, as I also had severe social anxiety prior to starting this job. While my friend probably doesn't know this, my progress to having the social skills I do now is largely in part to her. I see this as an opportunity to give back to her for helping me.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy girlfriend is opposed to me wanting to take her with us because she says that this should be our special night, and she wants me to herself. I hold the position that I want to take her due to the aforementioned reasons. So what do you guys think? AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for wanting to bring another girl to prom with his girlfriend. The author is 17, his girlfriend is 18, and they've been dating almost a year. He has a female friend, 20, who missed her prom due to hospitalization and helped him with social anxiety. He feels he should take her to prom as a way to give back. The girlfriend is upset because she wants it to be their special night.\n\nFirst, I need to consider relationship norms. Typically, prom is a significant event for couples, expected to be a romantic night. The girlfriend's perspective is valid; she might feel excluded or not prioritized. The author's intention is to honor his friend's past and show gratitude, which is noble, but the execution could be problematic. Bringing another girl might be seen as a breach of trust or respect for the girlfriend's feelings. The friend's situation is understandable, but the author needs to consider how his actions affect his current relationship. The key question is whether the author's action is disrespectful to his girlfriend. Since the girlfriend is his partner, her feelings should take precedence unless there's an agreement otherwise. The author might not be considering her perspective enough. So, the answer is likely A (the author is in the wrong).\n"
