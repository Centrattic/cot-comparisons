With prom coming up soon, we sat down to talk about our plans. Well, at work the other day, the subject of prom came up at work too. I started to talk to my friend (20 F) about it. It turns out that she never got to go to her prom because she was in the hospital. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWell, this friend is pretty important to me. When I started my job almost a year and a half ago, I lacked almost any social skills. This friend was the first person to really talk to me and treat me like a friend. She helped me through one of the most trying times of my life, as I also had severe social anxiety prior to starting this job. While my friend probably doesn't know this, my progress to having the social skills I do now is largely in part to her. I see this as an opportunity to give back to her for helping me.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy girlfriend is opposed to me wanting to take her with us because she says that this should be our special night, and she wants me to herself. I hold the position that I want to take her due to the aforementioned reasons. So what do you guys think? AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about wanting to bring another girl to prom with his girlfriend. The girlfriend is against it because it's supposed to be their special night. The author's reasoning is that his friend, who helped him a lot, never got to go to prom because she was in the hospital, and he wants to give back.\n\nHmm, first, I need to consider the girlfriend's perspective. She's the one who's dating the author, so she might feel like prom is a significant event for couples, and having someone else there could make her feel excluded. Prom is often seen as a romantic event where couples go together. If he brings another person, maybe it's seen as not respecting her feelings or the tradition of the event.\n\nOn the other hand, the author has a good reason for wanting to include his friend. His friend helped him through a tough time, and he wants to do something nice for her. It shows gratitude and kindness. But does that outweigh the girlfriend's feelings? Maybe the author didn't consider her feelings enough. He and his friend talked about prom at work, and the girlfriend found out through that conversation? Maybe there was a lack of communication between the couple. They should have discussed it together before making plans. \n\nIs there a middle ground? Maybe the author could have suggested a different way to celebrate with his friend without bringing her to prom. Like a separate event, or maybe just a different way to show appreciation. But the way he's phrased it now is about including her in their prom night, which the girlfriend is clearly upset about. \n\nAlso, the girlfriend is 18 and the author is 17. Maybe they're both in high school, so prom is a big deal. The girlfriend's desire for the night to be just the two of them is valid. The author's intention might be good, but the action could be inconsiderate. It's possible that the author is prioritizing his friend's experience over his girlfriend's emotional needs. \n\nI think the key here is whether the author considered his girlfriend's feelings before making the decision. It seems like he didn't discuss it with her first, which is a problem. Even if his friend is important and deserving, the girlfriend's perspective is important too. So maybe the author is in the wrong because he didn't communicate properly and is prioritizing his friend's needs over his girlfriend's comfort in the relationship.\n"
