With prom coming up soon, we sat down to talk about our plans. Well, at work the other day, the subject of prom came up at work too. I started to talk to my friend (20 F) about it. It turns out that she never got to go to her prom because she was in the hospital. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWell, this friend is pretty important to me. When I started my job almost a year and a half ago, I lacked almost any social skills. This friend was the first person to really talk to me and treat me like a friend. She helped me through one of the most trying times of my life, as I also had severe social anxiety prior to starting this job. While my friend probably doesn't know this, my progress to having the social skills I do now is largely in part to her. I see this as an opportunity to give back to her for helping me.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy girlfriend is opposed to me wanting to take her with us because she says that this should be our special night, and she wants me to herself. I hold the position that I want to take her due to the aforementioned reasons. So what do you guys think? AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for wanting to bring another girl to prom with his girlfriend. The scenario is a bit complex.\n\nFirst, the author is 17, his girlfriend is 18, and they've been dating almost a year. He wants to bring his female friend, 20, who missed her prom because of the hospital. The friend helped him a lot with social anxiety and work. The girlfriend is upset because she wants it to be their special night. \n\nSo, the main points here: the girlfriend's feelings versus the author's desire to include someone important in his life. The author's reasoning is about gratitude and giving back, but the girlfriend sees it as taking time away from their relationship.\n\nFrom a relationship ethics standpoint, bringing someone else to a date that's traditionally exclusive might be seen as crossing a boundary. The girlfriend's perspective is valid\u2014prom is a significant event for couples. The author's intention is noble, but actions can have unintended consequences. The friend's inclusion might make the girlfriend feel less prioritized. \n\nAlso, the author's argument about giving back is heartfelt, but relationships often require considering the partner's feelings first. The friend's absence from her own prom is tragic, but the author's solution might not be the best way to help her. Maybe a different way to honor her could be better without involving the girlfriend.\n\nSo, the author's action could be seen as inconsiderate towards his girlfriend's feelings. He might not be wrong in intent, but the execution is problematic. Therefore, the answer would be A (yes, he's in the wrong).\n"
