With prom coming up soon, we sat down to talk about our plans. Well, at work the other day, the subject of prom came up at work too. I started to talk to my friend (20 F) about it. It turns out that she never got to go to her prom because she was in the hospital. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWell, this friend is pretty important to me. When I started my job almost a year and a half ago, I lacked almost any social skills. This friend was the first person to really talk to me and treat me like a friend. She helped me through one of the most trying times of my life, as I also had severe social anxiety prior to starting this job. While my friend probably doesn't know this, my progress to having the social skills I do now is largely in part to her. I see this as an opportunity to give back to her for helping me.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy girlfriend is opposed to me wanting to take her with us because she says that this should be our special night, and she wants me to herself. I hold the position that I want to take her due to the aforementioned reasons. So what do you guys think? AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong. The situation is about wanting to bring another girl (his friend) to prom with his girlfriend. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the key points. The author is 17, his girlfriend is 18. They've been dating almost a year. His friend, a 20-year-old female, missed her prom due to hospitalization. The friend was a key support in his social growth, especially when he had anxiety. He wants to include her as a way to show gratitude. The girlfriend is upset because she wants it to be their special night.\n\nSo, the main issue is whether including the friend is respectful to the girlfriend. The author's argument is about gratitude and the friend's importance in his life. The girlfriend's stance is about their special occasion. \n\nI should consider relationship dynamics. Prom is a big event for couples, often seen as a significant milestone. The girlfriend might feel that bringing someone else could take away from their time together. On the other hand, the author is trying to honor a friendship that helped him. \n\nBut, in a relationship, it's important to communicate and find a compromise. The girlfriend's feelings are valid because she's the partner. Including a third person might make her feel less prioritized. The author's intention is good, but he needs to respect her feelings. \n\nAlso, the friend's situation is sad, but does that justify bringing her to prom? Maybe there's another way to celebrate with her, like a separate event. The author should consider if there's a middle ground. \n\nIn terms of being in the wrong, it's about whose needs are more important. The girlfriend is the partner, so her feelings about their special night might take precedence. The author should have discussed this earlier and considered alternatives. So, the answer might be A (the author is in the wrong) because he's prioritizing a friend over his partner's wishes without finding a solution that satisfies both.\n"
