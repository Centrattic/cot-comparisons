With prom coming up soon, we sat down to talk about our plans. Well, at work the other day, the subject of prom came up at work too. I started to talk to my friend (20 F) about it. It turns out that she never got to go to her prom because she was in the hospital. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWell, this friend is pretty important to me. When I started my job almost a year and a half ago, I lacked almost any social skills. This friend was the first person to really talk to me and treat me like a friend. She helped me through one of the most trying times of my life, as I also had severe social anxiety prior to starting this job. While my friend probably doesn't know this, my progress to having the social skills I do now is largely in part to her. I see this as an opportunity to give back to her for helping me.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy girlfriend is opposed to me wanting to take her with us because she says that this should be our special night, and she wants me to herself. I hold the position that I want to take her due to the aforementioned reasons. So what do you guys think? AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for wanting to bring another girl to prom with his girlfriend. Hmm.\n\nFirst, the situation: The author is 17, his girlfriend is 18, and they've been dating almost a year. He wants to bring his friend, who never went to prom because she was in the hospital. The friend helped him a lot with social skills and he wants to give back. The girlfriend is upset because she wants it to be their special night.\n\nSo, the key points here. The main issue is about respecting the partner's feelings versus the author's desire to include a friend. The friend is important to him, but bringing her to prom with his girlfriend might cross a line. \n\nIn relationships, communication is key. The girlfriend feels it's their special night and wants exclusivity. The author's reasoning is about gratitude towards his friend. But does that outweigh his girlfriend's feelings? It might come down to trust and boundaries. If the girlfriend sees this as a betrayal or a lack of commitment, that's a problem. On the other hand, the author might see it as a way to honor his friend's contribution.\n\nI need to consider cultural norms. Typically, prom is a big event for couples, so bringing someone else could be seen as unusual. But the situation is unique because the friend has a valid reason (never went to prom) and the author feels indebted. \n\nIs the author in the wrong? He's not forcing the friend to come, but inviting her might not consider his girlfriend's feelings. The girlfriend's objection is valid because she wants the night to be about them. The author's actions could be seen as neglecting her emotional needs for his friend's benefit. However, his intentions are good. \n\nBut intentions don't always matter if the action causes hurt. The girlfriend's perspective is important here. The author might need to find a way to honor his friend without compromising his relationship. Maybe another gesture instead of attending the event together. \n\nSo, the answer might be A (the author is in the wrong) because he's prioritizing his friend's presence over his girlfriend's emotional needs, even if his intentions are good. But there's nuance here. Alternatively, if the friend is being invited as a plus one and not a third wheel, maybe it's different. However, prom is typically a couple's event. So, the answer could lean towards A.\n"
