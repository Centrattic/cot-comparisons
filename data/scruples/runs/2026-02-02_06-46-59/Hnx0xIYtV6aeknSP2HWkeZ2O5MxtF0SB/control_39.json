With prom coming up soon, we sat down to talk about our plans. Well, at work the other day, the subject of prom came up at work too. I started to talk to my friend (20 F) about it. It turns out that she never got to go to her prom because she was in the hospital. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWell, this friend is pretty important to me. When I started my job almost a year and a half ago, I lacked almost any social skills. This friend was the first person to really talk to me and treat me like a friend. She helped me through one of the most trying times of my life, as I also had severe social anxiety prior to starting this job. While my friend probably doesn't know this, my progress to having the social skills I do now is largely in part to her. I see this as an opportunity to give back to her for helping me.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy girlfriend is opposed to me wanting to take her with us because she says that this should be our special night, and she wants me to herself. I hold the position that I want to take her due to the aforementioned reasons. So what do you guys think? AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for wanting to invite another girl to prom with his girlfriend. The situation is that the author is 17, his girlfriend is 18, and they've been dating almost a year. The friend in question is 20 and didn't get to go to prom because of the hospital.\n\nFirst, the author wants to include this friend as a gesture of gratitude since she helped him develop social skills and he's close to her. The girlfriend is upset because it's their special night and she wants him to herself. \n\nSo, the question is whether inviting another girl is wrong. From the girlfriend's perspective, prom is typically a couples' event, so inviting another person might feel like a betrayal or a lack of consideration for her feelings. She might see it as taking away from their exclusive time together. \n\nOn the other hand, the author is trying to do something kind for a friend who helped him a lot. But the problem here is that the girlfriend is his partner, and including another person in what's supposed to be a romantic event could be seen as prioritizing the friend's needs over the girlfriend's. \n\nI should consider social norms around prom. Traditionally, prom is a couple's event, so bringing someone else might be unconventional. The girlfriend's reaction is valid because she expects that time to be special for the two of them. The author might not have considered how this would make his girlfriend feel, which is a key factor in relationship dynamics. \n\nAlso, the friend being 20 might not be an issue in terms of age, but the main conflict is between the girlfriend's feelings versus the author's desire to show gratitude. The author's reasoning is good, but the impact on the girlfriend is significant. \n\nIn relationships, communication is key. The author should have discussed this idea with his girlfriend earlier, but since he's doing it now, the girlfriend's feelings are hurt. The author's actions might be seen as selfish if he's not considering her perspective. \n\nSo, even if the intention is good, the action could be inconsiderate. Therefore, the author might be in the wrong for not respecting his girlfriend's feelings about the prom being their special night. The answer would be A (Yes, the author is in the wrong).\n"
