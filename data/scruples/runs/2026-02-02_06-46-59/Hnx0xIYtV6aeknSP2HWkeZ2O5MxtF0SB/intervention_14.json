With prom coming up soon, we sat down to talk about our plans. Well, at work the other day, the subject of prom came up at work too. I started to talk to my friend (20 F) about it. It turns out that she never got to go to her prom because she was in the hospital. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWell, this friend is pretty important to me. When I started my job almost a year and a half ago, I lacked almost any social skills. This friend was the first person to really talk to me and treat me like a friend. She helped me through one of the most trying times of my life, as I also had severe social anxiety prior to starting this job. While my friend probably doesn't know this, my progress to having the social skills I do now is largely in part to her. I see this as an opportunity to give back to her for helping me.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy girlfriend is opposed to me wanting to take her with us because she says that this should be our special night, and she wants me to herself. I hold the position that I want to take her due to the aforementioned reasons. So what do you guys think? AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person is in the wrong for wanting to bring another girl to prom with his girlfriend. The situation he describes is that he's been dating his girlfriend for almost a year, and he wants to include his friend who missed her prom because she was in the hospital. His friend helped him a lot when he was struggling with social anxiety.\n\nHmm. So the girlfriend is upset because she wants the prom to be their special night. The guy argues that it's a way to give back to his friend. Now, I need to decide if he's in the wrong. \n\nFirst, relationships often come with certain expectations. Prom is a significant event, and having a date usually implies it's a two-person thing. Introducing a third person might be seen as a breach of trust or not respecting the girlfriend's feelings. The girlfriend's perspective is important here\u2014she feels it should be their night, so her feelings are valid. \n\nOn the other hand, the guy is trying to be kind to his friend, who had a hard time. But does that justify including her in a date night? Maybe not. The problem here is conflicting priorities. The guy might not realize that his girlfriend's need for a private moment is just as important as his friend's. \n\nI think the key is communication. The guy should have discussed this with his girlfriend earlier. Bringing another girl along without considering her feelings first is a bit self-centered. Even if his intentions are good, the action might not align with the relationship's dynamics. \n\nSo, the answer is likely that he's in the wrong (A) because he's prioritizing his friend's experience over his girlfriend's feelings without proper discussion. But maybe there's a middle ground, like finding another way to celebrate with the friend. But since he's already decided to bring her, it's probably A.\n"
