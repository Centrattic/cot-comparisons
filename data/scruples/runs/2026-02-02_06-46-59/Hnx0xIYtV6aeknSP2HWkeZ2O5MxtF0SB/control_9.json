With prom coming up soon, we sat down to talk about our plans. Well, at work the other day, the subject of prom came up at work too. I started to talk to my friend (20 F) about it. It turns out that she never got to go to her prom because she was in the hospital. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWell, this friend is pretty important to me. When I started my job almost a year and a half ago, I lacked almost any social skills. This friend was the first person to really talk to me and treat me like a friend. She helped me through one of the most trying times of my life, as I also had severe social anxiety prior to starting this job. While my friend probably doesn't know this, my progress to having the social skills I do now is largely in part to her. I see this as an opportunity to give back to her for helping me.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy girlfriend is opposed to me wanting to take her with us because she says that this should be our special night, and she wants me to herself. I hold the position that I want to take her due to the aforementioned reasons. So what do you guys think? AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the \"AITA\" post is in the wrong for wanting to bring another girl to prom with his girlfriend. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The person is a guy who's been dating his girlfriend for almost a year. They're both around the same age, 17 and 18. He's planning prom with her, but he also has a female friend who never got to go to her prom because she was in the hospital. This friend was very supportive to him when he was struggling socially and had anxiety. Now, he wants to include her in their prom night as a way of giving back. His girlfriend is upset because she wants the night to be just the two of them.\n\nSo, the main issue here is about whether including this friend is respectful to the girlfriend. The boyfriend feels it's a special gesture for his friend, while the girlfriend feels it's her special night. \n\nIn relationships, communication and mutual respect are key. The boyfriend might think he's being kind by helping his friend, but he didn't consider his girlfriend's feelings. Prom is traditionally a romantic event, so inviting someone else could be seen as a boundary issue. The girlfriend's perspective is that this is their time together, and bringing someone else might make her feel neglected or unimportant.\n\nHowever, the boyfriend's intentions are good\u2014trying to do something nice for someone who helped him. But in a romantic relationship, partners often expect exclusivity in certain situations, especially events like prom. The problem might be that he didn't discuss this idea with his girlfriend earlier, leading to her feeling left out now. \n\nIt's possible that the boyfriend didn't realize the significance of prom as a couple's event. But since the girlfriend is already upset, he should consider her feelings. While his friend's situation is unfortunate, the boyfriend's actions could be perceived as prioritizing the friend's needs over his girlfriend's. \n\nSo, the answer would likely be that he's in the wrong because he didn't respect his girlfriend's wishes about the specialness of the event. Even if his intentions were good, the girlfriend's feelings and the expected norms of such an event mean that he should have considered her perspective first.\n"
