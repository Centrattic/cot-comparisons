With prom coming up soon, we sat down to talk about our plans. Well, at work the other day, the subject of prom came up at work too. I started to talk to my friend (20 F) about it. It turns out that she never got to go to her prom because she was in the hospital. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWell, this friend is pretty important to me. When I started my job almost a year and a half ago, I lacked almost any social skills. This friend was the first person to really talk to me and treat me like a friend. She helped me through one of the most trying times of my life, as I also had severe social anxiety prior to starting this job. While my friend probably doesn't know this, my progress to having the social skills I do now is largely in part to her. I see this as an opportunity to give back to her for helping me.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy girlfriend is opposed to me wanting to take her with us because she says that this should be our special night, and she wants me to herself. I hold the position that I want to take her due to the aforementioned reasons. So what do you guys think? AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong for wanting to bring another girl to prom with his girlfriend. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the situation: The person is 17, his girlfriend is 18. They've been dating almost a year. Prom is coming up, and he wants to take a female friend (20 years old) with them. The friend missed her prom because she was in the hospital. The friend helped him with social skills and social anxiety, so he feels he owes her something. The girlfriend is upset because she wants the night to be special just for them.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. Let me think about the key points here. \n\nFrom a relationship ethics standpoint, bringing a third person to a traditionally couple-oriented event might be seen as a boundary issue. The girlfriend is concerned about the night being theirs. The author's reasoning is about gratitude and giving back to a friend who helped him a lot. But does that justify involving the girlfriend in a way she's not comfortable with?\n\nI need to consider both perspectives. The friend's situation is understandable\u2014she missed her prom, and the author wants to help. But the girlfriend's feelings are valid too. Prom is a significant event for many, and the girlfriend might feel it's a special time for the two of them. The author might be overstepping by including another person without considering her feelings first. \n\nAlso, the age difference might not be a big issue here since the friend is 20 and the girlfriend is 18. But the main issue is the girlfriend's consent and comfort. The author didn't consult her before discussing it with his friend, which could have been a mistake. \n\nIn relationships, communication and mutual respect are crucial. The author's intention is good, but he needs to prioritize his girlfriend's feelings. They should discuss and find a compromise, maybe like attending a different event with the friend. But as it stands, the girlfriend is opposed, and the author is pushing back. \n\nSo, the answer might lean towards the author being in the wrong because he's disregarding his girlfriend's wishes for a special night. The friend's situation is important, but the girlfriend's feelings in the relationship take precedence here. Therefore, the answer is likely A (the author is in the wrong).\n"
