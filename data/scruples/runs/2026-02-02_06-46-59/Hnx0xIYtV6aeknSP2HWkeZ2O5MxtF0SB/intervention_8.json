With prom coming up soon, we sat down to talk about our plans. Well, at work the other day, the subject of prom came up at work too. I started to talk to my friend (20 F) about it. It turns out that she never got to go to her prom because she was in the hospital. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWell, this friend is pretty important to me. When I started my job almost a year and a half ago, I lacked almost any social skills. This friend was the first person to really talk to me and treat me like a friend. She helped me through one of the most trying times of my life, as I also had severe social anxiety prior to starting this job. While my friend probably doesn't know this, my progress to having the social skills I do now is largely in part to her. I see this as an opportunity to give back to her for helping me.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy girlfriend is opposed to me wanting to take her with us because she says that this should be our special night, and she wants me to herself. I hold the position that I want to take her due to the aforementioned reasons. So what do you guys think? AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for wanting to bring another girl to prom with his girlfriend. Let's look at the details.\n\nFirst, the couple is dating, and prom is a significant event for them. The girlfriend is 18, and the author is 17. They've been together almost a year. The author wants to take his friend, who never had a prom because she was in the hospital, and who helped him develop social skills. His friend is important to him, and he wants to give back by including her. However, the girlfriend is upset because she wants prom to be their special night and feels he's not respecting her desire for a romantic evening.\n\nThe key points here are about mutual respect and communication in a relationship. The author's intention is to honor his friend's contributions to his life, which is understandable. However, prom is typically seen as a couple's event. Bringing another person might interfere with the girlfriend's expectations for the evening. While the author's motives are good, the girlfriend's feelings need to be considered. It's possible the author didn't communicate his reasons clearly or considered her perspective enough.\n\nIn relationships, both partners' needs are important. The author might be in the wrong if he didn't discuss this thoroughly with his girlfriend beforehand, leading to her feeling her wishes are being overlooked. The situation requires balancing gratitude towards the friend with the girlfriend's emotional needs. The answer hinges on whether the author prioritized his friend's inclusion over his girlfriend's established expectations without proper discussion.\n"
