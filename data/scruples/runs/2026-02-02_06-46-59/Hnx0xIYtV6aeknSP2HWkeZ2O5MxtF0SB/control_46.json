With prom coming up soon, we sat down to talk about our plans. Well, at work the other day, the subject of prom came up at work too. I started to talk to my friend (20 F) about it. It turns out that she never got to go to her prom because she was in the hospital. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWell, this friend is pretty important to me. When I started my job almost a year and a half ago, I lacked almost any social skills. This friend was the first person to really talk to me and treat me like a friend. She helped me through one of the most trying times of my life, as I also had severe social anxiety prior to starting this job. While my friend probably doesn't know this, my progress to having the social skills I do now is largely in part to her. I see this as an opportunity to give back to her for helping me.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy girlfriend is opposed to me wanting to take her with us because she says that this should be our special night, and she wants me to herself. I hold the position that I want to take her due to the aforementioned reasons. So what do you guys think? AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for wanting to bring another girl to prom with his girlfriend. The situation is that he and his girlfriend are going to prom, but he wants to include his friend who missed her prom because she was in the hospital. The friend helped him a lot with social skills and he wants to give back.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the perspectives here. The girlfriend feels it should be their special night, so she's upset about him bringing another girl. The author thinks he's doing the right thing by repaying his friend's support.\n\nIn relationships, communication is key. The author mentions they discussed prom plans, but maybe he didn't fully consider her feelings when making the decision. The girlfriend's perspective is that it's their night, so adding someone else might feel like a betrayal or lack of consideration. On the other hand, the author has valid reasons related to gratitude and his friend's circumstances. \n\nIt's a balance between respecting his friend's needs and his girlfriend's expectations. Maybe the author should have discussed this more with his girlfriend before committing to the idea. However, the intention isn't malicious; he's trying to do something kind. \n\nBut bringing another girl to a date could be seen as crossing a line, even with good intentions. The girlfriend might feel neglected or that her partner is prioritizing someone else's needs over the relationship. So, while the author's motives are good, the action could be inconsiderate of his girlfriend's feelings. Therefore, the answer might be A (the author is in the wrong) because he didn't fully consider his girlfriend's perspective and the impact on their relationship, even if his intentions were positive.\n"
