With prom coming up soon, we sat down to talk about our plans. Well, at work the other day, the subject of prom came up at work too. I started to talk to my friend (20 F) about it. It turns out that she never got to go to her prom because she was in the hospital. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWell, this friend is pretty important to me. When I started my job almost a year and a half ago, I lacked almost any social skills. This friend was the first person to really talk to me and treat me like a friend. She helped me through one of the most trying times of my life, as I also had severe social anxiety prior to starting this job. While my friend probably doesn't know this, my progress to having the social skills I do now is largely in part to her. I see this as an opportunity to give back to her for helping me.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy girlfriend is opposed to me wanting to take her with us because she says that this should be our special night, and she wants me to herself. I hold the position that I want to take her due to the aforementioned reasons. So what do you guys think? AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is that the person (17M) wants to bring his friend (20F) to prom with him and his girlfriend (18F). They've been dating almost a year, but his friend never got to go to prom because she was in the hospital. The friend helped him a lot when he started the job, improving his social skills when he had anxiety.\n\nFirst, the girlfriend is upset because she thinks prom should be their special night, and she wants him to herself. The author thinks he should take the friend as a way to give back for her help. The question is whether he's in the wrong.\n\nHmm. Let me consider both sides. On one hand, the girlfriend's perspective is valid. Prom is typically a significant event in a relationship, often seen as a couple's moment. If he's bringing another person, it might make her feel left out or not prioritized. She's in the relationship, so her feelings matter here. \n\nOn the other hand, the author has a good reason: the friend helped him a lot, and she missed out on prom. He wants to do something nice for her. But is that a valid reason to potentially hurt his girlfriend's feelings? \n\nI need to think about boundaries in relationships. When you have a partner, their expectations about shared events matter. Even if the friend is important, bringing someone else to a romantic event can be seen as disrespectful to the partner. The girlfriend's right to have that special night together might take precedence. \n\nBut maybe the author didn't consider his girlfriend's feelings enough. He should have discussed it with her before making the suggestion. The fact that he talked about it at work and then proposed bringing the friend might have come as a surprise, leading to hurt feelings. \n\nAlso, the friend is 20, which is older than the author and his girlfriend. Bringing someone older to prom might be unusual and could cause more tension. \n\nIn terms of social norms, prom is usually a couple's activity. Including another person might be seen as inappropriate. The author might not be in the wrong in terms of intentions, but the action could be hurtful. He needs to balance his gratitude towards the friend with his girlfriend's need for quality time. \n\nSo, the key points are: his girlfriend's feelings vs. his friend's gratitude. The author's actions might be causing emotional harm to his girlfriend, which is a problem. Even with good intentions, the impact on the relationship could be more significant. Therefore, he might be in the wrong for not considering her perspective first.\n"
