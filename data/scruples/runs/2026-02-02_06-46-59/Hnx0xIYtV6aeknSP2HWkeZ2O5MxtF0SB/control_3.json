With prom coming up soon, we sat down to talk about our plans. Well, at work the other day, the subject of prom came up at work too. I started to talk to my friend (20 F) about it. It turns out that she never got to go to her prom because she was in the hospital. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWell, this friend is pretty important to me. When I started my job almost a year and a half ago, I lacked almost any social skills. This friend was the first person to really talk to me and treat me like a friend. She helped me through one of the most trying times of my life, as I also had severe social anxiety prior to starting this job. While my friend probably doesn't know this, my progress to having the social skills I do now is largely in part to her. I see this as an opportunity to give back to her for helping me.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy girlfriend is opposed to me wanting to take her with us because she says that this should be our special night, and she wants me to herself. I hold the position that I want to take her due to the aforementioned reasons. So what do you guys think? AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for wanting to bring another girl to prom with his girlfriend. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the situation: The author is 17, his girlfriend is 18, and they've been dating almost a year. He wants to bring his female friend, who's 20, to prom with them. The friend missed her prom because she was in the hospital, and she helped him a lot when he started the job. She improved his social skills and helped him with anxiety. The girlfriend is upset because she wants the night to be just the two of them.\n\nSo, the main question is whether it's wrong to include this friend. From the girlfriend's perspective, prom is a special occasion meant for couples, so adding someone else might feel like a betrayal or a lack of consideration. She might feel that their time together is important and that including another person could take away from their intimacy.\n\nOn the other hand, the author feels a sense of gratitude towards the friend. He attributes much of his social progress to her, so he wants to do something nice in return. He sees it as a way to give back. His reasoning is based on appreciation and wanting to acknowledge her help.\n\nNow, considering relationships, trust and communication are key. The girlfriend's feelings are valid because she might perceive this as the author prioritizing friendship over their relationship. However, the author isn't trying to spend time with the friend romantically; it's more about gratitude. \n\nBut prom is typically a couples' event. Bringing another person could make the girlfriend feel less important. Even if the friend isn't a romantic interest, the girlfriend might feel that their special night is being compromised. The author should have discussed this earlier and considered his girlfriend's feelings more thoroughly before making the decision.\n\nAlso, the age difference might matter. The friend is 20, while the girlfriend is 18. Though legal, it could add complexity. However, the main issue here is about the girlfriend's feelings versus the author's intentions.\n\nIn terms of right or wrong, it's a bit of a gray area. The author's intentions are good, but he might not have considered the emotional impact on his girlfriend. Relationships require compromise. If the girlfriend is clearly opposed, the author might need to find another way to honor his friend's contribution without disrupting their special night. \n\nSo, the answer would hinge on whether the author's actions, despite good intentions, disregard his girlfriend's feelings. Since the girlfriend is in a committed relationship with him, her feelings are valid. The author should prioritize her emotions here and perhaps find a different way to thank his friend. Therefore, he might be in the wrong for not considering her perspective enough.\n"
