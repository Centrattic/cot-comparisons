With prom coming up soon, we sat down to talk about our plans. Well, at work the other day, the subject of prom came up at work too. I started to talk to my friend (20 F) about it. It turns out that she never got to go to her prom because she was in the hospital. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWell, this friend is pretty important to me. When I started my job almost a year and a half ago, I lacked almost any social skills. This friend was the first person to really talk to me and treat me like a friend. She helped me through one of the most trying times of my life, as I also had severe social anxiety prior to starting this job. While my friend probably doesn't know this, my progress to having the social skills I do now is largely in part to her. I see this as an opportunity to give back to her for helping me.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy girlfriend is opposed to me wanting to take her with us because she says that this should be our special night, and she wants me to herself. I hold the position that I want to take her due to the aforementioned reasons. So what do you guys think? AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person in the situation is in the wrong for wanting to bring another girl to prom with his girlfriend. Hmm. The scenario is that the guy and his girlfriend are going to prom, but he wants to include his friend who couldn't go to prom before. The girlfriend is upset because she wants it to be just the two of them.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The guy's friend helped him a lot when he was struggling with social anxiety and lacked social skills. He feels he owes her, so he wants to give her this experience. But his girlfriend is hurt because she expects prom to be a special, intimate event for the two of them. \n\nOn one hand, the guy's intentions are good. He's trying to repay his friend's kindness and acknowledge her support. On the other hand, his girlfriend's feelings are valid too. Prom is typically seen as a milestone event for couples, and bringing another person might make her feel neglected or less prioritized. \n\nI should think about communication. Did the guy discuss this with his girlfriend before making plans? In the story, he mentions they sat down to talk about prom plans, but then he talked to his friend at work. Maybe he didn't communicate his idea properly to his girlfriend. If he had discussed it with her earlier, perhaps they could have found a compromise.\n\nAlso, considering the girlfriend's perspective, she might feel that her partner isn't considering her feelings. The fact that she's 18 and he's 17, they're both young, and relationships at that age can be sensitive. The girlfriend might be worried about how this inclusion affects their relationship or how others perceive them at prom.\n\nBut does the guy have a valid point? He's trying to do something kind for a friend who helped him. It's a matter of balancing between honoring his friend's contribution and respecting his girlfriend's wishes. The key here is whether the guy should have considered his girlfriend's feelings more before making the decision. \n\nAnother angle: maybe the girlfriend's reaction is a bit possessive, but given their age, that's common. The guy's intention is good, but he might not have considered how it would affect his relationship. The friend's situation is unique, but bringing her along could create a three-person dynamic at a typically two-person event, which might cause tension.\n\nI think the main issue is the lack of prior communication. The guy should have discussed this with his girlfriend before making plans with his friend. Now that the girlfriend is upset, he needs to address her feelings. But is he in the wrong? If his intention is to do something kind, but he didn't think through the impact on his partner, then maybe he's partially at fault. However, if the girlfriend's reaction is overly possessive, maybe she's in the wrong. But given the information, the guy's actions, while well-intentioned, might have overlooked his girlfriend's expectations. So I'm leaning towards the answer being A, that he's in the wrong because he didn't prioritize his girlfriend's feelings enough in the planning.\n"
