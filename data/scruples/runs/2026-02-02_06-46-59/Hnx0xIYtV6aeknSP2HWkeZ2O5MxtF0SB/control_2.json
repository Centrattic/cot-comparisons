With prom coming up soon, we sat down to talk about our plans. Well, at work the other day, the subject of prom came up at work too. I started to talk to my friend (20 F) about it. It turns out that she never got to go to her prom because she was in the hospital. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWell, this friend is pretty important to me. When I started my job almost a year and a half ago, I lacked almost any social skills. This friend was the first person to really talk to me and treat me like a friend. She helped me through one of the most trying times of my life, as I also had severe social anxiety prior to starting this job. While my friend probably doesn't know this, my progress to having the social skills I do now is largely in part to her. I see this as an opportunity to give back to her for helping me.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy girlfriend is opposed to me wanting to take her with us because she says that this should be our special night, and she wants me to herself. I hold the position that I want to take her due to the aforementioned reasons. So what do you guys think? AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is that the person is a 17-year-old guy, and he's dating an 18-year-old girl. They're planning to go to prom together. But he wants to bring along his friend, a 20-year-old woman who he's really close to because she helped him with social skills and he feels indebted to her.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the relationship between the author and his girlfriend. They've been dating almost a year, so that's a significant amount of time. The girlfriend is upset because she wants prom to be their special night and doesn't want her there. The key points here are about respecting the girlfriend's feelings versus fulfilling a personal obligation to the friend.\n\nThe author's reasoning is that the friend missed out on prom and he wants to give back to her for helping him. But bringing a third person to a romantic event like prom might not be the best idea. Prom is typically a couples event, so having another person could make it less intimate for the girlfriend. The girlfriend's perspective is valid because she's expecting it to be a special time with just the two of them.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. The main issue is about respecting his partner's feelings. Even if the author has good intentions towards his friend, he needs to consider how his actions affect his girlfriend. The girlfriend's discomfort or feeling that her night is being compromised is a valid concern. The author might not have communicated this idea to her in a way that she felt heard, or perhaps he didn't consider the impact on their relationship dynamics.\n\nAnother angle is the friendship. The author's friend is important to him, but bringing her to prom might be an overstep. Friends can have their own events, but mixing personal obligations with a partner's expectations can lead to conflict. The author might not be in the wrong if he had discussed this thoroughly with his girlfriend and found a compromise, but since the girlfriend is opposed and he insists, that could be where the issue lies.\n\nSo, the answer hinges on whether the author's actions are prioritizing his friend's needs over his girlfriend's feelings. The girlfriend's right to have a special night with her partner is a strong point. The author might need to reconsider his approach, perhaps by finding another way to include his friend in a different setting or making up for it in other ways, rather than at the expense of his girlfriend's experience.\n"
