With prom coming up soon, we sat down to talk about our plans. Well, at work the other day, the subject of prom came up at work too. I started to talk to my friend (20 F) about it. It turns out that she never got to go to her prom because she was in the hospital. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWell, this friend is pretty important to me. When I started my job almost a year and a half ago, I lacked almost any social skills. This friend was the first person to really talk to me and treat me like a friend. She helped me through one of the most trying times of my life, as I also had severe social anxiety prior to starting this job. While my friend probably doesn't know this, my progress to having the social skills I do now is largely in part to her. I see this as an opportunity to give back to her for helping me.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy girlfriend is opposed to me wanting to take her with us because she says that this should be our special night, and she wants me to herself. I hold the position that I want to take her due to the aforementioned reasons. So what do you guys think? AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author (the person who wrote the original post) is in the wrong for wanting to bring another girl to prom with his girlfriend. The girlfriend is against it because it's supposed to be their special night. The author argues that the friend never went to prom because of being in the hospital and that the friend helped him a lot.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The author is in a relationship, and bringing another person could be seen as disrespectful to the girlfriend. Prom is typically a romantic event, so the girlfriend's perspective is valid. The author's reasoning is about gratitude and giving back to a friend, but that might not outweigh the girlfriend's feelings.\n\nThe friend is important to the author, but the girlfriend is his significant other. The author might not have considered how the girlfriend would feel. Maybe he should have discussed this with the girlfriend earlier to understand her feelings before making plans. The girlfriend might feel that the author is prioritizing a friend over her, even if unintentionally. \n\nOn the other hand, the author's intentions are good\u2014helping a friend who missed out on prom. But relationships require compromise. The author might need to find a different way to honor his friend without involving the girlfriend in a way that makes her uncomfortable. \n\nSo, the author might be in the wrong because he's introducing a third person into a romantic event without considering his girlfriend's feelings. Even though his intentions are good, the action itself could be seen as a breach of trust or consideration for his girlfriend. The girlfriend's right to expect a special night for the two of them is important. Therefore, the answer is likely A.\n"
