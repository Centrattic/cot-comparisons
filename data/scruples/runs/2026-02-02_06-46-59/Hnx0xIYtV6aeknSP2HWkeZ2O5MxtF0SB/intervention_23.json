With prom coming up soon, we sat down to talk about our plans. Well, at work the other day, the subject of prom came up at work too. I started to talk to my friend (20 F) about it. It turns out that she never got to go to her prom because she was in the hospital. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWell, this friend is pretty important to me. When I started my job almost a year and a half ago, I lacked almost any social skills. This friend was the first person to really talk to me and treat me like a friend. She helped me through one of the most trying times of my life, as I also had severe social anxiety prior to starting this job. While my friend probably doesn't know this, my progress to having the social skills I do now is largely in part to her. I see this as an opportunity to give back to her for helping me.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy girlfriend is opposed to me wanting to take her with us because she says that this should be our special night, and she wants me to herself. I hold the position that I want to take her due to the aforementioned reasons. So what do you guys think? AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong for wanting to bring another girl to prom with his girlfriend. The main points here are about the relationship dynamics and the reasons behind wanting to include the friend.\n\nFirst, the boyfriend (17 M) has been in a relationship with his girlfriend (18 F) for almost a year. Prom is a significant event, typically a couple's thing. The boyfriend wants to take his friend (20 F) with them because the friend missed out on prom due to being hospitalized. The friend is also important to him because she helped him develop social skills when he started a job and dealt with social anxiety.\n\nThe girlfriend is against it because she wants the night to be special and just for them. The question is whether the author is in the wrong. \n\nLooking at the girlfriend's perspective, she might see this as a personal event that should be just the two of them. Bringing another person could be seen as a breach of trust or a lack of consideration for her feelings. Relationships often involve prioritizing the partner's needs, especially in significant events like prom. \n\nOn the other hand, the author's reasoning is that it's an opportunity to give back to someone who helped him a lot. He values his friend's support and feels a sense of gratitude. However, the friend is another girl, which might add complexity, even if there's no romantic implication. The girlfriend's opposition is valid because she might feel overshadowed or that her partner is prioritizing someone else over their relationship. \n\nThe key issue is whether including the friend is a reasonable request given that prom is traditionally a couple's event. The author's justification is based on gratitude and friendship, but the girlfriend's desire for a special night together is also valid. In relationships, partners usually expect certain exclusivity, especially in important dates. The author's decision to include the friend might not consider the girlfriend's feelings as much as it should. \n\nTherefore, the author is likely in the wrong because he's potentially disregarding his girlfriend's wishes for a special occasion, even if his intentions are good. The solution would involve communication and compromise, but the act of wanting to bring someone else without fully respecting the girlfriend's main objection could be seen as prioritizing the friend over the relationship.\n"
