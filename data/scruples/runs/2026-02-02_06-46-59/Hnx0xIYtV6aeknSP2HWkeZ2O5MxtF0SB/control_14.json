With prom coming up soon, we sat down to talk about our plans. Well, at work the other day, the subject of prom came up at work too. I started to talk to my friend (20 F) about it. It turns out that she never got to go to her prom because she was in the hospital. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWell, this friend is pretty important to me. When I started my job almost a year and a half ago, I lacked almost any social skills. This friend was the first person to really talk to me and treat me like a friend. She helped me through one of the most trying times of my life, as I also had severe social anxiety prior to starting this job. While my friend probably doesn't know this, my progress to having the social skills I do now is largely in part to her. I see this as an opportunity to give back to her for helping me.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy girlfriend is opposed to me wanting to take her with us because she says that this should be our special night, and she wants me to herself. I hold the position that I want to take her due to the aforementioned reasons. So what do you guys think? AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person (the author) is in the wrong for wanting to bring a friend to prom with his girlfriend. The key points here are the relationships involved and the reasons given.\n\nFirst, the author is in a relationship with his girlfriend, and they're planning prom. He wants to include his friend, who he considers important. The friend missed her prom due to being in the hospital, and he feels indebted to her for helping him overcome social anxiety. His main argument is that this is a way to give back to her.\n\nThe girlfriend is against it, wanting the night to be special just for the two of them. The question is whether the author's actions are wrong. \n\nFrom a relationship perspective, the girlfriend's feelings are valid. Prom is typically seen as a romantic event, so she might feel left out. However, the author's intentions are rooted in gratitude and wanting to do something nice for a friend who supported him. \n\nBut in a committed relationship, the partner's feelings should be considered. Even if the author has good intentions, including another person in a supposedly special romantic event without the partner's consent could be seen as disrespectful. The girlfriend's desire for a private celebration is important. \n\nOn the other hand, the author's friend is important to him, and he might see this as a way to honor her. However, relationships often require balancing personal connections with the needs of the partner. \n\nSo, the author might be in the wrong because he's not prioritizing his girlfriend's feelings in a scenario that's traditionally about the couple. Even with good intentions, the act of including another person without her agreement could be seen as dismissive of her needs. Therefore, answer A.\n"
