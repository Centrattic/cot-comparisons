With prom coming up soon, we sat down to talk about our plans. Well, at work the other day, the subject of prom came up at work too. I started to talk to my friend (20 F) about it. It turns out that she never got to go to her prom because she was in the hospital. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWell, this friend is pretty important to me. When I started my job almost a year and a half ago, I lacked almost any social skills. This friend was the first person to really talk to me and treat me like a friend. She helped me through one of the most trying times of my life, as I also had severe social anxiety prior to starting this job. While my friend probably doesn't know this, my progress to having the social skills I do now is largely in part to her. I see this as an opportunity to give back to her for helping me.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy girlfriend is opposed to me wanting to take her with us because she says that this should be our special night, and she wants me to herself. I hold the position that I want to take her due to the aforementioned reasons. So what do you guys think? AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for wanting to bring another girl to prom with his girlfriend. Let me break down the situation.\n\nFirst, the author is a 17-year-old guy in a relationship with his 18-year-old girlfriend. They've been dating almost a year. Prom is coming up, and he wants to invite his female friend who couldn't go to her prom because she was in the hospital. The friend helped him a lot, especially when he was struggling with social anxiety. The girlfriend is upset because she wants the prom to be a special night just for them.\n\nSo, the main issue here is about respecting the girlfriend's feelings versus the author's desire to do something nice for his friend. The author feels he's giving back to someone who helped him, but the girlfriend sees it as taking away from their special time together.\n\nI need to consider both sides. On one hand, the author's intentions are positive\u2014he wants to include someone who's important to him and has supported him. On the other hand, the girlfriend might feel neglected or that her needs aren't being prioritized. In relationships, communication is key. The author might not have considered how his decision would affect his girlfriend's feelings about their relationship's exclusivity and special moments.\n\nAlso, prom is typically a couple's event. Bringing another person could be seen as unconventional and might make the girlfriend feel like the author isn't fully committed to making it a memorable night for them. Even though the author's intentions are good, the impact on his girlfriend's feelings is significant. The girlfriend's perspective is valid because she's in a relationship and expects certain gestures to be directed solely at her.\n\nThe author should have discussed this more thoroughly with his girlfriend before making plans. He might have overlooked how important this event is to her and not considered her feelings about sharing the night. While his friend's history is tragic, the way to honor that might not be by attending prom together, especially if it causes conflict in his current relationship.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the author's actions, although well-intentioned, are inconsiderate of his girlfriend's feelings. He's prioritizing his friend's needs over his girlfriend's expectations for their relationship milestone. That makes him at fault here. Therefore, the answer should be A.\n"
