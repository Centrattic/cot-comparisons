With prom coming up soon, we sat down to talk about our plans. Well, at work the other day, the subject of prom came up at work too. I started to talk to my friend (20 F) about it. It turns out that she never got to go to her prom because she was in the hospital. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWell, this friend is pretty important to me. When I started my job almost a year and a half ago, I lacked almost any social skills. This friend was the first person to really talk to me and treat me like a friend. She helped me through one of the most trying times of my life, as I also had severe social anxiety prior to starting this job. While my friend probably doesn't know this, my progress to having the social skills I do now is largely in part to her. I see this as an opportunity to give back to her for helping me.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy girlfriend is opposed to me wanting to take her with us because she says that this should be our special night, and she wants me to herself. I hold the position that I want to take her due to the aforementioned reasons. So what do you guys think? AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for wanting to bring another girl to prom with his girlfriend. The situation involves a couple where the boyfriend wants to include a female friend who missed her prom due to being in the hospital. The girlfriend is upset because she believes prom should be their special night.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics of the relationship. The couple has been dating for almost a year, which is a significant time. Prom is typically seen as a milestone event for high schoolers, often involving a romantic partner. The girlfriend's expectation that it's their special night makes sense from her perspective; she might view it as a time to celebrate their relationship without others.\n\nOn the other hand, the author argues that his friend helped him develop socially and overcome anxiety, so inviting her is a way to give back. The friend in question is female, and the author is suggesting bringing her along. The key here is whether this action respects the girlfriend's feelings and the nature of prom as a couple's event.\n\nProm is usually a formal dance where couples attend together. Adding a third person, especially a friend of the boyfriend, could disrupt the couple's dynamic. The girlfriend's opposition is valid because she might feel her partner is prioritizing someone else's needs over their shared experience. The author's reasoning is noble\u2014expressing gratitude to a friend\u2014but it's important to weigh that against the girlfriend's perspective.\n\nThere's also the aspect of communication. The author discussed prom plans with his girlfriend, but when he mentioned it to his friend and decided to invite her, he might not have considered how his girlfriend would feel. It's possible he didn't check in with her before finalizing the plan, which could be seen as dismissive of her feelings.\n\nThe friend's situation is unfortunate, but the author could have found another way to show appreciation without altering the prom plans. Maybe a different event or a gesture outside of prom night. The fact that the girlfriend is 18 and the author is 17 might also play a role in how they perceive the importance of this event, but that's speculative.\n\nIn terms of responsibility, the author might be in the wrong because he didn't prioritize his girlfriend's feelings and the traditional expectations of prom. While he has valid reasons, the way he approached the situation may not have considered the impact on their relationship. The girlfriend's desire for a special night together is a legitimate expectation, and the author's inclusion of another person without her consent could be seen as a breach of that expectation.\n"
