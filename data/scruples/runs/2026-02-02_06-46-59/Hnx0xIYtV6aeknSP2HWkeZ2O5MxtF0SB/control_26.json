With prom coming up soon, we sat down to talk about our plans. Well, at work the other day, the subject of prom came up at work too. I started to talk to my friend (20 F) about it. It turns out that she never got to go to her prom because she was in the hospital. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWell, this friend is pretty important to me. When I started my job almost a year and a half ago, I lacked almost any social skills. This friend was the first person to really talk to me and treat me like a friend. She helped me through one of the most trying times of my life, as I also had severe social anxiety prior to starting this job. While my friend probably doesn't know this, my progress to having the social skills I do now is largely in part to her. I see this as an opportunity to give back to her for helping me.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy girlfriend is opposed to me wanting to take her with us because she says that this should be our special night, and she wants me to herself. I hold the position that I want to take her due to the aforementioned reasons. So what do you guys think? AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person (AITA) is in the wrong for wanting to bring another girl to prom with his girlfriend. \n\nFirst, the situation: the guy and his girlfriend are going to prom, but he wants to include his female friend who missed her prom due to hospitalization. The friend was instrumental in helping him develop social skills and overcome anxiety. His girlfriend is upset because she wants the night to be special and just for them.\n\nSo, the key points here. The guy wants to do something nice for his friend as a gesture of gratitude. That's a noble intention. However, bringing another person to a date that's supposed to be just the two of them could be a problem. The girlfriend feels it's their special night, so her perspective is about the intimacy and exclusivity of the event.\n\nNow, is the guy in the wrong? Well, he's considering his friend's feelings and wants to make up for her missing out. But he's also supposed to be focusing on his girlfriend's feelings. The girlfriend's reaction is valid because prom is typically seen as a significant event in a relationship, and having a third person there might disrupt that. \n\nThe question is whether his actions cross a boundary. The friend isn't a romantic interest; he's just bringing her along out of kindness. But the girlfriend might feel that the effort to include the friend is prioritizing someone else over the relationship. \n\nFrom a relational standpoint, communication is key. The guy should have discussed this with his girlfriend earlier, maybe found a way to honor his friend's request without compromising the girlfriend's expectations. Since he didn't consult her first and is now pushing for it, that could be where the mistake lies. \n\nBut then, the friend's situation is unique. The guy might feel a moral obligation to include her. However, the girlfriend's feelings about the event being theirs should be considered equally. There's a balance between gratitude towards a friend and respecting your partner's wishes.\n\nIn many relationships, partners expect that major events will be shared exclusively. Bringing someone else without the partner's consent could be seen as disrespectful. The girlfriend's reaction is about feeling valued and the event being about their relationship. \n\nSo, while the guy's intentions are good, the action of including the friend without considering the girlfriend's feelings first might be where he's in the wrong. The answer hinges on whether the action respects both the friend's needs and the girlfriend's expectations. Since he's choosing to prioritize the friend's inclusion over the girlfriend's comfort, it's likely he's at fault.\n"
