With prom coming up soon, we sat down to talk about our plans. Well, at work the other day, the subject of prom came up at work too. I started to talk to my friend (20 F) about it. It turns out that she never got to go to her prom because she was in the hospital. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWell, this friend is pretty important to me. When I started my job almost a year and a half ago, I lacked almost any social skills. This friend was the first person to really talk to me and treat me like a friend. She helped me through one of the most trying times of my life, as I also had severe social anxiety prior to starting this job. While my friend probably doesn't know this, my progress to having the social skills I do now is largely in part to her. I see this as an opportunity to give back to her for helping me.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy girlfriend is opposed to me wanting to take her with us because she says that this should be our special night, and she wants me to herself. I hold the position that I want to take her due to the aforementioned reasons. So what do you guys think? AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for wanting to bring another girl to prom with his girlfriend. So, the situation is that he's 17, his girlfriend is 18, and they've been dating almost a year. He wants to take his friend, who never went to prom and helped him with social anxiety, but his girlfriend is upset because she wants it to be just the two of them.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the relationship dynamics. The girlfriend's perspective is that prom is a special night for them, so she wants exclusivity. The author feels it's a chance to thank a friend who helped him a lot. But bringing another girl could be seen as a betrayal of the girlfriend's trust. Even if the friend is important, prom is typically a romantic event. The girlfriend might feel neglected or that her feelings aren't being respected.\n\nAlso, the fact that the friend is female might raise concerns. The girlfriend could perceive this as a potential issue for their relationship. The author might be prioritizing a friendship over his partner's feelings. While gratitude is important, the girlfriend's feelings about their special night shouldn't be overlooked. The author needs to balance his gratitude with his responsibility to his girlfriend.\n\nSo, the main points are: Prom is a special occasion for couples, the girlfriend's feelings of wanting it to be their night, and the potential for the friend's presence to cause jealousy or insecurity. The author's intentions are good, but the action might be inconsiderate. Therefore, the answer is likely A (the author is in the wrong) because he's not respecting his girlfriend's valid feelings about their special day.\n"
