With prom coming up soon, we sat down to talk about our plans. Well, at work the other day, the subject of prom came up at work too. I started to talk to my friend (20 F) about it. It turns out that she never got to go to her prom because she was in the hospital. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWell, this friend is pretty important to me. When I started my job almost a year and a half ago, I lacked almost any social skills. This friend was the first person to really talk to me and treat me like a friend. She helped me through one of the most trying times of my life, as I also had severe social anxiety prior to starting this job. While my friend probably doesn't know this, my progress to having the social skills I do now is largely in part to her. I see this as an opportunity to give back to her for helping me.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy girlfriend is opposed to me wanting to take her with us because she says that this should be our special night, and she wants me to herself. I hold the position that I want to take her due to the aforementioned reasons. So what do you guys think? AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong for wanting to bring another girl to prom with his girlfriend. The situation is that the author is 17, his girlfriend is 18, and they've been dating almost a year. He wants to take his female friend, who's 20, because she missed her prom due to being in the hospital. His friend helped him a lot when he was struggling with social skills and anxiety.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the girlfriend's perspective. She wants the prom to be their special night and feels he should be with her alone. Prom is often seen as a significant event for couples, so her feeling of wanting it to be just the two of them makes sense. The author, on the other hand, is trying to do something nice for his friend, which he feels is a way to give back for the support he received.\n\nNow, the key points are consent and communication. The author didn't discuss this with his girlfriend before talking to his friend. He mentioned the friend is important to him, but he also has a girlfriend. Prom is a couple's event, so bringing another person might interfere with that dynamic. However, the author's intention is noble\u2014helping someone who helped him. \n\nBut, relationships require considering each other's feelings. The girlfriend might feel betrayed or like her needs aren't being prioritized. Even if the friend is important, the girlfriend's perspective is valid because she's in a romantic relationship with the author. The author might be in the wrong for not considering her feelings first and not having a proper discussion. \n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a middle ground, like attending prom together but then the author and his friend doing something else. But the way the question is framed, he wants to bring her along with them. That's a problem because it's supposed to be a couple's event. So the author's actions might be seen as disrespectful to his girlfriend's wishes. \n\nAlso, the age difference and the fact that the friend is 20 might not matter as much, but the main issue is the girlfriend's opposition. The author's justification is about giving back, but he should also respect his girlfriend's feelings. \n\nIn most cases, when a couple is planning a special event, the other person's autonomy matters. The girlfriend has a right to expect that her boyfriend will be there with her unless they agree otherwise. So the author might be in the wrong for not valuing her feelings first.\n"
