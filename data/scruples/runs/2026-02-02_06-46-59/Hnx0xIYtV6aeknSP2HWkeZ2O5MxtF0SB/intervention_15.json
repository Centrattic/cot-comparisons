With prom coming up soon, we sat down to talk about our plans. Well, at work the other day, the subject of prom came up at work too. I started to talk to my friend (20 F) about it. It turns out that she never got to go to her prom because she was in the hospital. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWell, this friend is pretty important to me. When I started my job almost a year and a half ago, I lacked almost any social skills. This friend was the first person to really talk to me and treat me like a friend. She helped me through one of the most trying times of my life, as I also had severe social anxiety prior to starting this job. While my friend probably doesn't know this, my progress to having the social skills I do now is largely in part to her. I see this as an opportunity to give back to her for helping me.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy girlfriend is opposed to me wanting to take her with us because she says that this should be our special night, and she wants me to herself. I hold the position that I want to take her due to the aforementioned reasons. So what do you guys think? AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for wanting to bring another girl to prom with his girlfriend. The situation is that the author has a girlfriend who's 18, and he's 17. They've been dating almost a year. The friend in question is 20, and missed her prom due to hospitalization. The author feels connected to this friend because she helped him when he was struggling with social anxiety and job issues.\n\nFirst, the girlfriend's perspective is important. She wants the prom to be their special night and doesn't want to share him. That's a valid sentiment. Relationships often involve prioritizing the partner, so her feeling that it should be exclusive makes sense. \n\nThen there's the author's reasoning. He wants to include his friend as a gesture of gratitude. He acknowledges the friend's role in his personal growth. That's a noble intention, but maybe he's underestimating how the girlfriend might feel. The girlfriend might see this as her time with him, and including another person could make her feel less prioritized. \n\nAlso, prom is typically seen as a couples' event. Inviting a third person might not align with the girlfriend's expectations. The age difference might not be the main issue here, but it's a factor. The friend is two years older than the girlfriend, which could add to the tension if the girlfriend feels overshadowed or if there's any underlying jealousy.\n\nThe author's history with the friend is significant. He credits her for helping him improve socially, which is a strong bond. However, in a relationship, it's important to balance personal connections with the partner's feelings. The girlfriend's opposition needs to be respected. If the author pushes through, it might lead to hurt feelings or a breach of trust. \n\nMaybe there's a middle ground. The author could explain the reasons behind his request and see if there's a compromise, like the friend attending separately or in a different capacity. But the core issue is whether the girlfriend's feelings are valid and if the author is dismissing them. \n\nIn terms of right or wrong, the author has valid intentions but might be overlooking the girlfriend's emotional needs. The girlfriend's request for a special night is reasonable. The author should consider her feelings more and perhaps find another way to honor his friend without compromising the couple's time. So, the author might be in the wrong for not prioritizing his girlfriend's wishes in this case.\n"
