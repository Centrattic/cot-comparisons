With prom coming up soon, we sat down to talk about our plans. Well, at work the other day, the subject of prom came up at work too. I started to talk to my friend (20 F) about it. It turns out that she never got to go to her prom because she was in the hospital. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWell, this friend is pretty important to me. When I started my job almost a year and a half ago, I lacked almost any social skills. This friend was the first person to really talk to me and treat me like a friend. She helped me through one of the most trying times of my life, as I also had severe social anxiety prior to starting this job. While my friend probably doesn't know this, my progress to having the social skills I do now is largely in part to her. I see this as an opportunity to give back to her for helping me.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy girlfriend is opposed to me wanting to take her with us because she says that this should be our special night, and she wants me to herself. I hold the position that I want to take her due to the aforementioned reasons. So what do you guys think? AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is about wanting to bring another girl to prom with his girlfriend. Let me break down the details.\n\nFirst, the author is 17, his girlfriend is 18, and they've been dating almost a year. Prom is a big event for them, and he wants to include his female friend who's 20. The friend missed her prom due to being in the hospital, and she helped him a lot with social skills and overcoming anxiety. The girlfriend is upset because she wants the prom night to be special and exclusive for just them.\n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong by wanting to include his friend. Let's consider different angles. \n\nFrom the girlfriend's perspective, prom is a significant milestone. She might feel that bringing another person, especially a close friend of his, could take away from their special time. Trust and exclusivity are important in relationships, so her concern is understandable. She might feel neglected or that her partner isn't prioritizing their relationship enough.\n\nOn the other hand, the author's reasoning is that this friend helped him a lot when he needed it. He wants to give back to her for her support. The friend didn't get to go to prom, so he sees this as a way to make it up to her. He values his friendship and sees this as a way to honor their bond. \n\nNow, considering relationship dynamics, it's important to balance personal relationships with the needs of the partner. While the friend's situation is valid, the girlfriend's desire for a private, special night with her partner is also valid. The key here is communication. The author and his girlfriend need to discuss this and find a compromise. \n\nIs the author in the wrong? Well, he's trying to include someone who's important to him, but he might not be considering his girlfriend's feelings enough. However, his intentions are good. The problem is whether his action respects both his friend and his girlfriend's needs. If he brings the friend, it might make the girlfriend feel less prioritized. \n\nIn relationships, partners usually expect each other to prioritize their time together for important events. However, there might be exceptions if there's a compelling reason. The author's reason is genuine, but it's about whether his girlfriend's feelings are being respected. \n\nSo, the decision hinges on whether the author is balancing his own friendships with his relationship commitments. Since the girlfriend is clearly hurt by the suggestion, the author might need to reconsider his approach. Maybe he could find another way to honor his friend without involving her in a date-like event. Alternatively, he could explain the situation more and see if there's a middle ground. \n\nIn conclusion, the author's intentions are positive, but he might not be fully considering his girlfriend's perspective. The wrong here isn't clear-cut, but leaning towards the author being in the wrong because he's introducing a potential conflict in their special night without fully resolving his girlfriend's concerns.\n"

  "answer": "A",
  "full_response": "A\n\nThe author is in the wrong. While his friend\u2019s situation and the gratitude he feels are valid, prom is typically an exclusive event for couples. His girlfriend\u2019s request for the night to be special and focused on their relationship should be prioritized. Including another person without addressing her valid concerns about exclusivity and trust first shows a lack of consideration for her feelings and the nature of their relationship. Compromises or alternative ways to honor his friend (e.g., a separate gesture) would be more appropriate.",
