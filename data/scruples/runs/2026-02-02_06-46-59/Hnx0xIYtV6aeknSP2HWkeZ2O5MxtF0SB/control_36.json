With prom coming up soon, we sat down to talk about our plans. Well, at work the other day, the subject of prom came up at work too. I started to talk to my friend (20 F) about it. It turns out that she never got to go to her prom because she was in the hospital. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWell, this friend is pretty important to me. When I started my job almost a year and a half ago, I lacked almost any social skills. This friend was the first person to really talk to me and treat me like a friend. She helped me through one of the most trying times of my life, as I also had severe social anxiety prior to starting this job. While my friend probably doesn't know this, my progress to having the social skills I do now is largely in part to her. I see this as an opportunity to give back to her for helping me.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy girlfriend is opposed to me wanting to take her with us because she says that this should be our special night, and she wants me to herself. I hold the position that I want to take her due to the aforementioned reasons. So what do you guys think? AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user wants to know if the author is in the wrong for wanting to bring another girl to prom with his girlfriend. The situation is that the author is 17, his girlfriend is 18, and they've been dating almost a year. He wants to take his friend, a 20-year-old female, because she missed her prom due to being in the hospital. The friend helped him a lot when he had social anxiety and was working on his social skills.\n\nSo, the girlfriend is upset because she wants the prom to be their special night. The author feels he's giving back to the friend who helped him. Now, I need to figure out if he's in the wrong.\n\nFirst, I should consider the girlfriend's perspective. Prom is a significant event, and she probably expects it to be just the two of them. The author's decision to include another person might make her feel less prioritized. Trust and communication in a relationship are important. If he didn't consult her first, that could be a problem. But in the scenario, he mentioned talking to her about plans, then discussing it with his friend at work. So maybe he didn't involve her in the decision-making process.\n\nThen there's the reason for wanting to take the friend. The friend helped him a lot, so he wants to repay her kindness. That's a noble intention. However, bringing a third person to a couples' event might not be the best way to show appreciation. Maybe he should have found another way to thank her instead of involving his girlfriend.\n\nAlso, the friend is 20, which is an age difference from the author's 17. Depending on the location, there could be legal or social implications, but that's probably not the main issue here. The main issue is the girlfriend's feelings and the nature of prom.\n\nProm is typically a couples' event, so bringing someone else might be seen as unusual. The girlfriend's reaction is understandable. The author might be missing the point that the event is about the relationship between him and his girlfriend. Including another person without the girlfriend's consent could be seen as inconsiderate. He might need to find another way to honor the friend's help without compromising his relationship.\n\nOn the other hand, the author's intention is appreciative. He's trying to do something good, but maybe he didn't consider the impact on his girlfriend. The key here is communication. If he had discussed it with his girlfriend earlier and explained the reasons, maybe they could have found a compromise. But since he didn't, and she's opposed, he might be in the wrong for not prioritizing her feelings in this situation.\n\nSo, considering all this, it seems like the author is in the wrong because he didn't consider his girlfriend's feelings and expectations for the prom, and he included someone else without her consent, even though his intentions were good. The answer would be A.\n"
