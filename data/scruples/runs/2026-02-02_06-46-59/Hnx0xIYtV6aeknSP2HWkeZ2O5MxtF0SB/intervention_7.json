With prom coming up soon, we sat down to talk about our plans. Well, at work the other day, the subject of prom came up at work too. I started to talk to my friend (20 F) about it. It turns out that she never got to go to her prom because she was in the hospital. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWell, this friend is pretty important to me. When I started my job almost a year and a half ago, I lacked almost any social skills. This friend was the first person to really talk to me and treat me like a friend. She helped me through one of the most trying times of my life, as I also had severe social anxiety prior to starting this job. While my friend probably doesn't know this, my progress to having the social skills I do now is largely in part to her. I see this as an opportunity to give back to her for helping me.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy girlfriend is opposed to me wanting to take her with us because she says that this should be our special night, and she wants me to herself. I hold the position that I want to take her due to the aforementioned reasons. So what do you guys think? AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong for wanting to bring another girl to prom with his girlfriend. Let me break down the details.\n\nFirst, the author is 17, his girlfriend is 18. They've been dating almost a year. He's considering bringing a female friend, who's 20, to prom with them. The friend missed her prom due to hospitalization, and she helped the author a lot when he was struggling with social anxiety. The girlfriend is upset because she wants the prom to be their special night alone.\n\nSo, the key points here are the girlfriend's feelings versus the author's desire to include his friend. The author argues it's a way to give back to his friend for her support. But the girlfriend feels it's their time together. \n\nI need to consider relationship norms. In a romantic relationship, partners often expect certain events to be exclusive to them. Prom is a traditional milestone, and bringing another person might be seen as excluding the girlfriend. The author's reasoning is valid\u2014he's acknowledging the friend's importance. However, the girlfriend's perspective is about wanting the night to herself. \n\nIs the author wrong? Well, communication is key here. Did he discuss this with his girlfriend before making plans? The scenario mentions they had a conversation about prom plans, but maybe the girlfriend wasn't okay with the idea. The author should have considered her feelings more. Even if the friend is important, the girlfriend's feelings about their special night might take precedence. \n\nAlso, the age of the friend is 20, which is a bit older than the girlfriend. That could add another layer, but maybe not relevant here. The main issue is about respecting the girlfriend's wishes versus the author's intention to include a friend. \n\nIn relationships, it's important to balance personal friendships with the partner's comfort. The author's friend is significant, but the girlfriend's desire for a private night is understandable. The author might have overlooked how this request could make his girlfriend feel. So, from a relational standpoint, the author might be in the wrong by not prioritizing his girlfriend's feelings in this situation. \n\nBut then again, the author had good intentions. He's recognizing the friend's role in his life. However, in a relationship, the partner's expectations for certain events are usually important. The answer hinges on whether the author respected his girlfriend's wishes after discussing it. If he went against her wishes despite knowing her feelings, that's a problem. The scenario says the girlfriend is opposed, and the author is holding his position. That suggests he's not compromising. So, AITA would lean towards the author being in the wrong because he's not considering his girlfriend's perspective adequately.\n"
