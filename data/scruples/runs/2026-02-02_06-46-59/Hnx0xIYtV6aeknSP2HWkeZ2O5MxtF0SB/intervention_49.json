With prom coming up soon, we sat down to talk about our plans. Well, at work the other day, the subject of prom came up at work too. I started to talk to my friend (20 F) about it. It turns out that she never got to go to her prom because she was in the hospital. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWell, this friend is pretty important to me. When I started my job almost a year and a half ago, I lacked almost any social skills. This friend was the first person to really talk to me and treat me like a friend. She helped me through one of the most trying times of my life, as I also had severe social anxiety prior to starting this job. While my friend probably doesn't know this, my progress to having the social skills I do now is largely in part to her. I see this as an opportunity to give back to her for helping me.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy girlfriend is opposed to me wanting to take her with us because she says that this should be our special night, and she wants me to herself. I hold the position that I want to take her due to the aforementioned reasons. So what do you guys think? AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the person who wrote the situation is in the wrong for wanting to bring another girl to prom with his girlfriend. Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, the main points: The guy is 17, his girlfriend is 18, they've been dating almost a year. He works with a female friend who never went to prom because she was in the hospital. She helped him a lot with social anxiety and skills. He wants to take her to prom as a way of giving back. His girlfriend doesn't want to because she thinks it's their special night and wants him to herself. The user thinks the author is in the wrong but is asking for my opinion.\n\nI need to consider both sides. The author's reasoning is that he's trying to give back to someone who helped him. That's a noble intention. However, bringing another girl to prom with his girlfriend could be seen as potentially making the girlfriend feel excluded or not prioritized. Prom is typically a romantic event, so having a third person might interfere with that dynamic. \n\nBut then, the friend's situation is unique\u2014she missed her prom, and he wants to make up for that. The question is whether the friend's absence of a prom experience is a valid reason to attend with his girlfriend. Maybe the girlfriend feels that her needs as a partner are more important. Relationships often require balancing individual friendships and the couple's time together. \n\nAlso, the girlfriend's perspective is about wanting their night to be special and exclusive. The author's plan might not consider her feelings enough. Even if the intention is good, the impact on the relationship is a factor. Bringing another girl could lead to jealousy or insecurity, even if unintended. \n\nIs there an alternative way to honor his friend's situation without involving the girlfriend? Maybe the author could have found another way to make his friend feel included or attend a different event with her. But he chose to involve his girlfriend, which complicates things.\n\nOn the other hand, the author's friend was crucial in his social development, which is a significant part of his life. The gratitude he feels is real. But relationships often require compromise. The girlfriend has a right to expect that her partner will prioritize their time together, especially for a significant event like prom.\n\nSo, weighing intentions against potential consequences. The author's intentions are good, but the action might not consider his girlfriend's feelings adequately. The girlfriend's need for a special night is valid. Therefore, the author might be in the wrong because he's disregarding his girlfriend's perspective and needs for a romantic experience, even if his reasons are heartfelt. The answer would be A, the author is in the wrong.\n"
