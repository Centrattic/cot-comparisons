With prom coming up soon, we sat down to talk about our plans. Well, at work the other day, the subject of prom came up at work too. I started to talk to my friend (20 F) about it. It turns out that she never got to go to her prom because she was in the hospital. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWell, this friend is pretty important to me. When I started my job almost a year and a half ago, I lacked almost any social skills. This friend was the first person to really talk to me and treat me like a friend. She helped me through one of the most trying times of my life, as I also had severe social anxiety prior to starting this job. While my friend probably doesn't know this, my progress to having the social skills I do now is largely in part to her. I see this as an opportunity to give back to her for helping me.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy girlfriend is opposed to me wanting to take her with us because she says that this should be our special night, and she wants me to herself. I hold the position that I want to take her due to the aforementioned reasons. So what do you guys think? AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break down this situation. The user is a 17-year-old guy who's been dating his girlfriend for almost a year. They're planning to go to prom together. He wants to bring his female friend, who's 20 and was in the hospital and missed her prom. The friend helped him a lot with social skills when he started the job. The girlfriend is upset because she wants it to be their special night. The user is asking if he's in the wrong.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The main issue is the girlfriend's feelings versus the user's desire to include his friend. The girlfriend's perspective is that prom is a significant event for couples, and bringing another person might make it less special for her. On the other hand, the user feels that inviting his friend is a way to repay her for her support.\n\nI should think about the expectations around prom. In many cultures, prom is a time for couples to be together, and bringing someone else could be seen as inconsiderate. However, the user's reasoning is based on gratitude towards his friend, which is valid. The problem arises when personal gratitude conflicts with the partner's emotional needs.\n\nAnother angle is communication. The user mentioned discussing prom plans with his girlfriend, but maybe didn't fully consider how she'd feel about bringing another person. It's possible he didn't check in with her before making the suggestion, which could lead to hurt feelings. The girlfriend's reaction indicates that this is important to her, so her feelings should be a priority.\n\nAlso, the user is 17, so maybe he's still learning about relationships and how to balance different needs. The friend's situation is understandable, but the user needs to weigh the emotional impact on his partner. While the motivation is good, the outcome might not be fair to the girlfriend if it's about their special night.\n\nIn terms of responsibility, the user initiated the idea without considering the girlfriend's perspective fully. The girlfriend's feelings are valid, and the user might need to respect that. So, even though his intentions are good, the action could be seen as inconsiderate, making him at least partially in the wrong.\n"
