With prom coming up soon, we sat down to talk about our plans. Well, at work the other day, the subject of prom came up at work too. I started to talk to my friend (20 F) about it. It turns out that she never got to go to her prom because she was in the hospital. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWell, this friend is pretty important to me. When I started my job almost a year and a half ago, I lacked almost any social skills. This friend was the first person to really talk to me and treat me like a friend. She helped me through one of the most trying times of my life, as I also had severe social anxiety prior to starting this job. While my friend probably doesn't know this, my progress to having the social skills I do now is largely in part to her. I see this as an opportunity to give back to her for helping me.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy girlfriend is opposed to me wanting to take her with us because she says that this should be our special night, and she wants me to herself. I hold the position that I want to take her due to the aforementioned reasons. So what do you guys think? AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for wanting to bring another girl to prom with his girlfriend. First, I need to understand the situation.\n\nThe author is a guy in a relationship with a girlfriend. They're planning prom, but he wants to bring a female friend who missed her prom due to hospitalization. The friend was important in helping him develop social skills when he had anxiety. His girlfriend doesn't want that because she considers prom a special night for just the two of them.\n\nSo, the question is whether the author is at fault here. Let me break it down. On one hand, the author is trying to do something nice for a friend who helped him a lot. On the other hand, the girlfriend feels this is their special time. \n\nI should consider the dynamics of relationships. Prom is typically seen as a couples' event, especially when the couple has been together for a while. The girlfriend's feelings of wanting exclusivity make sense. The author's intention is to honor his friend's request and repay her kindness, which is noble, but he needs to balance that with his partner's feelings.\n\nIs there a way to satisfy both? Maybe the friend could go with someone else or attend a different event. The author might not have considered alternative solutions. Also, communication is key. If the girlfriend feels her concerns aren't being heard, that could strain the relationship. \n\nThe author's reasoning is about gratitude and giving back, which is valid, but relationships require considering both partners' comfort. The friend's situation is unique, but prom is a traditional event where couples expect privacy. \n\nSo, the author's mistake might be not being considerate enough of his girlfriend's perspective. Even with good intentions, he's prioritizing his friend's needs over his partner's. That could be seen as inconsiderate. However, it's also about whether he's being unreasonable. If the friend is truly alone and wants to attend, maybe there's a compromise. But the friend's reason for missing her prom might be more complex. The author might need to explore other options for the friend instead of including her in his date night.\n\nIn conclusion, while the author has good intentions, he's in the wrong because he's not prioritizing his girlfriend's feelings regarding their special event. The answer is A.\n"
