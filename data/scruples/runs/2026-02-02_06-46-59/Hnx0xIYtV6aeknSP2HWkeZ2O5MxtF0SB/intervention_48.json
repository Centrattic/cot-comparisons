With prom coming up soon, we sat down to talk about our plans. Well, at work the other day, the subject of prom came up at work too. I started to talk to my friend (20 F) about it. It turns out that she never got to go to her prom because she was in the hospital. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWell, this friend is pretty important to me. When I started my job almost a year and a half ago, I lacked almost any social skills. This friend was the first person to really talk to me and treat me like a friend. She helped me through one of the most trying times of my life, as I also had severe social anxiety prior to starting this job. While my friend probably doesn't know this, my progress to having the social skills I do now is largely in part to her. I see this as an opportunity to give back to her for helping me.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy girlfriend is opposed to me wanting to take her with us because she says that this should be our special night, and she wants me to herself. I hold the position that I want to take her due to the aforementioned reasons. So what do you guys think? AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the \"AITA\" post is in the wrong for wanting to bring another girl to prom with his girlfriend. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The person is 17, his girlfriend is 18, and they've been dating almost a year. The other girl is a friend who never went to prom because she was in the hospital. She helped him a lot when he was struggling with social anxiety, so he feels grateful and wants to include her as a way of giving back.\n\nThe girlfriend is upset because she wants it to be their special night and doesn't want to share him. The author thinks it's about giving back to his friend. \n\nNow, thinking about relationships, it's common for partners to want certain things for themselves, like having a night to themselves. Prom is a significant event, often seen as a couple's moment. Bringing another person might make the girlfriend feel less prioritized. \n\nOn the other hand, the author has valid reasons for wanting to include his friend. The friend helped him a lot, so he wants to make her happy. There's a sense of gratitude and wanting to do something nice for someone who's been supportive.\n\nBut here's the conflict: the girlfriend's feelings are important too. Even if the author's intentions are good, the girlfriend might feel that her needs aren't being respected. In a relationship, both partners' needs should be considered. The author is trying to balance between his friendship and his romantic relationship. \n\nHowever, inviting another person to a romantic event like prom can be seen as a breach of trust or lack of consideration. The girlfriend might feel that the author isn't valuing the relationship enough. The author might not realize how this could be perceived. \n\nAnother angle: the fact that the friend is female might add to the girlfriend's insecurity. Even if the author is just being kind, the girlfriend might worry about their dynamic. The author should address these feelings directly, maybe by explaining his reasons and ensuring his girlfriend feels secure. \n\nIn terms of responsibility, the author should consider if there's a compromise. Maybe the friend can attend separately, or they can find another way to honor her without intruding on the prom date. But since the question is whether the author is in the wrong, the main issue is whether his action is respectful to the girlfriend's wishes. \n\nSo, even if the author has good intentions, he might be in the wrong if he insists on bringing the friend without considering his girlfriend's feelings. The girlfriend's request for the night to be just the two of them is a valid boundary. Not respecting that could be seen as prioritizing a friendship over the romantic relationship, which is a common issue in relationships where boundaries aren't communicated or respected. \n\nTherefore, the answer is A (the author is in the wrong) because he's not respecting his girlfriend's wishes for a private night, despite his good intentions.\n"
