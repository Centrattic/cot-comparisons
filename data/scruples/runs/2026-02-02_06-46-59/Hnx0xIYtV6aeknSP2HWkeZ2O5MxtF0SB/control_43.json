With prom coming up soon, we sat down to talk about our plans. Well, at work the other day, the subject of prom came up at work too. I started to talk to my friend (20 F) about it. It turns out that she never got to go to her prom because she was in the hospital. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWell, this friend is pretty important to me. When I started my job almost a year and a half ago, I lacked almost any social skills. This friend was the first person to really talk to me and treat me like a friend. She helped me through one of the most trying times of my life, as I also had severe social anxiety prior to starting this job. While my friend probably doesn't know this, my progress to having the social skills I do now is largely in part to her. I see this as an opportunity to give back to her for helping me.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy girlfriend is opposed to me wanting to take her with us because she says that this should be our special night, and she wants me to herself. I hold the position that I want to take her due to the aforementioned reasons. So what do you guys think? AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong for wanting to bring another girl to prom with his girlfriend. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the guy is 17, his girlfriend is 18, and they've been dating almost a year. Prom is a big event, usually meant for couples. He wants to bring his female friend, who's 20, because she missed her prom due to hospitalization and helped him with social skills when he was struggling. His girlfriend is upset because she wants the night to be special just for them.\n\nSo, the main issue is about respecting the girlfriend's feelings versus the guy's desire to include a friend who's been supportive. The guy's reasoning is that he wants to give back to his friend, but his girlfriend feels it's their special night. \n\nI need to consider both sides. On one hand, the girlfriend's perspective is valid\u2014prom is typically a couple's event, and she might feel hurt or neglected if he brings someone else. On the other hand, the guy has good intentions, valuing his friend's support and wanting to honor her. But is that a valid reason to override his girlfriend's feelings?\n\nIt's about communication and mutual respect. The girlfriend's opposition is about her emotional needs. The guy's action might be seen as self-centered if he doesn't consider her feelings. Even if the friend's situation is sympathetic, the prom is a personal event between the couple. The guy might be making a mistake by not respecting his girlfriend's wishes, leading to potential relationship strain. So, the answer would be AITA A (the author is in the wrong).\n"
