With prom coming up soon, we sat down to talk about our plans. Well, at work the other day, the subject of prom came up at work too. I started to talk to my friend (20 F) about it. It turns out that she never got to go to her prom because she was in the hospital. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWell, this friend is pretty important to me. When I started my job almost a year and a half ago, I lacked almost any social skills. This friend was the first person to really talk to me and treat me like a friend. She helped me through one of the most trying times of my life, as I also had severe social anxiety prior to starting this job. While my friend probably doesn't know this, my progress to having the social skills I do now is largely in part to her. I see this as an opportunity to give back to her for helping me.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy girlfriend is opposed to me wanting to take her with us because she says that this should be our special night, and she wants me to herself. I hold the position that I want to take her due to the aforementioned reasons. So what do you guys think? AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, so I need to figure out whether the person asking this question (the author) is in the wrong. Let me start by understanding the situation.\n\nThe author is 17, male, and in a relationship with his girlfriend who is 18. They're planning prom. The author wants to bring another girl, his friend who is 20, to prom with them. The friend missed her prom because she was in the hospital. The author says this friend helped him a lot when he started his job, improved his social skills, and he wants to give back by taking her to prom. His girlfriend is upset because she wants it to be a special night just for them. The author is asking if he's the asshole (AITA) for wanting to bring the friend.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the girlfriend's perspective. Prom is typically seen as a significant event for couples, a time for them to have their own experience. The girlfriend's objection is that she wants it to be \"their special night,\" which is a common sentiment. The author is introducing a third person into what's usually a two-person event, which could be seen as disregarding her feelings or the traditional aspect of prom.\n\nOn the other hand, the author's reasoning is that the friend has been very supportive and he wants to thank her. He feels a sense of gratitude and a desire to return the favor. However, bringing the friend to prom could be seen as a betrayal of trust or a lack of consideration for the girlfriend's feelings. \n\nI need to weigh the social norms here. Prom is a shared experience between couples, and adding someone else might be considered inappropriate, especially if the girlfriend is not okay with it. The author is prioritizing his friendship over his girlfriend's expectations. While the friend's situation is unfortunate, the author's solution might not be the best way to show appreciation. There are other ways to give back, like organizing a different event or expressing gratitude in another form.\n\nAnother angle is communication. The author mentioned that the friend probably doesn't know about his progress, so maybe he hasn't shared the full extent of her impact on his life. However, the decision to bring her to prom is a big step that affects the girlfriend. The author might not have considered how his girlfriend would feel before making the request. \n\nAlso, the girlfriend is 18, which is an adult age in many places, and her feelings should be respected. The author's age is 17, so they're both young, but that doesn't mitigate the need for mutual respect in the relationship. The girlfriend's objection is valid, and the author's actions might be seen as selfish or inconsiderate.\n\nSo, considering all these points, the author is likely in the wrong because he's not respecting his girlfriend's wishes and the traditional nature of prom as a two-person event. His intentions are good, but the action of bringing the friend without considering the girlfriend's feelings is problematic.\n"
