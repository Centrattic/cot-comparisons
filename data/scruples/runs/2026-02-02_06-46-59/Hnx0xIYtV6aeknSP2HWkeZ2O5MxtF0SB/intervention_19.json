With prom coming up soon, we sat down to talk about our plans. Well, at work the other day, the subject of prom came up at work too. I started to talk to my friend (20 F) about it. It turns out that she never got to go to her prom because she was in the hospital. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWell, this friend is pretty important to me. When I started my job almost a year and a half ago, I lacked almost any social skills. This friend was the first person to really talk to me and treat me like a friend. She helped me through one of the most trying times of my life, as I also had severe social anxiety prior to starting this job. While my friend probably doesn't know this, my progress to having the social skills I do now is largely in part to her. I see this as an opportunity to give back to her for helping me.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy girlfriend is opposed to me wanting to take her with us because she says that this should be our special night, and she wants me to herself. I hold the position that I want to take her due to the aforementioned reasons. So what do you guys think? AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong for wanting to bring another girl to prom with his girlfriend.\n\nFirst, the key points: The guy is 17, his girlfriend is 18, and they've been dating almost a year. He wants to take his friend, a girl who never went to prom, because she helped him a lot with social anxiety. The girlfriend is upset because she wants the night to be just the two of them. The friend is important to him and he feels he needs to include her as a way to give back.\n\nSo, the main issue is about respecting the girlfriend's feelings versus the author's desire to include his friend. Prom is traditionally a couples event, so bringing someone else might be seen as disrupting that. However, the author's reasons are noble\u2014helping a friend who's important to him.\n\nI need to consider communication. Did the author talk to his girlfriend about this before deciding? The post says they talked about prom plans, but then he discussed it with his friend at work. Maybe the girlfriend felt left out of the decision-making process. Also, the girlfriend's perspective is valid; she might feel that the prom is their special time. The author might not realize how important that night is to her.\n\nAnother angle is the friend's situation. She missed prom due to hospitalization, so the author wants to make up for that. But bringing her to prom with the couple could complicate things. Maybe there's a compromise, like taking the friend to prom separately or doing something else. But the author insists on bringing her along with them, which the girlfriend refuses.\n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong. If I consider the girlfriend's feelings and the traditional context of prom being a couples event, the author's actions might be seen as inconsiderate. However, his intentions are positive. But intentions vs. impact\u2014sometimes even good intentions can cause harm if they don't consider the other person's feelings.\n\nAlso, the author's friend is a girl, and bringing her might make the girlfriend uncomfortable, thinking there's an ulterior motive. The author needs to address her concerns and find a solution that respects both their needs. If he proceeds without considering her feelings, he's in the wrong.\n\nSo, balancing the two sides: the author's valid reasons for wanting to include his friend versus the girlfriend's desire for a private evening. The author might be in the wrong because he's not prioritizing his girlfriend's feelings and the significance of the event. He should have discussed it more thoroughly with her and found a compromise instead of insisting on his plan.\n"
