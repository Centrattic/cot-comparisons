With prom coming up soon, we sat down to talk about our plans. Well, at work the other day, the subject of prom came up at work too. I started to talk to my friend (20 F) about it. It turns out that she never got to go to her prom because she was in the hospital. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWell, this friend is pretty important to me. When I started my job almost a year and a half ago, I lacked almost any social skills. This friend was the first person to really talk to me and treat me like a friend. She helped me through one of the most trying times of my life, as I also had severe social anxiety prior to starting this job. While my friend probably doesn't know this, my progress to having the social skills I do now is largely in part to her. I see this as an opportunity to give back to her for helping me.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy girlfriend is opposed to me wanting to take her with us because she says that this should be our special night, and she wants me to herself. I hold the position that I want to take her due to the aforementioned reasons. So what do you guys think? AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The person is asking if they're at fault for wanting to bring their female friend to prom with their girlfriend. The key points here are the relationships and motivations involved.\n\nFirst, the girlfriend is 18 and they've been dating almost a year. Prom is a significant event for couples, so the girlfriend's desire for it to be their special night makes sense. She wants to spend the evening just with her boyfriend, which is a reasonable expectation. On the other hand, the boyfriend has a close female friend who was his support system during a tough time. He wants to include her as a thank you.\n\nNow, the question is whether the boyfriend is in the wrong. From a relationship standpoint, the girlfriend's feelings are valid. Prom is a traditional couples' event, so bringing another girl might come off as dismissive of her feelings. The boyfriend's intention is noble\u2014wanting to repay his friend\u2014but he needs to consider his partner's perspective. The girlfriend might feel that he's prioritizing someone else's experience over their couple time. \n\nHowever, the boyfriend's reasoning isn't entirely selfish. His friend helped him through social anxiety, which is a big deal. But in a romantic relationship, partners often expect to have priority for such events. The boyfriend might not be in the wrong if he communicates and finds a compromise, like attending a different event with his friend or finding another way to thank her. But as it stands, insisting on bringing her without considering his girlfriend's feelings could be seen as inconsiderate. \n\nSo, the answer hinges on whether the boyfriend's actions respect his girlfriend's wishes. Since he's choosing to include another person despite her objections, it's likely he's in the wrong. The right approach would be to find a solution that honors both his gratitude and his girlfriend's desire for a private evening.\n"
