With prom coming up soon, we sat down to talk about our plans. Well, at work the other day, the subject of prom came up at work too. I started to talk to my friend (20 F) about it. It turns out that she never got to go to her prom because she was in the hospital. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWell, this friend is pretty important to me. When I started my job almost a year and a half ago, I lacked almost any social skills. This friend was the first person to really talk to me and treat me like a friend. She helped me through one of the most trying times of my life, as I also had severe social anxiety prior to starting this job. While my friend probably doesn't know this, my progress to having the social skills I do now is largely in part to her. I see this as an opportunity to give back to her for helping me.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy girlfriend is opposed to me wanting to take her with us because she says that this should be our special night, and she wants me to herself. I hold the position that I want to take her due to the aforementioned reasons. So what do you guys think? AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong for wanting to bring another girl to prom with his girlfriend. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the context. The guy is 17, his girlfriend is 18, and they've been dating almost a year. His friend, who's 20, didn't get to go to prom because she was in the hospital. He feels this friend helped him a lot with social anxiety and wants to include her as a way to say thanks. But his girlfriend is upset because she wants prom to be their special night.\n\nSo, the key points here are the boyfriend's intentions. He's not trying to be romantic with the friend but to include her as a gesture of gratitude. However, the girlfriend feels it's their night and doesn't want to share him. \n\nFrom a relationship perspective, communication is key. The boyfriend should have discussed this with his girlfriend before making plans. Even if his intentions are good, bringing another person could make his girlfriend feel less prioritized. On the other hand, the friend has a valid reason for missing prom, and the boyfriend might feel it's important to acknowledge that.\n\nBut the girlfriend's feelings matter too. Prom is a significant event, and she might feel it's a time for just the two of them. The boyfriend's actions could be seen as dismissive of her needs, even if unintended. However, if he's transparent about his intentions and they can find a compromise, that's a better path. But since the question is whether he's in the wrong, I need to assess if his actions are inherently wrong.\n\nIn relationships, partners often have different expectations. The girlfriend's perspective is valid because she expects her boyfriend to prioritize her on a special occasion. The boyfriend's perspective is also valid because he's trying to honor a friend's missed experience. However, the main issue is whether he considered her feelings first. Since he discussed it at work first and then brought it up, maybe he didn't communicate properly. \n\nSo, the answer might be A (he's in the wrong) because he didn't prioritize his girlfriend's feelings, but some might argue B because his intentions are good. But given that relationships require considering the partner's perspective, especially in such a significant event, he might be in the wrong for not valuing her feelings enough. However, it's a nuanced situation. But according to the typical \"Am I the Asshole\" analysis, if the boyfriend's actions are causing the girlfriend distress without sufficient consideration, then he's the asshole. So likely A.\n"
