With prom coming up soon, we sat down to talk about our plans. Well, at work the other day, the subject of prom came up at work too. I started to talk to my friend (20 F) about it. It turns out that she never got to go to her prom because she was in the hospital. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWell, this friend is pretty important to me. When I started my job almost a year and a half ago, I lacked almost any social skills. This friend was the first person to really talk to me and treat me like a friend. She helped me through one of the most trying times of my life, as I also had severe social anxiety prior to starting this job. While my friend probably doesn't know this, my progress to having the social skills I do now is largely in part to her. I see this as an opportunity to give back to her for helping me.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy girlfriend is opposed to me wanting to take her with us because she says that this should be our special night, and she wants me to herself. I hold the position that I want to take her due to the aforementioned reasons. So what do you guys think? AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong for wanting to bring another girl to prom with his girlfriend. \n\nFirst, the setup: The person is 17, their girlfriend is 18, and they've been dating almost a year. They want to bring their female friend (20) to prom. The friend never went to prom because she was in the hospital. She's important to them because she helped them with social anxiety and improved their social skills.\n\nThe girlfriend is upset because she wants the prom night to be just the two of them, their special night. The author thinks they want to take the friend as a way to give back for her help.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author is in the wrong (A) or not (B). \n\nSo, prom is typically a couple's event. Bringing a third person could be seen as unusual. The girlfriend's perspective is valid\u2014she wants a special night with her partner. The author's reasoning is about gratitude and helping a friend, but that might not outweigh the girlfriend's feelings. \n\nProm is a big event for high school students, and having a third person might make the girlfriend feel excluded. The author's friend is important, but the girlfriend is the romantic partner. The author might need to consider the girlfriend's feelings more here. Maybe there's a middle ground, like inviting the friend to another event, but the request as it is could be seen as dismissive of the girlfriend's needs. \n\nSo, I think the answer is A (the author is in the wrong) because prioritizing a friend's inclusion over the girlfriend's desire for a romantic night might be considered inconsiderate. Even though the author has good intentions, the girlfriend's feelings are a key part of the relationship.\n"
