With prom coming up soon, we sat down to talk about our plans. Well, at work the other day, the subject of prom came up at work too. I started to talk to my friend (20 F) about it. It turns out that she never got to go to her prom because she was in the hospital. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWell, this friend is pretty important to me. When I started my job almost a year and a half ago, I lacked almost any social skills. This friend was the first person to really talk to me and treat me like a friend. She helped me through one of the most trying times of my life, as I also had severe social anxiety prior to starting this job. While my friend probably doesn't know this, my progress to having the social skills I do now is largely in part to her. I see this as an opportunity to give back to her for helping me.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy girlfriend is opposed to me wanting to take her with us because she says that this should be our special night, and she wants me to herself. I hold the position that I want to take her due to the aforementioned reasons. So what do you guys think? AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the question is in the wrong for wanting to bring another girl to prom with his girlfriend. The situation is that the author, a 17-year-old guy, has been dating his girlfriend for almost a year. He wants to bring his female friend, who's important to him, to prom with them. His girlfriend is against it because she wants the night to be special just for the two of them.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The author's reasoning is that this friend helped him a lot when he started working, improving his social skills and supporting him during his social anxiety. The friend missed her prom due to hospitalization, so he wants to give back by including her. On the other hand, the girlfriend is upset because she expects a private, romantic night.\n\nI should evaluate both sides. The girlfriend's perspective is about wanting a special, intimate event with her partner. It's common for couples to desire privacy during significant events like prom. The author's argument is based on gratitude and the friend's positive impact on his life. But bringing another person to a date can be seen as potentially undermining the girlfriend's feelings of exclusivity and importance in the relationship.\n\nAnother angle: is the author respecting his girlfriend's feelings? If the girlfriend expressed her desire for the night to be just the two of them, then the author needs to consider that her feelings are valid. Relationships require balancing personal connections with the needs of the partner. While the friend's situation is understandable, the girlfriend's expectation for a romantic evening is also valid.\n\nHowever, the author might not be fully aware of how his actions affect his girlfriend. The key here is communication. Has the author tried to explain his reasons while also acknowledging her feelings? If he's only focused on his own perspective without considering hers, then he might be in the wrong. But if he's made an effort to discuss it and there's still a conflict, it's a matter of compromise.\n\nAlso, bringing another person to a date can sometimes be seen as a breach of trust or respect, depending on how it's presented. The girlfriend might feel that her partner is prioritizing someone else's needs over their relationship's needs. Even if the author's intention is good, the impact on the relationship is significant.\n\nIn some cases, friends can accompany couples to events, but it's important that both partners are on board. Since the girlfriend is opposed, the author needs to prioritize her feelings here. The fact that the friend is important to him doesn't negate the girlfriend's right to have her wishes respected.\n\nSo, considering all this, the author might be in the wrong because he's not respecting his girlfriend's valid feelings about the prom being a special, intimate event. While his intentions are good towards his friend, the relationship's dynamics take precedence in this context.\n"
