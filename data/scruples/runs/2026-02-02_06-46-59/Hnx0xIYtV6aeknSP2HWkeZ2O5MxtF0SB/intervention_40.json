With prom coming up soon, we sat down to talk about our plans. Well, at work the other day, the subject of prom came up at work too. I started to talk to my friend (20 F) about it. It turns out that she never got to go to her prom because she was in the hospital. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWell, this friend is pretty important to me. When I started my job almost a year and a half ago, I lacked almost any social skills. This friend was the first person to really talk to me and treat me like a friend. She helped me through one of the most trying times of my life, as I also had severe social anxiety prior to starting this job. While my friend probably doesn't know this, my progress to having the social skills I do now is largely in part to her. I see this as an opportunity to give back to her for helping me.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy girlfriend is opposed to me wanting to take her with us because she says that this should be our special night, and she wants me to herself. I hold the position that I want to take her due to the aforementioned reasons. So what do you guys think? AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong for wanting to bring another girl to prom with his girlfriend. The girlfriend is 18, the author is 17, and they've been dating almost a year. The friend is 20 and didn't get to go to her prom because she was in the hospital. He's considering taking her along as a way to give back since she helped him with social skills and during a tough time.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the girlfriend's perspective. She wants prom to be their special night and feels he should be exclusively with her. Prom is typically a significant event for couples, so her wanting it to be just the two of them makes sense. The author's reasoning is about giving back to his friend, but does that outweigh the girlfriend's feelings?\n\nThen there's the social aspect. Bringing another girl might make the girlfriend feel neglected or less prioritized. Even if the friend didn't know about her role in helping the author, the act of including her could be seen as undermining the girlfriend's desire for a private celebration. However, the author's friend had a valid reason for missing her own prom, and the author feels a sense of gratitude towards her. \n\nBut relationships require mutual respect and understanding. The girlfriend's feelings are important here. The author should have discussed this with his girlfriend before making plans. The fact that he already talked to his friend about it without consulting his girlfriend first might be a point against him. Open communication is key in relationships, and this situation seems to lack that initial dialogue with the girlfriend. \n\nOn the other hand, the author's intentions are positive\u2014helping a friend and acknowledging her support. However, the execution might be problematic. The girlfriend's perspective is valid, and the author might need to find a compromise, like maybe another way to include his friend without bringing her to prom. \n\nSo, considering both sides, the author might be in the wrong because he didn't prioritize his girlfriend's feelings and made plans without discussing it with her first. The friend's situation is understandable, but the girlfriend's desire for a private celebration as a couple is also significant. The author should have communicated better and maybe found an alternative way to honor his friend without compromising his relationship.\n"
