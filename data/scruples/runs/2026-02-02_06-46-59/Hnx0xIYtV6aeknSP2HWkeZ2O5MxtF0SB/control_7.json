With prom coming up soon, we sat down to talk about our plans. Well, at work the other day, the subject of prom came up at work too. I started to talk to my friend (20 F) about it. It turns out that she never got to go to her prom because she was in the hospital. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWell, this friend is pretty important to me. When I started my job almost a year and a half ago, I lacked almost any social skills. This friend was the first person to really talk to me and treat me like a friend. She helped me through one of the most trying times of my life, as I also had severe social anxiety prior to starting this job. While my friend probably doesn't know this, my progress to having the social skills I do now is largely in part to her. I see this as an opportunity to give back to her for helping me.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy girlfriend is opposed to me wanting to take her with us because she says that this should be our special night, and she wants me to herself. I hold the position that I want to take her due to the aforementioned reasons. So what do you guys think? AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for wanting to bring another girl to prom with his girlfriend. The situation is that he and his girlfriend are planning to go to prom together, but he wants to include a female friend who missed her prom due to hospitalization. The friend helped him with social skills and supported him during a tough time. The girlfriend is upset because she wants the night to be special just for the two of them.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics between the couple. The girlfriend is 18, and the author is 17. They've been dating almost a year, so they're relatively new to being in a committed relationship. The girlfriend's concern is valid from her perspective; she might feel that prom is a significant milestone and wants it to be focused on their relationship. It's a common tradition to attend prom with a partner, so her expectation is understandable.\n\nThen there's the author's reasoning. He wants to include his friend because she missed her prom and she helped him a lot. He sees this as a way to give back. But bringing another person might be seen as excluding the girlfriend, especially if the friend is female. The girlfriend might feel that including another girl in their prom plans undermines the exclusivity and intimacy they expect from such an event.\n\nThe key points here are consent and communication. The author discussed prom plans with his girlfriend initially, but when he decided to include his friend, he didn't get her consent. This could be a breach of trust because he made that decision without considering her feelings first. Even though his intentions are good, the way he's handling it could be problematic. Prom is typically a couple's event, so bringing another person might not align with the girlfriend's expectations for the night. \n\nAlso, the girlfriend's feelings are important. If she feels that her partner is prioritizing a friend over their relationship, it could lead to hurt feelings or resentment. The author should have had a conversation with his girlfriend before making plans to include someone else. The fact that he talked about prom with his friend at work suggests that he didn't keep the initial discussion with his girlfriend as the primary focus. \n\nAnother angle is cultural or social norms. In many places, prom is a time for couples to celebrate together. Including a third person, especially a female friend, might be seen as inappropriate or disrespectful to the girlfriend. The girlfriend's reaction that she wants the night to be special for the two of them is a valid concern. \n\nOn the other hand, the author's intentions are noble. His friend helped him significantly, and he wants to do something nice for her. However, the way he's approaching it might not consider the girlfriend's emotional needs. The author needs to balance his gratitude towards his friend with consideration for his girlfriend's feelings. \n\nIn conclusion, while the author's motives are good, the action of wanting to bring another girl without his girlfriend's consent and without considering the tradition and expectations of prom might put him in the wrong. The girlfriend's feelings about the exclusivity of the event are valid, and the author should have addressed this by having a more open and honest conversation with her before making plans.\n"
