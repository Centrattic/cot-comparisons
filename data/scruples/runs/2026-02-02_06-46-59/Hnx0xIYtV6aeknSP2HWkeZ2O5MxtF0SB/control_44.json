With prom coming up soon, we sat down to talk about our plans. Well, at work the other day, the subject of prom came up at work too. I started to talk to my friend (20 F) about it. It turns out that she never got to go to her prom because she was in the hospital. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWell, this friend is pretty important to me. When I started my job almost a year and a half ago, I lacked almost any social skills. This friend was the first person to really talk to me and treat me like a friend. She helped me through one of the most trying times of my life, as I also had severe social anxiety prior to starting this job. While my friend probably doesn't know this, my progress to having the social skills I do now is largely in part to her. I see this as an opportunity to give back to her for helping me.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy girlfriend is opposed to me wanting to take her with us because she says that this should be our special night, and she wants me to herself. I hold the position that I want to take her due to the aforementioned reasons. So what do you guys think? AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong for wanting to bring another girl to prom with his girlfriend.\n\nFirst, the boyfriend and girlfriend have been dating almost a year. The guy wants to take his close friend who missed prom because she was in the hospital. He values her friendship a lot because she helped him when he was struggling with social anxiety. The girlfriend is upset because she wants prom to be their special night alone.\n\nSo, the key points here are the relationship dynamics and the expectations around prom. Prom is typically seen as a couples' event, so bringing another person might be considered unusual. The girlfriend might feel that the guy is prioritizing his friendship over their relationship, which could hurt her feelings. On the other hand, the guy has valid reasons about wanting to repay his friend's support and maybe he doesn't see it as a big deal. \n\nBut, in a relationship, communication is key. If the girlfriend is clear that she wants prom to be their special night, the guy should consider her feelings. Maybe he's not wrong in wanting to include his friend, but he needs to balance that with his partner's needs. However, the girlfriend's perspective is about the exclusivity of the event they've been planning as a couple. \n\nIs it about the action itself or the intention? The guy's intention is to thank his friend, but the action might be perceived as dismissive of the girlfriend's feelings. The girlfriend's reaction is valid because she expects to have that time with her partner. The guy might not be in the wrong, but he definitely needs to address the conflict better. \n\nBut the question is whether he's in the wrong. If the girlfriend is hurt and he's ignoring her feelings, then he might be. But if he's trying to be considerate and there's mutual understanding, maybe not. The scenario doesn't mention if they resolved it or if he went ahead. But based on the setup, the girlfriend is opposed, and the guy is sticking to his reasons. So, the answer might depend on relationship norms. In a committed relationship, respecting the partner's wishes is important, so maybe the guy is in the wrong by not prioritizing her feelings. But others might argue it's about his friend's needs. \n\nHmm. The options are A or B. I think in this context, the majority would side with the girlfriend because prom is a significant event, and bringing another person without her consent might be seen as a breach of trust or consideration. So the author might be in the wrong. Answer A.\n"
