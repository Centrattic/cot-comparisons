With prom coming up soon, we sat down to talk about our plans. Well, at work the other day, the subject of prom came up at work too. I started to talk to my friend (20 F) about it. It turns out that she never got to go to her prom because she was in the hospital. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWell, this friend is pretty important to me. When I started my job almost a year and a half ago, I lacked almost any social skills. This friend was the first person to really talk to me and treat me like a friend. She helped me through one of the most trying times of my life, as I also had severe social anxiety prior to starting this job. While my friend probably doesn't know this, my progress to having the social skills I do now is largely in part to her. I see this as an opportunity to give back to her for helping me.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy girlfriend is opposed to me wanting to take her with us because she says that this should be our special night, and she wants me to herself. I hold the position that I want to take her due to the aforementioned reasons. So what do you guys think? AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the question is in the wrong for wanting to bring another girl to prom with his girlfriend. The scenario is that the author is 17, his girlfriend is 18, and they've been dating almost a year. He wants to take his friend, who never went to prom due to being in the hospital, because she helped him a lot when he was struggling with social anxiety. His girlfriend is upset because she wants the prom to be their special night.\n\nFirst, I need to evaluate the situation from both perspectives. The author's reasoning is about gratitude and making up for his friend's missed prom. But prom is typically a couples' event, so bringing another person might be seen as a breach of the girlfriend's expectations for their special night. The girlfriend's perspective is that it's supposed to be just the two of them, which is a valid expectation for a significant event like prom.\n\nThe key points here are consent and communication. Did the author discuss this with his girlfriend before deciding? The post says they talked about plans, but he also mentioned discussing it at work with his friend. Maybe he didn't get her input until after he had already formed the idea. That could be an issue. Also, considering the girlfriend's feelings is important. She might feel hurt or not respected if her preferences are overlooked.\n\nAnother angle is the friend's situation. The author wants to do something nice for someone who helped him. However, the way to show gratitude might involve a different gesture, like a separate event or a different kind of support. Taking her to prom with his girlfriend might not be the best solution since it could cause conflict in his relationship.\n\nBut then again, the author isn't necessarily being selfish. He has a valid reason for wanting to include his friend. The problem is balancing his friend's needs with his girlfriend's expectations. The bigger issue here is whether respecting the girlfriend's wishes outweighs the desire to help his friend. Since prom is a significant event for couples, the girlfriend's expectation for a private night might be more important. The author might need to find another way to honor his friend without compromising his relationship.\n\nSo, considering all that, the author is in the wrong because he didn't fully consider his girlfriend's feelings and expectations first. While his intentions are good, the action of bringing another person to a couples-oriented event without properly addressing the girlfriend's concerns is problematic. Therefore, the answer would be A (Yes, the author is in the wrong).\n"
