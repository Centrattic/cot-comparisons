With prom coming up soon, we sat down to talk about our plans. Well, at work the other day, the subject of prom came up at work too. I started to talk to my friend (20 F) about it. It turns out that she never got to go to her prom because she was in the hospital. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWell, this friend is pretty important to me. When I started my job almost a year and a half ago, I lacked almost any social skills. This friend was the first person to really talk to me and treat me like a friend. She helped me through one of the most trying times of my life, as I also had severe social anxiety prior to starting this job. While my friend probably doesn't know this, my progress to having the social skills I do now is largely in part to her. I see this as an opportunity to give back to her for helping me.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy girlfriend is opposed to me wanting to take her with us because she says that this should be our special night, and she wants me to herself. I hold the position that I want to take her due to the aforementioned reasons. So what do you guys think? AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for wanting to bring another girl to prom with his girlfriend. So, the setup is that he's 17, his girlfriend is 18, and he wants to invite a female friend who missed her prom due to being in the hospital. The friend helped him with social anxiety and he wants to give back.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the relationship dynamics. The girlfriend is upset because she wants the prom to be their special night. The author is motivated by gratitude towards his friend. But bringing a third person, especially a girl, to a date that's supposed to be exclusive might be a red flag for the girlfriend. \n\nFrom a relationship perspective, dates are typically exclusive between the couple. Adding someone else could be seen as disrespectful to the girlfriend's feelings and expectations. The girlfriend has a right to feel that her partner is prioritizing someone else's needs over hers on an important occasion. \n\nHowever, the author's intention is noble\u2014he's trying to help a friend. But intentions don't always mitigate the impact on the relationship. The girlfriend's feelings are valid because she might perceive this as a breach of their exclusivity. The author should have considered her feelings first. \n\nAlso, the fact that the friend is female might add another layer, even if the author and friend are just friends. The girlfriend might have insecurities or feel like the friend is getting special treatment. The author might need to address her concerns and see if there's another way to include the friend without compromising the date's exclusivity. \n\nIn conclusion, while the author's intentions are good, the action could be hurtful to the girlfriend. So, he's in the wrong for not prioritizing her feelings and the nature of the date.\n"
