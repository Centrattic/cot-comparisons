With prom coming up soon, we sat down to talk about our plans. Well, at work the other day, the subject of prom came up at work too. I started to talk to my friend (20 F) about it. It turns out that she never got to go to her prom because she was in the hospital. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWell, this friend is pretty important to me. When I started my job almost a year and a half ago, I lacked almost any social skills. This friend was the first person to really talk to me and treat me like a friend. She helped me through one of the most trying times of my life, as I also had severe social anxiety prior to starting this job. While my friend probably doesn't know this, my progress to having the social skills I do now is largely in part to her. I see this as an opportunity to give back to her for helping me.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy girlfriend is opposed to me wanting to take her with us because she says that this should be our special night, and she wants me to herself. I hold the position that I want to take her due to the aforementioned reasons. So what do you guys think? AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for wanting to bring his friend to prom with his girlfriend. \n\nFirst, the situation: The author is a 17-year-old guy with an 18-year-old girlfriend. They've been dating almost a year. Prom is coming up, and the author wants to bring a female friend who never went to her prom. The friend is significant because she helped him with social anxiety when he started a job. The girlfriend is upset because she wants the prom night to be just the two of them.\n\nNow, considering the relationships. The girlfriend is the romantic partner, and the friend is someone who helped the author. The author feels he's giving back by including the friend. But the girlfriend feels it's their special time.\n\nI need to think about typical expectations around prom. Usually, prom is a romantic event, so bringing another person might be seen as violating that expectation. The girlfriend's perspective is valid because she might see the prom as a dedicated time for the two of them. The author's reasoning is noble\u2014he's trying to repay a friend who helped him\u2014but might not realize how his girlfriend is feeling. \n\nAlso, communication is key here. Did the author discuss this with his girlfriend before making plans? The post mentions they had a discussion about their plans, but maybe he didn't fully consider her feelings when suggesting bringing the friend. The friend's situation is unfortunate, but the girlfriend's desire for a private night is also important. Balancing both needs could be an issue. \n\nIs the author in the wrong? Well, by wanting to include the friend, he might be prioritizing a platonic relationship over his romantic partner's wishes for a special night. Even if his intentions are good, he's not respecting his girlfriend's feelings about the event. So, maybe he's in the wrong because he's not considering her perspective enough. \n\nAlternatively, if the friend's situation is genuine and the author is trying to do something kind, maybe there's a way to compromise. But the question is whether the author is in the wrong. From the girlfriend's point of view, yes, because she's the romantic partner and the event is traditionally for couples. The author might not have considered how his request would affect her. So, the answer would be A.\n"
