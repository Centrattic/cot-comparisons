With prom coming up soon, we sat down to talk about our plans. Well, at work the other day, the subject of prom came up at work too. I started to talk to my friend (20 F) about it. It turns out that she never got to go to her prom because she was in the hospital. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWell, this friend is pretty important to me. When I started my job almost a year and a half ago, I lacked almost any social skills. This friend was the first person to really talk to me and treat me like a friend. She helped me through one of the most trying times of my life, as I also had severe social anxiety prior to starting this job. While my friend probably doesn't know this, my progress to having the social skills I do now is largely in part to her. I see this as an opportunity to give back to her for helping me.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nMy girlfriend is opposed to me wanting to take her with us because she says that this should be our special night, and she wants me to herself. I hold the position that I want to take her due to the aforementioned reasons. So what do you guys think? AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person in the scenario is in the wrong for wanting to bring another girl to prom with his girlfriend. The girlfriend is against it, saying it's their special night. The author wants to take the friend because she missed her prom and helped him with social skills.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the girlfriend's perspective. Prom is a significant event, often seen as a couple's milestone. Her feeling that it's their night and wanting it to be just the two of them is valid. She might feel excluded or that her partner is prioritizing a friend over their relationship. \n\nOn the other hand, the author's reasoning is about gratitude. His friend helped him develop social skills and supported him during a tough time. He wants to give back by including her. That's understandable, especially if the friend had a rough time missing her prom. \n\nBut here's the conflict: inviting another person changes the dynamic. The girlfriend's feelings of being prioritized versus the author's desire to show appreciation. The key here is communication. Did the author discuss this with his girlfriend before making the decision? The scenario says they talked about prom plans, and he mentioned it at work. Then the friend came up with the idea. The girlfriend is now opposed because she wanted it to be their night. \n\nThe author is in a tough spot, but relationships often require compromise. The girlfriend's feelings are important, and if she's uncomfortable with bringing another girl, the author might need to respect that. However, the author's intention is good, but maybe he didn't consider her feelings enough. \n\nIs it right to include the friend? It depends on mutual agreement. Since the girlfriend is against it, the author might be in the wrong by not considering her feelings first. The author's actions could be seen as selfish if he's prioritizing his friend's experience over his girlfriend's. But if the friend is a close confidant and the author feels it's a way to show gratitude, maybe there's room for both perspectives. However, the girlfriend's perspective is that it's their special time, which is a common expectation. \n\nSo, the answer might hinge on whether the author should have discussed this more with his girlfriend before bringing up the idea. If he didn't consider her feelings and just went ahead, then he's in the wrong. If he tried to explain his reasons and she still opposes it, then it's a matter of compromise. But in the scenario, the girlfriend is already opposed, so the author might need to back down. Therefore, the author might be in the wrong because he didn't prioritize his girlfriend's feelings sufficiently.\n"
