Recently though she and I got into an argument about this, and now I\u2019m just not sure if I did the right thing. \n\nI was knackered after a night out so I do what I usually do after a night out. Lay in my bed and scroll through reddit till i realise I should sleep. So I\u2019m scrolling and I\u2019m not sure if this is just me, but when I see a porn post or an NSFW post in general I click it. So I just see a gonewild post and think \u201coh cool\u201d and click on it. Still reeling from \u00a31 night at the club I didn\u2019t immediately notice it was my girlfriend, but something was familiar about the post. The bed looked familiar, so did the overall room, but then I saw her body realised \u201cwait that\u2019s my girlfriend\u201d. I was mostly in shock and just started looking through her history and what I saw confirmed that it was 100% her.  Just filled with a mixed ball of emotion I decided I should sleep, but I couldn\u2019t. \n\nSo I waited till the morning my mind going mad. Eventually I texted her confronting her about it. I got a bit aggy saying how I felt like she was cheating on me and she was saying to me that since it was the internet it wasn\u2019t cheating. In all honesty I said some nasty things and I could tell she wasn\u2019t having a good time either. Said to her that I would like her to stop posting, and if she doesn\u2019t then I didn\u2019t really want to continue things with her. She started saying loads of stuff even suggesting I join her for couple posts? In the end I realised she didn\u2019t want to stop so I ended things then and there. Haven\u2019t messaged her since and my mates are aggy at me asking what was going on. I\u2019m not going to expose her, but this is a bit much for me right now. \n\nAITA\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the person who broke up with his girlfriend for posting on GoneWild is in the wrong. So, the situation is that the guy found out his girlfriend was posting explicit content online, which he considered cheating even though she said it wasn't. He got upset, confronted her, and they had a big argument leading to a breakup.\n\nFirst, I need to consider their relationship dynamics. They had been going strong before this issue. The guy found her posts on Reddit/Gonewild, which he clicked on not realizing it was her. Then he confronted her, and she didn't think it was cheating. She even suggested he join her for posts. He felt betrayed and ended things because she didn't want to stop. \n\nFrom the guy's perspective, seeing explicit content of his partner in a public forum might make him feel like she's sharing something private without his consent. Even if it's online, he might view it as a breach of trust. But she argues that since it's online, it's not cheating. That's a key point. \n\nNow, whether he's in the wrong depends on their agreed-upon boundaries. If they had an open discussion about what constitutes cheating, and she didn't cross that line, maybe he overreacted. But if there was an unspoken understanding that she wouldn't post explicit content, then she might have broken trust. \n\nHe did confront her, which is reasonable, but his reaction was to end the relationship when she didn't agree to stop. That might be too drastic. However, if this was a deal-breaker for him, then leaving because of her actions isn't necessarily wrong. \n\nOn the other hand, she wanted to continue posting and even invited him to participate, which he might find uncomfortable. He might have the right to end the relationship if he can't accept her choices. \n\nBut was breaking up the right move? If he was in a fit of anger or not giving her a chance to explain, maybe. But from his description, he was conflicted and waited until morning to confront her. He also felt she wasn't taking his feelings seriously. \n\nIn terms of cheating definitions, some people consider online sharing as cheating, others don't. It's subjective. So if they didn't have clear boundaries, both might have different expectations. \n\nHe might not be in the wrong if he felt the trust was broken. However, ending the relationship immediately after a conflict could indicate he didn't try to resolve it. But if he felt it was a deal-breaker, then it's his choice. \n\nSo the answer could be B (No, he's not in the wrong) because he's acting based on his feelings of betrayal, even if others might see it differently. But some might argue he could have handled it better. However, the question is whether he's in the wrong, not whether he handled it well. Since the core issue is her posting explicit content, which he found unacceptable, his reaction might be justifiable.\n"
