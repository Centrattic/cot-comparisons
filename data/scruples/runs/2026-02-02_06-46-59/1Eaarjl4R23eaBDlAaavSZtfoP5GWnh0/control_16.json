Recently though she and I got into an argument about this, and now I\u2019m just not sure if I did the right thing. \n\nI was knackered after a night out so I do what I usually do after a night out. Lay in my bed and scroll through reddit till i realise I should sleep. So I\u2019m scrolling and I\u2019m not sure if this is just me, but when I see a porn post or an NSFW post in general I click it. So I just see a gonewild post and think \u201coh cool\u201d and click on it. Still reeling from \u00a31 night at the club I didn\u2019t immediately notice it was my girlfriend, but something was familiar about the post. The bed looked familiar, so did the overall room, but then I saw her body realised \u201cwait that\u2019s my girlfriend\u201d. I was mostly in shock and just started looking through her history and what I saw confirmed that it was 100% her.  Just filled with a mixed ball of emotion I decided I should sleep, but I couldn\u2019t. \n\nSo I waited till the morning my mind going mad. Eventually I texted her confronting her about it. I got a bit aggy saying how I felt like she was cheating on me and she was saying to me that since it was the internet it wasn\u2019t cheating. In all honesty I said some nasty things and I could tell she wasn\u2019t having a good time either. Said to her that I would like her to stop posting, and if she doesn\u2019t then I didn\u2019t really want to continue things with her. She started saying loads of stuff even suggesting I join her for couple posts? In the end I realised she didn\u2019t want to stop so I ended things then and there. Haven\u2019t messaged her since and my mates are aggy at me asking what was going on. I\u2019m not going to expose her, but this is a bit much for me right now. \n\nAITA\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is that the guy broke up with his girlfriend because he found out she was posting on a site called gonewild. He went on Reddit, clicked a post, realized it was his girlfriend, and then confronted her. She said that since it was the internet, it's not cheating. He felt like she was being disrespectful and ended things.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The guy's perspective: he was upset because he found out his girlfriend was sharing explicit content online. He felt like it was a betrayal, even if she didn't consider it cheating. Maybe he felt uncomfortable with her sharing such personal stuff, especially without his knowledge. He might have felt that it was a breach of trust, even if there wasn't an actual affair. The fact that she suggested he join her for couple posts probably made it worse for him. He decided to break up because she didn't want to stop, which he found unacceptable.\n\nThen there's the girlfriend's side. She might have believed that sharing content on the internet wasn't cheating. Maybe she didn't think it was a big deal and saw it as her personal choice. She could have felt that the guy was overreacting. Also, she suggested he join her, which might have been an attempt to include him or to explain her actions, but he took it as a bad sign.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. Legally or morally? Well, in terms of their relationship, it's more about their mutual expectations. Cheating is usually defined as an extramarital affair, but sharing explicit content online might not fall into that category. However, there's consent and privacy involved. If the guy didn't know she was doing it, then she didn't get his consent. That could be a breach of privacy. On the other hand, if they were in an open relationship, maybe it's different. But the problem is that they had an argument about it, and he felt hurt.\n\nThe guy broke up because he couldn't handle it, and she didn't want to stop. Is that justified? It's a personal decision. If their relationship requires mutual trust and respect, and he can't trust her to not share explicit content, then maybe breaking up is his way of protecting his own boundaries. But if she didn't see it as cheating, maybe he's being too strict. However, the fact that she didn't stop after he was upset might show that she didn't respect his feelings.\n\nAnother angle: the guy found out through her posts. If she was sharing content without his knowledge, that's a violation of trust. Even if it's online, sharing explicit material about oneself without the partner's knowledge can be a big deal. The guy's reaction might be justified if he felt it was a breach of their relationship's norms.\n\nIn terms of right or wrong, it's not a clear legal matter but a moral or relational one. The question is whether the author's actions (breaking up) were wrong. If the girlfriend didn't think it was cheating, but the guy did, and he chose to end things, is that his right? Yes, because relationships are based on mutual respect and boundaries. If her actions violated his boundaries, then he's within his right to end the relationship. Therefore, the author isn't in the wrong. But maybe he could have handled it differently, like talking more calmly instead of getting aggressive. But the decision to break up because of incompatible values (she wants to post, he doesn't want her to) is his choice. So the answer would be B (No, he's not in the wrong).\n"
