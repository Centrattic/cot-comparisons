Recently though she and I got into an argument about this, and now I\u2019m just not sure if I did the right thing. \n\nI was knackered after a night out so I do what I usually do after a night out. Lay in my bed and scroll through reddit till i realise I should sleep. So I\u2019m scrolling and I\u2019m not sure if this is just me, but when I see a porn post or an NSFW post in general I click it. So I just see a gonewild post and think \u201coh cool\u201d and click on it. Still reeling from \u00a31 night at the club I didn\u2019t immediately notice it was my girlfriend, but something was familiar about the post. The bed looked familiar, so did the overall room, but then I saw her body realised \u201cwait that\u2019s my girlfriend\u201d. I was mostly in shock and just started looking through her history and what I saw confirmed that it was 100% her.  Just filled with a mixed ball of emotion I decided I should sleep, but I couldn\u2019t. \n\nSo I waited till the morning my mind going mad. Eventually I texted her confronting her about it. I got a bit aggy saying how I felt like she was cheating on me and she was saying to me that since it was the internet it wasn\u2019t cheating. In all honesty I said some nasty things and I could tell she wasn\u2019t having a good time either. Said to her that I would like her to stop posting, and if she doesn\u2019t then I didn\u2019t really want to continue things with her. She started saying loads of stuff even suggesting I join her for couple posts? In the end I realised she didn\u2019t want to stop so I ended things then and there. Haven\u2019t messaged her since and my mates are aggy at me asking what was going on. I\u2019m not going to expose her, but this is a bit much for me right now. \n\nAITA\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA post is in the wrong for breaking up with his girlfriend after finding her posts on gonewild. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The girlfriend was posting explicit content online, and the boyfriend discovered it. He felt it was equivalent to cheating because it's on the internet. The key points here are the definition of cheating, the context of the posts, and the boyfriend's reaction.\n\nCheating typically involves physical or emotional infidelity. However, some people might consider sharing explicit content online as a form of cheating, especially if it's done without the partner's knowledge. The girlfriend argues that because it's online, it's not cheating. The boyfriend, on the other hand, felt betrayed and decided to end the relationship after she didn't want to stop the behavior.\n\nNext, I should consider consent and communication. Did the girlfriend know that posting such content would be an issue for her partner? If they hadn't discussed boundaries beforehand, it's possible that both parties had different expectations. However, once the issue was brought up, the girlfriend suggested involving the boyfriend in such posts, which might have exacerbated the situation.\n\nThe boyfriend's decision to end the relationship is based on his personal boundaries. If someone's actions violate another's trust, it's reasonable for the affected partner to leave. The question is whether his reaction was justified. Since cheating can be subjective in relationships, and given that the girlfriend was continuing the behavior despite his discomfort, the breakup might be seen as a valid response to a breach of trust, even if it's not traditional cheating.\n\nHowever, there's also the aspect of how he confronted her. He admitted to saying some nasty things, which might indicate that the breakup wasn't entirely his fault but perhaps the way he handled it could be questioned. Yet, the core issue is the content she posted and his reaction to it.\n\nIn summary, whether he's in the wrong depends on societal views on digital infidelity. If the community or the individuals involved consider online behavior as part of fidelity, then he's justified. Otherwise, if it's not seen as cheating, he might be at fault. But in many modern contexts, sharing explicit content without consent is considered a breach of trust. Therefore, the author isn't in the wrong for ending the relationship when his boundaries were violated.\n"
