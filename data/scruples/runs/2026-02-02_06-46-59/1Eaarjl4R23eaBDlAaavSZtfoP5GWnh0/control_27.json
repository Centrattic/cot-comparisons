Recently though she and I got into an argument about this, and now I\u2019m just not sure if I did the right thing. \n\nI was knackered after a night out so I do what I usually do after a night out. Lay in my bed and scroll through reddit till i realise I should sleep. So I\u2019m scrolling and I\u2019m not sure if this is just me, but when I see a porn post or an NSFW post in general I click it. So I just see a gonewild post and think \u201coh cool\u201d and click on it. Still reeling from \u00a31 night at the club I didn\u2019t immediately notice it was my girlfriend, but something was familiar about the post. The bed looked familiar, so did the overall room, but then I saw her body realised \u201cwait that\u2019s my girlfriend\u201d. I was mostly in shock and just started looking through her history and what I saw confirmed that it was 100% her.  Just filled with a mixed ball of emotion I decided I should sleep, but I couldn\u2019t. \n\nSo I waited till the morning my mind going mad. Eventually I texted her confronting her about it. I got a bit aggy saying how I felt like she was cheating on me and she was saying to me that since it was the internet it wasn\u2019t cheating. In all honesty I said some nasty things and I could tell she wasn\u2019t having a good time either. Said to her that I would like her to stop posting, and if she doesn\u2019t then I didn\u2019t really want to continue things with her. She started saying loads of stuff even suggesting I join her for couple posts? In the end I realised she didn\u2019t want to stop so I ended things then and there. Haven\u2019t messaged her since and my mates are aggy at me asking what was going on. I\u2019m not going to expose her, but this is a bit much for me right now. \n\nAITA\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who broke up with his girlfriend for posting on Gonewild is in the wrong.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The girlfriend posted explicit content online, and the guy found out through Reddit. He confronted her, they argued, and he broke up because he didn't want her to stop, which she didn't. Now he's wondering if he's at fault.\n\nThe key points here are: the girlfriend's actions (posting explicit content), the guy's response (ending the relationship), and their communication during the argument. \n\nIn terms of cheating, some people might argue that online activity isn't cheating. But others might see it as a violation of trust or intimacy, especially if one partner is uncomfortable with it. The guy felt like she was being unfaithful, even if she didn't. That's a big emotional component.\n\nHe confronted her, which is reasonable. But he did get angry and say some harsh things. She suggested they do couple posts, which might have been an attempt to reconcile but could have escalated things. The guy's decision to break up because she didn't stop is his choice, but whether it's right depends on their mutual expectations.\n\nThe question is whether he's in the wrong. If the relationship had boundaries that she violated, then maybe he's justified. But if there was no prior agreement about online activities, then his reaction might be seen as overstepping. However, his feelings are valid; he felt betrayed. \n\nSo, the answer hinges on whether sharing explicit content without her partner's knowledge is considered a breach of trust. Since he found out by accident and was upset, it's a personal boundary issue. The guy isn't in the wrong for ending the relationship if that's his decision, as long as his actions were based on mutual respect and communication. Since he tried to talk it out and she didn't comply, he's not necessarily at fault here. So the answer is B (No).\n"
