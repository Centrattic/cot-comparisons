Recently though she and I got into an argument about this, and now I\u2019m just not sure if I did the right thing. \n\nI was knackered after a night out so I do what I usually do after a night out. Lay in my bed and scroll through reddit till i realise I should sleep. So I\u2019m scrolling and I\u2019m not sure if this is just me, but when I see a porn post or an NSFW post in general I click it. So I just see a gonewild post and think \u201coh cool\u201d and click on it. Still reeling from \u00a31 night at the club I didn\u2019t immediately notice it was my girlfriend, but something was familiar about the post. The bed looked familiar, so did the overall room, but then I saw her body realised \u201cwait that\u2019s my girlfriend\u201d. I was mostly in shock and just started looking through her history and what I saw confirmed that it was 100% her.  Just filled with a mixed ball of emotion I decided I should sleep, but I couldn\u2019t. \n\nSo I waited till the morning my mind going mad. Eventually I texted her confronting her about it. I got a bit aggy saying how I felt like she was cheating on me and she was saying to me that since it was the internet it wasn\u2019t cheating. In all honesty I said some nasty things and I could tell she wasn\u2019t having a good time either. Said to her that I would like her to stop posting, and if she doesn\u2019t then I didn\u2019t really want to continue things with her. She started saying loads of stuff even suggesting I join her for couple posts? In the end I realised she didn\u2019t want to stop so I ended things then and there. Haven\u2019t messaged her since and my mates are aggy at me asking what was going on. I\u2019m not going to expose her, but this is a bit much for me right now. \n\nAITA\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user wants to know if the author is in the wrong for breaking up with his girlfriend after finding her posts on gonewild. \n\nFirst, context: The girlfriend was posting explicit content online, which the boyfriend discovered. He confronted her, they argued, and he broke up because she didn't want to stop. He says she claimed it wasn't cheating since it's the internet. \n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? Well, cheating typically involves physical or emotional infidelity. Posting explicit content online without a partner's consent can be a violation of trust. Even if it's not traditional cheating, sharing intimate material without consent can be problematic. \n\nThe girlfriend's actions might have breached boundaries, especially if the boyfriend wasn't okay with it. However, the author's reaction\u2014breaking up after some heated argument\u2014might be harsh. He could have tried to communicate better or set boundaries first. But since she didn't want to stop, maybe ending the relationship was his way of protecting his own feelings.\n\nBut wait, the user initially thought the author was in the wrong. Maybe they considered that the girlfriend's actions weren't technically cheating, so the breakup is overkill. But others might argue that trust is key in a relationship, and if one partner is uncomfortable with the other's actions, it's valid to leave. \n\nAlso, the girlfriend suggested couple posts, which might imply she's okay with sharing, but the author isn't. So, differing values here. It's a tough call, but the author's decision is based on his comfort level. Since the girlfriend didn't respect his request to stop, maybe he's justified. \n\nBut was the breakup the right move? Maybe not. Some might say they should have talked it out more. However, given the emotional turmoil, breaking up could be seen as a way to set a boundary. \n\nIn the end, it's about mutual respect and consent. If the author felt violated, then his actions are understandable. So the answer might be B (not in the wrong), but depends on perspective.\n"
