Recently though she and I got into an argument about this, and now I\u2019m just not sure if I did the right thing. \n\nI was knackered after a night out so I do what I usually do after a night out. Lay in my bed and scroll through reddit till i realise I should sleep. So I\u2019m scrolling and I\u2019m not sure if this is just me, but when I see a porn post or an NSFW post in general I click it. So I just see a gonewild post and think \u201coh cool\u201d and click on it. Still reeling from \u00a31 night at the club I didn\u2019t immediately notice it was my girlfriend, but something was familiar about the post. The bed looked familiar, so did the overall room, but then I saw her body realised \u201cwait that\u2019s my girlfriend\u201d. I was mostly in shock and just started looking through her history and what I saw confirmed that it was 100% her.  Just filled with a mixed ball of emotion I decided I should sleep, but I couldn\u2019t. \n\nSo I waited till the morning my mind going mad. Eventually I texted her confronting her about it. I got a bit aggy saying how I felt like she was cheating on me and she was saying to me that since it was the internet it wasn\u2019t cheating. In all honesty I said some nasty things and I could tell she wasn\u2019t having a good time either. Said to her that I would like her to stop posting, and if she doesn\u2019t then I didn\u2019t really want to continue things with her. She started saying loads of stuff even suggesting I join her for couple posts? In the end I realised she didn\u2019t want to stop so I ended things then and there. Haven\u2019t messaged her since and my mates are aggy at me asking what was going on. I\u2019m not going to expose her, but this is a bit much for me right now. \n\nAITA\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who broke up with their girlfriend for posting on gonewild is in the wrong. So first, I need to understand the situation.\n\nThe guy found out his girlfriend was posting NSFW content of herself on a site called gonewild. He confronted her, they argued, and he broke up because she didn't want to stop. The key points here are about boundaries in a relationship and what constitutes cheating or betrayal.\n\nNow, gonewild is a site where people share explicit content, so posting there is a big deal if you're in a committed relationship. The girlfriend said it's not cheating because it's online, but many people would see sharing explicit photos as a breach of trust, even if there's no physical infidelity. \n\nThe guy felt betrayed and couldn't handle it, leading to the breakup. His friends are upset, but he's not exposing her. The question is whether he's in the wrong. \n\nFrom a relationship ethics perspective, trust and mutual respect are crucial. If one partner does something that the other finds unacceptable, it's their right to end the relationship. However, the guy admitted to saying nasty things during the argument, which could be a point against him. But the main issue is the girlfriend's actions and his reaction. \n\nThe key here is consent and boundaries. If the girlfriend didn't hide her posts and the guy found out later, it's a matter of what both considered acceptable. Since the guy felt it was a dealbreaker and the girlfriend didn't want to stop, the breakup was his way to honor his own boundaries. \n\nSo, the answer would be B (No), because he's not in the wrong for ending the relationship over something that clearly made him uncomfortable and which the girlfriend wasn't willing to change. The girlfriend's actions crossed a line he couldn't accept, and he had the right to leave.\n"
