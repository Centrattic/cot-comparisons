Recently though she and I got into an argument about this, and now I\u2019m just not sure if I did the right thing. \n\nI was knackered after a night out so I do what I usually do after a night out. Lay in my bed and scroll through reddit till i realise I should sleep. So I\u2019m scrolling and I\u2019m not sure if this is just me, but when I see a porn post or an NSFW post in general I click it. So I just see a gonewild post and think \u201coh cool\u201d and click on it. Still reeling from \u00a31 night at the club I didn\u2019t immediately notice it was my girlfriend, but something was familiar about the post. The bed looked familiar, so did the overall room, but then I saw her body realised \u201cwait that\u2019s my girlfriend\u201d. I was mostly in shock and just started looking through her history and what I saw confirmed that it was 100% her.  Just filled with a mixed ball of emotion I decided I should sleep, but I couldn\u2019t. \n\nSo I waited till the morning my mind going mad. Eventually I texted her confronting her about it. I got a bit aggy saying how I felt like she was cheating on me and she was saying to me that since it was the internet it wasn\u2019t cheating. In all honesty I said some nasty things and I could tell she wasn\u2019t having a good time either. Said to her that I would like her to stop posting, and if she doesn\u2019t then I didn\u2019t really want to continue things with her. She started saying loads of stuff even suggesting I join her for couple posts? In the end I realised she didn\u2019t want to stop so I ended things then and there. Haven\u2019t messaged her since and my mates are aggy at me asking what was going on. I\u2019m not going to expose her, but this is a bit much for me right now. \n\nAITA\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking whether the person who broke up with his girlfriend over her posting on gonewild is in the wrong. The scenario is that the guy found her on a site with explicit content, got upset, argued, and ended the relationship. The user initially thinks the author is in the wrong but wants others' opinions.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The girlfriend was on gonewild, which is a site for adult content. The guy found her there and felt like she was cheating, even though she said online isn't cheating. The argument escalated, and he broke up because she didn't want to stop posting. The question is whether he was wrong to break up.\n\nIn relationships, trust and communication are crucial. The guy's reaction might be influenced by his personal boundaries. If he felt uncomfortable with her presence on such sites, then his feelings are valid. However, whether that justifies breaking up depends on context. The girlfriend's perspective is important too; she might see her online activity as harmless. The argument also involved him saying \"nasty things,\" which could indicate poor communication. Ending the relationship immediately might be seen as a reaction rather than resolving the issue. But if the guy felt fundamentally disrespected or betrayed, his decision might be his right. However, maybe there's a middle ground. The user's own thought is that the author is in the wrong, but others might disagree. Need to weigh both sides. So, is the author in the wrong? The answer options are A (yes) or B (no).\n"
