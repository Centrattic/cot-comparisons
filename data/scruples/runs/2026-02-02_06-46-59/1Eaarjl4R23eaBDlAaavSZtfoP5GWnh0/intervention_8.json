Recently though she and I got into an argument about this, and now I\u2019m just not sure if I did the right thing. \n\nI was knackered after a night out so I do what I usually do after a night out. Lay in my bed and scroll through reddit till i realise I should sleep. So I\u2019m scrolling and I\u2019m not sure if this is just me, but when I see a porn post or an NSFW post in general I click it. So I just see a gonewild post and think \u201coh cool\u201d and click on it. Still reeling from \u00a31 night at the club I didn\u2019t immediately notice it was my girlfriend, but something was familiar about the post. The bed looked familiar, so did the overall room, but then I saw her body realised \u201cwait that\u2019s my girlfriend\u201d. I was mostly in shock and just started looking through her history and what I saw confirmed that it was 100% her.  Just filled with a mixed ball of emotion I decided I should sleep, but I couldn\u2019t. \n\nSo I waited till the morning my mind going mad. Eventually I texted her confronting her about it. I got a bit aggy saying how I felt like she was cheating on me and she was saying to me that since it was the internet it wasn\u2019t cheating. In all honesty I said some nasty things and I could tell she wasn\u2019t having a good time either. Said to her that I would like her to stop posting, and if she doesn\u2019t then I didn\u2019t really want to continue things with her. She started saying loads of stuff even suggesting I join her for couple posts? In the end I realised she didn\u2019t want to stop so I ended things then and there. Haven\u2019t messaged her since and my mates are aggy at me asking what was going on. I\u2019m not going to expose her, but this is a bit much for me right now. \n\nAITA\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who broke up with his girlfriend over her posting on GoneWild is in the wrong. The situation is that the guy found out his girlfriend was posting explicit content online, which he considered cheating. They argued, and he ended the relationship because she didn't want to stop.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points here. The main issue is whether posting explicit photos or videos online constitutes cheating. The girlfriend argues that since it's the internet, it's not cheating. But the boyfriend felt betrayed and ended it. \n\nI should think about the definition of cheating. Traditionally, cheating involves being unfaithful to a partner, usually through physical or emotional infidelity. However, sharing explicit content, especially if it was done without the partner's consent or for the purpose of sharing with others, can be a form of betrayal. But in this case, the girlfriend was the one posting it, so maybe she consented to it in her own way. But the boyfriend's perspective is that sharing explicit content online is a boundary he expected her not to cross.\n\nAnother angle is communication. The couple had an argument where the boyfriend felt she didn't respect his feelings. He confronted her and she suggested couple posts, which might have escalated things. The boyfriend felt that her willingness to continue posting, even after his hurt, led him to end the relationship. \n\nIt's also important to consider mutual respect and boundaries in a relationship. If the boyfriend had previously discussed his discomfort with such content and she still posted it, that's one thing. But if this was a new issue, maybe they needed to communicate better before deciding to break up. \n\nHowever, the boyfriend's reaction was strong\u2014he called her out, said some nasty things, and ended it immediately. Was that too harsh? If they couldn't resolve the conflict through discussion, maybe breaking up was his way of protecting himself from further hurt. On the other hand, if the content was her choice to share and not involving others, perhaps the boyfriend overreacted.\n\nIn terms of morality, it's subjective. The girlfriend's actions might not be cheating in a traditional sense, but they might have violated his trust. The boyfriend's decision to end the relationship is his personal choice, but whether he's \"in the wrong\" depends on societal norms and individual values. \n\nI think the answer here is that the boyfriend isn't in the wrong. He had a valid reason to feel hurt and chose to end the relationship when his boundaries weren't respected. But others might argue that it's her body and her choice. However, since the question is about being in the wrong, and the boyfriend isn't violating any laws, it's more about relationship choices. So the answer would be B (Not in the wrong).\n"
