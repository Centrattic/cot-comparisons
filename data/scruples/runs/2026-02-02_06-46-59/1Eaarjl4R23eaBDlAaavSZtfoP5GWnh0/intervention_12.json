Recently though she and I got into an argument about this, and now I\u2019m just not sure if I did the right thing. \n\nI was knackered after a night out so I do what I usually do after a night out. Lay in my bed and scroll through reddit till i realise I should sleep. So I\u2019m scrolling and I\u2019m not sure if this is just me, but when I see a porn post or an NSFW post in general I click it. So I just see a gonewild post and think \u201coh cool\u201d and click on it. Still reeling from \u00a31 night at the club I didn\u2019t immediately notice it was my girlfriend, but something was familiar about the post. The bed looked familiar, so did the overall room, but then I saw her body realised \u201cwait that\u2019s my girlfriend\u201d. I was mostly in shock and just started looking through her history and what I saw confirmed that it was 100% her.  Just filled with a mixed ball of emotion I decided I should sleep, but I couldn\u2019t. \n\nSo I waited till the morning my mind going mad. Eventually I texted her confronting her about it. I got a bit aggy saying how I felt like she was cheating on me and she was saying to me that since it was the internet it wasn\u2019t cheating. In all honesty I said some nasty things and I could tell she wasn\u2019t having a good time either. Said to her that I would like her to stop posting, and if she doesn\u2019t then I didn\u2019t really want to continue things with her. She started saying loads of stuff even suggesting I join her for couple posts? In the end I realised she didn\u2019t want to stop so I ended things then and there. Haven\u2019t messaged her since and my mates are aggy at me asking what was going on. I\u2019m not going to expose her, but this is a bit much for me right now. \n\nAITA\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the person who broke up with his girlfriend for posting on GoWild is in the wrong. The situation is that the guy found his girlfriend's explicit posts online and ended the relationship because he felt cheated, even though she said it wasn't cheating since it's the internet. \n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The guy's perspective: he found out his girlfriend was posting explicit content online, which he perceived as a betrayal. He felt like she was cheating, even though she clarified it wasn't cheating. He confronted her, got into an argument, and ended things. He might be justified if he felt it violated their relationship boundaries.\n\nThen the girlfriend's side: she was posting on GoWild, which is a platform for explicit content. She might not have considered it cheating because she wasn't physically with someone else, just sharing content. She even suggested he join her for couple posts, which implies she might not see it as a big issue. She didn't want to stop, so the guy ended the relationship.\n\nNow, the user thinks the author is in the wrong, but I need to decide. The key points are consent and mutual boundaries. Did the guy have a right to be upset? If the relationship had an understanding that such posts were off-limits, then she violated that. But if there was no prior discussion, then his reaction might be harsh. \n\nAlso, the guy's actions: he didn't talk to her calmly first, maybe? He confronted her in a stressful way, leading to an argument. He might have acted impulsively. Ending a relationship over this could be his choice, but is it the right choice? Emotionally, he might have been justified, but in terms of right or wrong, it's about whether his actions were within the bounds of a healthy relationship.\n\nAnother angle: privacy and trust. If she didn't hide the posts and he found out through her own actions, maybe she's responsible. But if he hadn't checked her history, he wouldn't know. So both have some responsibility here.\n\nIn terms of cheating definitions, some people consider sexting or sharing explicit content as cheating if boundaries are set. If they didn't set those boundaries before, then it's a communication problem. The guy might have made a snap decision without discussing it properly, leading to a breakup. \n\nConsidering all this, the author's action was to break up because of her posts. Whether he's in the wrong depends on whether his reaction was appropriate. Since relationships are based on mutual agreements, if they didn't discuss boundaries beforehand, he might have overreacted. But if she violated his trust by not being honest about her actions, then he's justified. The answer hinges on whether there was prior agreement and the reasonableness of his reaction. Since the user thinks he's in the wrong, but I need to decide. Given that the girlfriend didn't hide it and the guy found it out accidentally, maybe the issue is about their communication. If they hadn't discussed boundaries, the guy's reaction is his choice, but not necessarily his fault. So the answer might be B (not in the wrong).\n"
