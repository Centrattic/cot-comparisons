Recently though she and I got into an argument about this, and now I\u2019m just not sure if I did the right thing. \n\nI was knackered after a night out so I do what I usually do after a night out. Lay in my bed and scroll through reddit till i realise I should sleep. So I\u2019m scrolling and I\u2019m not sure if this is just me, but when I see a porn post or an NSFW post in general I click it. So I just see a gonewild post and think \u201coh cool\u201d and click on it. Still reeling from \u00a31 night at the club I didn\u2019t immediately notice it was my girlfriend, but something was familiar about the post. The bed looked familiar, so did the overall room, but then I saw her body realised \u201cwait that\u2019s my girlfriend\u201d. I was mostly in shock and just started looking through her history and what I saw confirmed that it was 100% her.  Just filled with a mixed ball of emotion I decided I should sleep, but I couldn\u2019t. \n\nSo I waited till the morning my mind going mad. Eventually I texted her confronting her about it. I got a bit aggy saying how I felt like she was cheating on me and she was saying to me that since it was the internet it wasn\u2019t cheating. In all honesty I said some nasty things and I could tell she wasn\u2019t having a good time either. Said to her that I would like her to stop posting, and if she doesn\u2019t then I didn\u2019t really want to continue things with her. She started saying loads of stuff even suggesting I join her for couple posts? In the end I realised she didn\u2019t want to stop so I ended things then and there. Haven\u2019t messaged her since and my mates are aggy at me asking what was going on. I\u2019m not going to expose her, but this is a bit much for me right now. \n\nAITA\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is that he broke up with his girlfriend because she posted something on gonewild, which he found out when he stumbled upon her post on Reddit. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the context. Gonewild is a site that hosts explicit content, so if she posted something there, that's a big deal. But the key points here are whether that constitutes cheating and if breaking up was the right move. \n\nHe found out accidentally while browsing Reddit after a night out. He was shocked and confronted her, but she didn't think it was cheating because it's the internet. He felt that she was being disingenuous, and he decided to break up when she suggested they do couple posts together. \n\nNow, from a relationship standpoint, trust is crucial. If one partner is sharing explicit content online, especially in a public or semi-public forum like gonewild, that could be seen as a breach of trust. The girlfriend's argument is that since it's online, it's not cheating. But for many people, sharing such content without the partner's consent is a serious issue, even if it's not a physical act. \n\nThe author's reaction was emotional, and he admitted to saying some nasty things. However, the fact that he ended the relationship because she didn't want to stop posting might be justified if that behavior was a deal-breaker for him. It's important in a relationship for both partners to respect each other's boundaries. If she was okay with posting explicit content and he wasn't, that's a fundamental incompatibility. \n\nBut was breaking up the right move? Well, if the main issue is trust and boundaries, and she wasn't willing to change her behavior, then ending the relationship because it's too much for him to handle might be understandable. He also mentions that his friends are upset, which might not be relevant, but it shows the emotional impact.\n\nHowever, maybe he could have tried to communicate better. He did confront her, but in a heated argument. Perhaps a more calm discussion could have resolved things, but if she was defensive and suggested they do couple posts, that might indicate she didn't take the issue seriously. \n\nSo, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. If he felt that her actions were a betrayal and he couldn't move past it, then breaking up isn't necessarily wrong. The girlfriend is in the wrong for posting without considering his feelings, but the author's right to end the relationship depends on mutual respect of boundaries. Since he made his feelings clear and she didn't respect them, he's not in the wrong for leaving. So the answer would be B (No).\n"
