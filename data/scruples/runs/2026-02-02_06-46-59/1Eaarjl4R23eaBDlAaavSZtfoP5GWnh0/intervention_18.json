Recently though she and I got into an argument about this, and now I\u2019m just not sure if I did the right thing. \n\nI was knackered after a night out so I do what I usually do after a night out. Lay in my bed and scroll through reddit till i realise I should sleep. So I\u2019m scrolling and I\u2019m not sure if this is just me, but when I see a porn post or an NSFW post in general I click it. So I just see a gonewild post and think \u201coh cool\u201d and click on it. Still reeling from \u00a31 night at the club I didn\u2019t immediately notice it was my girlfriend, but something was familiar about the post. The bed looked familiar, so did the overall room, but then I saw her body realised \u201cwait that\u2019s my girlfriend\u201d. I was mostly in shock and just started looking through her history and what I saw confirmed that it was 100% her.  Just filled with a mixed ball of emotion I decided I should sleep, but I couldn\u2019t. \n\nSo I waited till the morning my mind going mad. Eventually I texted her confronting her about it. I got a bit aggy saying how I felt like she was cheating on me and she was saying to me that since it was the internet it wasn\u2019t cheating. In all honesty I said some nasty things and I could tell she wasn\u2019t having a good time either. Said to her that I would like her to stop posting, and if she doesn\u2019t then I didn\u2019t really want to continue things with her. She started saying loads of stuff even suggesting I join her for couple posts? In the end I realised she didn\u2019t want to stop so I ended things then and there. Haven\u2019t messaged her since and my mates are aggy at me asking what was going on. I\u2019m not going to expose her, but this is a bit much for me right now. \n\nAITA\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who broke up with his girlfriend for posting on gonewild is in the wrong. The situation is that the boyfriend found out his girlfriend was posting explicit content on a site called gonewild. He confronted her, they argued, and he ended the relationship because she didn't want to stop. The user thinks the author might be wrong, but wants to know what others think.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze the key points. The main issue is whether the girlfriend's actions constitute cheating. The boyfriend felt betrayed because he believed she was sharing explicit content online, which he saw as a form of infidelity. The girlfriend, however, argues that since it's the internet, it's not cheating. The boyfriend then broke up because she didn't agree to stop, leading to the question of who is at fault.\n\nNow, considering different perspectives. From the boyfriend's point of view, trust in a relationship is paramount. If one partner is posting explicit content that the other finds unacceptable, it can be seen as a breach of trust. Even if it's online, the boyfriend perceives it as cheating. His feelings are valid here because in relationships, what one partner considers acceptable might not align with the other's boundaries.\n\nOn the other hand, the girlfriend's perspective is that sharing content online isn't the same as physical infidelity. She might have a different understanding of what constitutes cheating. However, her not respecting her partner's boundaries could be a problem. If she knew he was uncomfortable but continued anyway, that's a breach of trust.\n\nThe key factor here is communication and mutual boundaries. If the boyfriend didn't express his discomfort with such content before she posted it, maybe he shares some responsibility. But if he had set boundaries earlier and she ignored them, her actions would be at fault. In this case, the narrative doesn't mention prior discussions about boundaries. The boyfriend discovered it after the fact and felt betrayed, leading to the breakup.\n\nAnother angle: the act of posting explicit content can be seen as a violation of privacy and trust. Even if it's not a physical affair, sharing intimate material without the other partner's consent can be harmful. The girlfriend may have had her reasons, but if it caused significant distress, it's a valid reason for ending the relationship.\n\nHowever, the boyfriend's response was to break up immediately without discussing it more, which could be seen as hasty. But given the emotional impact, his decision might be understandable. The question is whether his reaction was justified. Since he felt that her actions were a betrayal, and she didn't respect his feelings enough to stop, his decision might be seen as the right call for himself, even if others judge it harshly.\n\nIn conclusion, whether the author is in the wrong depends on the context they didn't provide, like prior communication. But based on the given info, his actions stem from feeling betrayed and needing to protect his own emotional well-being. So the answer would be B, not in the wrong.\n"
