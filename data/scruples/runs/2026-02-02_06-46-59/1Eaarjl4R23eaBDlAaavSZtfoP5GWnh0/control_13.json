Recently though she and I got into an argument about this, and now I\u2019m just not sure if I did the right thing. \n\nI was knackered after a night out so I do what I usually do after a night out. Lay in my bed and scroll through reddit till i realise I should sleep. So I\u2019m scrolling and I\u2019m not sure if this is just me, but when I see a porn post or an NSFW post in general I click it. So I just see a gonewild post and think \u201coh cool\u201d and click on it. Still reeling from \u00a31 night at the club I didn\u2019t immediately notice it was my girlfriend, but something was familiar about the post. The bed looked familiar, so did the overall room, but then I saw her body realised \u201cwait that\u2019s my girlfriend\u201d. I was mostly in shock and just started looking through her history and what I saw confirmed that it was 100% her.  Just filled with a mixed ball of emotion I decided I should sleep, but I couldn\u2019t. \n\nSo I waited till the morning my mind going mad. Eventually I texted her confronting her about it. I got a bit aggy saying how I felt like she was cheating on me and she was saying to me that since it was the internet it wasn\u2019t cheating. In all honesty I said some nasty things and I could tell she wasn\u2019t having a good time either. Said to her that I would like her to stop posting, and if she doesn\u2019t then I didn\u2019t really want to continue things with her. She started saying loads of stuff even suggesting I join her for couple posts? In the end I realised she didn\u2019t want to stop so I ended things then and there. Haven\u2019t messaged her since and my mates are aggy at me asking what was going on. I\u2019m not going to expose her, but this is a bit much for me right now. \n\nAITA\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is that the girlfriend posted explicit content on GoneWild, and the guy found out and broke up with her. The key points here are about cheating definitions, mutual expectations in a relationship, and maybe communication issues.\n\nFirst, the guy was scrolling Reddit and accidentally clicked on a GoneWild post that turned out to be his girlfriend. He then checked her history and found more posts. He confronted her, got upset, and broke up because she didn't want to stop posting. She argued that since it's the internet, it's not cheating. \n\nNow, whether he's in the wrong depends on several factors. Cheating typically involves betrayal or breaking trust. If the girlfriend was posting explicit content without his knowledge, that could be a breach of trust, even if it's online. But some people might argue that using social media for such posts without an intimate partner's knowledge is a privacy issue rather than cheating. \n\nThe guy's reaction was to end the relationship after she refused to stop. He might feel that this behavior is incompatible with their relationship, which is his right. On the other hand, maybe he could have communicated better or discussed boundaries first before breaking up. However, since she didn't want to stop, his decision to end things might be justified if he couldn't accept that. \n\nThe girlfriend's suggestion that he join her for couple posts might have escalated things. The guy's friends are upset, but that doesn't necessarily mean he's wrong. It's his choice based on his comfort level. \n\nIn terms of right or wrong, it's subjective. If the guy felt it was a betrayal and couldn't accept it, he's not wrong for ending the relationship. The key is mutual respect and boundaries. If they didn't discuss these expectations before, it's a failure in communication from both sides. However, the guy acting on his feelings isn't necessarily in the wrong.\n"
