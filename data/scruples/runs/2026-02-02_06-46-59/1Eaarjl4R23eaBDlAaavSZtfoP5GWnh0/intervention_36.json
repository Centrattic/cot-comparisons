Recently though she and I got into an argument about this, and now I\u2019m just not sure if I did the right thing. \n\nI was knackered after a night out so I do what I usually do after a night out. Lay in my bed and scroll through reddit till i realise I should sleep. So I\u2019m scrolling and I\u2019m not sure if this is just me, but when I see a porn post or an NSFW post in general I click it. So I just see a gonewild post and think \u201coh cool\u201d and click on it. Still reeling from \u00a31 night at the club I didn\u2019t immediately notice it was my girlfriend, but something was familiar about the post. The bed looked familiar, so did the overall room, but then I saw her body realised \u201cwait that\u2019s my girlfriend\u201d. I was mostly in shock and just started looking through her history and what I saw confirmed that it was 100% her.  Just filled with a mixed ball of emotion I decided I should sleep, but I couldn\u2019t. \n\nSo I waited till the morning my mind going mad. Eventually I texted her confronting her about it. I got a bit aggy saying how I felt like she was cheating on me and she was saying to me that since it was the internet it wasn\u2019t cheating. In all honesty I said some nasty things and I could tell she wasn\u2019t having a good time either. Said to her that I would like her to stop posting, and if she doesn\u2019t then I didn\u2019t really want to continue things with her. She started saying loads of stuff even suggesting I join her for couple posts? In the end I realised she didn\u2019t want to stop so I ended things then and there. Haven\u2019t messaged her since and my mates are aggy at me asking what was going on. I\u2019m not going to expose her, but this is a bit much for me right now. \n\nAITA\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who broke up with his girlfriend for her posting on GoneWild is in the wrong. The situation is about fidelity and boundaries.\n\nFirst, the girlfriend posted explicit content on a site like GoneWild. The boyfriend found out and felt cheated because he thought it was akin to infidelity. The key issue is whether sharing such content online counts as cheating in their relationship. \n\nThe girlfriend argues that since it's online, it's not cheating. But the boyfriend saw it as a betrayal. The question is about consent and mutual boundaries. If they had an agreement about such things beforehand, then her actions might be a violation. However, if they didn't discuss it, maybe the boyfriend's reaction is based on his own assumptions without clear communication.\n\nThe boyfriend broke up because she didn't want to stop. He felt it was a deal-breaker. The girlfriend wanted to continue, even suggesting he join. The conflict here is about differing values. Some might say he overreacted if there was no prior discussion. Others might say he was justified in ending the relationship if it made him uncomfortable.\n\nThe user initially thought the author is in the wrong but is unsure. The answer needs to consider if the boyfriend's actions were reasonable given the lack of clear boundaries. If there was no prior agreement, maybe he had the right to set that boundary. However, if he didn't communicate his expectations first, then he might be in the wrong for not discussing it before taking action.\n\nIn relationships, communication is key. If the boyfriend had expressed his discomfort before, then her continuing might be a problem. But if he never talked to her about it, then he might be reacting based on his own standards without mutual understanding. The sudden breakup after an argument where he said some hurtful things could be seen as impulsive.\n\nSo, considering all angles, if there was no prior discussion, the boyfriend might be in the wrong for not setting boundaries earlier and for breaking up based on something that wasn't clearly agreed upon. Alternatively, if they had an implicit understanding, he might be right. But given the information, the answer might lean towards him being in the wrong because he didn't address it earlier and acted out of anger during an argument.\n"
