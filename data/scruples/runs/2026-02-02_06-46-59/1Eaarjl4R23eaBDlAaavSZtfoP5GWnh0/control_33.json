Recently though she and I got into an argument about this, and now I\u2019m just not sure if I did the right thing. \n\nI was knackered after a night out so I do what I usually do after a night out. Lay in my bed and scroll through reddit till i realise I should sleep. So I\u2019m scrolling and I\u2019m not sure if this is just me, but when I see a porn post or an NSFW post in general I click it. So I just see a gonewild post and think \u201coh cool\u201d and click on it. Still reeling from \u00a31 night at the club I didn\u2019t immediately notice it was my girlfriend, but something was familiar about the post. The bed looked familiar, so did the overall room, but then I saw her body realised \u201cwait that\u2019s my girlfriend\u201d. I was mostly in shock and just started looking through her history and what I saw confirmed that it was 100% her.  Just filled with a mixed ball of emotion I decided I should sleep, but I couldn\u2019t. \n\nSo I waited till the morning my mind going mad. Eventually I texted her confronting her about it. I got a bit aggy saying how I felt like she was cheating on me and she was saying to me that since it was the internet it wasn\u2019t cheating. In all honesty I said some nasty things and I could tell she wasn\u2019t having a good time either. Said to her that I would like her to stop posting, and if she doesn\u2019t then I didn\u2019t really want to continue things with her. She started saying loads of stuff even suggesting I join her for couple posts? In the end I realised she didn\u2019t want to stop so I ended things then and there. Haven\u2019t messaged her since and my mates are aggy at me asking what was going on. I\u2019m not going to expose her, but this is a bit much for me right now. \n\nAITA\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. So the question is whether the person who broke up with his girlfriend for posting on GoneWild is in the wrong. The user is asking if the author (AITA) is at fault here.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The girlfriend posted something on a site like Reddit's GoneWild, which is known for explicit content. The author found out that she was in a post there, and that's why he broke up with her. He says he found her post by accident because he was browsing Reddit after a night out. He didn't realize it was her at first but then recognized her. He confronted her, got into an argument, and ended things because she didn't want to stop posting.\n\nNow, considering what cheating is. Cheating typically involves a physical or emotional affair with someone else. The girlfriend argues that since it's online, it's not cheating. But the author feels betrayed. The key here is whether sharing explicit photos of oneself online without consent or against the partner's wishes is considered a form of betrayal, even if there's no physical infidelity.\n\nThe author's reaction is about trust and boundaries in the relationship. If the girlfriend agreed to be in explicit content and shared it online without her partner's knowledge or consent, that could be a breach of trust. The author's decision to break up is based on not being able to accept that behavior. On the other hand, the girlfriend might not see it as cheating and might think she has the right to share content about herself online.\n\nBut the problem is, in a relationship, both partners usually have expectations about what's acceptable. If the author found out she was sharing explicit images and felt it violated their relationship's boundaries, then his reaction might be justified. However, the girlfriend might argue that she's not cheating by just posting photos of herself. The line here is blurry. Some people might consider sharing explicit photos of oneself without the partner's consent as a form of emotional cheating, especially if it's done without the partner's awareness or approval.\n\nAnother angle: the author found out through her history, so maybe she didn't hide it from him? If she was posting on a public site, maybe she didn't intend for him to see it, but it's possible she thought it was private. However, given that it's a public forum, she might not have expected someone to find it accidentally. \n\nThe author's actions\u2014confronting her, getting angry, and breaking up\u2014could be seen as a valid response if he felt that her actions violated their relationship's trust. However, if the girlfriend didn't see it as a deal-breaker and thought it was her personal choice, then the author's reaction might be harsh. But relationships require mutual consent and respect for each other's boundaries. If she was posting explicit content without discussing it with him, causing him emotional distress, then the author's decision to end the relationship could be justified.\n\nSo, considering all that, whether the author is in the wrong depends on the relationship's norms and whether the girlfriend's actions were a violation of agreed-upon boundaries. Since the author felt it was a betrayal and couldn't continue the relationship, and the girlfriend didn't meet his request to stop, he might not be in the wrong. However, if the girlfriend believed she had the right to post such content without consulting him, the author's reaction is a matter of differing views on privacy and trust.\n"
