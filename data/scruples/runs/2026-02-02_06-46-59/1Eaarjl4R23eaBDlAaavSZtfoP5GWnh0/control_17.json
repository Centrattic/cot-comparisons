Recently though she and I got into an argument about this, and now I\u2019m just not sure if I did the right thing. \n\nI was knackered after a night out so I do what I usually do after a night out. Lay in my bed and scroll through reddit till i realise I should sleep. So I\u2019m scrolling and I\u2019m not sure if this is just me, but when I see a porn post or an NSFW post in general I click it. So I just see a gonewild post and think \u201coh cool\u201d and click on it. Still reeling from \u00a31 night at the club I didn\u2019t immediately notice it was my girlfriend, but something was familiar about the post. The bed looked familiar, so did the overall room, but then I saw her body realised \u201cwait that\u2019s my girlfriend\u201d. I was mostly in shock and just started looking through her history and what I saw confirmed that it was 100% her.  Just filled with a mixed ball of emotion I decided I should sleep, but I couldn\u2019t. \n\nSo I waited till the morning my mind going mad. Eventually I texted her confronting her about it. I got a bit aggy saying how I felt like she was cheating on me and she was saying to me that since it was the internet it wasn\u2019t cheating. In all honesty I said some nasty things and I could tell she wasn\u2019t having a good time either. Said to her that I would like her to stop posting, and if she doesn\u2019t then I didn\u2019t really want to continue things with her. She started saying loads of stuff even suggesting I join her for couple posts? In the end I realised she didn\u2019t want to stop so I ended things then and there. Haven\u2019t messaged her since and my mates are aggy at me asking what was going on. I\u2019m not going to expose her, but this is a bit much for me right now. \n\nAITA\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the author of the AITA post is in the wrong for breaking up with his girlfriend after finding her posts on gonewild. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The boyfriend found out his girlfriend had posted explicit content of herself on a site like Reddit, specifically gonewild which is known for explicit material. He broke up with her because he felt it was like cheating and she didn't want to stop doing it. The girlfriend's argument was that since it's online, it's not cheating. The author is now wondering if he's the one at fault.\n\nHmm. So, cheating typically involves engaging in a romantic or sexual relationship with someone else. But here, the issue is about posting explicit content. The girlfriend might not be cheating if she's just posting content, not interacting with others. But the boyfriend felt it was like cheating. \n\nThe key points here are communication and mutual boundaries. In a relationship, both partners should discuss and agree on what is acceptable. If the boyfriend didn't know about her activity until he found out, maybe there was a lack of communication. But once he found out, he confronted her. \n\nThe girlfriend's response was suggesting they do couple posts together, which might be a red flag for the boyfriend. If he felt uncomfortable with that and she didn't respect his boundaries, then breaking up could be justified. \n\nHowever, is the act of posting explicit content inherently cheating? It depends on the relationship's boundaries. Some people might find sharing such content without consent a violation, even if it's not with someone else. Others might not. The boyfriend's reaction is based on betrayal and lack of trust. \n\nThe girlfriend's argument that it's not cheating because it's online might be true in terms of actual cheating, but the boyfriend's emotional reaction is valid. If he couldn't handle it and felt it was a deal-breaker, then breaking up isn't necessarily wrong. \n\nBut maybe the boyfriend could have handled it differently. He admitted to being aggressive in his text and saying nasty things. Maybe a more calm discussion could have led to understanding. However, if the girlfriend was unwilling to stop, the breakup might be the right call. \n\nSo, considering all that, the author's actions are not in the wrong because he followed his conscience after a breach of trust, even if the definition of cheating is blurred here. The answer might be B (No).\n"
