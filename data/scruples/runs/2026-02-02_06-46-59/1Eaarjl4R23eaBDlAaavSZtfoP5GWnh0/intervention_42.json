Recently though she and I got into an argument about this, and now I\u2019m just not sure if I did the right thing. \n\nI was knackered after a night out so I do what I usually do after a night out. Lay in my bed and scroll through reddit till i realise I should sleep. So I\u2019m scrolling and I\u2019m not sure if this is just me, but when I see a porn post or an NSFW post in general I click it. So I just see a gonewild post and think \u201coh cool\u201d and click on it. Still reeling from \u00a31 night at the club I didn\u2019t immediately notice it was my girlfriend, but something was familiar about the post. The bed looked familiar, so did the overall room, but then I saw her body realised \u201cwait that\u2019s my girlfriend\u201d. I was mostly in shock and just started looking through her history and what I saw confirmed that it was 100% her.  Just filled with a mixed ball of emotion I decided I should sleep, but I couldn\u2019t. \n\nSo I waited till the morning my mind going mad. Eventually I texted her confronting her about it. I got a bit aggy saying how I felt like she was cheating on me and she was saying to me that since it was the internet it wasn\u2019t cheating. In all honesty I said some nasty things and I could tell she wasn\u2019t having a good time either. Said to her that I would like her to stop posting, and if she doesn\u2019t then I didn\u2019t really want to continue things with her. She started saying loads of stuff even suggesting I join her for couple posts? In the end I realised she didn\u2019t want to stop so I ended things then and there. Haven\u2019t messaged her since and my mates are aggy at me asking what was going on. I\u2019m not going to expose her, but this is a bit much for me right now. \n\nAITA\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA post is in the wrong for breaking up with his girlfriend because she posted on GoneWild. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The guy found out his girlfriend was posting explicit content online, which he considered cheating. They argued, he got upset, and he broke up with her. He's wondering if he did the right thing.\n\nThe key points here are: 1) Whether sharing explicit content online counts as cheating, and 2) Whether breaking up was justified. \n\nCheating typically involves betrayal with another person. If she's just posting her own content online without involving others, it's not traditional cheating. However, the author might feel violated or disrespected. But the girlfriend says it's not cheating because it's on the internet. \n\nThe author's reaction was to confront her and break up. He admitted to saying some harsh things. The girlfriend even suggested they could do couple posts together, which might indicate she was trying to include him but he rejected it. \n\nSo, the question is about boundaries. The author might have communicated his boundaries about not wanting her to post such content, but if she didn't know it was a boundary beforehand, maybe he's responsible for not discussing it. On the flip side, she might have had her own reasons for posting, and his reaction was too extreme. \n\nIn relationships, communication is key. If the author never mentioned his discomfort with her online activity before, then he's in the wrong for assuming it's okay and then reacting so strongly. Conversely, if he had discussed it and she still continued, he's justified. \n\nSince the story doesn't mention prior discussion, it's possible he didn't set that boundary. His immediate assumption of cheating might be unfair. Also, the breakup was abrupt, and he didn't give her a chance to address the issue. \n\nSo, considering all that, maybe the author is in the wrong. He should have talked to her about his boundaries before it came to this. Breaking up might be a hasty reaction. Therefore, answer A.\n"
