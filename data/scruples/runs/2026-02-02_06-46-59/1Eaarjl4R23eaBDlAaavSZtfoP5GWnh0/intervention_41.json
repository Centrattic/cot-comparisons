Recently though she and I got into an argument about this, and now I\u2019m just not sure if I did the right thing. \n\nI was knackered after a night out so I do what I usually do after a night out. Lay in my bed and scroll through reddit till i realise I should sleep. So I\u2019m scrolling and I\u2019m not sure if this is just me, but when I see a porn post or an NSFW post in general I click it. So I just see a gonewild post and think \u201coh cool\u201d and click on it. Still reeling from \u00a31 night at the club I didn\u2019t immediately notice it was my girlfriend, but something was familiar about the post. The bed looked familiar, so did the overall room, but then I saw her body realised \u201cwait that\u2019s my girlfriend\u201d. I was mostly in shock and just started looking through her history and what I saw confirmed that it was 100% her.  Just filled with a mixed ball of emotion I decided I should sleep, but I couldn\u2019t. \n\nSo I waited till the morning my mind going mad. Eventually I texted her confronting her about it. I got a bit aggy saying how I felt like she was cheating on me and she was saying to me that since it was the internet it wasn\u2019t cheating. In all honesty I said some nasty things and I could tell she wasn\u2019t having a good time either. Said to her that I would like her to stop posting, and if she doesn\u2019t then I didn\u2019t really want to continue things with her. She started saying loads of stuff even suggesting I join her for couple posts? In the end I realised she didn\u2019t want to stop so I ended things then and there. Haven\u2019t messaged her since and my mates are aggy at me asking what was going on. I\u2019m not going to expose her, but this is a bit much for me right now. \n\nAITA\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong. The situation is about breaking up with a girlfriend because she posted on a site called gonewild, which they consider explicit content. The author found her post on Reddit, realized it was her, and confronted her, leading to an argument and the breakup.\n\nFirst, I need to figure out the key points here. The main issue is about whether posting on gonewild counts as cheating. The girlfriend argues that since it's the internet, it's not cheating. The author, however, felt it was a breach of trust and values, leading him to end the relationship.\n\nNow, to determine if the author is in the wrong. The user thinks the author is in the wrong but wants confirmation. The question is whether the author overreacted or acted appropriately.\n\nFrom the author's perspective, he found out that his girlfriend was sharing explicit content online, which he found unacceptable. He confronted her, and when she didn't agree to stop, he ended things. His friends are upset, but he's not exposing her, which he considers respectful.\n\nOn the other hand, the girlfriend's view is that posting online isn't cheating. She even suggested he join her for couple posts, implying that she might not see it as a big deal or that she wants to include him in her activities. The author's reaction could be seen as a misunderstanding or a personal issue rather than the girlfriend's fault.\n\nBut then, the question is about whether the author is in the wrong. In relationships, it's about mutual respect and boundaries. If the girlfriend had discussed this with the author beforehand, maybe things would be different. However, she didn't, and he found out through her post. The author's decision to break up might be seen as his choice, but does that make him the asshole? It depends on the context. If the girlfriend's actions were a violation of their agreed-upon boundaries, then the author's reaction is justified. However, if there were no prior discussions about this, the author might be overreacting to something that the girlfriend didn't consider wrong.\n\nAlso, considering the platform gonewild is known for explicit content. If the author considers that a form of cheating, even if it's online, then his feelings are valid. However, the girlfriend's stance is that it's not cheating, which is her perspective. The author's actions led to the breakup, but whether he's in the wrong would depend on societal norms and the specific relationship's expectations.\n\nIn some relationships, sharing explicit content online without the partner's consent could be a deal-breaker. The author might feel betrayed, even if there's no physical infidelity. However, others might argue that unless there was an explicit agreement not to post such content, the author's reaction is his personal discomfort rather than a betrayal.\n\nThe key here is whether the author had a right to expect that his girlfriend wouldn't share such content. If he didn't discuss it with her first, he might have contributed to the misunderstanding. On the other hand, if he felt strongly about it and it's a boundary for him, then acting on that is his right.\n\nIn the end, the author made a choice based on his feelings, but whether he's in the wrong is subjective. However, since the question is about whether he's in the wrong, and given that the girlfriend didn't consider it cheating and the author didn't discuss it beforehand, it's possible that the author is not in the wrong for ending the relationship over something that matters to him. But if the girlfriend's actions were consensual and within her own views, the author might be overstepping by breaking up without more discussion.\n"
