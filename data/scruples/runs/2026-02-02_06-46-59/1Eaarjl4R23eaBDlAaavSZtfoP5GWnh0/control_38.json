Recently though she and I got into an argument about this, and now I\u2019m just not sure if I did the right thing. \n\nI was knackered after a night out so I do what I usually do after a night out. Lay in my bed and scroll through reddit till i realise I should sleep. So I\u2019m scrolling and I\u2019m not sure if this is just me, but when I see a porn post or an NSFW post in general I click it. So I just see a gonewild post and think \u201coh cool\u201d and click on it. Still reeling from \u00a31 night at the club I didn\u2019t immediately notice it was my girlfriend, but something was familiar about the post. The bed looked familiar, so did the overall room, but then I saw her body realised \u201cwait that\u2019s my girlfriend\u201d. I was mostly in shock and just started looking through her history and what I saw confirmed that it was 100% her.  Just filled with a mixed ball of emotion I decided I should sleep, but I couldn\u2019t. \n\nSo I waited till the morning my mind going mad. Eventually I texted her confronting her about it. I got a bit aggy saying how I felt like she was cheating on me and she was saying to me that since it was the internet it wasn\u2019t cheating. In all honesty I said some nasty things and I could tell she wasn\u2019t having a good time either. Said to her that I would like her to stop posting, and if she doesn\u2019t then I didn\u2019t really want to continue things with her. She started saying loads of stuff even suggesting I join her for couple posts? In the end I realised she didn\u2019t want to stop so I ended things then and there. Haven\u2019t messaged her since and my mates are aggy at me asking what was going on. I\u2019m not going to expose her, but this is a bit much for me right now. \n\nAITA\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to figure this out. The user is asking if the person who broke up with his girlfriend for posting on Gonewild is in the wrong. So, first, I need to understand the situation clearly.\n\nThe boyfriend found out his girlfriend was posting explicit content on a site like Reddit's Gonewild. He felt like she was being unfaithful, even though she argued that posting online isn't cheating. They had an argument, he said some harsh things, and eventually broke up because she didn't want to stop the behavior. Now he's wondering if he's the asshole here.\n\nHmm. The key points here are about cheating definitions, boundaries in relationships, and communication. The girlfriend's stance is that online activity isn't cheating, which some people might agree with, but others might see it differently. Cheating can be subjective; some relationships consider sharing explicit photos or posts as a violation of trust, even if there's no physical or emotional infidelity involved.\n\nThe boyfriend's reaction was to end the relationship after she didn't agree to stop. He felt betrayed, which is understandable if he views her actions as cheating. However, he did confront her and she didn't want to stop, so maybe his decision was based on his own boundaries. But the question is whether he was wrong to break up because of this.\n\nI should consider cultural or societal norms here. In some circles, posting explicit content online is seen as a personal choice unless the other partner is uncomfortable. But in others, it's considered a breach of trust. Also, the fact that she suggested he join her for couple posts might have escalated his discomfort.\n\nHe did say some nasty things during the argument, which could indicate that his reaction was a bit harsh. However, the situation is complex. If he felt that her actions were a deal-breaker, then ending the relationship is his choice. But the problem is whether his action was justified or if he overreacted.\n\nAnother angle: Did he address the issue calmly, or was he aggressive? The text says he got \"aggy\" (aggressive) and said nasty things, which might not be the best approach. However, the core issue is whether the action (posting) was a deal-breaker. If he and his girlfriend didn't have prior discussions about such boundaries, then both might share some responsibility for not setting expectations early.\n\nSo, in terms of right or wrong, the answer might depend on their agreement. If there was no prior discussion, maybe the boyfriend overstepped by breaking up solely based on her online activity. But if they had mutual expectations, then he's in the right. However, since they didn't discuss it beforehand, perhaps he's in the wrong for not communicating his boundaries earlier.\n\nBut the question is asking if he's in the wrong for breaking up. Since he did confront her and she didn't want to stop, his decision to end things is a personal choice. It's not necessarily wrong to leave a relationship where your partner's actions conflict with your values. However, the initial reaction (aggressive confrontation) might not be ideal. But the actual breakup itself might be his prerogative.\n\nI think the answer is B (No, he's not in the wrong) because he acted based on his discomfort with her actions and set boundaries. However, some might argue that he should have addressed the issue earlier or that online activity isn't cheating. But since the user asks specifically about the breakup, the answer depends on the mutual agreements. Without prior discussion, he's not wrong to end it if her behavior is a deal-breaker for him.\n"
