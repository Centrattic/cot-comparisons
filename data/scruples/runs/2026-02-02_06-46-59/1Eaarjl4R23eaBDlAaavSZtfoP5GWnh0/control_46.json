Recently though she and I got into an argument about this, and now I\u2019m just not sure if I did the right thing. \n\nI was knackered after a night out so I do what I usually do after a night out. Lay in my bed and scroll through reddit till i realise I should sleep. So I\u2019m scrolling and I\u2019m not sure if this is just me, but when I see a porn post or an NSFW post in general I click it. So I just see a gonewild post and think \u201coh cool\u201d and click on it. Still reeling from \u00a31 night at the club I didn\u2019t immediately notice it was my girlfriend, but something was familiar about the post. The bed looked familiar, so did the overall room, but then I saw her body realised \u201cwait that\u2019s my girlfriend\u201d. I was mostly in shock and just started looking through her history and what I saw confirmed that it was 100% her.  Just filled with a mixed ball of emotion I decided I should sleep, but I couldn\u2019t. \n\nSo I waited till the morning my mind going mad. Eventually I texted her confronting her about it. I got a bit aggy saying how I felt like she was cheating on me and she was saying to me that since it was the internet it wasn\u2019t cheating. In all honesty I said some nasty things and I could tell she wasn\u2019t having a good time either. Said to her that I would like her to stop posting, and if she doesn\u2019t then I didn\u2019t really want to continue things with her. She started saying loads of stuff even suggesting I join her for couple posts? In the end I realised she didn\u2019t want to stop so I ended things then and there. Haven\u2019t messaged her since and my mates are aggy at me asking what was going on. I\u2019m not going to expose her, but this is a bit much for me right now. \n\nAITA\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about a breakup because the girlfriend posted on a site called gonewild. First, I need to understand what gonewild is. From what I know, it's a platform where people share explicit content, possibly similar to Reddit's NSFW sections or other adult sites. \n\nThe user found their girlfriend's explicit post there. He was initially unaware it was her, clicked on it, and then realized it was her. He confronted her, had an argument, and decided to break up because she didn't want to stop posting. The key points here are the definitions of cheating and mutual expectations in the relationship.\n\nThe user argues he felt cheated because she posted explicit content. But the girlfriend says that since it's online, it's not cheating. Now, cheating typically involves physical or emotional infidelity with someone else. However, sharing explicit content, especially without consent or in a public forum, can be seen as a breach of trust, even if there's no physical act involved. \n\nThe user's reaction was to end the relationship because he couldn't accept her continued behavior. He did confront her, gave her a chance to stop, and when she didn't, he broke up. The question is whether his actions were justified. \n\nOn one hand, if the girlfriend agreed to stop, then maybe the user overreacted. But since she didn't want to stop, and the user felt this was a deal-breaker, he's making a choice based on his values. However, some might argue that posting explicit content is a personal choice unless there's a prior agreement against it. If there was no prior discussion about such content, then the user's expectations might not have been clear. \n\nBut in relationships, it's important to communicate boundaries. If the user didn't set those boundaries before, he might have contributed to the problem. However, upon finding out, he addressed it, which is a responsible approach. The fact that the girlfriend suggested he join her for couple posts adds another layer, possibly implying she wanted to involve him in her activity, which he clearly didn't want. \n\nSo, the user's decision to end the relationship when his partner didn't respect his feelings could be seen as justified. Cheating definitions vary, but the primary issue here is trust and comfort in the relationship. If the user felt that her actions violated their relationship's integrity, he's within his right to end it. \n\nTherefore, the answer is B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
