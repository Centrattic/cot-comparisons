Recently though she and I got into an argument about this, and now I\u2019m just not sure if I did the right thing. \n\nI was knackered after a night out so I do what I usually do after a night out. Lay in my bed and scroll through reddit till i realise I should sleep. So I\u2019m scrolling and I\u2019m not sure if this is just me, but when I see a porn post or an NSFW post in general I click it. So I just see a gonewild post and think \u201coh cool\u201d and click on it. Still reeling from \u00a31 night at the club I didn\u2019t immediately notice it was my girlfriend, but something was familiar about the post. The bed looked familiar, so did the overall room, but then I saw her body realised \u201cwait that\u2019s my girlfriend\u201d. I was mostly in shock and just started looking through her history and what I saw confirmed that it was 100% her.  Just filled with a mixed ball of emotion I decided I should sleep, but I couldn\u2019t. \n\nSo I waited till the morning my mind going mad. Eventually I texted her confronting her about it. I got a bit aggy saying how I felt like she was cheating on me and she was saying to me that since it was the internet it wasn\u2019t cheating. In all honesty I said some nasty things and I could tell she wasn\u2019t having a good time either. Said to her that I would like her to stop posting, and if she doesn\u2019t then I didn\u2019t really want to continue things with her. She started saying loads of stuff even suggesting I join her for couple posts? In the end I realised she didn\u2019t want to stop so I ended things then and there. Haven\u2019t messaged her since and my mates are aggy at me asking what was going on. I\u2019m not going to expose her, but this is a bit much for me right now. \n\nAITA\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is at fault for breaking up with his girlfriend because she posted on a site called gonewild. The key points here are about cheating and the definition of cheating in a relationship. \n\nFirst, the guy found out that his girlfriend had posted explicit content of herself on an online forum. He felt this was a breach of trust, so he ended the relationship. The girlfriend argues that since it's the internet, it's not cheating. The author is conflicted because he didn't like her posting but also felt she wasn't respecting his boundaries by not stopping.\n\nIn relationships, trust and communication are crucial. Cheating is typically defined as engaging in intimate activities with someone else while in a committed relationship. However, some people might consider sharing explicit content online as a form of cheating, depending on the couple's agreed-upon boundaries. The girlfriend's perspective is that the internet isn't a physical act, so it's not cheating. But the author felt betrayed, which is a valid emotional response if they had different expectations.\n\nThe author's actions here were to confront her and then break up when she didn't agree to stop. He might have overreacted by ending the relationship immediately without discussing it more. However, if their communication showed that they had different values about online content, then ending the relationship could be justified as a way to protect his own feelings and boundaries.\n\nOn the other hand, the author did lash out and say some nasty things, which isn't ideal. But the core issue is about differing views on what constitutes cheating. The author might be in the right if they had discussed boundaries beforehand and she violated them. If there was no prior discussion, then it's a gray area. Since the user thinks the author is in the wrong, but I need to weigh both sides. \n\nIn many relationships, sharing explicit content without consent is considered a boundary violation. If the author felt this was a deal-breaker, then ending the relationship isn't necessarily wrong. The girlfriend's suggestion to make couple posts might have added to his discomfort, reinforcing that she didn't see the issue. So, considering all that, the author's decision might be justified. Therefore, the answer is B.\n"
