Recently though she and I got into an argument about this, and now I\u2019m just not sure if I did the right thing. \n\nI was knackered after a night out so I do what I usually do after a night out. Lay in my bed and scroll through reddit till i realise I should sleep. So I\u2019m scrolling and I\u2019m not sure if this is just me, but when I see a porn post or an NSFW post in general I click it. So I just see a gonewild post and think \u201coh cool\u201d and click on it. Still reeling from \u00a31 night at the club I didn\u2019t immediately notice it was my girlfriend, but something was familiar about the post. The bed looked familiar, so did the overall room, but then I saw her body realised \u201cwait that\u2019s my girlfriend\u201d. I was mostly in shock and just started looking through her history and what I saw confirmed that it was 100% her.  Just filled with a mixed ball of emotion I decided I should sleep, but I couldn\u2019t. \n\nSo I waited till the morning my mind going mad. Eventually I texted her confronting her about it. I got a bit aggy saying how I felt like she was cheating on me and she was saying to me that since it was the internet it wasn\u2019t cheating. In all honesty I said some nasty things and I could tell she wasn\u2019t having a good time either. Said to her that I would like her to stop posting, and if she doesn\u2019t then I didn\u2019t really want to continue things with her. She started saying loads of stuff even suggesting I join her for couple posts? In the end I realised she didn\u2019t want to stop so I ended things then and there. Haven\u2019t messaged her since and my mates are aggy at me asking what was going on. I\u2019m not going to expose her, but this is a bit much for me right now. \n\nAITA\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that the author found out their girlfriend was posting explicit content on a site called gonewild. He got upset, confronted her, and then broke up with her. He's asking if he's at fault.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The girl was posting on gonewild, which is a platform for explicit content. The author clicked on a post and realized it was her. He was upset because he thought it felt like cheating. The girl argued that it wasn't cheating because it's online. The author then told her to stop, and when she didn't, he ended the relationship.\n\nIs the author wrong? Well, cheating typically involves a betrayal in a relationship. If the couple had an agreement that she wouldn't post explicit material, then she might be violating that. But if there was no such agreement, then maybe the author's reaction is based on his own feelings rather than an actual betrayal. However, sharing explicit photos without consent can be an issue. But in this case, she was the one posting them, so it's her own content. \n\nThe key points here are communication and boundaries. The author might have felt that her actions crossed a line he wasn't comfortable with. But did he have the right to break up over it? If they hadn't discussed boundaries beforehand, maybe he should have communicated his feelings earlier instead of reacting impulsively. Also, suggesting that he should join her for couple posts might have been a red flag, but the author's immediate decision to end things might be hasty.\n\nOn the other hand, sharing explicit content online can have consequences, like it being shared further or used inappropriately. The girl might not have considered his feelings when posting, especially if she knew he was a regular user of such sites. But the author's anger and the breakup decision might be an overreaction if there was no prior discussion about boundaries.\n\nSo, considering both perspectives, the author might not be entirely in the wrong if they had an understanding or if he communicated his discomfort before. However, if there was no prior discussion, his reaction could be seen as his own issue. But since he ended the relationship immediately without trying to resolve it, maybe he's at fault for not addressing it earlier. Alternatively, the girl might be at fault for posting without considering his feelings. It's a bit of a gray area, but the author's decision to break up might be justified if he felt it was a deal-breaker. However, if he didn't set boundaries beforehand, he might share some responsibility.\n"
