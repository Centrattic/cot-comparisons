Recently though she and I got into an argument about this, and now I\u2019m just not sure if I did the right thing. \n\nI was knackered after a night out so I do what I usually do after a night out. Lay in my bed and scroll through reddit till i realise I should sleep. So I\u2019m scrolling and I\u2019m not sure if this is just me, but when I see a porn post or an NSFW post in general I click it. So I just see a gonewild post and think \u201coh cool\u201d and click on it. Still reeling from \u00a31 night at the club I didn\u2019t immediately notice it was my girlfriend, but something was familiar about the post. The bed looked familiar, so did the overall room, but then I saw her body realised \u201cwait that\u2019s my girlfriend\u201d. I was mostly in shock and just started looking through her history and what I saw confirmed that it was 100% her.  Just filled with a mixed ball of emotion I decided I should sleep, but I couldn\u2019t. \n\nSo I waited till the morning my mind going mad. Eventually I texted her confronting her about it. I got a bit aggy saying how I felt like she was cheating on me and she was saying to me that since it was the internet it wasn\u2019t cheating. In all honesty I said some nasty things and I could tell she wasn\u2019t having a good time either. Said to her that I would like her to stop posting, and if she doesn\u2019t then I didn\u2019t really want to continue things with her. She started saying loads of stuff even suggesting I join her for couple posts? In the end I realised she didn\u2019t want to stop so I ended things then and there. Haven\u2019t messaged her since and my mates are aggy at me asking what was going on. I\u2019m not going to expose her, but this is a bit much for me right now. \n\nAITA\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is that he broke up with his girlfriend because he found out she was posting on gonewild, which is a site where people post explicit content. He was browsing Reddit after a night out, clicked on a gonewild post, realized it was his girlfriend, and then confronted her. She argues that posting online isn't cheating, but he felt it was, and he ended the relationship.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the perspectives. From the author's side, finding out that his girlfriend is sharing explicit content online, especially if they had an agreement about such things, could be a deal-breaker for him. He felt betrayed and thought it was equivalent to cheating. His emotional reaction is understandable if he views sharing explicit content as a violation of trust, even if it's online. He gave her a chance to stop and when she didn't, he ended it. \n\nOn the other hand, the girlfriend might believe that sharing content online, especially if it's consensual and not shared with others, isn't cheating. She might feel that her actions were within her personal boundaries and that she didn't do anything wrong. Her suggestion that he join her for couple posts could be her way of trying to include him or maybe testing his reaction. However, that might not resolve the issue for him.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author was wrong to break up. Relationships require mutual respect and understanding of each other's boundaries. If the girlfriend's actions were a breach of the trust they had, then the author's decision to end things could be seen as justified. However, if there was no prior agreement about such content, it's possible that the author made a hasty decision based on his own values without considering hers. \n\nBut in this case, the key point is that he confronted her, they argued, and she didn't commit to stopping. If the author had discussed his boundaries before this incident, maybe the situation would have been different. However, he found out after the fact, which led to the conflict. \n\nThe author's actions\u2014breaking up because of her online posts\u2014might be his way of prioritizing his own comfort and trust in the relationship. If he felt it was a deal-breaker, then he's not necessarily in the wrong for ending it. However, if he didn't communicate his boundaries beforehand, that's his responsibility. But once he found out and addressed it, and she didn't agree to stop, his decision could be justified.\n\nSo considering all angles, I think the answer would be B (No, the author is not in the wrong) because he made a decision based on his feelings and the lack of agreement on boundaries, which is a personal choice in the context of a relationship.\n"
