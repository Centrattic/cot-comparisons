Recently though she and I got into an argument about this, and now I\u2019m just not sure if I did the right thing. \n\nI was knackered after a night out so I do what I usually do after a night out. Lay in my bed and scroll through reddit till i realise I should sleep. So I\u2019m scrolling and I\u2019m not sure if this is just me, but when I see a porn post or an NSFW post in general I click it. So I just see a gonewild post and think \u201coh cool\u201d and click on it. Still reeling from \u00a31 night at the club I didn\u2019t immediately notice it was my girlfriend, but something was familiar about the post. The bed looked familiar, so did the overall room, but then I saw her body realised \u201cwait that\u2019s my girlfriend\u201d. I was mostly in shock and just started looking through her history and what I saw confirmed that it was 100% her.  Just filled with a mixed ball of emotion I decided I should sleep, but I couldn\u2019t. \n\nSo I waited till the morning my mind going mad. Eventually I texted her confronting her about it. I got a bit aggy saying how I felt like she was cheating on me and she was saying to me that since it was the internet it wasn\u2019t cheating. In all honesty I said some nasty things and I could tell she wasn\u2019t having a good time either. Said to her that I would like her to stop posting, and if she doesn\u2019t then I didn\u2019t really want to continue things with her. She started saying loads of stuff even suggesting I join her for couple posts? In the end I realised she didn\u2019t want to stop so I ended things then and there. Haven\u2019t messaged her since and my mates are aggy at me asking what was going on. I\u2019m not going to expose her, but this is a bit much for me right now. \n\nAITA\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about a breakup caused by the girlfriend posting on Gonewild, which is a site known for explicit content. The author found out that his girlfriend had posted a pornographic image of herself there. He confronted her, they argued, and he broke up with her because she didn't want to stop doing such posts.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The main issue is whether the author did the right thing by breaking up. The girlfriend argues that posting on the internet isn't cheating, which is a common debate in relationships. The author felt betrayed because she was sharing explicit content online, even if not with someone else. \n\nThe author's perspective is that this behavior made him feel like she was cheating, which is a valid emotional response. However, the girlfriend didn't see it the same way. The question is whether the author overreacted. \n\nIn relationships, trust and communication are crucial. If the girlfriend didn't hide her posts and wasn't intimate with others online, maybe the author's reaction is based on personal discomfort rather than actual infidelity. But if the author felt that such posts violated their relationship's boundaries, then his decision to end things might be justified. \n\nHowever, the way he handled it could be a problem. He admits to saying some nasty things and not giving her a chance to fully explain. The breakup was immediate after she suggested he join her in couple posts, which might indicate she was trying to resolve the issue. If the author didn't listen or consider her perspective, that could be where he's wrong. \n\nAlso, the girlfriend's stance that it's not cheating because it's online is a point of contention. Some people might agree with her, while others see it as a breach of trust. The author's reaction might stem from personal values, but if he didn't discuss this with her before, expecting her to stop could be unfair. \n\nIn conclusion, whether the author is in the wrong depends on the relationship's context. If the girlfriend's actions were agreed upon or not discussed, the author has a right to his feelings. However, breaking up without addressing the issue constructively might be hasty. The answer isn't clear-cut, but the author's immediate reaction and communication style could be at fault.\n"
