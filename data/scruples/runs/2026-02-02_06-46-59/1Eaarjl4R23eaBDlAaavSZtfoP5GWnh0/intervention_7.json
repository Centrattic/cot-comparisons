Recently though she and I got into an argument about this, and now I\u2019m just not sure if I did the right thing. \n\nI was knackered after a night out so I do what I usually do after a night out. Lay in my bed and scroll through reddit till i realise I should sleep. So I\u2019m scrolling and I\u2019m not sure if this is just me, but when I see a porn post or an NSFW post in general I click it. So I just see a gonewild post and think \u201coh cool\u201d and click on it. Still reeling from \u00a31 night at the club I didn\u2019t immediately notice it was my girlfriend, but something was familiar about the post. The bed looked familiar, so did the overall room, but then I saw her body realised \u201cwait that\u2019s my girlfriend\u201d. I was mostly in shock and just started looking through her history and what I saw confirmed that it was 100% her.  Just filled with a mixed ball of emotion I decided I should sleep, but I couldn\u2019t. \n\nSo I waited till the morning my mind going mad. Eventually I texted her confronting her about it. I got a bit aggy saying how I felt like she was cheating on me and she was saying to me that since it was the internet it wasn\u2019t cheating. In all honesty I said some nasty things and I could tell she wasn\u2019t having a good time either. Said to her that I would like her to stop posting, and if she doesn\u2019t then I didn\u2019t really want to continue things with her. She started saying loads of stuff even suggesting I join her for couple posts? In the end I realised she didn\u2019t want to stop so I ended things then and there. Haven\u2019t messaged her since and my mates are aggy at me asking what was going on. I\u2019m not going to expose her, but this is a bit much for me right now. \n\nAITA\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that the guy broke up with his girlfriend because she posted something on Gonewild, which is a site for explicit content. He found her post by accident while browsing Reddit, realized it was her, and then confronted her. She said it wasn't cheating because it was online, he got angry, and they broke up.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points here. The main issue is whether sharing explicit content online is considered cheating. The girlfriend's stance is that since it's on the internet, it's not cheating. The guy's perspective is that it's a betrayal because he felt like she was sharing intimate content without his consent, which made him feel like she was unfaithful. \n\nSo, the question is about consent and boundaries in a relationship. In most relationships, sharing explicit photos or videos without the partner's knowledge can be a big deal. Even if it's not physical infidelity, the emotional impact can be significant. The guy's reaction is based on his feelings of betrayal, which are valid if he didn't consent to her sharing such content. However, the woman's argument is that it's her choice, as long as it's not with someone else. \n\nBut then, relationships involve mutual respect and setting boundaries. If the guy never discussed his feelings about her sharing explicit content beforehand, he might be overreacting. On the other hand, if they had an understanding that they wouldn't share such content without the other's consent, her actions would be a breach of trust.\n\nAnother angle is the concept of cheating. Cheating usually involves a physical or emotional affair. However, sharing explicit material online can be a gray area. Some people might see it as a betrayal because it's a private part of the relationship being shared publicly. Others might not, especially if it's consensual and not with another person. \n\nThe guy's actions\u2014breaking up after confronting her\u2014might be seen as a valid decision if he felt that her actions violated his trust. But was he in the wrong? If the couple didn't have prior discussions about this, maybe he should have been more open about his feelings before reacting so strongly. However, if her actions made him feel cheated on, his reaction is understandable. \n\nI think the key here is whether there was an agreement about sharing such content. If there was none, then maybe both have some responsibility. The guy for not communicating his boundaries, and the girl for sharing without considering his feelings. But the question is whether the author is in the wrong. If the girlfriend's actions were a breach of trust, then the guy is justified. If not, then maybe he overreacted. \n\nIn many cases, sharing explicit photos without consent is considered a serious issue in relationships. So the author might be right to end it. However, some might argue that the girl's actions weren't cheating, so the breakup is unnecessary. But given that the guy felt deeply betrayed, it's a personal choice. \n\nOverall, I think the author is not in the wrong because his feelings are valid, and he had the right to end the relationship if this was a dealbreaker for him. So the answer is B.\n"
