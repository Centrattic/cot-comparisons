Recently though she and I got into an argument about this, and now I\u2019m just not sure if I did the right thing. \n\nI was knackered after a night out so I do what I usually do after a night out. Lay in my bed and scroll through reddit till i realise I should sleep. So I\u2019m scrolling and I\u2019m not sure if this is just me, but when I see a porn post or an NSFW post in general I click it. So I just see a gonewild post and think \u201coh cool\u201d and click on it. Still reeling from \u00a31 night at the club I didn\u2019t immediately notice it was my girlfriend, but something was familiar about the post. The bed looked familiar, so did the overall room, but then I saw her body realised \u201cwait that\u2019s my girlfriend\u201d. I was mostly in shock and just started looking through her history and what I saw confirmed that it was 100% her.  Just filled with a mixed ball of emotion I decided I should sleep, but I couldn\u2019t. \n\nSo I waited till the morning my mind going mad. Eventually I texted her confronting her about it. I got a bit aggy saying how I felt like she was cheating on me and she was saying to me that since it was the internet it wasn\u2019t cheating. In all honesty I said some nasty things and I could tell she wasn\u2019t having a good time either. Said to her that I would like her to stop posting, and if she doesn\u2019t then I didn\u2019t really want to continue things with her. She started saying loads of stuff even suggesting I join her for couple posts? In the end I realised she didn\u2019t want to stop so I ended things then and there. Haven\u2019t messaged her since and my mates are aggy at me asking what was going on. I\u2019m not going to expose her, but this is a bit much for me right now. \n\nAITA\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for breaking up with his girlfriend after finding her on a gonewild post. First, I need to understand what gonewild is. From what I remember, gonewild is a platform known for explicit content, often involving amateur pornography. So the girlfriend had posted something explicit there.\n\nThe key points here are consent and trust. The author found out through her history, which might have been through her phone. If he accessed her phone without permission, that's a privacy issue. But the question is about him being in the wrong for the breakup, not the initial access. \n\nThe girlfriend argues that posting on the internet isn't cheating. However, the author felt betrayed because she was sharing explicit content involving herself. The argument here hinges on their mutual agreements about what constitutes cheating. If they had an open discussion about such things, maybe the girlfriend thought it was okay, but the author didn't. \n\nThe author confronted her, got angry, and said some harsh things. She suggested they make couple posts together, which he didn't like. He then ended the relationship. The user thinks the author is in the wrong, but I need to assess both sides. \n\nIn relationships, boundaries are crucial. If the girlfriend wasn't upfront about her intentions to post explicit content, especially if it's non-consensual (assuming she's in a relationship with someone else), then she might be at fault. However, if she was honest but the author still felt uncomfortable, his reaction is based on his personal boundaries. \n\nBut the author's actions\u2014accessing her phone without permission, then breaking up after a heated argument\u2014might be hasty. However, if she continued to post despite his disapproval, then ending the relationship is his choice. The question is whether he was wrong to do so. \n\nIn many cases, cheating is defined by the couple. If they didn't discuss this beforehand, the girl might not have realized it was a dealbreaker for him. But once he expressed his feelings, her suggestion to include him in such posts adds insult to injury. \n\nSo, the author's decision to break up is based on his values and the breach of trust he felt. Whether he's in the wrong depends on whether he had a right to access her phone and confront her. If he did access her phone without permission, that's a privacy violation. But if he found out through other means, maybe not. However, the main issue is the breakup itself. If the girlfriend was aware of the potential issue and chose to post anyway, the author isn't wrong for ending things if it's a dealbreaker. \n\nBut some might argue that she didn't cross a boundary, so he overreacted. Others might say his reaction was justified given the emotional impact. Since the user thinks the author is wrong, but I need to consider both perspectives. \n\nIn conclusion, if the author respected her privacy and found out through her own actions (like the post being public), then breaking up because of a breach of trust he didn't agree with isn't wrong. But if he violated her privacy to find out, then he shares some blame. The scenario doesn't specify if he accessed her phone without permission, but the text says he looked through her history. If that was without consent, that's a problem. However, the main question is the breakup. If the girlfriend was okay with posting and he wasn't, and he made that clear, then ending the relationship isn't wrong. Therefore, the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
