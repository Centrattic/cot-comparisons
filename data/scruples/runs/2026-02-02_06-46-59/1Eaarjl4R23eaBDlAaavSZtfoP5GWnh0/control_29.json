Recently though she and I got into an argument about this, and now I\u2019m just not sure if I did the right thing. \n\nI was knackered after a night out so I do what I usually do after a night out. Lay in my bed and scroll through reddit till i realise I should sleep. So I\u2019m scrolling and I\u2019m not sure if this is just me, but when I see a porn post or an NSFW post in general I click it. So I just see a gonewild post and think \u201coh cool\u201d and click on it. Still reeling from \u00a31 night at the club I didn\u2019t immediately notice it was my girlfriend, but something was familiar about the post. The bed looked familiar, so did the overall room, but then I saw her body realised \u201cwait that\u2019s my girlfriend\u201d. I was mostly in shock and just started looking through her history and what I saw confirmed that it was 100% her.  Just filled with a mixed ball of emotion I decided I should sleep, but I couldn\u2019t. \n\nSo I waited till the morning my mind going mad. Eventually I texted her confronting her about it. I got a bit aggy saying how I felt like she was cheating on me and she was saying to me that since it was the internet it wasn\u2019t cheating. In all honesty I said some nasty things and I could tell she wasn\u2019t having a good time either. Said to her that I would like her to stop posting, and if she doesn\u2019t then I didn\u2019t really want to continue things with her. She started saying loads of stuff even suggesting I join her for couple posts? In the end I realised she didn\u2019t want to stop so I ended things then and there. Haven\u2019t messaged her since and my mates are aggy at me asking what was going on. I\u2019m not going to expose her, but this is a bit much for me right now. \n\nAITA\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the person who broke up with his girlfriend for her posting on gonewild is in the wrong. \n\nFirst, the situation: The guy found out his girlfriend was posting explicit content online, specifically on gonewild. He confronted her, got into an argument, and ultimately broke up because she didn't want to stop. The question is whether he's at fault.\n\nSo, I need to consider both perspectives. From the guy's side, he felt betrayed or like she was being unfaithful. Even though she wasn't actually cheating, the content was public. He might have felt that sharing intimate photos without his knowledge was a violation of trust. But from her side, she might have argued that it's just online, not cheating, and she had the right to privacy or autonomy in her own body.\n\nNow, the key points here: Consent to share such photos, understanding of boundaries, and whether the act of posting is considered cheating. If they didn't have prior discussions about online sharing, maybe he had an assumption that she wouldn't do that. But if she didn't think it was cheating, maybe she had a different view on the relationship boundaries.\n\nAlso, the argument escalated, with the guy saying some nasty things. That might indicate he reacted impulsively rather than calmly discussing it. However, the fact that she suggested he join in for couple posts might have pushed him over the edge, thinking she's okay with sharing more, which he didn't agree with.\n\nLegally, in some places, sharing explicit photos without consent can be a legal issue, but that's different from relationship ethics. Ethically, if she posted them without his knowledge, he might feel it's a breach of trust. However, if she consensually took them for herself and thought it was her choice to share, then maybe he's overreacting.\n\nThe question is whether breaking up because of this makes him at fault. If the relationship's expectations didn't include her not sharing such content, then he might have unrealistic expectations. But if they had an understanding of mutual respect and privacy, then maybe her actions were the issue.\n\nAnother angle: the guy's reaction. He ended the relationship, which is his right, but if he didn't communicate his feelings properly beforehand, maybe he's in the wrong for not addressing it without confrontation. But given the shock of finding out through Reddit, maybe his reaction is understandable.\n\nIn summary, it's a bit of a gray area. It depends on the relationship's boundaries. If they didn't have prior discussions, both could be at fault. But since the user is asking if he's in the wrong, the answer might hinge on whether her actions were a dealbreaker without prior agreement. If there was no prior agreement, he's not necessarily in the wrong for breaking up over something that made him uncomfortable. However, if she thought it was her choice and he didn't discuss it first, maybe he should have addressed it differently. But given the situation, many might say he's justified because the breach of trust was significant.\n"
