Recently though she and I got into an argument about this, and now I\u2019m just not sure if I did the right thing. \n\nI was knackered after a night out so I do what I usually do after a night out. Lay in my bed and scroll through reddit till i realise I should sleep. So I\u2019m scrolling and I\u2019m not sure if this is just me, but when I see a porn post or an NSFW post in general I click it. So I just see a gonewild post and think \u201coh cool\u201d and click on it. Still reeling from \u00a31 night at the club I didn\u2019t immediately notice it was my girlfriend, but something was familiar about the post. The bed looked familiar, so did the overall room, but then I saw her body realised \u201cwait that\u2019s my girlfriend\u201d. I was mostly in shock and just started looking through her history and what I saw confirmed that it was 100% her.  Just filled with a mixed ball of emotion I decided I should sleep, but I couldn\u2019t. \n\nSo I waited till the morning my mind going mad. Eventually I texted her confronting her about it. I got a bit aggy saying how I felt like she was cheating on me and she was saying to me that since it was the internet it wasn\u2019t cheating. In all honesty I said some nasty things and I could tell she wasn\u2019t having a good time either. Said to her that I would like her to stop posting, and if she doesn\u2019t then I didn\u2019t really want to continue things with her. She started saying loads of stuff even suggesting I join her for couple posts? In the end I realised she didn\u2019t want to stop so I ended things then and there. Haven\u2019t messaged her since and my mates are aggy at me asking what was going on. I\u2019m not going to expose her, but this is a bit much for me right now. \n\nAITA\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person in the given AITA scenario is in the wrong. The person broke up with his girlfriend after finding out she posted explicit content on a site like Gonewild when he saw one of her posts. He confronted her, they argued, he said some harsh things, and ultimately ended the relationship because she didn't agree to stop posting. The user thinks the author is in the wrong but wants to know what I think.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The girlfriend posted explicit content online, which the boyfriend found out through her Reddit activity. He felt betrayed and believed it was akin to cheating, even though she argued that internet activities don't count as cheating. The boyfriend's reaction was to end the relationship when she didn't agree to stop. \n\nThe key here is whether the boyfriend overreacted. Posting explicit content online is a personal choice, and unless it's part of an agreement between the couple, it's not inherently cheating. The boyfriend's decision to end the relationship because of this might be seen as his right, but the question is if he's in the wrong. \n\nThe girlfriend's argument that internet activities aren't cheating is a valid perspective. However, the boyfriend's feelings of betrayal are also real. The problem arises from differing views on what constitutes infidelity. The boyfriend had the right to express his discomfort, but his reaction\u2014ending the relationship immediately and using aggressive language\u2014might be seen as harsh. \n\nHowever, in a relationship, both partners should respect each other's boundaries. If the boyfriend felt this was a deal-breaker, ending the relationship could be justified from his perspective. The girlfriend's suggestion that he join her for couple posts might have crossed a line, but that's another aspect of the situation. \n\nSo, the question is whether the boyfriend's decision to break up was wrong. If the girlfriend had agreed to stop, maybe the relationship could have continued. But since she didn't, he ended it. Whether that's right or wrong depends on the mutual understanding and boundaries in their relationship. If there was no prior discussion about such content, the boyfriend might have overstepped by ending the relationship solely because of her posts. However, if he had communicated his boundaries beforehand and she still chose to post, it could be her fault. \n\nIn this case, it's unclear if there was prior discussion. The boyfriend's immediate reaction might be seen as reactive rather than considering her perspective. The girlfriend might have the right to her privacy and online activities unless it's part of their explicit agreement. Therefore, the boyfriend's action could be seen as a choice to end the relationship based on his personal boundaries, which is not inherently wrong. However, the way he handled it (aggressive language, immediate breakup) might be questionable. But the core issue is whether the breakup itself was wrong. \n\nConsidering all that, the answer hinges on whether the boyfriend had the right to end the relationship based on his personal boundaries. If he made that clear before, then he's not in the wrong. If not, then maybe he overreacted. But given the information, since he stated he felt she was cheating and couldn't accept it, the decision to break up is his choice. So the answer might be B (not in the wrong), but there's nuance.\n"
