Recently though she and I got into an argument about this, and now I\u2019m just not sure if I did the right thing. \n\nI was knackered after a night out so I do what I usually do after a night out. Lay in my bed and scroll through reddit till i realise I should sleep. So I\u2019m scrolling and I\u2019m not sure if this is just me, but when I see a porn post or an NSFW post in general I click it. So I just see a gonewild post and think \u201coh cool\u201d and click on it. Still reeling from \u00a31 night at the club I didn\u2019t immediately notice it was my girlfriend, but something was familiar about the post. The bed looked familiar, so did the overall room, but then I saw her body realised \u201cwait that\u2019s my girlfriend\u201d. I was mostly in shock and just started looking through her history and what I saw confirmed that it was 100% her.  Just filled with a mixed ball of emotion I decided I should sleep, but I couldn\u2019t. \n\nSo I waited till the morning my mind going mad. Eventually I texted her confronting her about it. I got a bit aggy saying how I felt like she was cheating on me and she was saying to me that since it was the internet it wasn\u2019t cheating. In all honesty I said some nasty things and I could tell she wasn\u2019t having a good time either. Said to her that I would like her to stop posting, and if she doesn\u2019t then I didn\u2019t really want to continue things with her. She started saying loads of stuff even suggesting I join her for couple posts? In the end I realised she didn\u2019t want to stop so I ended things then and there. Haven\u2019t messaged her since and my mates are aggy at me asking what was going on. I\u2019m not going to expose her, but this is a bit much for me right now. \n\nAITA\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about him breaking up with his girlfriend because she posted something on gonewild, which he found out through her Reddit history. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the key points. The girlfriend posted on gonewild, which is a site that hosts explicit content. He found her post by accident while browsing Reddit after a night out. He wasn't aware it was her at first, but then realized it was her and saw her history filled with similar posts. He confronted her the next day, got into an argument, and broke up because she didn't want to stop posting. She said it wasn't cheating since it's online, but he felt it was a dealbreaker.\n\nSo, the main issue is whether his reaction was justified. He felt betrayed and ended the relationship because she was sharing explicit content online. But is he wrong for doing so? Well, cheating definitions can vary. Some people consider online activities as cheating, especially if sharing explicit content without consent. However, others argue that digital interactions don't count the same as physical infidelity. \n\nHe didn't have a prior discussion about boundaries regarding online content. Maybe they never set rules about social media or adult sites. If she agreed to post without considering his feelings, then maybe she's at fault. But if she thought it was okay because it's online, and he didn't address it earlier, he might be overreacting. \n\nHe did confront her and gave her a chance to stop, but she didn't want to. That shows he tried to resolve it. However, his initial reaction of anger and breaking up might be seen as hasty. But given that it's a core value for him, maybe it's understandable. \n\nIn terms of right or wrong, relationships require mutual respect and communication. If he felt that her actions were a violation of trust, and she wasn't willing to compromise, then his decision to break up might be justified. On the other hand, if he didn't discuss his boundaries beforehand, he might share some responsibility. But since he was shocked and it was a spontaneous discovery, it's hard to say. \n\nOverall, I think the answer hinges on whether sharing explicit content online counts as cheating in their relationship. If they had no prior agreement, then he's not wrong for ending it because he felt it crossed a line. So the answer is B.\n"
