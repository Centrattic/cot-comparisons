Recently though she and I got into an argument about this, and now I\u2019m just not sure if I did the right thing. \n\nI was knackered after a night out so I do what I usually do after a night out. Lay in my bed and scroll through reddit till i realise I should sleep. So I\u2019m scrolling and I\u2019m not sure if this is just me, but when I see a porn post or an NSFW post in general I click it. So I just see a gonewild post and think \u201coh cool\u201d and click on it. Still reeling from \u00a31 night at the club I didn\u2019t immediately notice it was my girlfriend, but something was familiar about the post. The bed looked familiar, so did the overall room, but then I saw her body realised \u201cwait that\u2019s my girlfriend\u201d. I was mostly in shock and just started looking through her history and what I saw confirmed that it was 100% her.  Just filled with a mixed ball of emotion I decided I should sleep, but I couldn\u2019t. \n\nSo I waited till the morning my mind going mad. Eventually I texted her confronting her about it. I got a bit aggy saying how I felt like she was cheating on me and she was saying to me that since it was the internet it wasn\u2019t cheating. In all honesty I said some nasty things and I could tell she wasn\u2019t having a good time either. Said to her that I would like her to stop posting, and if she doesn\u2019t then I didn\u2019t really want to continue things with her. She started saying loads of stuff even suggesting I join her for couple posts? In the end I realised she didn\u2019t want to stop so I ended things then and there. Haven\u2019t messaged her since and my mates are aggy at me asking what was going on. I\u2019m not going to expose her, but this is a bit much for me right now. \n\nAITA\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who broke up with their girlfriend for posting on Gonewild is in the wrong. The options are A (yes) or B (no). \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The boyfriend found out his girlfriend was posting explicit content online, specifically on Gonewild. He was upset, felt like she was cheating even though she didn't think so, and ended the relationship because she didn't stop. \n\nNow, considering cheating. Cheating typically involves physical or emotional infidelity. Posting explicit content on an online platform might not be cheating in a traditional sense, but it's a line that varies based on personal boundaries. The girlfriend argued it wasn't cheating because it's the internet. The boyfriend felt it was a betrayal because he associated it with infidelity.\n\nDifferent people have different views on what constitutes cheating. Some might see sharing explicit photos online as a form of emotional cheating, especially if it's done without the partner's knowledge or consent. In this case, the girlfriend didn't mention this to him before, so it's possible he felt blindsided.\n\nThe boyfriend's reaction was to confront her and give her an ultimatum. He admitted he said some harsh things. Ending the relationship because of this might be his way of protecting himself from potential further hurt, especially if he felt it was a deal-breaker.\n\nOn the other hand, the girlfriend's actions were consensual in the sense that she chose to post them. If there was no prior agreement about not posting such content, then she might not be wrong. However, the boyfriend's feelings are valid; trust is crucial in a relationship. If this breach of trust is something he can't get over, then his decision to break up isn't necessarily wrong.\n\nThe key here is about mutual expectations. If the boyfriend never discussed this with her beforehand, he can't expect her to know it's a deal-breaker. However, once he expressed his feelings, she didn't comply, leading him to end the relationship. \n\nIn terms of right or wrong, it's subjective. But since the question is whether the author is in the wrong for breaking up, the answer might depend on whether there was a prior agreement. If there wasn't, then he might be within his rights to end the relationship based on his own comfort and boundaries. \n\nHowever, some might argue that he overreacted because it's not traditional cheating. But others would support his decision if he felt it violated their relationship's terms. \n\nSo, considering all angles, the answer would be B (No), because the author acted based on his own boundaries and feelings, even if others might disagree. It's not necessarily about right or wrong, but about personal tolerance and communication.\n"
