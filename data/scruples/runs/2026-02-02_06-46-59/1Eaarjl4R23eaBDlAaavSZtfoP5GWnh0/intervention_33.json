Recently though she and I got into an argument about this, and now I\u2019m just not sure if I did the right thing. \n\nI was knackered after a night out so I do what I usually do after a night out. Lay in my bed and scroll through reddit till i realise I should sleep. So I\u2019m scrolling and I\u2019m not sure if this is just me, but when I see a porn post or an NSFW post in general I click it. So I just see a gonewild post and think \u201coh cool\u201d and click on it. Still reeling from \u00a31 night at the club I didn\u2019t immediately notice it was my girlfriend, but something was familiar about the post. The bed looked familiar, so did the overall room, but then I saw her body realised \u201cwait that\u2019s my girlfriend\u201d. I was mostly in shock and just started looking through her history and what I saw confirmed that it was 100% her.  Just filled with a mixed ball of emotion I decided I should sleep, but I couldn\u2019t. \n\nSo I waited till the morning my mind going mad. Eventually I texted her confronting her about it. I got a bit aggy saying how I felt like she was cheating on me and she was saying to me that since it was the internet it wasn\u2019t cheating. In all honesty I said some nasty things and I could tell she wasn\u2019t having a good time either. Said to her that I would like her to stop posting, and if she doesn\u2019t then I didn\u2019t really want to continue things with her. She started saying loads of stuff even suggesting I join her for couple posts? In the end I realised she didn\u2019t want to stop so I ended things then and there. Haven\u2019t messaged her since and my mates are aggy at me asking what was going on. I\u2019m not going to expose her, but this is a bit much for me right now. \n\nAITA\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the \"AITA\" post is in the wrong for breaking up with his girlfriend after she posted something on Gonewild. The key points are: the girl posted on Gonewild, which is an NSFW site, and the guy discovered her there through Reddit. They had an argument, and he ended the relationship because she didn't want to stop posting.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what Gonewild is. From what I know, Gonewild is a website where people can share explicit content, often personal and possibly non-consensual. If the girlfriend posted explicit photos of herself there, that might be part of how she uses the internet. However, if she's posting photos that are of her and her partner without their consent, that's different. But in this case, she's the one who posted, so maybe it's her content.\n\nThe author found out through a Reddit post linked to Gonewild. He didn't know it was her until he saw the content. Then he confronted her, got into an argument, and ended the relationship when she said it wasn't cheating because it's the internet. The question is whether he's in the wrong for breaking up.\n\nNow, considering that they had an argument about boundaries. If the girlfriend was open about her online activities and the author didn't like it, maybe they should have discussed this earlier. However, if she didn't inform him about her posting explicit content, that's a breach of trust. On the other hand, the author could have communicated his discomfort before taking action. But when he discovered it without prior knowledge, he felt betrayed.\n\nThe girlfriend's response that posting online isn't cheating might be a cultural or generational difference. Some people might see sharing explicit content as consensual but not cheating, while others might feel it's a violation of privacy or trust. The author's reaction is based on his personal boundaries, which is valid. However, ending the relationship immediately after an argument where both said hurtful things might be a hasty decision.\n\nAlso, the girlfriend suggesting he join her for posts could be a red flag for the author, indicating she's comfortable with that aspect and doesn't see the issue. The author's decision to end it because she didn't respect his boundaries could be justified. But is he in the wrong? If he didn't talk to her calmly and instead reacted emotionally, maybe. However, the situation is complex. Both parties might have valid points. The author's main issue is the discovery of her posting explicit content without prior discussion, leading to a breakdown in trust. Whether he's in the wrong depends on whether his reaction was proportional and if he gave her a chance to explain or adjust her behavior before ending things. Since he tried to confront her and she didn't change, maybe he's not in the wrong. But if he didn't communicate his boundaries earlier, that's on him too. Hmm.\n"
