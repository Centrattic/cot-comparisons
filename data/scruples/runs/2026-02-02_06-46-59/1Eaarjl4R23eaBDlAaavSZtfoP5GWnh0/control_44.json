Recently though she and I got into an argument about this, and now I\u2019m just not sure if I did the right thing. \n\nI was knackered after a night out so I do what I usually do after a night out. Lay in my bed and scroll through reddit till i realise I should sleep. So I\u2019m scrolling and I\u2019m not sure if this is just me, but when I see a porn post or an NSFW post in general I click it. So I just see a gonewild post and think \u201coh cool\u201d and click on it. Still reeling from \u00a31 night at the club I didn\u2019t immediately notice it was my girlfriend, but something was familiar about the post. The bed looked familiar, so did the overall room, but then I saw her body realised \u201cwait that\u2019s my girlfriend\u201d. I was mostly in shock and just started looking through her history and what I saw confirmed that it was 100% her.  Just filled with a mixed ball of emotion I decided I should sleep, but I couldn\u2019t. \n\nSo I waited till the morning my mind going mad. Eventually I texted her confronting her about it. I got a bit aggy saying how I felt like she was cheating on me and she was saying to me that since it was the internet it wasn\u2019t cheating. In all honesty I said some nasty things and I could tell she wasn\u2019t having a good time either. Said to her that I would like her to stop posting, and if she doesn\u2019t then I didn\u2019t really want to continue things with her. She started saying loads of stuff even suggesting I join her for couple posts? In the end I realised she didn\u2019t want to stop so I ended things then and there. Haven\u2019t messaged her since and my mates are aggy at me asking what was going on. I\u2019m not going to expose her, but this is a bit much for me right now. \n\nAITA\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is they broke up with their girlfriend because they found out she was posting on gonewild, which is a subreddit for explicit content. \n\nFirst, the key points: The girlfriend was posting explicit content on gonewild, and the author saw it. They confronted her, there was an argument, and he broke up because she didn't want to stop. The girlfriend argues that since it was online, it's not cheating. The author felt it was a betrayal.\n\nNow, I need to consider if the author is right to break up. Cheating usually involves infidelity, but in this case, it's about sharing explicit content. Is sharing such content considered cheating if there's no physical or emotional infidelity involved? The girlfriend might see it as her choice to share content online, which isn't directly cheating. However, the author might feel that sharing explicit photos is a violation of trust or intimacy, especially without their consent.\n\nConsent is a big factor here. If the girlfriend posted the photos without the author's knowledge, then it's a breach of trust. Even if she's the one who took the photos, sharing them publicly without the partner's consent could be seen as crossing a boundary. The author had a right to feel upset, especially if they had discussed boundaries about such content before.\n\nAnother angle: The girlfriend suggested making couple posts together. That might imply she was open to sharing content involving both of them, but the issue here is she was posting alone. Maybe the author didn't want that. The key is whether there was mutual agreement on what each partner considers acceptable behavior online.\n\nIn relationships, boundaries vary. What's okay for one person might not be for another. The author's decision to end the relationship because she didn't agree to stop might be his prerogative if he values those boundaries. However, some might argue that breaking up over this is harsh, especially if there's no actual infidelity. \n\nBut considering the emotional impact, the author's reaction is understandable. He felt betrayed and couldn't reconcile with her continuing the behavior. The girlfriend's stance that it's not cheating because it's online might be a point of contention. Different people have different values here. \n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? If the relationship had no prior discussion about online content boundaries, it's hard to say. If the girlfriend was clear that she didn't want to share such content, and he did it anyway, but she didn't mention it until he found out, that's another issue. But given the scenario, the author acted based on his feelings of betrayal once he discovered it. Since breaking up is a personal decision, and if the core issue is about trust and consent, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong for ending the relationship when his boundaries weren't respected.\n"
