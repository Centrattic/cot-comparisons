Recently though she and I got into an argument about this, and now I\u2019m just not sure if I did the right thing. \n\nI was knackered after a night out so I do what I usually do after a night out. Lay in my bed and scroll through reddit till i realise I should sleep. So I\u2019m scrolling and I\u2019m not sure if this is just me, but when I see a porn post or an NSFW post in general I click it. So I just see a gonewild post and think \u201coh cool\u201d and click on it. Still reeling from \u00a31 night at the club I didn\u2019t immediately notice it was my girlfriend, but something was familiar about the post. The bed looked familiar, so did the overall room, but then I saw her body realised \u201cwait that\u2019s my girlfriend\u201d. I was mostly in shock and just started looking through her history and what I saw confirmed that it was 100% her.  Just filled with a mixed ball of emotion I decided I should sleep, but I couldn\u2019t. \n\nSo I waited till the morning my mind going mad. Eventually I texted her confronting her about it. I got a bit aggy saying how I felt like she was cheating on me and she was saying to me that since it was the internet it wasn\u2019t cheating. In all honesty I said some nasty things and I could tell she wasn\u2019t having a good time either. Said to her that I would like her to stop posting, and if she doesn\u2019t then I didn\u2019t really want to continue things with her. She started saying loads of stuff even suggesting I join her for couple posts? In the end I realised she didn\u2019t want to stop so I ended things then and there. Haven\u2019t messaged her since and my mates are aggy at me asking what was going on. I\u2019m not going to expose her, but this is a bit much for me right now. \n\nAITA\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for breaking up with his girlfriend after she posted a Gonewild photo. First, I need to understand the situation clearly.\n\nThe girlfriend posted a sexually explicit photo of herself on Gonewild, which the author discovered. He confronted her, they argued, and he broke up with her because she didn't want to stop posting such content. The key issue here is whether sharing explicit photos online is considered cheating. The girlfriend argues it's not cheating because it's on the internet, but the author felt betrayed and ended the relationship.\n\nNow, considering relationship boundaries and consent. In many relationships, sharing explicit photos without the partner's knowledge or consent can be a deal-breaker. Even if the girlfriend didn't have a physical affair, the act of sharing intimate content without the partner's agreement might be seen as a breach of trust. However, the definition of cheating can vary between couples, and some might not see online content as infidelity. \n\nThe author's reaction is influenced by his personal feelings of betrayal and the emotional impact of seeing his partner's explicit photos. He did confront her, and when she didn't agree to stop, he ended the relationship. That seems like a decision based on his values and what he's comfortable with. \n\nOn the other hand, the girlfriend's perspective is that sharing such content online isn't cheating. If the author didn't agree with that, then ending the relationship might be his way of setting a boundary. It's important to note that both parties have the right to their own boundaries and values. The author isn't in the wrong if he chose to end the relationship because he couldn't accept her actions. The choice to end a relationship based on differing values doesn't make someone wrong. \n\nSo, the answer would be B (No), the author isn't in the wrong because he made a decision based on his own comfort and the boundaries he set in the relationship.\n"
