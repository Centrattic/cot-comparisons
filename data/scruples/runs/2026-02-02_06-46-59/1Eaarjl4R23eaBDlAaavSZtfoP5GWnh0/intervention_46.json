Recently though she and I got into an argument about this, and now I\u2019m just not sure if I did the right thing. \n\nI was knackered after a night out so I do what I usually do after a night out. Lay in my bed and scroll through reddit till i realise I should sleep. So I\u2019m scrolling and I\u2019m not sure if this is just me, but when I see a porn post or an NSFW post in general I click it. So I just see a gonewild post and think \u201coh cool\u201d and click on it. Still reeling from \u00a31 night at the club I didn\u2019t immediately notice it was my girlfriend, but something was familiar about the post. The bed looked familiar, so did the overall room, but then I saw her body realised \u201cwait that\u2019s my girlfriend\u201d. I was mostly in shock and just started looking through her history and what I saw confirmed that it was 100% her.  Just filled with a mixed ball of emotion I decided I should sleep, but I couldn\u2019t. \n\nSo I waited till the morning my mind going mad. Eventually I texted her confronting her about it. I got a bit aggy saying how I felt like she was cheating on me and she was saying to me that since it was the internet it wasn\u2019t cheating. In all honesty I said some nasty things and I could tell she wasn\u2019t having a good time either. Said to her that I would like her to stop posting, and if she doesn\u2019t then I didn\u2019t really want to continue things with her. She started saying loads of stuff even suggesting I join her for couple posts? In the end I realised she didn\u2019t want to stop so I ended things then and there. Haven\u2019t messaged her since and my mates are aggy at me asking what was going on. I\u2019m not going to expose her, but this is a bit much for me right now. \n\nAITA\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for breaking up with his girlfriend after she posted on Gonewild. First, I need to understand the situation.\n\nThe guy found a post on Reddit's Gonewild (which is adult content) that his girlfriend was part of. He didn't realize it was her at first but then he did. He confronted her, got into an argument, and broke up because she didn't want to stop posting. He says he felt like she was cheating, but she argues that online activity isn't cheating. The user thinks the author might be wrong.\n\nSo, the main question is whether he was justified in breaking up. Let's consider the factors. Cheating is typically about physical infidelity, but some people have boundaries around sharing intimate content online. If they had an agreement that she wouldn't do that, then his reaction makes sense. However, if there was no prior discussion about such boundaries, he might be overreacting. \n\nAlso, his approach\u2014confronting her in a aggy (aggressive?) way and making negative comments\u2014could be seen as harsh. She might not have realized how much this would affect him. The fact that she suggested doing couple posts might have pushed him over the edge, but that's a red flag for him.\n\nOn the other hand, sharing explicit content without consent is a big deal. Even if it's online, it can lead to privacy issues and breaches of trust. If he felt this violated their relationship's boundaries, breaking up is his right. However, if there was no clear boundary set before, maybe he should have addressed it earlier rather than reacting this way.\n\nI think the key points are: 1) Did they establish boundaries beforehand? 2) Was his reaction proportionate? 3) Is sharing such content a dealbreaker for him? \n\nSince the user says they were going strong until this, maybe there was an unspoken expectation. His breaking up is a personal choice, but if he didn't communicate his boundaries earlier, the blame might not be entirely on her. However, in relationships, both partners have responsibilities in setting expectations. \n\nSo, the answer isn't clear-cut. If he felt violated, it's not entirely his fault. But if the issue came up suddenly without prior discussion, maybe he's in the wrong for not addressing it sooner. The user's initial thought is that he's wrong, but I'm leaning towards B (not in the wrong) because sharing explicit content without consent is a serious breach of trust, and ending the relationship is a personal choice.\n"
