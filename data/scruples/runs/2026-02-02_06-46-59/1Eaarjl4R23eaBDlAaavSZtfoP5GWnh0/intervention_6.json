Recently though she and I got into an argument about this, and now I\u2019m just not sure if I did the right thing. \n\nI was knackered after a night out so I do what I usually do after a night out. Lay in my bed and scroll through reddit till i realise I should sleep. So I\u2019m scrolling and I\u2019m not sure if this is just me, but when I see a porn post or an NSFW post in general I click it. So I just see a gonewild post and think \u201coh cool\u201d and click on it. Still reeling from \u00a31 night at the club I didn\u2019t immediately notice it was my girlfriend, but something was familiar about the post. The bed looked familiar, so did the overall room, but then I saw her body realised \u201cwait that\u2019s my girlfriend\u201d. I was mostly in shock and just started looking through her history and what I saw confirmed that it was 100% her.  Just filled with a mixed ball of emotion I decided I should sleep, but I couldn\u2019t. \n\nSo I waited till the morning my mind going mad. Eventually I texted her confronting her about it. I got a bit aggy saying how I felt like she was cheating on me and she was saying to me that since it was the internet it wasn\u2019t cheating. In all honesty I said some nasty things and I could tell she wasn\u2019t having a good time either. Said to her that I would like her to stop posting, and if she doesn\u2019t then I didn\u2019t really want to continue things with her. She started saying loads of stuff even suggesting I join her for couple posts? In the end I realised she didn\u2019t want to stop so I ended things then and there. Haven\u2019t messaged her since and my mates are aggy at me asking what was going on. I\u2019m not going to expose her, but this is a bit much for me right now. \n\nAITA\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's dive into this situation. The user is asking if the person who broke up with his girlfriend for posting on gonewild is in the wrong. Let me start by understanding the scenario.\n\nFirst, the guy found his girlfriend's posts on a site like Gonewild, which is known for adult content. He confronted her, and she argued that since it's online, it's not cheating. The guy felt hurt and ended the relationship because she didn't want to stop posting. The user's opinion is that the author (the guy) is in the wrong, but they want others' perspectives.\n\nHmm, so the key points here are: the guy found out about her posts, felt cheated on, and broke up. She didn't see it as cheating. Now, the question is whether the guy was wrong to end the relationship.\n\nLet me consider the definitions of cheating. Traditionally, cheating involves a physical or emotional affair. However, in modern relationships, boundaries can be set around sharing content online. If the couple had an agreement about what constitutes cheating, that's one thing. But if they didn't, the guy's feelings are valid because he felt betrayed. \n\nBut wait, she was the one who posted the content. If he wasn't aware of her online activity beforehand, maybe he should have discussed boundaries. However, it's also her choice to share such content. If she didn't inform him, that's on her. The guy's reaction was based on his emotional response. \n\nAnother angle: the guy confronted her, but she didn't take it seriously, suggesting they do couple posts together. That might have pushed him to end things. He might have acted impulsively, but his feelings are genuine. \n\nIs it his fault for breaking up? If the relationship had mutual boundaries that weren't communicated, both could be at fault. But since he ended it because of her actions, the responsibility might be on her. However, the guy's decision to break up is his choice, not necessarily wrong. \n\nI think the main issue is whether the act of posting on gonewild counts as cheating. If the guy felt it was cheating, then his reaction is about his boundaries. But if she didn't see it that way, then the disagreement led to the breakup. \n\nSo, who's at fault? The guy had the right to end things if he felt uncomfortable. She had the right to post if it's not against their agreement. If there was no prior discussion, both might be at fault. But the user's question is if the author (the guy) is in the wrong. \n\nIn the end, the guy's decision is his to make if her actions made him feel disrespected. So, maybe he's not in the wrong for breaking up. But if he didn't talk about boundaries first, maybe he's partly at fault. However, the situation isn't clear on prior communication. \n\nConsidering all that, I think the answer is B (No, the author is not in the wrong) because he had the right to end the relationship if her actions violated his personal boundaries, even if she disagreed.\n"
