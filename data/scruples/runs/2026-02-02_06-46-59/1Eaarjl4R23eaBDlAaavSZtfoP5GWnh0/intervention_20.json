Recently though she and I got into an argument about this, and now I\u2019m just not sure if I did the right thing. \n\nI was knackered after a night out so I do what I usually do after a night out. Lay in my bed and scroll through reddit till i realise I should sleep. So I\u2019m scrolling and I\u2019m not sure if this is just me, but when I see a porn post or an NSFW post in general I click it. So I just see a gonewild post and think \u201coh cool\u201d and click on it. Still reeling from \u00a31 night at the club I didn\u2019t immediately notice it was my girlfriend, but something was familiar about the post. The bed looked familiar, so did the overall room, but then I saw her body realised \u201cwait that\u2019s my girlfriend\u201d. I was mostly in shock and just started looking through her history and what I saw confirmed that it was 100% her.  Just filled with a mixed ball of emotion I decided I should sleep, but I couldn\u2019t. \n\nSo I waited till the morning my mind going mad. Eventually I texted her confronting her about it. I got a bit aggy saying how I felt like she was cheating on me and she was saying to me that since it was the internet it wasn\u2019t cheating. In all honesty I said some nasty things and I could tell she wasn\u2019t having a good time either. Said to her that I would like her to stop posting, and if she doesn\u2019t then I didn\u2019t really want to continue things with her. She started saying loads of stuff even suggesting I join her for couple posts? In the end I realised she didn\u2019t want to stop so I ended things then and there. Haven\u2019t messaged her since and my mates are aggy at me asking what was going on. I\u2019m not going to expose her, but this is a bit much for me right now. \n\nAITA\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is that the guy broke up with his girlfriend because he found out she was posting on Gonewild, which he considers cheating. The question is whether he's in the wrong for doing that.\n\nFirst, I need to understand both sides. The guy found his girlfriend's explicit posts on a site, which he interpreted as cheating. He confronted her, she didn't agree, and he broke up with her. He's now questioning if he was wrong to do so.\n\nCheating definitions vary. Some people consider sharing explicit content online as cheating because it's a betrayal of trust. Others might see it as not cheating since there's no physical act involved. The girlfriend here argues that since it's online, it's not cheating, and even suggests they do couple posts together. That's a red flag for the guy, leading him to end the relationship.\n\nThe guy's actions: he was upset, confronted her, maybe harshly, and then broke up. He admits he said some nasty things. But he's also clear that her behavior made him uncomfortable and he wanted it to stop. She didn't comply, so he ended things. \n\nNow, is he in the wrong? Well, it depends on mutual boundaries. If they didn't discuss their expectations about online behavior beforehand, both might have different views. The guy might have the right to set boundaries in the relationship. If he found out she was doing something he found unacceptable, and she refused to stop, ending the relationship is a valid choice, even if it's painful. \n\nBut maybe he overreacted? If the girlfriend wasn't cheating in the traditional sense, but just sharing content, and he didn't communicate his discomfort earlier, maybe he should have handled it differently. However, the situation is that he felt betrayed, and his reaction is based on his feelings. \n\nIn relationships, trust and communication are key. If the guy felt that her actions were a breach of trust, then his decision to end it isn't necessarily wrong. The girlfriend's suggestion to do couple posts might have been the last straw. \n\nSo, considering all that, the answer is likely B\u2014No, the author isn't in the wrong. He made a tough decision based on his values and the boundaries he set. The girlfriend's actions violated his trust, and he chose to end the relationship when she didn't respect his boundaries.\n"
