Recently though she and I got into an argument about this, and now I\u2019m just not sure if I did the right thing. \n\nI was knackered after a night out so I do what I usually do after a night out. Lay in my bed and scroll through reddit till i realise I should sleep. So I\u2019m scrolling and I\u2019m not sure if this is just me, but when I see a porn post or an NSFW post in general I click it. So I just see a gonewild post and think \u201coh cool\u201d and click on it. Still reeling from \u00a31 night at the club I didn\u2019t immediately notice it was my girlfriend, but something was familiar about the post. The bed looked familiar, so did the overall room, but then I saw her body realised \u201cwait that\u2019s my girlfriend\u201d. I was mostly in shock and just started looking through her history and what I saw confirmed that it was 100% her.  Just filled with a mixed ball of emotion I decided I should sleep, but I couldn\u2019t. \n\nSo I waited till the morning my mind going mad. Eventually I texted her confronting her about it. I got a bit aggy saying how I felt like she was cheating on me and she was saying to me that since it was the internet it wasn\u2019t cheating. In all honesty I said some nasty things and I could tell she wasn\u2019t having a good time either. Said to her that I would like her to stop posting, and if she doesn\u2019t then I didn\u2019t really want to continue things with her. She started saying loads of stuff even suggesting I join her for couple posts? In the end I realised she didn\u2019t want to stop so I ended things then and there. Haven\u2019t messaged her since and my mates are aggy at me asking what was going on. I\u2019m not going to expose her, but this is a bit much for me right now. \n\nAITA\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the person who broke up with his girlfriend for posting on Gonewild is in the wrong. Let me start by understanding the situation.\n\nFirst, the guy found out his girlfriend had posted something on Gonewild, which is a site for explicit content. He didn't know it was her at first, but after looking through her history, he realized. He confronted her, they argued, and he broke up because she didn't want to stop. He's asking if he's the asshole here.\n\nNow, the user thinks the author is in the wrong. But I need to evaluate both sides. Let's break it down.\n\nOn one hand, the girlfriend posted explicit content online. The question is whether that constitutes cheating. Some people might say that sharing such content isn't cheating, especially if it's not with someone else. But others might feel it's a breach of trust or something they're uncomfortable with in a relationship. The guy felt like she was cheating because it was on the internet, but she disagreed. That's a key point. He said she even suggested they could do couple posts together, which might indicate she's not taking his feelings seriously.\n\nOn the other hand, the guy found this out by snooping through her phone or history, which isn't great. Privacy is important, so maybe he shouldn't have looked without her permission. But he might argue that he had a right to know if she was doing something that made him uncomfortable. However, breaking up immediately after confronting her might be hasty. He did say he said some nasty things during the argument, which could have contributed to the conflict.\n\nThe main issue here is consent and boundaries. If the couple had discussed their expectations about online activities beforehand, this might have been avoided. Since they didn't, the guy felt betrayed even though she didn't. But his reaction\u2014snooping, then breaking up\u2014might not be the healthiest approach. Ending a relationship over something that isn't traditionally considered cheating could be seen as overreacting. However, relationships are about mutual respect and comfort. If she's posting things that make him uncomfortable, and she's not willing to compromise, maybe he's justified in ending it.\n\nBut is he in the wrong? Well, if he didn't discuss his feelings about such content with her before finding out, maybe he shares some responsibility. He could have addressed the issue earlier instead of letting it escalate. However, she also didn't consider his feelings when posting online. Her suggesting couple posts might have been a way to dismiss his concerns, which could be hurtful.\n\nIn the end, it's a judgment call. Some might say he's right to prioritize his comfort and set boundaries, while others might think he overreacted. But since the question is whether he's in the wrong (AITA), the answer hinges on whether his actions were justified. If the community generally considers sharing explicit content on such sites not cheating unless agreed otherwise, then the guy might be seen as the asshole for breaking up over it. But if respecting mutual boundaries is key, then he's justified. I think there's a balance here. The fact that she didn't want to stop and suggested couple posts might show she's not taking his feelings seriously, so his decision to end it isn't necessarily wrong. However, his initial snooping could be a point against him. But maybe the bigger issue is the lack of communication both ways. I'm not entirely sure. Maybe the answer is B (not in the wrong) because he had valid concerns and she wasn't willing to accommodate them. But others might argue A because he didn't discuss it before assuming she was cheating.\n"
