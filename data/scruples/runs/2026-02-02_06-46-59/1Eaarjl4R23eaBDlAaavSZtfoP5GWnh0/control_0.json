Recently though she and I got into an argument about this, and now I\u2019m just not sure if I did the right thing. \n\nI was knackered after a night out so I do what I usually do after a night out. Lay in my bed and scroll through reddit till i realise I should sleep. So I\u2019m scrolling and I\u2019m not sure if this is just me, but when I see a porn post or an NSFW post in general I click it. So I just see a gonewild post and think \u201coh cool\u201d and click on it. Still reeling from \u00a31 night at the club I didn\u2019t immediately notice it was my girlfriend, but something was familiar about the post. The bed looked familiar, so did the overall room, but then I saw her body realised \u201cwait that\u2019s my girlfriend\u201d. I was mostly in shock and just started looking through her history and what I saw confirmed that it was 100% her.  Just filled with a mixed ball of emotion I decided I should sleep, but I couldn\u2019t. \n\nSo I waited till the morning my mind going mad. Eventually I texted her confronting her about it. I got a bit aggy saying how I felt like she was cheating on me and she was saying to me that since it was the internet it wasn\u2019t cheating. In all honesty I said some nasty things and I could tell she wasn\u2019t having a good time either. Said to her that I would like her to stop posting, and if she doesn\u2019t then I didn\u2019t really want to continue things with her. She started saying loads of stuff even suggesting I join her for couple posts? In the end I realised she didn\u2019t want to stop so I ended things then and there. Haven\u2019t messaged her since and my mates are aggy at me asking what was going on. I\u2019m not going to expose her, but this is a bit much for me right now. \n\nAITA\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who broke up with his girlfriend for posting on GoWild is in the wrong. \n\nFirst, the situation: The girlfriend posted explicit content online, which the boyfriend found out about through her Reddit history. He confronted her, they argued, and he ended the relationship because she didn't want to stop posting. The key issue here is whether her actions constitute cheating or betrayal.\n\nThe girlfriend argues that since it's the internet, it's not cheating. But the boyfriend feels like it's a breach of trust. The question is about whether he was right to break up. \n\nLegally, cheating usually involves physical infidelity, but in relationships, trust and boundaries are subjective. Some people might consider sharing explicit content without the partner's consent as a form of betrayal, even if it's online. Others might not see it as cheating but still view it as a violation of privacy or trust. \n\nThe boyfriend's reaction is based on his feelings of betrayal. He felt she was being dishonest by not telling him about these posts. If they had discussed boundaries beforehand, maybe the outcome would be different. But since she didn't stop, he decided to end the relationship. \n\nIn terms of right or wrong, it's complex. The boyfriend's decision to break up is his prerogative if he feels the trust is broken. However, whether he's \"in the wrong\" depends on societal standards. Some might argue that he overreacted, while others support his decision to prioritize his emotional well-being. \n\nThe girlfriend's suggestion to do couple posts together might have escalated the situation. But the core issue is about mutual respect and boundaries. If the boyfriend couldn't accept her actions, ending the relationship is a valid choice. \n\nSo, the answer hinges on whether the action of posting explicit content online is considered a betrayal. Since it's not a clear-cut legal or ethical violation, it's more about personal values. Therefore, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong for making that choice.\n"
