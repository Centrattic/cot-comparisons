Recently though she and I got into an argument about this, and now I\u2019m just not sure if I did the right thing. \n\nI was knackered after a night out so I do what I usually do after a night out. Lay in my bed and scroll through reddit till i realise I should sleep. So I\u2019m scrolling and I\u2019m not sure if this is just me, but when I see a porn post or an NSFW post in general I click it. So I just see a gonewild post and think \u201coh cool\u201d and click on it. Still reeling from \u00a31 night at the club I didn\u2019t immediately notice it was my girlfriend, but something was familiar about the post. The bed looked familiar, so did the overall room, but then I saw her body realised \u201cwait that\u2019s my girlfriend\u201d. I was mostly in shock and just started looking through her history and what I saw confirmed that it was 100% her.  Just filled with a mixed ball of emotion I decided I should sleep, but I couldn\u2019t. \n\nSo I waited till the morning my mind going mad. Eventually I texted her confronting her about it. I got a bit aggy saying how I felt like she was cheating on me and she was saying to me that since it was the internet it wasn\u2019t cheating. In all honesty I said some nasty things and I could tell she wasn\u2019t having a good time either. Said to her that I would like her to stop posting, and if she doesn\u2019t then I didn\u2019t really want to continue things with her. She started saying loads of stuff even suggesting I join her for couple posts? In the end I realised she didn\u2019t want to stop so I ended things then and there. Haven\u2019t messaged her since and my mates are aggy at me asking what was going on. I\u2019m not going to expose her, but this is a bit much for me right now. \n\nAITA\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that the author found out their girlfriend was posting explicit content on a site called Gonewild. He got upset, confronted her, and ended the relationship because she didn't agree that it was cheating and even suggested they do couple posts together. The user is asking if the author is at fault.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The girlfriend posted something explicit online, which the author discovered. The author felt this was a betrayal and ended the relationship. The girlfriend's stance was that posting online isn't cheating, which the author didn't agree with. \n\nNow, whether the author is in the wrong depends on several factors. One is the definition of cheating. Some people might see posting explicit content as cheating, especially if it's done without the partner's knowledge. Others might not, as it's not physical infidelity. The author's reaction was anger and ending the relationship, which could be seen as a valid response if he felt violated. However, the way he handled the confrontation\u2014being aggressive and not communicating calmly\u2014might have been a mistake. \n\nAnother angle is consent and transparency. If the girlfriend didn't hide her posts before and the author wasn't aware, maybe there's an issue of secrecy. But if she didn't know he was looking through her history, then maybe the fault isn't entirely hers. The author's actions in checking her history could be a privacy issue, depending on their agreement. \n\nAlso, the girlfriend's suggestion to do couple posts might have made the author feel pressured, leading to the breakup. The author's decision to end things because she wouldn't stop could be justified if he felt it was a deal-breaker. However, ending a relationship abruptly after an argument without trying to resolve it might not be the healthiest approach. \n\nIt's a bit of a gray area. The author had valid reasons to feel hurt, but his reaction's intensity and the method of confronting her could be problematic. On the other hand, the girlfriend's actions might have crossed a boundary that the author didn't agree with. \n\nConsidering all this, maybe the author isn't entirely in the wrong because he acted based on his feelings. But he might have handled it poorly. However, the question is whether he's \"in the wrong,\" which usually implies a moral or ethical fault. If the girlfriend's actions were consensual and not agreed upon, the author has a right to his feelings. So maybe the answer is B, he's not in the wrong. But some might argue that he overreacted, making him at least partially responsible. Hmm, tricky.\n"
