Recently though she and I got into an argument about this, and now I\u2019m just not sure if I did the right thing. \n\nI was knackered after a night out so I do what I usually do after a night out. Lay in my bed and scroll through reddit till i realise I should sleep. So I\u2019m scrolling and I\u2019m not sure if this is just me, but when I see a porn post or an NSFW post in general I click it. So I just see a gonewild post and think \u201coh cool\u201d and click on it. Still reeling from \u00a31 night at the club I didn\u2019t immediately notice it was my girlfriend, but something was familiar about the post. The bed looked familiar, so did the overall room, but then I saw her body realised \u201cwait that\u2019s my girlfriend\u201d. I was mostly in shock and just started looking through her history and what I saw confirmed that it was 100% her.  Just filled with a mixed ball of emotion I decided I should sleep, but I couldn\u2019t. \n\nSo I waited till the morning my mind going mad. Eventually I texted her confronting her about it. I got a bit aggy saying how I felt like she was cheating on me and she was saying to me that since it was the internet it wasn\u2019t cheating. In all honesty I said some nasty things and I could tell she wasn\u2019t having a good time either. Said to her that I would like her to stop posting, and if she doesn\u2019t then I didn\u2019t really want to continue things with her. She started saying loads of stuff even suggesting I join her for couple posts? In the end I realised she didn\u2019t want to stop so I ended things then and there. Haven\u2019t messaged her since and my mates are aggy at me asking what was going on. I\u2019m not going to expose her, but this is a bit much for me right now. \n\nAITA\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The person is asking if they're in the wrong for breaking up with their girlfriend because she posted on Gonewild. First, I need to understand the situation.\n\nSo, the author found their girlfriend's post on a site like Gonewild, which is known for adult content. They clicked on it, realized it was her, checked her history and confirmed it was her. Then they confronted her, got into an argument, and broke up because she didn't want to stop posting. The question is whether the author was in the wrong.\n\nLet me break this down. The key points are:\n\n1. The girlfriend was posting her own content online, which the author found out about. The author felt it was like cheating because she was in explicit content. The girlfriend argued that since it's the internet, it's not cheating. The author then ended the relationship because she didn't stop.\n\nCheating typically involves infidelity or violating trust. But in this case, the girlfriend wasn't physically cheating; she was sharing explicit content, which is different. However, in a relationship, sharing explicit photos can be a violation of trust, especially without the partner's consent. The author might feel that this compromises the relationship's integrity.\n\nThe girlfriend's perspective is that since it's online and not involving another person, it's not cheating. But the author clearly felt hurt and betrayed. The problem is whether the author overreacted. \n\nThe author's actions: they confronted her, got angry, and ended the relationship. They admitted to saying nasty things. The girlfriend suggested they do couple posts together, which might have been an attempt to reconcile or explain her side. The author decided to end things because she wouldn't stop.\n\nIs the author at fault for breaking up? Well, relationships require mutual respect and boundaries. If the author never discussed their stance on sharing explicit content before, and the girlfriend didn't know that was a dealbreaker, then the author might be at fault for not being upfront. However, the girlfriend's actions could be seen as a breach of trust, especially if the author found it offensive or felt it was equivalent to cheating. \n\nOn the other hand, the girlfriend might have thought she was in the right, sharing her own content without involving others. The author might not have communicated their discomfort beforehand, making the breakup a result of a lack of communication rather than the girlfriend's fault.\n\nBut since the author is the one who ended the relationship, the question is whether their reaction was justified. If the girlfriend's actions violated the author's trust and boundaries, then the breakup is justified. However, if the author didn't discuss their boundaries and then broke up suddenly, they might be at fault for not addressing the issue earlier.\n\nIn this case, the author found out through a discovery rather than a conversation. They might have a right to feel betrayed, but if they never addressed their feelings about her online activity, then the breakup could be seen as a result of their own lack of communication. Alternatively, the girlfriend might have a right to share her content if that's what she's comfortable with, but it's a mutual decision in a relationship.\n\nSo, considering all that, the author's decision to break up might be their way of protecting themselves from ongoing discomfort. But if they didn't talk about it first and just left, maybe they're partially at fault. However, the girlfriend's refusal to stop might be the main issue here. Since consent and mutual respect are key in a relationship, if the author can't accept her actions, breaking up is their choice. So the answer might be B (Not in the wrong) because the author stood up for their boundaries, even if they could have communicated better. But maybe there's a middle ground where they could have discussed it more. However, given the scenario, the author's action was to end the relationship because of a fundamental disagreement, which is their right. Therefore, the answer is B.\n"
