Recently though she and I got into an argument about this, and now I\u2019m just not sure if I did the right thing. \n\nI was knackered after a night out so I do what I usually do after a night out. Lay in my bed and scroll through reddit till i realise I should sleep. So I\u2019m scrolling and I\u2019m not sure if this is just me, but when I see a porn post or an NSFW post in general I click it. So I just see a gonewild post and think \u201coh cool\u201d and click on it. Still reeling from \u00a31 night at the club I didn\u2019t immediately notice it was my girlfriend, but something was familiar about the post. The bed looked familiar, so did the overall room, but then I saw her body realised \u201cwait that\u2019s my girlfriend\u201d. I was mostly in shock and just started looking through her history and what I saw confirmed that it was 100% her.  Just filled with a mixed ball of emotion I decided I should sleep, but I couldn\u2019t. \n\nSo I waited till the morning my mind going mad. Eventually I texted her confronting her about it. I got a bit aggy saying how I felt like she was cheating on me and she was saying to me that since it was the internet it wasn\u2019t cheating. In all honesty I said some nasty things and I could tell she wasn\u2019t having a good time either. Said to her that I would like her to stop posting, and if she doesn\u2019t then I didn\u2019t really want to continue things with her. She started saying loads of stuff even suggesting I join her for couple posts? In the end I realised she didn\u2019t want to stop so I ended things then and there. Haven\u2019t messaged her since and my mates are aggy at me asking what was going on. I\u2019m not going to expose her, but this is a bit much for me right now. \n\nAITA\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who broke up with their girlfriend for posting on Gonewild was in the wrong. The options are A for yes, B for no.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The guy found out his girlfriend was posting explicit content online on a site like Gonewild. He confronted her, they had an argument, and he ended the relationship because she didn't want to stop. The question is whether he's at fault.\n\nSo, what's the key here? Well, cheating typically involves physical or emotional infidelity. Sharing explicit photos online might be a different issue. In some relationships, posting explicit content without the partner's consent could be a breach of trust. However, the girlfriend argues that since it's online, it's not cheating. But is that a valid argument?\n\nThe guy felt violated and betrayed, which is a legitimate emotional response. If he didn't want her to be sharing such content, especially if she's doing it on a public or explicit site, then his reaction is understandable. The problem is that the definition of cheating varies. Some people might see online activity as a form of cheating, others might not.\n\nAlso, the girlfriend suggested doing couple posts, which could mean she's okay with sharing content involving both of them if they're together. But since the guy found out after the fact, and she didn't inform him, that could be an issue. Communication is key in relationships. If she didn't discuss this with him beforehand, that's a problem. \n\nHe broke up because she didn't want to stop, which is his choice. If the relationship was built on mutual respect and trust, then expecting her to stop is reasonable. The fact that she continued despite his discomfort shows a lack of consideration for his feelings. \n\nSo, the guy's actions were based on his discomfort and the breach of trust he felt. He had the right to decide that this was a deal-breaker for him. The girlfriend's stance that it's not cheating because it's online might be a stretch. \n\nTherefore, the answer is B (the author is not in the wrong) because he had a right to his feelings and made a decision based on what he found unacceptable in the relationship.\n"
