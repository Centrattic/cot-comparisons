Recently though she and I got into an argument about this, and now I\u2019m just not sure if I did the right thing. \n\nI was knackered after a night out so I do what I usually do after a night out. Lay in my bed and scroll through reddit till i realise I should sleep. So I\u2019m scrolling and I\u2019m not sure if this is just me, but when I see a porn post or an NSFW post in general I click it. So I just see a gonewild post and think \u201coh cool\u201d and click on it. Still reeling from \u00a31 night at the club I didn\u2019t immediately notice it was my girlfriend, but something was familiar about the post. The bed looked familiar, so did the overall room, but then I saw her body realised \u201cwait that\u2019s my girlfriend\u201d. I was mostly in shock and just started looking through her history and what I saw confirmed that it was 100% her.  Just filled with a mixed ball of emotion I decided I should sleep, but I couldn\u2019t. \n\nSo I waited till the morning my mind going mad. Eventually I texted her confronting her about it. I got a bit aggy saying how I felt like she was cheating on me and she was saying to me that since it was the internet it wasn\u2019t cheating. In all honesty I said some nasty things and I could tell she wasn\u2019t having a good time either. Said to her that I would like her to stop posting, and if she doesn\u2019t then I didn\u2019t really want to continue things with her. She started saying loads of stuff even suggesting I join her for couple posts? In the end I realised she didn\u2019t want to stop so I ended things then and there. Haven\u2019t messaged her since and my mates are aggy at me asking what was going on. I\u2019m not going to expose her, but this is a bit much for me right now. \n\nAITA\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the person who broke up with his girlfriend for posting on gonewild is in the wrong. The options are A (yes, he's wrong) or B (no, he's not). \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The guy found out his girlfriend was posting explicit content on a site called gonewild. He got upset, confronted her, and they argued. He ended the relationship because she didn't want to stop posting. The question is whether he's at fault here.\n\nLet me break down the key points. The girlfriend was on gonewild, which is a site for explicit content. The guy saw her post there, realized it was her, and felt like she was cheating. She argued that since it's the internet, it's not cheating. He felt hurt and ended the relationship because she didn't agree to stop.\n\nNow, the main issue is whether sharing explicit photos online constitutes cheating. From a relationship standpoint, trust and boundaries are important. If both partners didn't discuss what they consider acceptable behavior before, it's a communication problem. The guy felt betrayed, but does that make him right to end it?\n\nOn one hand, sharing explicit photos without the partner's knowledge could be seen as violating trust. Even if it's online, some people might feel it's equivalent to cheating. On the other hand, if there was no prior agreement about this, it's a matter of differing values. The girlfriend might not see it as cheating, and the guy's reaction could be seen as overreacting if there wasn't a clear boundary set.\n\nBut the guy did confront her, and when she didn't agree to stop, he ended things. Is that fair? If they had a disagreement and couldn't find a compromise, the breakup might be a mutual decision. However, if the guy didn't address this issue before and it came up suddenly, maybe he should have communicated better. However, in relationships, people have different boundaries, and it's okay for one person to walk away if they can't meet the other's expectations.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? If the girlfriend's actions were within the boundaries she believed were acceptable and they weren't discussed beforehand, maybe the guy should have addressed it earlier. But since he did confront her and she didn't agree to stop, ending the relationship because of incompatible values isn't necessarily wrong. Therefore, the answer might be B, he's not in the wrong. But I need to check if there's a cultural or social norm that says sharing explicit photos is cheating. Some people consider it cheating because it's sharing intimate content without the partner's consent. If that's the case, then the guy's reaction is justified, and he's not wrong. So the answer would be B.\n"
