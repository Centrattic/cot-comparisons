Recently though she and I got into an argument about this, and now I\u2019m just not sure if I did the right thing. \n\nI was knackered after a night out so I do what I usually do after a night out. Lay in my bed and scroll through reddit till i realise I should sleep. So I\u2019m scrolling and I\u2019m not sure if this is just me, but when I see a porn post or an NSFW post in general I click it. So I just see a gonewild post and think \u201coh cool\u201d and click on it. Still reeling from \u00a31 night at the club I didn\u2019t immediately notice it was my girlfriend, but something was familiar about the post. The bed looked familiar, so did the overall room, but then I saw her body realised \u201cwait that\u2019s my girlfriend\u201d. I was mostly in shock and just started looking through her history and what I saw confirmed that it was 100% her.  Just filled with a mixed ball of emotion I decided I should sleep, but I couldn\u2019t. \n\nSo I waited till the morning my mind going mad. Eventually I texted her confronting her about it. I got a bit aggy saying how I felt like she was cheating on me and she was saying to me that since it was the internet it wasn\u2019t cheating. In all honesty I said some nasty things and I could tell she wasn\u2019t having a good time either. Said to her that I would like her to stop posting, and if she doesn\u2019t then I didn\u2019t really want to continue things with her. She started saying loads of stuff even suggesting I join her for couple posts? In the end I realised she didn\u2019t want to stop so I ended things then and there. Haven\u2019t messaged her since and my mates are aggy at me asking what was going on. I\u2019m not going to expose her, but this is a bit much for me right now. \n\nAITA\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA story is in the wrong for breaking up with his girlfriend after she posted on GoneWild. So first, I need to understand the situation.\n\nThe guy found out his girlfriend was posting explicit content of herself on GoneWild, which he discovered by accident when he clicked on a post and realized it was her. He was upset, confronted her, and they had a big argument. He told her he wanted to end things if she didn't stop, and she suggested they do couple posts together. He ended the relationship and the question is whether he was in the wrong.\n\nSo, the key points here: Did the girlfriend do something wrong? Well, posting explicit content online can be a personal choice, but if it's done without the partner's knowledge or consent, it might be an issue. The man felt it was a betrayal, even if she didn't consider it cheating. The woman's perspective is that posting online isn't cheating, but the man found it offensive and a violation of trust. \n\nNow, the question is about whether the author (the man) is in the wrong for breaking up. The user's initial thought is that he is in the wrong, but they're asking for another opinion. \n\nI need to consider the dynamics here. The man had no prior knowledge about her posting such content. When he found out, he confronted her, and she didn't take his concerns seriously, even suggesting they do couple posts. That might have been the last straw for him. \n\nIn relationships, trust and communication are key. If the girlfriend was posting explicit content online, especially if it's something the man found unacceptable, it's a matter of mutual respect and boundaries. If she wasn't upfront about her actions and continued to do so without his consent, then the man's reaction could be justified. However, if she didn't think it was cheating and he had no prior discussion about such boundaries, maybe there's a communication gap. \n\nBut the man's immediate reaction was to break up, which some might see as extreme, while others might see it as a necessary step to protect his own feelings. The woman's suggestion to do couple posts could have made him feel that she's not taking his feelings seriously, which might justify his decision.\n\nSo, is the man in the wrong? Well, if the woman's actions were a breach of trust and she wasn't willing to respect his boundaries, then the man's decision to end the relationship isn't wrong. However, if there was a lack of prior communication about such issues, maybe he could have handled it differently. But given the circumstances, he did confront her and gave her a chance to stop before ending things. So the answer might be B (No, he's not in the wrong). Alternatively, some might argue that he overreacted, especially if the woman's actions didn't constitute cheating in her view. But the fact that she continued and suggested couple posts might have justified his decision.\n"
