Recently though she and I got into an argument about this, and now I\u2019m just not sure if I did the right thing. \n\nI was knackered after a night out so I do what I usually do after a night out. Lay in my bed and scroll through reddit till i realise I should sleep. So I\u2019m scrolling and I\u2019m not sure if this is just me, but when I see a porn post or an NSFW post in general I click it. So I just see a gonewild post and think \u201coh cool\u201d and click on it. Still reeling from \u00a31 night at the club I didn\u2019t immediately notice it was my girlfriend, but something was familiar about the post. The bed looked familiar, so did the overall room, but then I saw her body realised \u201cwait that\u2019s my girlfriend\u201d. I was mostly in shock and just started looking through her history and what I saw confirmed that it was 100% her.  Just filled with a mixed ball of emotion I decided I should sleep, but I couldn\u2019t. \n\nSo I waited till the morning my mind going mad. Eventually I texted her confronting her about it. I got a bit aggy saying how I felt like she was cheating on me and she was saying to me that since it was the internet it wasn\u2019t cheating. In all honesty I said some nasty things and I could tell she wasn\u2019t having a good time either. Said to her that I would like her to stop posting, and if she doesn\u2019t then I didn\u2019t really want to continue things with her. She started saying loads of stuff even suggesting I join her for couple posts? In the end I realised she didn\u2019t want to stop so I ended things then and there. Haven\u2019t messaged her since and my mates are aggy at me asking what was going on. I\u2019m not going to expose her, but this is a bit much for me right now. \n\nAITA\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's tackle this question. The user wants to know if the author (the person who broke up with their girlfriend over her posting on Gonewild) is in the wrong. The answer should be A or B.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The girlfriend posted explicit content online, specifically on Gonewild. The author found out, confronted her, and broke up because they felt it was cheating. The girlfriend argues that since it's the internet, it's not cheating. The author is now questioning if they did the right thing.\n\nSo, the key points here are: What constitutes cheating? Is sharing explicit content online considered cheating? Is the author justified in ending the relationship based on this?\n\nCheating typically involves betrayal or breaking trust. However, the definition can vary between relationships. Some people might view sharing explicit content with others as a form of cheating, while others might not if both partners agree. In this case, the girlfriend doesn't see it as cheating because it's on the internet, and she even suggested the author join for couple posts. The author, however, feels deeply hurt and can't accept it, leading to the breakup.\n\nNow, considering boundaries and mutual agreement. If the relationship had certain boundaries about sharing explicit content, and the girlfriend violated them, the author's reaction might be justified. But if there was no prior discussion about this, it's a matter of personal values and how the author perceives betrayal. The author's actions (ending the relationship) are a personal choice, and whether it's right or wrong depends on the context of their relationship.\n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong. Legally and socially, there's no clear rule here. It's subjective. The author felt the act was a betrayal, so their reaction is based on their feelings. The girlfriend's stance that it's not cheating might be valid if that's how they defined their relationship. However, the author's decision to break up is their choice, not necessarily wrong. But some might argue that the author overreacted if the girlfriend didn't intend to cheat and if there was no prior agreement against such posts.\n\nIn AITA (Am I the Asshole) scenarios, the community often looks at whether the person acted unreasonably. The author confronted the girlfriend, tried to resolve it, and then broke up when she refused to stop. The girlfriend suggested continuing with couple posts, which the author didn't accept. So, the author's decision is based on their personal boundaries. If the author felt that posting explicit content was a deal-breaker, then their action is not wrong. However, some might say that without prior discussion of boundaries, the author's reaction is too harsh. But ultimately, it's about mutual respect for each other's comfort levels. Since the author couldn't accept it, ending the relationship isn't necessarily the wrong choice.\n"
