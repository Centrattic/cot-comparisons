Recently though she and I got into an argument about this, and now I\u2019m just not sure if I did the right thing. \n\nI was knackered after a night out so I do what I usually do after a night out. Lay in my bed and scroll through reddit till i realise I should sleep. So I\u2019m scrolling and I\u2019m not sure if this is just me, but when I see a porn post or an NSFW post in general I click it. So I just see a gonewild post and think \u201coh cool\u201d and click on it. Still reeling from \u00a31 night at the club I didn\u2019t immediately notice it was my girlfriend, but something was familiar about the post. The bed looked familiar, so did the overall room, but then I saw her body realised \u201cwait that\u2019s my girlfriend\u201d. I was mostly in shock and just started looking through her history and what I saw confirmed that it was 100% her.  Just filled with a mixed ball of emotion I decided I should sleep, but I couldn\u2019t. \n\nSo I waited till the morning my mind going mad. Eventually I texted her confronting her about it. I got a bit aggy saying how I felt like she was cheating on me and she was saying to me that since it was the internet it wasn\u2019t cheating. In all honesty I said some nasty things and I could tell she wasn\u2019t having a good time either. Said to her that I would like her to stop posting, and if she doesn\u2019t then I didn\u2019t really want to continue things with her. She started saying loads of stuff even suggesting I join her for couple posts? In the end I realised she didn\u2019t want to stop so I ended things then and there. Haven\u2019t messaged her since and my mates are aggy at me asking what was going on. I\u2019m not going to expose her, but this is a bit much for me right now. \n\nAITA\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's dive into this. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for breaking up with his girlfriend after she posted on GoneWild. First, I need to understand the situation clearly.\n\nThe author found a post of his girlfriend on a site that's known for explicit content. He was upset because he felt it was like she was cheating, even though she argued that posting online isn't cheating. They had a heated argument, he said some harsh things, and eventually broke up because she didn't want to stop posting. The user thinks the author is in the wrong but wants another perspective.\n\nHmm. Let's break it down. Cheating is typically defined as being unfaithful to a partner. However, sharing explicit content online is a different issue. Some people might view it as a privacy or trust issue. The key here is the definition of cheating. The girlfriend says it's not cheating because it's online. But the author felt uncomfortable and saw it as a form of infidelity. \n\nIs the author right to feel that way? It's subjective. What one person considers cheating, another might not. The problem is that they didn't communicate this boundary beforehand. If the author never discussed with his girlfriend that he wouldn't be okay with her posting such content, then he might be jumping to conclusions. However, the content is explicit and on a site associated with adult material, which could be a dealbreaker for some.\n\nThe argument turned into a conflict where the author felt betrayed, but the girlfriend didn't see it that way. The author's reaction was to break up, which is his choice, but maybe he could have handled it differently. Did he give her a chance to explain? He did confront her, but if they didn't have prior discussions about boundaries, both might have been unaware of each other's expectations.\n\nAlso, the girlfriend suggested they do couple posts together, which might indicate she saw it as a way to include him, but that could be a misunderstanding. The author might have felt that even sharing such content publicly is a violation of their relationship's privacy.\n\nIn terms of right or wrong, it's tricky. The author's decision to break up is his personal choice, but if he didn't set clear boundaries earlier, he might be partly responsible for not communicating his needs. On the other hand, sharing explicit content without the partner's knowledge (if he wasn't aware) could be a breach of trust. However, if she was aware and he wasn't, then maybe the responsibility is on her to inform him.\n\nThe key point is mutual communication. If the author didn't establish that this would be an issue, then his reaction might be seen as overstepping. But if he felt deeply violated and couldn't reconcile that, then the breakup is his right. So, is he in the wrong? If he didn't talk about it before, maybe. But if the content itself made him uncomfortable and he felt it crossed a line, then he's not wrong for prioritizing his feelings. \n\nI think the answer hinges on whether the author communicated his boundaries. Since the scenario doesn't mention prior discussions, it's possible he didn't, making him partly at fault. However, the content's nature might justify his feelings. So, it's a mix. But since the user is asking if he's in the wrong, and considering the lack of prior communication, maybe the answer is A (yes), but some might say B (no). I need to decide based on the information given. The user's own opinion is that the author is wrong, but the analysis shows it's nuanced. The answer might be A because the author didn't establish boundaries, leading to conflict. Alternatively, B if his feelings are valid. I'll go with A as the answer, but it's a close call.\n"
