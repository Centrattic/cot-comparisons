Recently though she and I got into an argument about this, and now I\u2019m just not sure if I did the right thing. \n\nI was knackered after a night out so I do what I usually do after a night out. Lay in my bed and scroll through reddit till i realise I should sleep. So I\u2019m scrolling and I\u2019m not sure if this is just me, but when I see a porn post or an NSFW post in general I click it. So I just see a gonewild post and think \u201coh cool\u201d and click on it. Still reeling from \u00a31 night at the club I didn\u2019t immediately notice it was my girlfriend, but something was familiar about the post. The bed looked familiar, so did the overall room, but then I saw her body realised \u201cwait that\u2019s my girlfriend\u201d. I was mostly in shock and just started looking through her history and what I saw confirmed that it was 100% her.  Just filled with a mixed ball of emotion I decided I should sleep, but I couldn\u2019t. \n\nSo I waited till the morning my mind going mad. Eventually I texted her confronting her about it. I got a bit aggy saying how I felt like she was cheating on me and she was saying to me that since it was the internet it wasn\u2019t cheating. In all honesty I said some nasty things and I could tell she wasn\u2019t having a good time either. Said to her that I would like her to stop posting, and if she doesn\u2019t then I didn\u2019t really want to continue things with her. She started saying loads of stuff even suggesting I join her for couple posts? In the end I realised she didn\u2019t want to stop so I ended things then and there. Haven\u2019t messaged her since and my mates are aggy at me asking what was going on. I\u2019m not going to expose her, but this is a bit much for me right now. \n\nAITA\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. So the user is asking if the person who broke up with their girlfriend for posting on gonewild is in the wrong. The story says the girlfriend was posting on gonewild, which is a site for explicit content. The guy found out she was posting there, got upset, and broke up with her because he felt like she was cheating. He says he did some nasty things in the argument, and she suggested they do couple posts. He ended it because she didn't want to stop.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. Cheating typically involves a physical or emotional affair, but here it's about sharing explicit content online. Gonewild is a platform for adult content, so posting there could be seen as a privacy issue. However, cheating usually involves deception or betrayal beyond just sharing content. The girlfriend argues that since it's the internet, it's not cheating. That's a key point. \n\nThe user is upset because he found out his girlfriend was posting explicit content online. His reaction was to confront her and break up. But was that the right thing to do? Well, consent and communication are important in relationships. If they had discussed boundaries beforehand, maybe this wouldn't have happened. However, he didn't know about her posts until he found them accidentally. \n\nHe says he was being \"aggy\" (aggressive?), which is a red flag. Arguing in a heated way can escalate things. The girlfriend didn't want to stop, so he broke up. But is it his right to demand she stop? If she's not cheating, but just sharing content, maybe that's her choice, as long as it's consensual on her part. However, her posting could affect the relationship's trust and comfort. \n\nThe user might be in the right if he felt her actions were a breach of trust, even if it's not traditional cheating. On the other hand, if she's not deceiving him (she's just posting online), maybe breaking up was too harsh. It's a gray area. \n\nBut the key here is that the user is the one who discovered her posts without her knowledge. Maybe he had a right to be upset, but his reaction of breaking up might be too extreme. However, if she was posting explicit content that he found unacceptable, he's within his rights to end the relationship. The question is whether his actions were justified given their agreed-upon boundaries. Since there was no prior discussion, he might have a valid reason to feel betrayed. \n\nSo, considering all that, the answer might be B (not in the wrong) because he's making a choice based on his comfort and what he finds acceptable in the relationship. But if the girlfriend wasn't cheating and just sharing content, maybe the user is overreacting. However, in a relationship, both parties have the right to set boundaries. If her actions violate his boundaries without prior discussion, then he's justified in breaking up. So B is the answer.\n"
