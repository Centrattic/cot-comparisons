Recently though she and I got into an argument about this, and now I\u2019m just not sure if I did the right thing. \n\nI was knackered after a night out so I do what I usually do after a night out. Lay in my bed and scroll through reddit till i realise I should sleep. So I\u2019m scrolling and I\u2019m not sure if this is just me, but when I see a porn post or an NSFW post in general I click it. So I just see a gonewild post and think \u201coh cool\u201d and click on it. Still reeling from \u00a31 night at the club I didn\u2019t immediately notice it was my girlfriend, but something was familiar about the post. The bed looked familiar, so did the overall room, but then I saw her body realised \u201cwait that\u2019s my girlfriend\u201d. I was mostly in shock and just started looking through her history and what I saw confirmed that it was 100% her.  Just filled with a mixed ball of emotion I decided I should sleep, but I couldn\u2019t. \n\nSo I waited till the morning my mind going mad. Eventually I texted her confronting her about it. I got a bit aggy saying how I felt like she was cheating on me and she was saying to me that since it was the internet it wasn\u2019t cheating. In all honesty I said some nasty things and I could tell she wasn\u2019t having a good time either. Said to her that I would like her to stop posting, and if she doesn\u2019t then I didn\u2019t really want to continue things with her. She started saying loads of stuff even suggesting I join her for couple posts? In the end I realised she didn\u2019t want to stop so I ended things then and there. Haven\u2019t messaged her since and my mates are aggy at me asking what was going on. I\u2019m not going to expose her, but this is a bit much for me right now. \n\nAITA\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA post is in the wrong for breaking up with his girlfriend over her posting on GoneWild. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The girlfriend posted explicit content on a site like Reddit's GoneWild, which the author discovered. He was initially unaware it was her, clicked on the post, then realized it was her. He confronted her, they argued, and he ended the relationship because she didn't want to stop posting. He's now questioning if he did the right thing.\n\nThe user's initial thought is that the author might be in the wrong, but they want others' opinions. The question is whether the author is in the wrong (A) or not (B).\n\nKey points to consider: \n1. The girlfriend's actions: Posting explicit content online, which the author found problematic. \n2. Communication issues: The author reacted with anger, called her and said some nasty things. She suggested they do couple posts together, which the author found unacceptable. \n3. The breakup: The author ended the relationship because she didn't agree to stop, but he could have handled it differently, maybe with more discussion or setting boundaries before breaking up. \n\nFrom the girlfriend's perspective, she might feel that sharing such content is her personal choice, especially if it's consensual. However, in a relationship, sharing explicit content can affect the partner, and the fact that the author was upset is valid. The problem here is the lack of prior communication about boundaries regarding online content. \n\nThe author's reaction was immediate and confrontational, which might have escalated the situation. Ending the relationship suddenly without trying to resolve the issue through discussion could be seen as hasty. However, if this was a deal-breaker for him and she wasn't willing to compromise, then his decision isn't entirely his fault. \n\nAlso, she suggested couple posts, which he found even more problematic. That might have been a red line for him. So, while he could have handled the confrontation better, the decision to break up might be justified if mutual respect for boundaries isn't possible. \n\nBut is he in the wrong? If the issue was about her content, and he didn't discuss it before finding out, then maybe he shares some responsibility for not setting expectations. However, once he found out, his reaction was based on his feelings. \n\nIn AITA scenarios, the community often considers whether the person acted unreasonably. Here, the author's actions were based on his reaction to content he found uncomfortable. However, breaking up without addressing the issue through dialogue and giving her a chance to stop might be seen as abrupt. But if she wasn't willing to compromise, then it's a valid decision. \n\nSo, the answer might lean towards B (No, the author is not in the wrong) because he acted based on his boundaries and values, but some might argue A because of the handling of the situation. However, the key is whether the action of breaking up is wrong. Since relationships require mutual respect and communication, if the girlfriend's actions violated his boundaries and she wasn't willing to adjust, then ending the relationship isn't necessarily wrong. Therefore, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
