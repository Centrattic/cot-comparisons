Recently though she and I got into an argument about this, and now I\u2019m just not sure if I did the right thing. \n\nI was knackered after a night out so I do what I usually do after a night out. Lay in my bed and scroll through reddit till i realise I should sleep. So I\u2019m scrolling and I\u2019m not sure if this is just me, but when I see a porn post or an NSFW post in general I click it. So I just see a gonewild post and think \u201coh cool\u201d and click on it. Still reeling from \u00a31 night at the club I didn\u2019t immediately notice it was my girlfriend, but something was familiar about the post. The bed looked familiar, so did the overall room, but then I saw her body realised \u201cwait that\u2019s my girlfriend\u201d. I was mostly in shock and just started looking through her history and what I saw confirmed that it was 100% her.  Just filled with a mixed ball of emotion I decided I should sleep, but I couldn\u2019t. \n\nSo I waited till the morning my mind going mad. Eventually I texted her confronting her about it. I got a bit aggy saying how I felt like she was cheating on me and she was saying to me that since it was the internet it wasn\u2019t cheating. In all honesty I said some nasty things and I could tell she wasn\u2019t having a good time either. Said to her that I would like her to stop posting, and if she doesn\u2019t then I didn\u2019t really want to continue things with her. She started saying loads of stuff even suggesting I join her for couple posts? In the end I realised she didn\u2019t want to stop so I ended things then and there. Haven\u2019t messaged her since and my mates are aggy at me asking what was going on. I\u2019m not going to expose her, but this is a bit much for me right now. \n\nAITA\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the person who broke up with his girlfriend over her posting on gonewild is in the wrong. I need to analyze the situation from both sides.\n\nFirst, the guy was scrolling through Reddit after a night out and accidentally found a gonewild post that was his girlfriend. He was shocked and confronted her. She argued that posting online isn't cheating, and he ended the relationship because she didn't want to stop. He's now asking if he's at fault.\n\nSo, what's gonewild? It's a site for explicit content, right? If she's posting there, that's her choice, but maybe he felt it was a betrayal. The key points here are consent, boundaries, and mutual respect. \n\nThe guy's reaction: he felt like she was cheating, even if she didn't. He got angry and ended the relationship. She didn't want to stop, which led to the breakup. But is he wrong for that? \n\nWell, whether sharing explicit content is considered cheating can be subjective. Some people see it as a betrayal because it's sharing intimate material without the partner's consent. Others might not see it the same way. The girl felt it wasn't cheating, but the guy did. That's a conflict in values. \n\nHe confronted her, they had a heated argument, and he ended it. The question is if he's in the wrong. If the relationship requires mutual consent and boundaries, then maybe he had a right to end things if she was unwilling to respect his feelings. However, maybe he overreacted. But if he felt deeply hurt and she was unwilling to compromise, then his decision might be justified. \n\nAlso, the girl suggested making couple posts, which might not have been what he wanted. He might have felt that sharing his photos would be a step further. \n\nSo, considering all that, the answer could be B (No, he's not in the wrong) because he's ending a relationship where there's a fundamental disagreement on values, and if she wasn't willing to meet his needs, he's within his right to leave. However, if he accused her of cheating without discussing it calmly first, maybe some blame on his side. But the main issue is the breach of trust and boundaries. \n\nI think the answer is B. The author isn't in the wrong because it's his choice to end a relationship where there's irreconcilable differences in what's acceptable behavior. He communicated his feelings and she didn't compromise. So, he's not at fault.\n"
