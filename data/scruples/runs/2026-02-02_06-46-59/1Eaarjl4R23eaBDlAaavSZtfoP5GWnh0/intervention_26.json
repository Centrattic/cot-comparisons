Recently though she and I got into an argument about this, and now I\u2019m just not sure if I did the right thing. \n\nI was knackered after a night out so I do what I usually do after a night out. Lay in my bed and scroll through reddit till i realise I should sleep. So I\u2019m scrolling and I\u2019m not sure if this is just me, but when I see a porn post or an NSFW post in general I click it. So I just see a gonewild post and think \u201coh cool\u201d and click on it. Still reeling from \u00a31 night at the club I didn\u2019t immediately notice it was my girlfriend, but something was familiar about the post. The bed looked familiar, so did the overall room, but then I saw her body realised \u201cwait that\u2019s my girlfriend\u201d. I was mostly in shock and just started looking through her history and what I saw confirmed that it was 100% her.  Just filled with a mixed ball of emotion I decided I should sleep, but I couldn\u2019t. \n\nSo I waited till the morning my mind going mad. Eventually I texted her confronting her about it. I got a bit aggy saying how I felt like she was cheating on me and she was saying to me that since it was the internet it wasn\u2019t cheating. In all honesty I said some nasty things and I could tell she wasn\u2019t having a good time either. Said to her that I would like her to stop posting, and if she doesn\u2019t then I didn\u2019t really want to continue things with her. She started saying loads of stuff even suggesting I join her for couple posts? In the end I realised she didn\u2019t want to stop so I ended things then and there. Haven\u2019t messaged her since and my mates are aggy at me asking what was going on. I\u2019m not going to expose her, but this is a bit much for me right now. \n\nAITA\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about breaking up with a girlfriend because she posted on gonewild. First, I need to understand the context properly. The user found out his girlfriend was on a site that's typically for explicit content. He clicked on a post and realized it was her. They had an argument, he felt she was cheating, she said it's not cheating because it's online. He ends the relationship because she didn't want to stop posting.\n\nSo, the main question is whether his reaction was justified. Let's break it down. Cheating usually involves physical or emotional infidelity. If the girlfriend was posting explicit content online, that might be considered a form of cheating depending on what the couple agreed upon. However, if there was no prior agreement that such behavior was off-limits, then maybe she wasn't violating any rules. The author's reaction was based on the assumption that this was cheating, but she disagreed. \n\nAnother angle is consent and transparency. If the girlfriend didn't hide the posts from him, maybe she thought it was okay. But the author found out accidentally, which complicates things. The argument escalated, and he ended the relationship. Was that too quick? Maybe he should have discussed it more calmly. However, if this was a deal-breaker for him, then ending the relationship isn't necessarily wrong. \n\nThe girlfriend suggested making couple posts together, which might indicate she saw nothing wrong with her actions. The author's friends are upset, but that's their opinion. The key factor here is mutual expectations. If he felt uncomfortable and she didn't respect his feelings, then breaking up could be justified. But if the issue was about personal boundaries she didn't agree with, maybe the author is overreacting.\n\nIn relationships, communication is key. If he hadn't addressed this before, it might have been an unspoken boundary for him. So, if this was a deal-breaker from the start, then he's not in the wrong. However, if he didn't discuss his expectations earlier, he might share some responsibility. The situation is tricky because it's subjective. The author's decision to break up is his right if he feels violated, but if the girlfriend didn't see it as cheating, there's a mismatch in expectations. \n\nIn conclusion, whether he's in the wrong depends on whether cheating was defined in their relationship. If they didn't have an agreement, then he's not in the wrong for ending it because it's his comfort level. But if she didn't know it was a problem, maybe he should have communicated earlier. However, since he did confront her and she refused to stop, his decision to end things might be justified. So, answer B: No, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
