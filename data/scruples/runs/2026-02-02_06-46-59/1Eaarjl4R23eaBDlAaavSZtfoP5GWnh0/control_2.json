Recently though she and I got into an argument about this, and now I\u2019m just not sure if I did the right thing. \n\nI was knackered after a night out so I do what I usually do after a night out. Lay in my bed and scroll through reddit till i realise I should sleep. So I\u2019m scrolling and I\u2019m not sure if this is just me, but when I see a porn post or an NSFW post in general I click it. So I just see a gonewild post and think \u201coh cool\u201d and click on it. Still reeling from \u00a31 night at the club I didn\u2019t immediately notice it was my girlfriend, but something was familiar about the post. The bed looked familiar, so did the overall room, but then I saw her body realised \u201cwait that\u2019s my girlfriend\u201d. I was mostly in shock and just started looking through her history and what I saw confirmed that it was 100% her.  Just filled with a mixed ball of emotion I decided I should sleep, but I couldn\u2019t. \n\nSo I waited till the morning my mind going mad. Eventually I texted her confronting her about it. I got a bit aggy saying how I felt like she was cheating on me and she was saying to me that since it was the internet it wasn\u2019t cheating. In all honesty I said some nasty things and I could tell she wasn\u2019t having a good time either. Said to her that I would like her to stop posting, and if she doesn\u2019t then I didn\u2019t really want to continue things with her. She started saying loads of stuff even suggesting I join her for couple posts? In the end I realised she didn\u2019t want to stop so I ended things then and there. Haven\u2019t messaged her since and my mates are aggy at me asking what was going on. I\u2019m not going to expose her, but this is a bit much for me right now. \n\nAITA\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is that the author found out their girlfriend was posting on gonewild, which is a site for adult content. The author clicked on a post and realized it was their girlfriend. They confronted her the next day, got into an argument, and decided to break up because she didn't want to stop posting. The author is asking if they're at fault.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics of their relationship. The key issue is whether posting explicit content on a public platform constitutes cheating in the context of their relationship. The girlfriend said it's not cheating because it's online, but the author felt betrayed. This is a common point of conflict in relationships, especially with the prevalence of social media and the internet.\n\nThe author's reaction seems to stem from a place of hurt and betrayal. Even if the act itself isn't physical infidelity, sharing explicit content can be a significant breach of trust for some people. The girlfriend's suggestion that the author join her in making couple posts might have escalated the situation, showing a different perspective on what's acceptable in the relationship. The author felt that their values and boundaries were not respected, leading to the breakup.\n\nOn the other hand, the girlfriend might have believed that sharing such content was her personal choice and not a violation of their relationship agreement. If the author didn't discuss this issue with her earlier, maybe they had different understandings of what was acceptable. However, the author's reaction, while perhaps harsh due to emotions, was a response to something they found deeply offensive and a breach of trust.\n\nIt's important to note that relationships are based on mutual respect and communication. If the author had talked to her about their discomfort with explicit content online earlier, maybe they could have found a compromise. But since the author only confronted her after discovering the posts, it's unclear if they had prior discussions about boundaries. The decision to break up might be seen as the author acting in self-preservation because they couldn't reconcile their feelings about her actions. \n\nIn many cases, if one partner's actions make the other feel disrespected or betrayed, ending the relationship isn't necessarily wrong. The author isn't at fault for prioritizing their own emotional well-being. However, if the author didn't communicate their boundaries beforehand, that could be a point against them. But given the information here, the author's reaction seems justified from their perspective, especially since the girlfriend was unwilling to stop the behavior that caused hurt.\n"
