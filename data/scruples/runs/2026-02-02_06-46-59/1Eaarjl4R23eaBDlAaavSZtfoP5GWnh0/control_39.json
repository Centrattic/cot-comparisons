Recently though she and I got into an argument about this, and now I\u2019m just not sure if I did the right thing. \n\nI was knackered after a night out so I do what I usually do after a night out. Lay in my bed and scroll through reddit till i realise I should sleep. So I\u2019m scrolling and I\u2019m not sure if this is just me, but when I see a porn post or an NSFW post in general I click it. So I just see a gonewild post and think \u201coh cool\u201d and click on it. Still reeling from \u00a31 night at the club I didn\u2019t immediately notice it was my girlfriend, but something was familiar about the post. The bed looked familiar, so did the overall room, but then I saw her body realised \u201cwait that\u2019s my girlfriend\u201d. I was mostly in shock and just started looking through her history and what I saw confirmed that it was 100% her.  Just filled with a mixed ball of emotion I decided I should sleep, but I couldn\u2019t. \n\nSo I waited till the morning my mind going mad. Eventually I texted her confronting her about it. I got a bit aggy saying how I felt like she was cheating on me and she was saying to me that since it was the internet it wasn\u2019t cheating. In all honesty I said some nasty things and I could tell she wasn\u2019t having a good time either. Said to her that I would like her to stop posting, and if she doesn\u2019t then I didn\u2019t really want to continue things with her. She started saying loads of stuff even suggesting I join her for couple posts? In the end I realised she didn\u2019t want to stop so I ended things then and there. Haven\u2019t messaged her since and my mates are aggy at me asking what was going on. I\u2019m not going to expose her, but this is a bit much for me right now. \n\nAITA\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong for breaking up with his girlfriend because she posted on Gonewild. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The author found a Gonewild post of his girlfriend, which is an adult content platform. He was upset, confronted her, and she didn't think it was cheating because it's online. The author felt she was disrespecting the relationship and broke up.\n\nNow, the key points here: Is posting on Gonewild considered cheating? That's subjective and depends on the couple's boundaries. The author didn't know about the posts initially, so maybe there was a lack of communication. But once confronted, she didn't want to stop, which led to the breakup. \n\nThe user wants a binary answer, A or B. The options are whether the author is in the wrong. \n\nI should consider that the author's actions were based on his feelings of betrayal, even if the girlfriend didn't see it the same way. Cheating is often defined by the couple's mutual understanding. If they didn't have prior agreements about online content, then maybe the author overstepped. However, the girlfriend's behavior could be seen as a violation of trust if the author considered it cheating. \n\nAlso, the author's reaction was intense, but he did try to communicate. The girlfriend's suggestion to do couple posts might have escalated the situation. \n\nIn some perspectives, the author is within his right to end the relationship if he feels his boundaries were crossed. But others might argue that he shouldn't have judged her without a prior discussion. \n\nHowever, the main issue is the definition of cheating. If the girlfriend's actions were consensual in her view, but the author felt it was a betrayal, the breakup is his choice. So, technically, the author isn't in the wrong for ending the relationship if it's based on his values and the situation. \n\nTherefore, the answer should be B (No), the author is not in the wrong.\n"
