Recently though she and I got into an argument about this, and now I\u2019m just not sure if I did the right thing. \n\nI was knackered after a night out so I do what I usually do after a night out. Lay in my bed and scroll through reddit till i realise I should sleep. So I\u2019m scrolling and I\u2019m not sure if this is just me, but when I see a porn post or an NSFW post in general I click it. So I just see a gonewild post and think \u201coh cool\u201d and click on it. Still reeling from \u00a31 night at the club I didn\u2019t immediately notice it was my girlfriend, but something was familiar about the post. The bed looked familiar, so did the overall room, but then I saw her body realised \u201cwait that\u2019s my girlfriend\u201d. I was mostly in shock and just started looking through her history and what I saw confirmed that it was 100% her.  Just filled with a mixed ball of emotion I decided I should sleep, but I couldn\u2019t. \n\nSo I waited till the morning my mind going mad. Eventually I texted her confronting her about it. I got a bit aggy saying how I felt like she was cheating on me and she was saying to me that since it was the internet it wasn\u2019t cheating. In all honesty I said some nasty things and I could tell she wasn\u2019t having a good time either. Said to her that I would like her to stop posting, and if she doesn\u2019t then I didn\u2019t really want to continue things with her. She started saying loads of stuff even suggesting I join her for couple posts? In the end I realised she didn\u2019t want to stop so I ended things then and there. Haven\u2019t messaged her since and my mates are aggy at me asking what was going on. I\u2019m not going to expose her, but this is a bit much for me right now. \n\nAITA\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who broke up with his girlfriend for posting on gonewild is in the wrong.\n\nFirst, the key facts: The girlfriend posted explicit content online, possibly on a site like Gonewild. The boyfriend found out, got upset, confronted her, and broke up. She argued that since it was online, it's not cheating. The question is whether he's in the wrong.\n\nFrom a relationship ethics perspective, trust and communication are crucial. The girlfriend's actions might be considered a betrayal if the boyfriend views sharing explicit content as cheating. Even if she didn't have a sexual partner, the act of sharing such content without consent can breach trust. The boyfriend's reaction is about feeling disrespected and violated, which is understandable.\n\nBut there's also the angle of consent and mutual understanding. If they hadn't discussed boundaries around online activity, it's unclear if the girlfriend knew this would be an issue. However, the boyfriend's immediate assumption of cheating and the breakup after a confrontation suggests that his feelings were significantly hurt. \n\nThe girlfriend's suggestion that he join her for couple posts might indicate she didn't see the issue, which could exacerbate the situation. The boyfriend's decision to end the relationship is a personal choice, but whether he's in the wrong depends on the context of their relationship's values and agreements. \n\nIf the relationship required mutual respect for each other's boundaries and the girlfriend didn't honor that by posting explicit content without discussing it, then the boyfriend's decision isn't necessarily wrong. Conversely, if the boyfriend overreacted without considering possible explanations or if there was a lack of prior communication about such matters, he might share some responsibility. \n\nHowever, given that he confronted her, expressed his feelings, and she didn't agree to stop, leading him to break up, it seems his actions were a response to a breach of trust he found unacceptable. So, the answer might lean towards him not being in the wrong.\n"
