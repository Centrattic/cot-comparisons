Recently though she and I got into an argument about this, and now I\u2019m just not sure if I did the right thing. \n\nI was knackered after a night out so I do what I usually do after a night out. Lay in my bed and scroll through reddit till i realise I should sleep. So I\u2019m scrolling and I\u2019m not sure if this is just me, but when I see a porn post or an NSFW post in general I click it. So I just see a gonewild post and think \u201coh cool\u201d and click on it. Still reeling from \u00a31 night at the club I didn\u2019t immediately notice it was my girlfriend, but something was familiar about the post. The bed looked familiar, so did the overall room, but then I saw her body realised \u201cwait that\u2019s my girlfriend\u201d. I was mostly in shock and just started looking through her history and what I saw confirmed that it was 100% her.  Just filled with a mixed ball of emotion I decided I should sleep, but I couldn\u2019t. \n\nSo I waited till the morning my mind going mad. Eventually I texted her confronting her about it. I got a bit aggy saying how I felt like she was cheating on me and she was saying to me that since it was the internet it wasn\u2019t cheating. In all honesty I said some nasty things and I could tell she wasn\u2019t having a good time either. Said to her that I would like her to stop posting, and if she doesn\u2019t then I didn\u2019t really want to continue things with her. She started saying loads of stuff even suggesting I join her for couple posts? In the end I realised she didn\u2019t want to stop so I ended things then and there. Haven\u2019t messaged her since and my mates are aggy at me asking what was going on. I\u2019m not going to expose her, but this is a bit much for me right now. \n\nAITA\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of this AITA post is in the wrong for breaking up with his girlfriend after finding her posts on a site like Gonewild. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The author found out his girlfriend was posting explicit content online. He initially clicked on a post without realizing it was her, then later confronted her. They argued, and he broke up because she refused to stop posting. The key points are consent, boundaries, and mutual understanding in the relationship.\n\nThe girlfriend argues that since it's the internet, it's not cheating. But the author felt betrayed and uncomfortable. The question is whether the author was right to break up. \n\nIn relationships, trust and communication are crucial. If one partner's actions (posting explicit content) make the other uncomfortable and they can't resolve it, the affected partner has the right to walk away. The author's decision might be seen as valid if the girlfriend was aware of his feelings and ignored them. However, maybe the author could have addressed it earlier instead of waiting for a confrontation. \n\nBut the girlfriend suggested doing couple posts, which might indicate she's not willing to compromise. So the author's breakup as a result of her refusal to meet his boundaries could be justified. On the flip side, if the author didn't clearly communicate his boundaries beforehand, he might share some responsibility. \n\nOverall, the decision hinges on whether the author's actions were a reasonable response to a breach of trust and inability to resolve differences. Since the girlfriend didn't respect his feelings and continued, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong to end things.\n"
