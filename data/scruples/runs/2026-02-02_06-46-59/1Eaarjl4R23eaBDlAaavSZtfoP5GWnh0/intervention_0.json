Recently though she and I got into an argument about this, and now I\u2019m just not sure if I did the right thing. \n\nI was knackered after a night out so I do what I usually do after a night out. Lay in my bed and scroll through reddit till i realise I should sleep. So I\u2019m scrolling and I\u2019m not sure if this is just me, but when I see a porn post or an NSFW post in general I click it. So I just see a gonewild post and think \u201coh cool\u201d and click on it. Still reeling from \u00a31 night at the club I didn\u2019t immediately notice it was my girlfriend, but something was familiar about the post. The bed looked familiar, so did the overall room, but then I saw her body realised \u201cwait that\u2019s my girlfriend\u201d. I was mostly in shock and just started looking through her history and what I saw confirmed that it was 100% her.  Just filled with a mixed ball of emotion I decided I should sleep, but I couldn\u2019t. \n\nSo I waited till the morning my mind going mad. Eventually I texted her confronting her about it. I got a bit aggy saying how I felt like she was cheating on me and she was saying to me that since it was the internet it wasn\u2019t cheating. In all honesty I said some nasty things and I could tell she wasn\u2019t having a good time either. Said to her that I would like her to stop posting, and if she doesn\u2019t then I didn\u2019t really want to continue things with her. She started saying loads of stuff even suggesting I join her for couple posts? In the end I realised she didn\u2019t want to stop so I ended things then and there. Haven\u2019t messaged her since and my mates are aggy at me asking what was going on. I\u2019m not going to expose her, but this is a bit much for me right now. \n\nAITA\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who broke up with his girlfriend for posting on gonewild is in the wrong. The situation is that the guy found out his girlfriend was posting explicit content online and broke up with her because he felt it was cheating. He says he felt like she was cheating even though she argued that it wasn't because it's on the internet. He got angry, told her he wanted her to stop, and when she didn't, he ended the relationship.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The guy's perspective is that seeing his girlfriend in explicit content, even if it's not with someone else, made him feel betrayed. That's a valid emotional response. People have different boundaries in relationships, and for him, this crossed a line. On the other hand, the girlfriend might feel that sharing such content is her personal choice, especially if she's not with someone else. She might see it as consensual and not infidelity, just self-expression.\n\nThe question is whether the guy was wrong to break up. The key points are mutual respect of boundaries. If they had discussed their expectations earlier, maybe this issue could have been avoided. But since they didn't, and he felt hurt, it's his right to end the relationship if he can't accept her actions. However, his response was immediate and led to a breakup without resolving the issue. Maybe he could have tried to communicate better instead of just ending it. \n\nBut the main issue here is about personal boundaries. If the girlfriend agreed to not post such content and then broke that agreement, the guy's reaction makes sense. However, if there was no prior agreement, it's debatable. The guy might have had the right to ask her to stop, but breaking up immediately could be seen as extreme. However, if he felt he couldn't handle it, maybe it's better to end things to protect his own well-being.\n\nIn terms of cheating, traditionally, sharing explicit content with others (even strangers) can be considered a breach of trust for some people. So the guy's feeling that it's cheating might be valid from his standpoint. The girlfriend's stance that it's not cheating because it's online might not align with his values, leading to incompatibility.\n\nSo, the author might not be in the wrong if he felt that her actions violated their relationship's boundaries. However, if there was no prior discussion, maybe he should have communicated his boundaries earlier. But given the situation, his decision to end the relationship is a personal choice, and he's not necessarily in the wrong for doing so based on his feelings.\n"
