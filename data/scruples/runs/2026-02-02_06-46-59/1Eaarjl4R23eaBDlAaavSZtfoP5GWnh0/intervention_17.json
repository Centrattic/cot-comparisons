Recently though she and I got into an argument about this, and now I\u2019m just not sure if I did the right thing. \n\nI was knackered after a night out so I do what I usually do after a night out. Lay in my bed and scroll through reddit till i realise I should sleep. So I\u2019m scrolling and I\u2019m not sure if this is just me, but when I see a porn post or an NSFW post in general I click it. So I just see a gonewild post and think \u201coh cool\u201d and click on it. Still reeling from \u00a31 night at the club I didn\u2019t immediately notice it was my girlfriend, but something was familiar about the post. The bed looked familiar, so did the overall room, but then I saw her body realised \u201cwait that\u2019s my girlfriend\u201d. I was mostly in shock and just started looking through her history and what I saw confirmed that it was 100% her.  Just filled with a mixed ball of emotion I decided I should sleep, but I couldn\u2019t. \n\nSo I waited till the morning my mind going mad. Eventually I texted her confronting her about it. I got a bit aggy saying how I felt like she was cheating on me and she was saying to me that since it was the internet it wasn\u2019t cheating. In all honesty I said some nasty things and I could tell she wasn\u2019t having a good time either. Said to her that I would like her to stop posting, and if she doesn\u2019t then I didn\u2019t really want to continue things with her. She started saying loads of stuff even suggesting I join her for couple posts? In the end I realised she didn\u2019t want to stop so I ended things then and there. Haven\u2019t messaged her since and my mates are aggy at me asking what was going on. I\u2019m not going to expose her, but this is a bit much for me right now. \n\nAITA\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA post is in the wrong for breaking up with his girlfriend after finding out she posted on gonewild. The question is asking whether I think the author is wrong, and to answer A or B.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The guy found his girlfriend's post on a site like Reddit's Gonewild, which likely includes explicit content. He was upset because he felt it was like cheating. The girlfriend didn't think it was cheating since it's online. He ended the relationship because she didn't want to stop posting, and he felt it was a dealbreaker.\n\nNow, to determine if he's in the wrong. Relationships are about mutual respect and boundaries. If the guy felt uncomfortable with her posting explicit content online, it's reasonable for him to express that. However, the concept of cheating varies. Most people might agree that sharing explicit content online with others isn't cheating, but some might feel differently. The girlfriend didn't see it as cheating, so the argument here is about differing values.\n\nBreaking up over this could be seen as his right if it's a dealbreaker for him. However, he might need to consider why she was posting such content and whether there was prior discussion. Did he talk about his boundaries before this happened? If he didn't communicate his feelings beforehand, maybe rushing into a breakup without addressing the issue could be seen as hasty. \n\nBut in this case, he did confront her and she refused to stop. If he can't accept that, ending the relationship isn't necessarily wrong. He had his reasons, and if the relationship can't accommodate his needs, it's his choice. However, some might argue that he overreacted, especially if she didn't cross a line he hadn't set. But since he did set clear boundaries after seeing the post and she didn't respect them, his decision might be justified.\n\nSo, the answer might depend on whether the boundaries were discussed beforehand. Since the post didn't mention prior discussions, maybe the guy should have talked about it earlier. But given the situation as presented, ending the relationship because of her actions, which he found unacceptable, might not be in the wrong. Therefore, answer B.\n"
