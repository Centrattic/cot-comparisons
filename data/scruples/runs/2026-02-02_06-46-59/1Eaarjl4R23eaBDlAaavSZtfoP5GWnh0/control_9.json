Recently though she and I got into an argument about this, and now I\u2019m just not sure if I did the right thing. \n\nI was knackered after a night out so I do what I usually do after a night out. Lay in my bed and scroll through reddit till i realise I should sleep. So I\u2019m scrolling and I\u2019m not sure if this is just me, but when I see a porn post or an NSFW post in general I click it. So I just see a gonewild post and think \u201coh cool\u201d and click on it. Still reeling from \u00a31 night at the club I didn\u2019t immediately notice it was my girlfriend, but something was familiar about the post. The bed looked familiar, so did the overall room, but then I saw her body realised \u201cwait that\u2019s my girlfriend\u201d. I was mostly in shock and just started looking through her history and what I saw confirmed that it was 100% her.  Just filled with a mixed ball of emotion I decided I should sleep, but I couldn\u2019t. \n\nSo I waited till the morning my mind going mad. Eventually I texted her confronting her about it. I got a bit aggy saying how I felt like she was cheating on me and she was saying to me that since it was the internet it wasn\u2019t cheating. In all honesty I said some nasty things and I could tell she wasn\u2019t having a good time either. Said to her that I would like her to stop posting, and if she doesn\u2019t then I didn\u2019t really want to continue things with her. She started saying loads of stuff even suggesting I join her for couple posts? In the end I realised she didn\u2019t want to stop so I ended things then and there. Haven\u2019t messaged her since and my mates are aggy at me asking what was going on. I\u2019m not going to expose her, but this is a bit much for me right now. \n\nAITA\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that the guy found out his girlfriend was posting on gonewild, which is a site with explicit content. He broke up with her because of that. The main question here is whether he was right to do so.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. From the guy's perspective, finding out that his girlfriend is posting explicit photos of herself online might make him feel like she's being unfaithful or not respecting the relationship. Even though she argues that it's just the internet and not cheating, he might feel betrayed. The fact that she suggested making couple posts together could make him feel like she's inviting others to view their intimacy, which he's uncomfortable with.\n\nOn the other hand, the girlfriend's side is that she's not cheating by posting online. She might see it as her personal choice and freedom of expression. If she's not having physical relations with someone else, then technically she's not cheating. However, sharing explicit content can be a boundary in a relationship that wasn't discussed. The guy might not have been aware of this beforehand, leading to a conflict when he found out.\n\nThe key points here are consent and boundaries. Were they clear about what each person was comfortable with? If the boyfriend didn't have an issue with her posting before, but now he does, maybe there's a communication gap. However, the act of posting explicit photos can be a red flag for some people, and if it's causing a major issue in the relationship, then the decision to break up is a personal one.\n\nThe guy's reaction was to confront her and end things when she didn't agree to stop. While his approach might have been harsh (getting angry and saying nasty things), his feelings are valid if he considers her actions a betrayal. The question is whether her actions actually constitute cheating. If they defined their relationship with certain boundaries and she broke them, then he's justified. But if there were no prior boundaries, maybe it's a misunderstanding.\n\nIn many relationships, sharing explicit content without the partner's knowledge can be a deal-breaker. The guy might feel that her privacy settings or intentions were not considerate of his feelings. She might think she's within her rights to share her content. It's a matter of mutual respect and communication. If they didn't discuss this before, it's hard to say who is wrong. But the guy acting on his feelings to end the relationship because he's not comfortable with it isn't necessarily wrong. He has the right to set his boundaries.\n\nSo, considering all that, the answer might be B (No, the author is not in the wrong) because he's making a decision based on his comfort and the boundaries he feels are important in the relationship. However, there's a nuance here. If there was no prior agreement, maybe it's a situation where both had different expectations. But since he's breaking up because her actions make him feel like she's cheating, and his feelings are valid, he's not in the wrong for prioritizing his emotional well-being.\n"
