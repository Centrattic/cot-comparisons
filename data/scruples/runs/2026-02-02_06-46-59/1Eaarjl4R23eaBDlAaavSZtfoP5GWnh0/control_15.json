Recently though she and I got into an argument about this, and now I\u2019m just not sure if I did the right thing. \n\nI was knackered after a night out so I do what I usually do after a night out. Lay in my bed and scroll through reddit till i realise I should sleep. So I\u2019m scrolling and I\u2019m not sure if this is just me, but when I see a porn post or an NSFW post in general I click it. So I just see a gonewild post and think \u201coh cool\u201d and click on it. Still reeling from \u00a31 night at the club I didn\u2019t immediately notice it was my girlfriend, but something was familiar about the post. The bed looked familiar, so did the overall room, but then I saw her body realised \u201cwait that\u2019s my girlfriend\u201d. I was mostly in shock and just started looking through her history and what I saw confirmed that it was 100% her.  Just filled with a mixed ball of emotion I decided I should sleep, but I couldn\u2019t. \n\nSo I waited till the morning my mind going mad. Eventually I texted her confronting her about it. I got a bit aggy saying how I felt like she was cheating on me and she was saying to me that since it was the internet it wasn\u2019t cheating. In all honesty I said some nasty things and I could tell she wasn\u2019t having a good time either. Said to her that I would like her to stop posting, and if she doesn\u2019t then I didn\u2019t really want to continue things with her. She started saying loads of stuff even suggesting I join her for couple posts? In the end I realised she didn\u2019t want to stop so I ended things then and there. Haven\u2019t messaged her since and my mates are aggy at me asking what was going on. I\u2019m not going to expose her, but this is a bit much for me right now. \n\nAITA\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong. The situation involves breaking up with a girlfriend because she posted explicit content of herself on a site called Gonewild. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the scenario. The author found out that his girlfriend posted explicit photos of herself on an adult website. He confronted her, they argued, and he broke up with her because she didn't agree that it was cheating and even suggested he join her. \n\nThe key points here are about consent, boundaries in a relationship, and what constitutes cheating. The girlfriend's action of posting explicit content without his knowledge might be an issue of trust. However, whether it's considered cheating can depend on the couple's agreed-upon boundaries. \n\nIf they didn't have prior discussions about sharing intimate content online, the girlfriend might not have been aware that it would be a deal-breaker. On the other hand, the author might feel that her actions breached his trust, especially if they were in an exclusive relationship. \n\nThe author's reaction could be seen as his way of protecting his feelings, even if the girlfriend doesn't view it as cheating. But breaking up immediately and not considering communication or compromise might be hasty. However, the girlfriend's suggestion to do couple posts could have escalated the issue, making the author feel pressured into something he's uncomfortable with. \n\nLegally and ethically, sharing explicit photos without consent can be problematic, but since it's her own content, the lines get blurry. The main issue here is mutual understanding and respecting each other's boundaries. \n\nIn AITA terms, the community often considers intentions, communication, and whether both parties acted unreasonably. The author had a valid reason to feel hurt and betrayed, but ending the relationship without thorough discussion might be seen as his decision based on his values. The girlfriend's stance that it's not cheating might be her perspective, but she didn't consider his feelings. \n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? It's a bit of a gray area. If the girlfriend didn't hide it and he found it by accident, maybe the author overreacted. But if sharing explicit content without discussing it with her partner is a breach of trust, then the author's decision to break up is understandable. \n\nConsidering these factors, the answer might lean towards the author not being in the wrong (B), as he made a decision based on his emotional response and the lack of prior communication about such content. However, there's room for both sides. But in AITA contexts, actions taken to protect one's emotional well-being are often seen as justified.\n"
