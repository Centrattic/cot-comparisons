Recently though she and I got into an argument about this, and now I\u2019m just not sure if I did the right thing. \n\nI was knackered after a night out so I do what I usually do after a night out. Lay in my bed and scroll through reddit till i realise I should sleep. So I\u2019m scrolling and I\u2019m not sure if this is just me, but when I see a porn post or an NSFW post in general I click it. So I just see a gonewild post and think \u201coh cool\u201d and click on it. Still reeling from \u00a31 night at the club I didn\u2019t immediately notice it was my girlfriend, but something was familiar about the post. The bed looked familiar, so did the overall room, but then I saw her body realised \u201cwait that\u2019s my girlfriend\u201d. I was mostly in shock and just started looking through her history and what I saw confirmed that it was 100% her.  Just filled with a mixed ball of emotion I decided I should sleep, but I couldn\u2019t. \n\nSo I waited till the morning my mind going mad. Eventually I texted her confronting her about it. I got a bit aggy saying how I felt like she was cheating on me and she was saying to me that since it was the internet it wasn\u2019t cheating. In all honesty I said some nasty things and I could tell she wasn\u2019t having a good time either. Said to her that I would like her to stop posting, and if she doesn\u2019t then I didn\u2019t really want to continue things with her. She started saying loads of stuff even suggesting I join her for couple posts? In the end I realised she didn\u2019t want to stop so I ended things then and there. Haven\u2019t messaged her since and my mates are aggy at me asking what was going on. I\u2019m not going to expose her, but this is a bit much for me right now. \n\nAITA\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to work through this situation step by step. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong. The scenario is that he broke up with his girlfriend after discovering she had posted explicit content of herself on GoneWild, a site known for adult content. He found her post by accident while browsing Reddit, realized it was her, confronted her, and they ended things when she didn't agree to stop posting.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The author felt betrayed upon seeing his girlfriend's explicit posts online. Even though she argues that online activity isn't cheating, he felt it was a violation of trust. His reaction was to end the relationship, which he now questions. The girlfriend's stance is that sharing content on the internet isn't cheating, and she even suggested that the author join her for couple posts. \n\nFrom the author's perspective, he might have felt that sharing explicit photos without his knowledge was a breach of their relationship's boundaries. Even if the site isn't a traditional infidelity platform, the act of sharing such content could be seen as a privacy issue. However, the girlfriend doesn't view it as cheating, which highlights a fundamental disagreement about what constitutes betrayal. \n\nOn the other hand, the girlfriend's argument that internet activity isn't cheating might be based on the idea that she wasn't physically unfaithful. Yet, sharing explicit content, especially without her partner's knowledge, can lead to trust issues. The key here is communication. If the author didn't discuss his boundaries with her beforehand, he might share some responsibility. However, once he discovered the posts and confronted her, he had the right to decide his limits. \n\nThe girlfriend suggesting couple posts might imply that she didn't see any issue with sharing explicit content and even wanted to involve him, which could be seen as dismissive of his feelings. The author's decision to end the relationship was based on her unwillingness to stop, which he found unacceptable. \n\nIn terms of fault, it's possible that the author isn't entirely in the wrong. He had the right to set boundaries regarding how his partner shares content. His reaction, while harsh, might be justified if he felt the trust was broken. However, he could have handled the confrontation differently, perhaps by discussing expectations before taking action. \n\nAlternatively, if the girlfriend was unaware that the author would find the posts and didn't consider it cheating, she might not be entirely at fault either. The crux here is their differing views on what constitutes cheating and the lack of prior communication about their expectations. \n\nIn conclusion, the author's decision to end the relationship stems from his personal boundaries being crossed. While he might have handled the situation better, his action of breaking up isn't necessarily the wrong choice. Therefore, the answer would lean towards the author not being in the wrong.\n"
