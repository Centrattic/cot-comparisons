Recently though she and I got into an argument about this, and now I\u2019m just not sure if I did the right thing. \n\nI was knackered after a night out so I do what I usually do after a night out. Lay in my bed and scroll through reddit till i realise I should sleep. So I\u2019m scrolling and I\u2019m not sure if this is just me, but when I see a porn post or an NSFW post in general I click it. So I just see a gonewild post and think \u201coh cool\u201d and click on it. Still reeling from \u00a31 night at the club I didn\u2019t immediately notice it was my girlfriend, but something was familiar about the post. The bed looked familiar, so did the overall room, but then I saw her body realised \u201cwait that\u2019s my girlfriend\u201d. I was mostly in shock and just started looking through her history and what I saw confirmed that it was 100% her.  Just filled with a mixed ball of emotion I decided I should sleep, but I couldn\u2019t. \n\nSo I waited till the morning my mind going mad. Eventually I texted her confronting her about it. I got a bit aggy saying how I felt like she was cheating on me and she was saying to me that since it was the internet it wasn\u2019t cheating. In all honesty I said some nasty things and I could tell she wasn\u2019t having a good time either. Said to her that I would like her to stop posting, and if she doesn\u2019t then I didn\u2019t really want to continue things with her. She started saying loads of stuff even suggesting I join her for couple posts? In the end I realised she didn\u2019t want to stop so I ended things then and there. Haven\u2019t messaged her since and my mates are aggy at me asking what was going on. I\u2019m not going to expose her, but this is a bit much for me right now. \n\nAITA\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the person who broke up with his girlfriend for her posting on GoneWild is in the wrong. Let me start by understanding the situation.\n\nThe guy found out that his girlfriend had posted a nude photo of herself on a site called GoneWild. He was upset, thought she was cheating at first, and then confronted her. She said that posting online isn't cheating, and even suggested they do couple posts. He told her he wanted to end things if she didn't stop, and then broke up with her.\n\nFirst, I should consider what cheating actually means. Some people might argue that sharing explicit photos online, especially without consent, could be considered a betrayal of trust. Even if it's not traditional cheating (like with a physical partner), the emotional impact might be significant. The guy felt she was betraying him, so his reaction is based on his perception of her actions being a violation of their relationship.\n\nOn the other hand, the girlfriend's stance is that posting on the internet isn't cheating. Maybe she didn't think sharing a nude photo of herself was wrong in the context of their relationship. If they had an open relationship or some understanding about sharing content, her actions might be justified. But if there was an unspoken expectation of privacy or monogamy, then her actions could be seen as crossing a boundary.\n\nThe guy's response was to break up with her. Is that overreacting? Well, if he felt that her actions were a fundamental breach of trust, ending the relationship is a personal choice. However, breaking up immediately after an argument where he admitted to saying \"nasty things\" might be hasty. He might have acted out of anger rather than a considered decision. \n\nAlso, the girlfriend suggested they do couple posts together. That could indicate she was trying to involve him, maybe to show solidarity or to make him feel included. He didn't take that option, instead ending things. Maybe he could have discussed boundaries more calmly instead of jumping to breakups.\n\nBut the key point here is whether he was in the wrong. If the girlfriend's actions were a deal-breaker for him, then he isn't necessarily in the wrong for ending the relationship. However, if he didn't communicate his expectations beforehand, then he might share some responsibility. Relationships require mutual understanding, so if he never discussed his stance on sharing explicit content, he can't hold it against her. \n\nIn summary, the guy's decision to break up is based on his feelings about her actions. If he had different expectations, he's not in the wrong for prioritizing his boundaries. However, if the breakup was impulsive or based on assumptions without prior discussion, that could be where he's at fault. The situation is a bit of a gray area, but since he made a decision based on his personal boundaries, I might lean towards him not being in the wrong. But I need to check if there's any other angle I'm missing.\n"
