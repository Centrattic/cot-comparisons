Recently though she and I got into an argument about this, and now I\u2019m just not sure if I did the right thing. \n\nI was knackered after a night out so I do what I usually do after a night out. Lay in my bed and scroll through reddit till i realise I should sleep. So I\u2019m scrolling and I\u2019m not sure if this is just me, but when I see a porn post or an NSFW post in general I click it. So I just see a gonewild post and think \u201coh cool\u201d and click on it. Still reeling from \u00a31 night at the club I didn\u2019t immediately notice it was my girlfriend, but something was familiar about the post. The bed looked familiar, so did the overall room, but then I saw her body realised \u201cwait that\u2019s my girlfriend\u201d. I was mostly in shock and just started looking through her history and what I saw confirmed that it was 100% her.  Just filled with a mixed ball of emotion I decided I should sleep, but I couldn\u2019t. \n\nSo I waited till the morning my mind going mad. Eventually I texted her confronting her about it. I got a bit aggy saying how I felt like she was cheating on me and she was saying to me that since it was the internet it wasn\u2019t cheating. In all honesty I said some nasty things and I could tell she wasn\u2019t having a good time either. Said to her that I would like her to stop posting, and if she doesn\u2019t then I didn\u2019t really want to continue things with her. She started saying loads of stuff even suggesting I join her for couple posts? In the end I realised she didn\u2019t want to stop so I ended things then and there. Haven\u2019t messaged her since and my mates are aggy at me asking what was going on. I\u2019m not going to expose her, but this is a bit much for me right now. \n\nAITA\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for breaking up with his girlfriend after finding her posts on GoneWild. \n\nFirst, the situation: The guy found his girlfriend's explicit posts online. He felt she was cheating because she was sharing herself publicly. They argued, he ended the relationship, and now he's wondering if he was right.\n\nSo, the main points here. The girlfriend argues that posting on the internet isn't cheating. But the author feels it is. That's a difference in values. Cheating definitions vary between couples. Some might see online activity as infidelity, others don't. The author's reaction was breaking up, which is a big step.\n\nHe confronted her, and she didn't want to stop posting. He felt she wasn't respecting his feelings. She even suggested he join her for couple posts, which might have made him feel even more uncomfortable. He's not exposing her, so he did consider her privacy, but the relationship didn't survive.\n\nLegally, posting explicit content isn't cheating, but relationships are about mutual respect and boundaries. If she was okay with it and he wasn't, there's a fundamental mismatch. The author had the right to end things if he felt violated. But maybe he could have handled it differently, like discussing boundaries first. However, breaking up is a personal choice, and if the core issue can't be resolved, it might be justified.\n\nSo, is he in the wrong? It's a tough call. He didn't force her to remove the content, but he couldn't accept her actions. If the issue was cheating, then he's within his rights to leave. The answer is probably B (No), because he's making a choice based on his values, even if others might argue she wasn't cheating by their definition. But the question is if he's in the wrong, and since he didn't act out of malice, maybe not.\n"
