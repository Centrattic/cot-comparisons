Recently though she and I got into an argument about this, and now I\u2019m just not sure if I did the right thing. \n\nI was knackered after a night out so I do what I usually do after a night out. Lay in my bed and scroll through reddit till i realise I should sleep. So I\u2019m scrolling and I\u2019m not sure if this is just me, but when I see a porn post or an NSFW post in general I click it. So I just see a gonewild post and think \u201coh cool\u201d and click on it. Still reeling from \u00a31 night at the club I didn\u2019t immediately notice it was my girlfriend, but something was familiar about the post. The bed looked familiar, so did the overall room, but then I saw her body realised \u201cwait that\u2019s my girlfriend\u201d. I was mostly in shock and just started looking through her history and what I saw confirmed that it was 100% her.  Just filled with a mixed ball of emotion I decided I should sleep, but I couldn\u2019t. \n\nSo I waited till the morning my mind going mad. Eventually I texted her confronting her about it. I got a bit aggy saying how I felt like she was cheating on me and she was saying to me that since it was the internet it wasn\u2019t cheating. In all honesty I said some nasty things and I could tell she wasn\u2019t having a good time either. Said to her that I would like her to stop posting, and if she doesn\u2019t then I didn\u2019t really want to continue things with her. She started saying loads of stuff even suggesting I join her for couple posts? In the end I realised she didn\u2019t want to stop so I ended things then and there. Haven\u2019t messaged her since and my mates are aggy at me asking what was going on. I\u2019m not going to expose her, but this is a bit much for me right now. \n\nAITA\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that the author found out their girlfriend was posting explicit content on a site called gonewild. They got into an argument, he felt like she was cheating, and then he broke up with her because she didn't want to stop posting. The question is whether he's at fault.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The author's perspective: he found her posting explicit stuff online, which made him feel like she was cheating. He confronted her, got upset, and ended the relationship when she didn't agree to stop. He feels conflicted now.\n\nOn the other hand, the girlfriend's stance is that since it's the internet, it's not cheating. She might be in her rights to post whatever she wants, especially if it's consensual and she's not with someone else. The author might have broken up over something that, in some relationships, isn't considered betrayal.\n\nBut then again, the author's feelings are valid. If someone is uncomfortable with their partner sharing explicit content publicly, they have the right to express that. The problem arises in how they handle it. The author's response was to break up, which can be seen as a drastic measure. However, if the girlfriend was aware of his discomfort and still didn't respect his boundaries, maybe the author was justified.\n\nWait, the user says they think the author is in the wrong, but I need to evaluate. The key points here are consent, boundaries, and mutual respect. The girlfriend's actions might not be cheating in a traditional sense, but sharing explicit content without the partner's knowledge could be a breach of trust. The author found out accidentally, which complicates things. He had a right to be upset, but his reaction led to a breakup. Was that fair?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the author could have discussed it more calmly, tried to understand why she was posting, and maybe set boundaries together. Ending the relationship immediately might be seen as impulsive. However, if the author felt it was a deal-breaker and the girlfriend wasn't willing to compromise, then maybe it's reasonable.\n\nI think the answer depends on the relationship's context. If the girlfriend was explicit about her intention to post and the author agreed, then the author's reaction is harsh. But if she didn't disclose this and he felt lied to, then he has a point. The article mentions she suggested he join in, which he might find unacceptable. \n\nIn the end, the decision to break up is personal. If both parties have different values, one might leave. The author might not be in the wrong if he couldn't accept her actions despite discussing it. But if the breakup was due to a misunderstanding without proper communication, maybe he's at fault. However, the scenario suggests they had an argument where the author felt betrayed, leading to the breakup. So, it's a bit of a toss-up. The author's actions are a personal choice, but whether he's in the wrong depends on the circumstances. Since the user thinks the author is wrong, but I need to decide. Considering that sharing explicit content without the partner's knowledge can be a breach of trust, but if the partner didn't consider it cheating, the author's reaction is based on his own values. So, the answer might be B (not in the wrong) because he had the right to end the relationship if her actions conflicted with his values.\n"
