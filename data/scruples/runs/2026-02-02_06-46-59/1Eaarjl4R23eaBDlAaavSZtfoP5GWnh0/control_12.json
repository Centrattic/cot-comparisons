Recently though she and I got into an argument about this, and now I\u2019m just not sure if I did the right thing. \n\nI was knackered after a night out so I do what I usually do after a night out. Lay in my bed and scroll through reddit till i realise I should sleep. So I\u2019m scrolling and I\u2019m not sure if this is just me, but when I see a porn post or an NSFW post in general I click it. So I just see a gonewild post and think \u201coh cool\u201d and click on it. Still reeling from \u00a31 night at the club I didn\u2019t immediately notice it was my girlfriend, but something was familiar about the post. The bed looked familiar, so did the overall room, but then I saw her body realised \u201cwait that\u2019s my girlfriend\u201d. I was mostly in shock and just started looking through her history and what I saw confirmed that it was 100% her.  Just filled with a mixed ball of emotion I decided I should sleep, but I couldn\u2019t. \n\nSo I waited till the morning my mind going mad. Eventually I texted her confronting her about it. I got a bit aggy saying how I felt like she was cheating on me and she was saying to me that since it was the internet it wasn\u2019t cheating. In all honesty I said some nasty things and I could tell she wasn\u2019t having a good time either. Said to her that I would like her to stop posting, and if she doesn\u2019t then I didn\u2019t really want to continue things with her. She started saying loads of stuff even suggesting I join her for couple posts? In the end I realised she didn\u2019t want to stop so I ended things then and there. Haven\u2019t messaged her since and my mates are aggy at me asking what was going on. I\u2019m not going to expose her, but this is a bit much for me right now. \n\nAITA\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that the guy broke up with his girlfriend because she posted on GoneWild, which is a site with explicit content. He found her post by accident while browsing Reddit, recognized her, and then confronted her. She argued that since it's the internet, it's not cheating, and even suggested he join her for couple posts. He ended things because she didn't want to stop.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The main issue is whether posting explicit content online counts as cheating. The guy felt betrayed because she was sharing her body online, which he interpreted as infidelity. The girlfriend's stance is that it's just the internet, so it's not cheating. But the guy's reaction led to the breakup.\n\nNow, I should think about the definitions of cheating. Cheating typically involves a breach of trust, which can be physical or emotional. However, some people might consider sharing explicit content online without their partner's consent as a form of betrayal. The guy's trust was broken because he wasn't okay with her doing this. On the other hand, the girlfriend didn't see it as cheating, so she might not have intended to betray him.\n\nAnother angle is consent and communication. Did the girlfriend know that sharing such content would be a dealbreaker for her partner? If they had discussed boundaries earlier, maybe the outcome would have been different. Since the guy didn't mention prior discussions, it's possible that they didn't set clear boundaries. However, the guy's reaction was based on his personal feelings and trust issues, which are valid in a relationship.\n\nThe girlfriend's suggestion for him to join in might have made the situation worse. If she wasn't willing to stop after he expressed his feelings, maybe the breakup was a necessary step for him to protect his mental well-being.\n\nAlso, the guy's approach could be seen as harsh. He ended things suddenly and hasn't contacted her since, which might indicate he didn't give her a chance to explain or change her behavior. However, given the emotional impact of finding out, his decision could be justified if he felt it was the only way to move on.\n\nIn relationships, values and boundaries vary. What's acceptable to one person might not be to another. The key is mutual agreement on such matters. If the guy couldn't accept her actions and they couldn't find a compromise, ending the relationship might be the right choice for him, even if others disagree.\n\nSo, considering all this, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong because he acted based on his feelings of betrayal and the inability to trust his partner. However, there's a middle ground where communication could have been explored first. But since he felt that stopping the relationship was the only option after she refused to change, his decision is his own. The answer would be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
