Recently though she and I got into an argument about this, and now I\u2019m just not sure if I did the right thing. \n\nI was knackered after a night out so I do what I usually do after a night out. Lay in my bed and scroll through reddit till i realise I should sleep. So I\u2019m scrolling and I\u2019m not sure if this is just me, but when I see a porn post or an NSFW post in general I click it. So I just see a gonewild post and think \u201coh cool\u201d and click on it. Still reeling from \u00a31 night at the club I didn\u2019t immediately notice it was my girlfriend, but something was familiar about the post. The bed looked familiar, so did the overall room, but then I saw her body realised \u201cwait that\u2019s my girlfriend\u201d. I was mostly in shock and just started looking through her history and what I saw confirmed that it was 100% her.  Just filled with a mixed ball of emotion I decided I should sleep, but I couldn\u2019t. \n\nSo I waited till the morning my mind going mad. Eventually I texted her confronting her about it. I got a bit aggy saying how I felt like she was cheating on me and she was saying to me that since it was the internet it wasn\u2019t cheating. In all honesty I said some nasty things and I could tell she wasn\u2019t having a good time either. Said to her that I would like her to stop posting, and if she doesn\u2019t then I didn\u2019t really want to continue things with her. She started saying loads of stuff even suggesting I join her for couple posts? In the end I realised she didn\u2019t want to stop so I ended things then and there. Haven\u2019t messaged her since and my mates are aggy at me asking what was going on. I\u2019m not going to expose her, but this is a bit much for me right now. \n\nAITA\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of the AITA post is in the wrong for breaking up with his girlfriend after she posted something on gonewild. First, I need to understand the situation.\n\nThe author found his girlfriend's profile on a site like Gonewild, which is known for adult content. He clicked on a post and realized it was her. He confronted her the next day, got into an argument, and eventually broke up because she didn't want to stop posting. He says he felt like she was cheating, but she argued that online isn't cheating. The question is whether he's in the wrong for ending the relationship.\n\nHmm. So, the key points here are about cheating, boundaries, and consent. The author believes that her posting explicit content online, even if not with someone else, is equivalent to cheating. But she doesn't see it that way. \n\nFirst, cheating typically involves a betrayal in the relationship, like engaging in sexual activity with someone else. However, sharing explicit content online, even if it's self-produced, can be a gray area. Some people might consider it a form of emotional infidelity or a breach of trust, especially if it was done without the partner's consent. The author didn't know about this until he found the post, so it was a secret. That could be a problem because transparency is important in relationships. \n\nBut then again, the girlfriend might have a privacy right to her own content. If she's not sharing it with others in a way that's compromising their relationship (like with other people), some might say it's her choice. However, the fact that she didn't disclose this and the author felt it was a betrayal could mean that there was a different understanding between them about what constitutes cheating.\n\nThe author acted out of hurt and anger, confronting her and breaking up. He might not have considered her perspective or the reasons why she posted. Was she doing it for fun, as part of her identity, or for some other reason? The girlfriend suggesting couple posts might indicate she saw it as a shared activity, which the author found unacceptable. \n\nBut the main issue is whether the author had the right to end the relationship. If they had clear boundaries and this was a breach, then maybe he's not wrong. However, if they never discussed this before, it's possible that he overreacted. However, the fact that she continued and didn't want to stop, combined with the argument where she dismissed his feelings, might justify his decision. \n\nIn many relationships, trust and communication are key. If one partner values privacy and the other sees it as cheating, they have conflicting expectations. The author's actions were based on his values and how he felt about the betrayal. But whether he's in the wrong depends on the context of their relationship and prior agreements. Since the girlfriend was nonchalant and suggested including him, maybe she didn't realize his discomfort. The author's reaction is understandable, but maybe he should have discussed it more before breaking up. However, the decision to break up is his choice, and he's not in the wrong for prioritizing his feelings and the trust in the relationship.\n"
