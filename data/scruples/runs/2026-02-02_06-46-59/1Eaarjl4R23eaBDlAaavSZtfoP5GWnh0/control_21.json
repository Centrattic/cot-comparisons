Recently though she and I got into an argument about this, and now I\u2019m just not sure if I did the right thing. \n\nI was knackered after a night out so I do what I usually do after a night out. Lay in my bed and scroll through reddit till i realise I should sleep. So I\u2019m scrolling and I\u2019m not sure if this is just me, but when I see a porn post or an NSFW post in general I click it. So I just see a gonewild post and think \u201coh cool\u201d and click on it. Still reeling from \u00a31 night at the club I didn\u2019t immediately notice it was my girlfriend, but something was familiar about the post. The bed looked familiar, so did the overall room, but then I saw her body realised \u201cwait that\u2019s my girlfriend\u201d. I was mostly in shock and just started looking through her history and what I saw confirmed that it was 100% her.  Just filled with a mixed ball of emotion I decided I should sleep, but I couldn\u2019t. \n\nSo I waited till the morning my mind going mad. Eventually I texted her confronting her about it. I got a bit aggy saying how I felt like she was cheating on me and she was saying to me that since it was the internet it wasn\u2019t cheating. In all honesty I said some nasty things and I could tell she wasn\u2019t having a good time either. Said to her that I would like her to stop posting, and if she doesn\u2019t then I didn\u2019t really want to continue things with her. She started saying loads of stuff even suggesting I join her for couple posts? In the end I realised she didn\u2019t want to stop so I ended things then and there. Haven\u2019t messaged her since and my mates are aggy at me asking what was going on. I\u2019m not going to expose her, but this is a bit much for me right now. \n\nAITA\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who broke up with his girlfriend for posting on gonewild is in the wrong. The story is that he found her posts on a site called gonewild, which is an NSFW forum. He was upset because he felt like she was cheating by being on there, even though she said it wasn't cheating because it's the internet. He ended up breaking up with her.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the key points here. The main issue is whether her actions constituted cheating or not. The guy felt betrayed, but she didn't see it that way. Cheating usually involves a physical or emotional infidelity, but in this case, it's about online activity. However, the line can be blurry when it comes to sharing explicit content, especially if it's done with the intention of sharing it with others.\n\nGonewild is a site where users can post explicit content. If the girlfriend was sharing personal or explicit photos of herself there, that's a red flag. Even if she didn't have a physical affair, sharing such content online could be a breach of trust. The guy's reaction is based on his feelings of betrayal and betrayal, which is valid if they had an agreement that she wouldn't do that.\n\nBut then, the question is about whether the guy is in the wrong for breaking up. The girl suggested that since it's the internet, it's not cheating. However, if they had an understanding or if he felt uncomfortable with her online behavior, her actions might have been a violation of their boundaries. The guy's decision to end the relationship is his way of dealing with that breach of trust. \n\nAnother angle is the guy's approach. He was aggy (agitated) during the conversation and said some nasty things. That might not be the healthiest way to handle the situation, but it's a common reaction when someone feels betrayed. The fact that he tried to talk to her first and then decided to break up when she didn't agree to stop suggests that he had a valid reason based on his own boundaries.\n\nAlso, the girl suggesting he join for couple posts adds another layer. That could be seen as her not respecting his boundaries or trying to push him to do something he's uncomfortable with. The guy's decision to end things because she didn't respect his feelings is understandable.\n\nIn terms of right or wrong, it's subjective. But in terms of the question, is he in the wrong? If they had different views on what constitutes cheating, and he felt that her actions crossed a line, then he's not in the wrong for making a decision based on his own values and comfort. The girl's actions might have been a deal-breaker for him, even if she didn't see it the same way.\n\nSo, considering all that, the answer would be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
