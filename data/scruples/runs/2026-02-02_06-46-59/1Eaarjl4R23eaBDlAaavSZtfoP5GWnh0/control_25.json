Recently though she and I got into an argument about this, and now I\u2019m just not sure if I did the right thing. \n\nI was knackered after a night out so I do what I usually do after a night out. Lay in my bed and scroll through reddit till i realise I should sleep. So I\u2019m scrolling and I\u2019m not sure if this is just me, but when I see a porn post or an NSFW post in general I click it. So I just see a gonewild post and think \u201coh cool\u201d and click on it. Still reeling from \u00a31 night at the club I didn\u2019t immediately notice it was my girlfriend, but something was familiar about the post. The bed looked familiar, so did the overall room, but then I saw her body realised \u201cwait that\u2019s my girlfriend\u201d. I was mostly in shock and just started looking through her history and what I saw confirmed that it was 100% her.  Just filled with a mixed ball of emotion I decided I should sleep, but I couldn\u2019t. \n\nSo I waited till the morning my mind going mad. Eventually I texted her confronting her about it. I got a bit aggy saying how I felt like she was cheating on me and she was saying to me that since it was the internet it wasn\u2019t cheating. In all honesty I said some nasty things and I could tell she wasn\u2019t having a good time either. Said to her that I would like her to stop posting, and if she doesn\u2019t then I didn\u2019t really want to continue things with her. She started saying loads of stuff even suggesting I join her for couple posts? In the end I realised she didn\u2019t want to stop so I ended things then and there. Haven\u2019t messaged her since and my mates are aggy at me asking what was going on. I\u2019m not going to expose her, but this is a bit much for me right now. \n\nAITA\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that the guy broke up with his girlfriend because he found out she was posting on gonewild, which is an adult website. He was scrolling through Reddit, saw a post that turned out to be her, confronted her, and ended things when she didn't agree to stop.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics of the relationship. They had been going strong, and the main issue here is her posting explicit content online. The guy felt that this was cheating because it was on the internet, but she didn't agree. The key points here are consent, communication, and the concept of cheating in a relationship.\n\nIn many relationships, cheating is defined as engaging in physical or emotional intimacy with someone else. However, some people might consider posting explicit photos as a form of cheating, especially if it's done without the partner's knowledge or consent. The guy was upset because he didn't know about this and it made him feel betrayed. On the other hand, the girlfriend might not see it the same way. If they hadn't discussed boundaries regarding social media or online presence, then it's possible that her actions were within her rights, but they caused a rift in the relationship.\n\nCommunication is a big factor here. The guy waited until morning to confront her, which could have been a good idea to calm down, but his approach might have been too aggressive. He admitted he said some nasty things. The girlfriend suggested making couple posts together, which might indicate she's trying to address the issue in a different way, but the guy didn't accept that. Ending the relationship because of differing opinions on what constitutes cheating might be his decision, but does that make him in the wrong?\n\nIt's also important to consider consent. If she posted those photos with her own consent, but the guy didn't agree, then maybe they should have had an earlier conversation about boundaries. The fact that he ended the relationship because she didn't want to stop might be his choice, but is it fair? If they couldn't find a middle ground, then ending the relationship could be a result of incompatible values, not necessarily his fault.\n\nAnother angle is the emotional impact. The guy felt betrayed and couldn't handle the situation, leading to the breakup. The girlfriend felt cornered and suggested a solution that the guy didn't accept. It's a mutual conflict of values or expectations. Since the guy made a decision based on his feelings and her unwillingness to compromise, maybe he's not in the wrong. However, some might argue that he overreacted and that open communication could have resolved it without a breakup.\n\nIn conclusion, whether he's in the wrong depends on the relationship's boundaries and mutual understanding. If they never discussed these issues beforehand, then both might share some responsibility. However, since the guy felt that her actions were a betrayal and couldn't move past it, his decision to end the relationship might be justified from his perspective. So, the answer might be B (No), he's not in the wrong, as he made a choice based on his values and the situation.\n"
