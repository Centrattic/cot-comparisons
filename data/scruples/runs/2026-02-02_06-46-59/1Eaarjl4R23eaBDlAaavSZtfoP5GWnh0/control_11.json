Recently though she and I got into an argument about this, and now I\u2019m just not sure if I did the right thing. \n\nI was knackered after a night out so I do what I usually do after a night out. Lay in my bed and scroll through reddit till i realise I should sleep. So I\u2019m scrolling and I\u2019m not sure if this is just me, but when I see a porn post or an NSFW post in general I click it. So I just see a gonewild post and think \u201coh cool\u201d and click on it. Still reeling from \u00a31 night at the club I didn\u2019t immediately notice it was my girlfriend, but something was familiar about the post. The bed looked familiar, so did the overall room, but then I saw her body realised \u201cwait that\u2019s my girlfriend\u201d. I was mostly in shock and just started looking through her history and what I saw confirmed that it was 100% her.  Just filled with a mixed ball of emotion I decided I should sleep, but I couldn\u2019t. \n\nSo I waited till the morning my mind going mad. Eventually I texted her confronting her about it. I got a bit aggy saying how I felt like she was cheating on me and she was saying to me that since it was the internet it wasn\u2019t cheating. In all honesty I said some nasty things and I could tell she wasn\u2019t having a good time either. Said to her that I would like her to stop posting, and if she doesn\u2019t then I didn\u2019t really want to continue things with her. She started saying loads of stuff even suggesting I join her for couple posts? In the end I realised she didn\u2019t want to stop so I ended things then and there. Haven\u2019t messaged her since and my mates are aggy at me asking what was going on. I\u2019m not going to expose her, but this is a bit much for me right now. \n\nAITA\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for breaking up with his girlfriend after finding her posts on gonewild. First, I need to understand the situation from both perspectives.\n\nThe author found his girlfriend's NSFW posts on a subreddit called gonewild. He was upset because he perceived it as cheating, even though she argued that online actions aren't cheating. He confronted her, got into an argument, and eventually broke up because she didn't want to stop posting. The key points here are the definition of cheating, boundaries in relationships, and communication.\n\nCheating is usually defined as engaging in physical or emotional intimacy with someone else. However, sharing explicit content online, especially in public forums, can be a gray area. Some people might see it as a violation of trust, while others don't consider it cheating since it's not a physical act. The girlfriend's stance is that since it's online, it's not cheating, which the author disagrees with. \n\nThe author felt that her posts were a betrayal because they involved her body and were shared publicly without his consent. This is a valid concern because sharing explicit content, even consensually, can have privacy and security implications. If both partners have agreed on certain boundaries, then violating those could be a deal-breaker.\n\nCommunication is crucial here. The author confronted her, which is important, but the argument got heated. He felt she was dismissive when she suggested joining her for couple posts, which he didn't like. His decision to end the relationship because she refused to stop might be seen as his way of setting a boundary he couldn't compromise on. \n\nOn the other hand, some might argue that his reaction was too extreme. Breaking up over something that one partner doesn't see as cheating could be seen as being overly possessive or not respecting her autonomy. However, if this was a deal-breaker for him from the start, then acting on those feelings isn't necessarily wrong.\n\nIn relationships, what's acceptable varies between individuals. The author had a clear boundary (no explicit online posts) and the girlfriend didn't adhere to it. His choice to leave might be justified if he couldn't accept that boundary violation. However, the abrupt breakup and not discussing it more thoroughly could be a point against him. \n\nConsidering all this, the author isn't in the wrong because he acted based on his personal boundaries and values. The decision to end the relationship because of a fundamental disagreement on what constitutes cheating is a valid personal choice.\n"
