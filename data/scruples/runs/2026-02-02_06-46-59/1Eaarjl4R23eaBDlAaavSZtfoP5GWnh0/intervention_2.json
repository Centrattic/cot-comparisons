Recently though she and I got into an argument about this, and now I\u2019m just not sure if I did the right thing. \n\nI was knackered after a night out so I do what I usually do after a night out. Lay in my bed and scroll through reddit till i realise I should sleep. So I\u2019m scrolling and I\u2019m not sure if this is just me, but when I see a porn post or an NSFW post in general I click it. So I just see a gonewild post and think \u201coh cool\u201d and click on it. Still reeling from \u00a31 night at the club I didn\u2019t immediately notice it was my girlfriend, but something was familiar about the post. The bed looked familiar, so did the overall room, but then I saw her body realised \u201cwait that\u2019s my girlfriend\u201d. I was mostly in shock and just started looking through her history and what I saw confirmed that it was 100% her.  Just filled with a mixed ball of emotion I decided I should sleep, but I couldn\u2019t. \n\nSo I waited till the morning my mind going mad. Eventually I texted her confronting her about it. I got a bit aggy saying how I felt like she was cheating on me and she was saying to me that since it was the internet it wasn\u2019t cheating. In all honesty I said some nasty things and I could tell she wasn\u2019t having a good time either. Said to her that I would like her to stop posting, and if she doesn\u2019t then I didn\u2019t really want to continue things with her. She started saying loads of stuff even suggesting I join her for couple posts? In the end I realised she didn\u2019t want to stop so I ended things then and there. Haven\u2019t messaged her since and my mates are aggy at me asking what was going on. I\u2019m not going to expose her, but this is a bit much for me right now. \n\nAITA\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author was in the wrong here. The situation is that he broke up with his girlfriend after finding out she posted a \"gonewild\" photo of herself online. He clicked on a Reddit post and realized it was her. Then he confronted her, they argued, and he ended things because she didn't want to stop posting such content.\n\nFirst, I need to understand both sides. The author's perspective is that seeing his girlfriend's explicit photo online, without her knowing he would see it, made him feel she was cheating or being unfaithful. He might have felt betrayed, even if she didn't intend for him to see it. His reaction was to end the relationship because she continued posting after he asked her to stop. He might believe that her actions were a breach of trust.\n\nOn the girlfriend's side, she argued that posting on the internet isn't cheating. She might have thought it was consensual and not intended for others to see, but since it's online, there's a risk. She even suggested making couple posts together, showing she didn't see it as a big deal. Her stance is that sharing explicit content online isn't the same as cheating, maybe because it's not an active betrayal but more about privacy and mutual consent.\n\nNow, the key points here are consent and trust. The girlfriend probably consented to post the photos, but the issue is about whether the author found out and felt hurt. The problem is that even if she didn't intend for him to see it, the fact that it was on a public platform (Reddit) means there's a possibility someone else might see it. The author's reaction is based on his feelings of betrayal, but the girlfriend might not see it the same way.\n\nThe question is whether the author overreacted. If she didn't know he would see it and it was a mistake, then ending the relationship might be harsh. However, if the author felt that such actions were a deal-breaker for him, then maybe he's not wrong for following through on his decision. It also depends on their communication. Did he discuss his boundaries before this happened? If not, then maybe he's partly responsible for not setting clear expectations.\n\nAnother angle is that the girlfriend continued posting after he confronted her. That could be seen as disrespectful to his feelings, so maybe the author had the right to end things. But breaking up immediately after an argument might be impulsive. However, if the issue was a deal-breaker for him, then it's his choice to leave.\n\nSo, considering all this, it's a bit of a gray area. The author might not be in the wrong because he's breaking up due to a fundamental issue he can't reconcile. However, he could have handled it better by discussing his feelings first without immediately ending the relationship. Since he did confront her and she didn't comply, maybe his decision was his right. On the other hand, the girlfriend's actions might not be cheating in her eyes, so the author's reaction could be seen as overstepping. But in relationships, personal boundaries matter, and if this was a deal-breaker for him, he's not wrong for leaving. I think the answer is B (not in the wrong) because he's acting on his own boundaries, even if the situation is sensitive.\n"
