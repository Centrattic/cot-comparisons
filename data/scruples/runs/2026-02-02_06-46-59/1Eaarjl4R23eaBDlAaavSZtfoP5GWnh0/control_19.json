Recently though she and I got into an argument about this, and now I\u2019m just not sure if I did the right thing. \n\nI was knackered after a night out so I do what I usually do after a night out. Lay in my bed and scroll through reddit till i realise I should sleep. So I\u2019m scrolling and I\u2019m not sure if this is just me, but when I see a porn post or an NSFW post in general I click it. So I just see a gonewild post and think \u201coh cool\u201d and click on it. Still reeling from \u00a31 night at the club I didn\u2019t immediately notice it was my girlfriend, but something was familiar about the post. The bed looked familiar, so did the overall room, but then I saw her body realised \u201cwait that\u2019s my girlfriend\u201d. I was mostly in shock and just started looking through her history and what I saw confirmed that it was 100% her.  Just filled with a mixed ball of emotion I decided I should sleep, but I couldn\u2019t. \n\nSo I waited till the morning my mind going mad. Eventually I texted her confronting her about it. I got a bit aggy saying how I felt like she was cheating on me and she was saying to me that since it was the internet it wasn\u2019t cheating. In all honesty I said some nasty things and I could tell she wasn\u2019t having a good time either. Said to her that I would like her to stop posting, and if she doesn\u2019t then I didn\u2019t really want to continue things with her. She started saying loads of stuff even suggesting I join her for couple posts? In the end I realised she didn\u2019t want to stop so I ended things then and there. Haven\u2019t messaged her since and my mates are aggy at me asking what was going on. I\u2019m not going to expose her, but this is a bit much for me right now. \n\nAITA\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that the author broke up with his girlfriend after finding out she had a GoWild post of herself. He was upset because he felt like she was cheating, but she said that since it was online, it wasn't cheating. The user is asking if they're the a**hole here.\n\nFirst, I need to consider their perspectives. The author found out his girlfriend was posting explicit content online. He felt betrayed, leading to him breaking up. The girlfriend's viewpoint is that posting on GoWild isn't cheating because it's the internet, and she even suggested they do it together as a couple. \n\nSo, is the author right to break up? Well, cheating definitions can be subjective. Some people consider sharing explicit content with others as cheating, especially if it's done without the partner's knowledge. The girlfriend might not see it the same way, but the author obviously did. \n\nHe confronted her and she didn't want to stop, leading him to end the relationship. That seems like a valid reason for him if he can't accept that part of her. But maybe he overreacted? If she had a mutual understanding with him beforehand, maybe not. But the key here is communication. Did they discuss boundaries about online activities? If not, then both might share some blame for not communicating. \n\nThe author is in a tough spot because he felt betrayed. However, breaking up immediately after an argument where he said some harsh things might not be the healthiest approach. But given the circumstances, if this was a dealbreaker for him, then ending the relationship makes sense. \n\nThe girlfriend's suggestion to join her in posting couple content might have pushed him over the edge. She didn't seem to understand his feelings, which could be a big red flag. \n\nIn terms of right or wrong, it's not black and white. The author's actions stem from feeling hurt and betrayed. If he couldn't handle her online activities, breaking up was his choice. But was he wrong? If the relationship had other issues or if he didn't address them earlier, maybe. However, from the given info, he acted based on his feelings. \n\nSo, considering all angles, the answer would be B (No, he's not in the wrong) because he made a choice based on his feelings and boundaries, even if it's a tough decision.\n"
