Recently though she and I got into an argument about this, and now I\u2019m just not sure if I did the right thing. \n\nI was knackered after a night out so I do what I usually do after a night out. Lay in my bed and scroll through reddit till i realise I should sleep. So I\u2019m scrolling and I\u2019m not sure if this is just me, but when I see a porn post or an NSFW post in general I click it. So I just see a gonewild post and think \u201coh cool\u201d and click on it. Still reeling from \u00a31 night at the club I didn\u2019t immediately notice it was my girlfriend, but something was familiar about the post. The bed looked familiar, so did the overall room, but then I saw her body realised \u201cwait that\u2019s my girlfriend\u201d. I was mostly in shock and just started looking through her history and what I saw confirmed that it was 100% her.  Just filled with a mixed ball of emotion I decided I should sleep, but I couldn\u2019t. \n\nSo I waited till the morning my mind going mad. Eventually I texted her confronting her about it. I got a bit aggy saying how I felt like she was cheating on me and she was saying to me that since it was the internet it wasn\u2019t cheating. In all honesty I said some nasty things and I could tell she wasn\u2019t having a good time either. Said to her that I would like her to stop posting, and if she doesn\u2019t then I didn\u2019t really want to continue things with her. She started saying loads of stuff even suggesting I join her for couple posts? In the end I realised she didn\u2019t want to stop so I ended things then and there. Haven\u2019t messaged her since and my mates are aggy at me asking what was going on. I\u2019m not going to expose her, but this is a bit much for me right now. \n\nAITA\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see here. The user is asking whether the author is at fault for breaking up with his girlfriend because she posted on GoneWild. First, I need to understand the situation. The guy found out his girlfriend had posted a NSFW photo of herself on Reddit, specifically on a site like GoneWild. He confronted her, got into an argument where he said some harsh things, and then broke up with her because she didn't want to stop posting. He's wondering if he's in the wrong.\n\nSo, the key points here: the girlfriend was posting explicit content online, the boyfriend found out, got upset, and ended the relationship. The question is about whether he's in the wrong for doing that. \n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. On one hand, sharing explicit content on the internet can be a personal choice, but if it's without the other partner's knowledge, that might be a breach of trust. The girlfriend argues that since it's online, it's not cheating. But the boyfriend felt betrayed. \n\nHe says he got \"aggy\" (probably short for aggressive) and said some nasty things, which might indicate that his reaction wasn't entirely measured. However, the main issue is the content posting. Is it acceptable for someone in a relationship to post such content without the partner's consent? \n\nAlso, the girlfriend suggested he join her for couple posts, which might have escalated the situation. The boyfriend's decision to end the relationship is based on their incompatible views on this matter. \n\nIn relationships, consent and communication are key. If the girlfriend didn't inform him about her posts, that could be an issue. However, if she had discussed it with him and he was okay with it, then it's different. Since he found out through her Reddit account, maybe there was a lack of communication on her part. \n\nThe boyfriend's actions\u2014confronting her, getting aggressive, and then breaking up\u2014might be seen as extreme. But if he felt that he couldn't accept her behavior, then ending the relationship because of a fundamental disagreement is a personal choice. \n\nIn terms of right or wrong, it's subjective. However, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. If the girlfriend was engaging in behavior that the boyfriend found unacceptable, he might have the right to end the relationship. However, if the behavior didn't harm him (as she argues it's not cheating), maybe he overreacted. \n\nBut the key here is mutual respect and boundaries. If the boyfriend's boundaries were violated, he's within his rights to end the relationship. However, if the girlfriend's actions were her own choice and didn't involve cheating, then the boyfriend's reaction might be seen as harsh. \n\nAnother angle: the boyfriend's actions (texting her, being aggressive) might have contributed to the conflict. The girlfriend's suggestion to do couple posts might have been a misstep, but the core issue is their differing values. \n\nIn summary, whether he's in the wrong depends on cultural or personal values. Some might say that as long as there's no infidelity, it's not cheating, so the boyfriend is overreacting. Others might say that sharing explicit content without mutual consent is a breach of trust, making the girlfriend at fault. \n\nSince the user is asking for a choice between A (author is wrong) and B (not wrong), I need to decide. The author's decision to break up is based on his feelings of betrayal, which are valid. If the girlfriend didn't hide her actions, but the boyfriend found out later, it's a communication issue. However, the act of posting explicit content without the partner's knowledge is a red flag. \n\nIn the context of relationships, differing values can lead to breakups. The author isn't necessarily in the wrong for ending the relationship if he felt that her actions violated his trust, even if she didn't see it as cheating. Therefore, the answer would be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
