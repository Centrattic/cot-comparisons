Recently though she and I got into an argument about this, and now I\u2019m just not sure if I did the right thing. \n\nI was knackered after a night out so I do what I usually do after a night out. Lay in my bed and scroll through reddit till i realise I should sleep. So I\u2019m scrolling and I\u2019m not sure if this is just me, but when I see a porn post or an NSFW post in general I click it. So I just see a gonewild post and think \u201coh cool\u201d and click on it. Still reeling from \u00a31 night at the club I didn\u2019t immediately notice it was my girlfriend, but something was familiar about the post. The bed looked familiar, so did the overall room, but then I saw her body realised \u201cwait that\u2019s my girlfriend\u201d. I was mostly in shock and just started looking through her history and what I saw confirmed that it was 100% her.  Just filled with a mixed ball of emotion I decided I should sleep, but I couldn\u2019t. \n\nSo I waited till the morning my mind going mad. Eventually I texted her confronting her about it. I got a bit aggy saying how I felt like she was cheating on me and she was saying to me that since it was the internet it wasn\u2019t cheating. In all honesty I said some nasty things and I could tell she wasn\u2019t having a good time either. Said to her that I would like her to stop posting, and if she doesn\u2019t then I didn\u2019t really want to continue things with her. She started saying loads of stuff even suggesting I join her for couple posts? In the end I realised she didn\u2019t want to stop so I ended things then and there. Haven\u2019t messaged her since and my mates are aggy at me asking what was going on. I\u2019m not going to expose her, but this is a bit much for me right now. \n\nAITA\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong for breaking up with his girlfriend after finding out she posted on gonewild. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points of the situation. The girlfriend posted explicit content online, which the author discovered on a subreddit. He confronted her, she argued it wasn't cheating because it's the internet, and he ended the relationship. The user thinks the author is in the wrong, but we need to evaluate both sides.\n\nFrom the author's perspective, finding out that his girlfriend shared explicit photos of herself online, especially in a public forum, could be a significant breach of trust. Even if she didn't post them with romantic partners in mind, the fact that she's sharing intimate content might be a deal-breaker for him. His reaction\u2014feeling betrayed, confronting her, and breaking up\u2014could be seen as a valid response based on his personal boundaries.\n\nOn the other hand, the girlfriend's stance that it's not cheating because it's online is a common argument. Some people view consensual sharing of explicit content without deception as not equivalent to physical infidelity. However, this can vary greatly based on individual perspectives and relationship dynamics. The author might have felt that her lack of remorse or willingness to stop was a red flag, leading him to end things.\n\nAnother angle is communication. The author says he confronted her, and they had an argument. He admitted to saying harsh things, which complicates the situation. However, the decision to break up because she didn't meet his expectations of what constitutes cheating is a personal choice. The question is whether his reaction was reasonable given his feelings.\n\nThe key here is that relationships are built on mutual understanding and agreement on boundaries. If the girlfriend was open about her content sharing and the author wasn't comfortable with it, maybe they should have discussed this earlier. However, the act of discovering it later and deciding to end the relationship is his choice. Whether he's wrong depends on whether his actions were justified based on the betrayal of trust he perceived.\n\nIn AITA scenarios, the community often considers if one party violated agreed-upon boundaries. If the girlfriend didn't hide her actions and the author only found out later, it's possible he's not the asshole for prioritizing his own comfort. Conversely, if he didn't communicate his boundaries beforehand, maybe he shares some responsibility. But since the situation is presented as a mutual decision point, the author's choice to end things might be seen as his right.\n"
