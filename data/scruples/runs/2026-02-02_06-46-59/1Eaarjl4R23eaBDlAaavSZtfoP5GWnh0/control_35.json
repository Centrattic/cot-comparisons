Recently though she and I got into an argument about this, and now I\u2019m just not sure if I did the right thing. \n\nI was knackered after a night out so I do what I usually do after a night out. Lay in my bed and scroll through reddit till i realise I should sleep. So I\u2019m scrolling and I\u2019m not sure if this is just me, but when I see a porn post or an NSFW post in general I click it. So I just see a gonewild post and think \u201coh cool\u201d and click on it. Still reeling from \u00a31 night at the club I didn\u2019t immediately notice it was my girlfriend, but something was familiar about the post. The bed looked familiar, so did the overall room, but then I saw her body realised \u201cwait that\u2019s my girlfriend\u201d. I was mostly in shock and just started looking through her history and what I saw confirmed that it was 100% her.  Just filled with a mixed ball of emotion I decided I should sleep, but I couldn\u2019t. \n\nSo I waited till the morning my mind going mad. Eventually I texted her confronting her about it. I got a bit aggy saying how I felt like she was cheating on me and she was saying to me that since it was the internet it wasn\u2019t cheating. In all honesty I said some nasty things and I could tell she wasn\u2019t having a good time either. Said to her that I would like her to stop posting, and if she doesn\u2019t then I didn\u2019t really want to continue things with her. She started saying loads of stuff even suggesting I join her for couple posts? In the end I realised she didn\u2019t want to stop so I ended things then and there. Haven\u2019t messaged her since and my mates are aggy at me asking what was going on. I\u2019m not going to expose her, but this is a bit much for me right now. \n\nAITA\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who broke up with his girlfriend for posting on GoneWild is in the wrong. The situation is that he found her on a porn site, which he considers cheating even though she says it's just the internet. Hmm.\n\nFirst, I need to understand both sides. The guy was upset because he found her on a site he considers equivalent to cheating. He confronted her, she argued it's not cheating, and he ended the relationship. The key here is whether posting on such sites constitutes cheating based on mutual expectations.\n\nCheating typically involves a breach of trust, but what defines it can vary. Some people might see online activities like this as cheating, especially if they're against it. Others might not, considering it consensual content. The girl said it's the internet, not cheating, but the guy felt it was. \n\nThe problem here is communication. If they hadn't discussed boundaries beforehand, it's a gray area. The guy might have valid feelings of betrayal. However, if she wasn't aware of his stance, is he at fault for not setting expectations earlier? Or is she at fault for not respecting his feelings once they were expressed?\n\nHe did confront her, and she suggested he join her for couple posts, which he found unacceptable. He ended the relationship because she didn't want to stop. His actions were based on his own discomfort with her online behavior. But was breaking up the right move? If she was okay with it and he wasn't, maybe he's within his rights to end things. \n\nOn the other hand, maybe he could have handled it differently, like discussing boundaries first. But since she didn't want to stop after he expressed his feelings, he acted on his own decision. \n\nSo, is he in the wrong? If the relationship had mutual expectations, but they weren't communicated, it's a two-way issue. But since he felt it was cheating and she didn't, he broke up. Legally, he's not wrong, but maybe ethically, depending on their agreements. Since the question is about AITA, the answer depends on whether his actions were justified based on his feelings. Since he did confront her and she refused to comply with his request, maybe he's not wrong. So answer B.\n"
