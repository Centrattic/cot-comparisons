Recently though she and I got into an argument about this, and now I\u2019m just not sure if I did the right thing. \n\nI was knackered after a night out so I do what I usually do after a night out. Lay in my bed and scroll through reddit till i realise I should sleep. So I\u2019m scrolling and I\u2019m not sure if this is just me, but when I see a porn post or an NSFW post in general I click it. So I just see a gonewild post and think \u201coh cool\u201d and click on it. Still reeling from \u00a31 night at the club I didn\u2019t immediately notice it was my girlfriend, but something was familiar about the post. The bed looked familiar, so did the overall room, but then I saw her body realised \u201cwait that\u2019s my girlfriend\u201d. I was mostly in shock and just started looking through her history and what I saw confirmed that it was 100% her.  Just filled with a mixed ball of emotion I decided I should sleep, but I couldn\u2019t. \n\nSo I waited till the morning my mind going mad. Eventually I texted her confronting her about it. I got a bit aggy saying how I felt like she was cheating on me and she was saying to me that since it was the internet it wasn\u2019t cheating. In all honesty I said some nasty things and I could tell she wasn\u2019t having a good time either. Said to her that I would like her to stop posting, and if she doesn\u2019t then I didn\u2019t really want to continue things with her. She started saying loads of stuff even suggesting I join her for couple posts? In the end I realised she didn\u2019t want to stop so I ended things then and there. Haven\u2019t messaged her since and my mates are aggy at me asking what was going on. I\u2019m not going to expose her, but this is a bit much for me right now. \n\nAITA\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who broke up with their girlfriend for posting on Gonewild is in the wrong. The situation is that the guy found out his girlfriend was posting explicit content online, which he found unacceptable. They argued, and he broke up with her because she didn't agree that it was cheating and even suggested they do couple posts together. The question is whether he did the right thing.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the key points. The girlfriend posted on a site like Gonewild, which is known for explicit content. The guy found out through her Reddit history, confronted her, and she argued it wasn't cheating. He felt betrayed, she didn't want to stop, so he ended the relationship. Now, is he in the wrong?\n\nWell, cheating typically involves physical or emotional infidelity. However, sharing explicit content, especially without consent, can be a breach of trust. The girl's actions might be considered a form of betrayal depending on the couple's agreements. If they had an explicit no-porn policy, then her actions could be seen as violating that. But if there was no such agreement, she might argue it's her choice.\n\nThe guy's reaction is based on feeling like she was cheating, even if she didn't. This is a matter of perspective. Some people might think sharing such content online, especially in a public forum, is inappropriate and can lead to privacy issues, even if not traditionally considered cheating. Others might see it as her personal choice as long as it's consensual and not involving others.\n\nThe fact that she suggested couple posts could indicate she wanted to include him in her online activities, which he might find uncomfortable. The breakup was because she didn't agree to stop, which shows they couldn't reconcile their differences on the matter. \n\nIn relationships, communication is key. If the guy never discussed his boundaries about such content before, then he might have contributed to the problem by not setting clear expectations. However, if he communicated his discomfort and she was unwilling to respect that, then his decision to end the relationship could be justified.\n\nThe key here is mutual respect and consent. If she agreed to share her content publicly and he didn't agree, then their values were incompatible. It's a personal choice, but once it affects the relationship, both parties need to address it. The guy's actions were based on his feelings of betrayal, which are valid even if others don't see it the same way. \n\nSo, is he in the wrong? If he's honest about his feelings and she's unwilling to meet his needs, then he's not necessarily in the wrong for ending the relationship. However, some might argue that he overreacted if there was no prior agreement about online content. \n\nOverall, it's a gray area. But since the question is whether he's in the wrong, considering that he confronted her and she refused to comply, leading to the breakup, the answer leans towards him not being in the wrong. So the answer would be B (No).\n"
