Recently though she and I got into an argument about this, and now I\u2019m just not sure if I did the right thing. \n\nI was knackered after a night out so I do what I usually do after a night out. Lay in my bed and scroll through reddit till i realise I should sleep. So I\u2019m scrolling and I\u2019m not sure if this is just me, but when I see a porn post or an NSFW post in general I click it. So I just see a gonewild post and think \u201coh cool\u201d and click on it. Still reeling from \u00a31 night at the club I didn\u2019t immediately notice it was my girlfriend, but something was familiar about the post. The bed looked familiar, so did the overall room, but then I saw her body realised \u201cwait that\u2019s my girlfriend\u201d. I was mostly in shock and just started looking through her history and what I saw confirmed that it was 100% her.  Just filled with a mixed ball of emotion I decided I should sleep, but I couldn\u2019t. \n\nSo I waited till the morning my mind going mad. Eventually I texted her confronting her about it. I got a bit aggy saying how I felt like she was cheating on me and she was saying to me that since it was the internet it wasn\u2019t cheating. In all honesty I said some nasty things and I could tell she wasn\u2019t having a good time either. Said to her that I would like her to stop posting, and if she doesn\u2019t then I didn\u2019t really want to continue things with her. She started saying loads of stuff even suggesting I join her for couple posts? In the end I realised she didn\u2019t want to stop so I ended things then and there. Haven\u2019t messaged her since and my mates are aggy at me asking what was going on. I\u2019m not going to expose her, but this is a bit much for me right now. \n\nAITA\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for breaking up with his girlfriend because she posted on GoneWild. First, I need to understand the situation clearly.\n\nThe girlfriend and the author were in a relationship that was going well until this incident. The author found out that his girlfriend was on GoneWild, which is a site for explicit content. He stumbled upon her post while browsing Reddit, didn't realize it was her at first, but then became upset. They had an argument where he felt she was cheating because it's the internet, and she didn't see it that way. She even suggested he join her for couple posts, which he refused, leading him to break up.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. Let's consider both sides. On one hand, cheating typically involves physical or emotional infidelity, but some relationships have boundaries about sharing intimate content online. If the girlfriend didn't inform him about her posts and it violates their agreed-upon boundaries, then the author might feel betrayed. However, if there was no prior discussion about this, it's unclear if her actions were a breach of trust.\n\nOn the other hand, the author reacted strongly by breaking up without giving her a chance to explain. She argued that posting online isn't cheating, and maybe they could have discussed boundaries instead of immediately ending the relationship. The author might be overreacting, especially if the relationship was otherwise healthy. Also, the girlfriend suggested couple posts, which could indicate she wasn't aware of how he felt about it. \n\nBut the author's feelings are valid; if he finds her online activity unacceptable, he has the right to end the relationship. However, the method of confrontation was aggressive, and he might have handled it better with a calm discussion. The key points are: prior communication about boundaries, mutual respect, and whether the action (posting) was a deal-breaker. Without prior discussion, it's hard to say, but the author's reaction seems extreme. So maybe he's not in the wrong if the relationship couldn't overcome this issue, but perhaps there were better ways to handle it. However, since the user's own opinion is that the author is in the wrong, I need to check if that's correct. The answer is B (No) because personal boundaries and feelings, even if they seem minor to others, are valid in a relationship. If the author felt it was a deal-breaker, he's within his right to end things.\n"
