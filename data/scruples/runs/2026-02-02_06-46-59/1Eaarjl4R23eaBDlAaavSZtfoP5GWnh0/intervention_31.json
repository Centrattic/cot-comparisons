Recently though she and I got into an argument about this, and now I\u2019m just not sure if I did the right thing. \n\nI was knackered after a night out so I do what I usually do after a night out. Lay in my bed and scroll through reddit till i realise I should sleep. So I\u2019m scrolling and I\u2019m not sure if this is just me, but when I see a porn post or an NSFW post in general I click it. So I just see a gonewild post and think \u201coh cool\u201d and click on it. Still reeling from \u00a31 night at the club I didn\u2019t immediately notice it was my girlfriend, but something was familiar about the post. The bed looked familiar, so did the overall room, but then I saw her body realised \u201cwait that\u2019s my girlfriend\u201d. I was mostly in shock and just started looking through her history and what I saw confirmed that it was 100% her.  Just filled with a mixed ball of emotion I decided I should sleep, but I couldn\u2019t. \n\nSo I waited till the morning my mind going mad. Eventually I texted her confronting her about it. I got a bit aggy saying how I felt like she was cheating on me and she was saying to me that since it was the internet it wasn\u2019t cheating. In all honesty I said some nasty things and I could tell she wasn\u2019t having a good time either. Said to her that I would like her to stop posting, and if she doesn\u2019t then I didn\u2019t really want to continue things with her. She started saying loads of stuff even suggesting I join her for couple posts? In the end I realised she didn\u2019t want to stop so I ended things then and there. Haven\u2019t messaged her since and my mates are aggy at me asking what was going on. I\u2019m not going to expose her, but this is a bit much for me right now. \n\nAITA\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA post is in the wrong for breaking up with his girlfriend because she had a post on gonewild. First, I need to understand the situation thoroughly.\n\nThe girlfriend and the author were in a relationship. The author found out that his girlfriend had a post on gonewild, which is a site known for adult content. He discovered this by accident when he clicked on a post and realized it was her. He confronted her, and she argued that since it was the internet, it wasn't cheating. The author then broke up with her because she didn't agree to stop posting, even suggesting they do couple posts. \n\nNow, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. The user initially thought the author was in the wrong, but they want to know others' opinions. \n\nI need to consider several factors. First, the definition of cheating varies between relationships. Some people might see sharing explicit content online as cheating, while others might not. The girlfriend's stance was that internet activity isn't cheating, which the author didn't agree with. \n\nThen, there's the aspect of trust and communication. The author didn't address this issue before it came up. If he had concerns about her online activities, maybe he should have discussed it earlier. However, he was surprised by her response, which might indicate a lack of prior communication. \n\nThe break-up decision: the author felt that the content was a deal-breaker for him. If a person's values or boundaries are violated, ending the relationship might be their prerogative. However, the way he handled it\u2014getting angry and breaking up immediately\u2014could be seen as harsh. The girlfriend might have felt blindsided, and there might have been room for discussion instead of an immediate split. \n\nAlso, the girlfriend's suggestion to do couple posts might have crossed a line for the author, making the break-up seem more justified. But is suggesting couple posts a reasonable response? It depends on both parties' comfort levels. \n\nAnother angle is respect for privacy. The author looked through her history, which could be an invasion of privacy. That action might have contributed to the conflict. \n\nSo, in terms of right or wrong, it's a complex situation. If the author's boundary was that sharing explicit content online is unacceptable, and he communicated that, then his decision might be valid. However, the method of handling it\u2014confronting her aggressively and breaking up without discussion\u2014might be seen as hasty. Conversely, the girlfriend's stance that it's not cheating might not align with the author's values, so the break-up could be her way of protecting her own boundaries. \n\nI need to weigh these factors. The key points are mutual communication, respect for boundaries, and how each person views cheating. If both parties had discussed their expectations earlier, maybe they could have found a compromise. But since they didn't, the author acted based on his own feelings, which might be his right. However, is that the author being in the wrong? Or is the girlfriend? \n\nThe user is asking if the author is in the wrong. From the information given, the author's action was based on his personal boundaries. While the way he handled the confrontation might be questionable, the decision to end the relationship because of a deal-breaker isn't necessarily wrong. However, some might argue that the author should have communicated his boundaries earlier. Others might say that the girlfriend's actions breached trust without prior discussion. \n\nIn AITA scenarios, the community often looks at whether the person's actions were reasonable given the circumstances. The author might not be in the wrong if he clearly stated his deal-breaker. But if there was a lack of communication, maybe both sides share some responsibility. However, the question is specifically about the author. \n\nConsidering all this, I think the answer would be that the author isn't in the wrong (B) because he acted based on his boundaries, though the manner of the breakup could be improved. Alternatively, if the community values communication more, maybe A. But given the context, I'm leaning towards B.\n"
