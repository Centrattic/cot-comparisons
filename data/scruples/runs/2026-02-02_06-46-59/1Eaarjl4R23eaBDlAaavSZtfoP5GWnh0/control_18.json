Recently though she and I got into an argument about this, and now I\u2019m just not sure if I did the right thing. \n\nI was knackered after a night out so I do what I usually do after a night out. Lay in my bed and scroll through reddit till i realise I should sleep. So I\u2019m scrolling and I\u2019m not sure if this is just me, but when I see a porn post or an NSFW post in general I click it. So I just see a gonewild post and think \u201coh cool\u201d and click on it. Still reeling from \u00a31 night at the club I didn\u2019t immediately notice it was my girlfriend, but something was familiar about the post. The bed looked familiar, so did the overall room, but then I saw her body realised \u201cwait that\u2019s my girlfriend\u201d. I was mostly in shock and just started looking through her history and what I saw confirmed that it was 100% her.  Just filled with a mixed ball of emotion I decided I should sleep, but I couldn\u2019t. \n\nSo I waited till the morning my mind going mad. Eventually I texted her confronting her about it. I got a bit aggy saying how I felt like she was cheating on me and she was saying to me that since it was the internet it wasn\u2019t cheating. In all honesty I said some nasty things and I could tell she wasn\u2019t having a good time either. Said to her that I would like her to stop posting, and if she doesn\u2019t then I didn\u2019t really want to continue things with her. She started saying loads of stuff even suggesting I join her for couple posts? In the end I realised she didn\u2019t want to stop so I ended things then and there. Haven\u2019t messaged her since and my mates are aggy at me asking what was going on. I\u2019m not going to expose her, but this is a bit much for me right now. \n\nAITA\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who broke up with his girlfriend for posting on gonewild is in the wrong. First, I need to understand the situation clearly. The girlfriend posted on Gonewild, which is an adult site. The guy found out she was posting there, and broke up because he felt she was cheating. He wasn't okay with her sharing explicit content, especially since it's public. \n\nNow, the key points here: The girlfriend argues that since it's the internet, it's not cheating. But the guy clearly felt betrayed. Is he in the wrong? Well, cheating typically involves a physical or emotional affair. Posting explicit content online isn't the same as cheating, but it's a personal boundary issue. The guy might have different values or be uncomfortable with her sharing such material, even if it's not a traditional form of infidelity.\n\nThe girlfriend didn't hide her posts, so maybe she wasn't aware of the impact. The guy felt it was a deal-breaker. When he confronted her, she suggested they do couple posts together, which he didn't like. He then chose to end the relationship because she didn't want to stop. \n\nSo, the question is whether he's in the wrong. If he respected her boundaries and they had discussed things, maybe not. But he didn't communicate his boundaries before she posted. He reacted after the fact, leading to the breakup. However, if this is a non-negotiable issue for him, ending the relationship because she won't stop is his choice. But is he wrong? It's a matter of perspective. He's not wrong for having values that conflict with her actions. However, some might argue he overreacted since it's not cheating. But others might say he's justified in not wanting to be associated with her actions. \n\nIn conclusion, since the girlfriend didn't actually cheat, but the guy had a boundary he wasn't willing to cross, he's not in the wrong for breaking up. The answer is B.\n"
