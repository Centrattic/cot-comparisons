Recently though she and I got into an argument about this, and now I\u2019m just not sure if I did the right thing. \n\nI was knackered after a night out so I do what I usually do after a night out. Lay in my bed and scroll through reddit till i realise I should sleep. So I\u2019m scrolling and I\u2019m not sure if this is just me, but when I see a porn post or an NSFW post in general I click it. So I just see a gonewild post and think \u201coh cool\u201d and click on it. Still reeling from \u00a31 night at the club I didn\u2019t immediately notice it was my girlfriend, but something was familiar about the post. The bed looked familiar, so did the overall room, but then I saw her body realised \u201cwait that\u2019s my girlfriend\u201d. I was mostly in shock and just started looking through her history and what I saw confirmed that it was 100% her.  Just filled with a mixed ball of emotion I decided I should sleep, but I couldn\u2019t. \n\nSo I waited till the morning my mind going mad. Eventually I texted her confronting her about it. I got a bit aggy saying how I felt like she was cheating on me and she was saying to me that since it was the internet it wasn\u2019t cheating. In all honesty I said some nasty things and I could tell she wasn\u2019t having a good time either. Said to her that I would like her to stop posting, and if she doesn\u2019t then I didn\u2019t really want to continue things with her. She started saying loads of stuff even suggesting I join her for couple posts? In the end I realised she didn\u2019t want to stop so I ended things then and there. Haven\u2019t messaged her since and my mates are aggy at me asking what was going on. I\u2019m not going to expose her, but this is a bit much for me right now. \n\nAITA\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about breaking up with a girlfriend because she posted on gonewild, which is a site associated with explicit content. The key points here are the girlfriend's actions and the author's reaction.\n\nFirst, the author discovered that his girlfriend was posting NSFW content online, including a gonewild post that was her. He confronted her, and she argued that since it's the internet, it's not cheating. He felt cheated on, got angry, and ended the relationship. Now he's asking if he's the asshole (AITA).\n\nSo, did the author do the wrong thing? Well, cheating typically involves a breach of trust in a relationship. But the girlfriend's posts were on the internet, not an actual affair. However, the line can be blurry. If the girlfriend was sharing explicit content of herself, even if it's not an affair, it's a significant privacy and trust issue for the partner. The author felt violated and decided to end the relationship because she didn't want to stop. \n\nOn the other hand, the girlfriend might argue that she didn't think it was cheating. Maybe they didn't have prior boundaries about online behavior. The author's reaction was intense, but considering the emotional impact, it's understandable. However, breaking up immediately after a confrontation without trying to resolve the issue might seem harsh. But if the core issue is trust and the girlfriend is unwilling to change her behavior, ending the relationship could be a valid choice.\n\nSo, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. The answer depends on whether cheating can be extended to online actions. Since cheating usually involves physical or emotional infidelity, posting explicit content online isn't cheating per se. However, the author's perception of betrayal is real. If the girlfriend was okay with it and the author wasn't, then maybe the author's decision is justified. But if the girlfriend's actions were consensual and not part of an affair, then the author might be overreacting. \n\nIn AITA scenarios, the community often looks at both sides. If the girlfriend was sharing explicit content without the partner's knowledge, even if it's online, it's a breach of privacy. The author felt it was equivalent to cheating, which led to the breakup. Given that the girlfriend was unwilling to stop, the author's decision might be seen as justified, especially if they had different expectations. Therefore, the answer might be B (No), the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
