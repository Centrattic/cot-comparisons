Recently though she and I got into an argument about this, and now I\u2019m just not sure if I did the right thing. \n\nI was knackered after a night out so I do what I usually do after a night out. Lay in my bed and scroll through reddit till i realise I should sleep. So I\u2019m scrolling and I\u2019m not sure if this is just me, but when I see a porn post or an NSFW post in general I click it. So I just see a gonewild post and think \u201coh cool\u201d and click on it. Still reeling from \u00a31 night at the club I didn\u2019t immediately notice it was my girlfriend, but something was familiar about the post. The bed looked familiar, so did the overall room, but then I saw her body realised \u201cwait that\u2019s my girlfriend\u201d. I was mostly in shock and just started looking through her history and what I saw confirmed that it was 100% her.  Just filled with a mixed ball of emotion I decided I should sleep, but I couldn\u2019t. \n\nSo I waited till the morning my mind going mad. Eventually I texted her confronting her about it. I got a bit aggy saying how I felt like she was cheating on me and she was saying to me that since it was the internet it wasn\u2019t cheating. In all honesty I said some nasty things and I could tell she wasn\u2019t having a good time either. Said to her that I would like her to stop posting, and if she doesn\u2019t then I didn\u2019t really want to continue things with her. She started saying loads of stuff even suggesting I join her for couple posts? In the end I realised she didn\u2019t want to stop so I ended things then and there. Haven\u2019t messaged her since and my mates are aggy at me asking what was going on. I\u2019m not going to expose her, but this is a bit much for me right now. \n\nAITA\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for breaking up with his girlfriend after finding out she posted on gonewild. First, I need to understand the situation properly. The girlfriend posted on a site like Reddit, specifically gonewild, which is an NSFW subreddit. The author found out by accident, clicked on a post, realized it was her, and then confronted her. The girlfriend argued that internet stuff isn't cheating, but the author felt it was a betrayal. He ended the relationship because she didn't want to stop, and his friends are upset with him.\n\nNow, I need to consider the perspectives. The author's main issue is about trust and boundaries. He was upset and felt like she was cheating, even if she didn't think so. The girlfriend's stance is that posting online isn't the same as cheating. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong. \n\nIn relationships, trust is crucial. If one partner does something that the other finds unacceptable, even if the first partner doesn't see it as a problem, the decision to break up is a personal choice. However, there's a nuance here. The girlfriend's action of posting explicit content online could be seen as a breach of trust, especially if it was done without the partner's knowledge. The fact that she suggested the author join her for couple posts might indicate she's comfortable with it, but the author isn't. \n\nBut wait, is posting on gonewild considered cheating? It's a point of debate. Some people might argue that sharing explicit content online without the partner's consent is a form of betrayal. Others might say that as long as there's no physical infidelity, it's not cheating. The author felt betrayed, so his reaction is valid. \n\nHowever, breaking up immediately after an argument where both parties said hurtful things might be hasty. The author mentions he said some nasty things too. The girlfriend suggested couple posts, which the author found unacceptable. It seems like they had fundamental differences in what they consider acceptable in a relationship. \n\nIn terms of fault, the question is whether the author overreacted. If the girlfriend's actions were a deal-breaker for him, then his decision to end the relationship is understandable. On the other hand, if she didn't think it was cheating, maybe the author could have communicated his feelings better before breaking up. But given that he tried to confront her, and she didn't want to stop, leading to the breakup, it's a mutual issue. \n\nI think the key here is that the author's reaction is based on his personal values and the trust in the relationship. If the trust was broken because of her actions, then he's justified. However, others might say that without explicit consent, sharing such content is wrong. But the answer depends on societal norms and personal boundaries. \n\nSince the user is asking if the author is in the wrong, I need to decide between A and B. Considering that the girlfriend didn't see it as cheating, but the author did, and the breakup was due to irreconcilable differences, it's hard to say the author is in the wrong. However, if the act of posting wasn't considered cheating by many, maybe the author is overreacting. But given the emotional impact on him, I think the answer leans towards B, the author is not in the wrong for ending the relationship based on his feelings of betrayal.\n"
