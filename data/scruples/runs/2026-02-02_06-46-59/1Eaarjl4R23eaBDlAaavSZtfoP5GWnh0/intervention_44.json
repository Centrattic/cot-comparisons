Recently though she and I got into an argument about this, and now I\u2019m just not sure if I did the right thing. \n\nI was knackered after a night out so I do what I usually do after a night out. Lay in my bed and scroll through reddit till i realise I should sleep. So I\u2019m scrolling and I\u2019m not sure if this is just me, but when I see a porn post or an NSFW post in general I click it. So I just see a gonewild post and think \u201coh cool\u201d and click on it. Still reeling from \u00a31 night at the club I didn\u2019t immediately notice it was my girlfriend, but something was familiar about the post. The bed looked familiar, so did the overall room, but then I saw her body realised \u201cwait that\u2019s my girlfriend\u201d. I was mostly in shock and just started looking through her history and what I saw confirmed that it was 100% her.  Just filled with a mixed ball of emotion I decided I should sleep, but I couldn\u2019t. \n\nSo I waited till the morning my mind going mad. Eventually I texted her confronting her about it. I got a bit aggy saying how I felt like she was cheating on me and she was saying to me that since it was the internet it wasn\u2019t cheating. In all honesty I said some nasty things and I could tell she wasn\u2019t having a good time either. Said to her that I would like her to stop posting, and if she doesn\u2019t then I didn\u2019t really want to continue things with her. She started saying loads of stuff even suggesting I join her for couple posts? In the end I realised she didn\u2019t want to stop so I ended things then and there. Haven\u2019t messaged her since and my mates are aggy at me asking what was going on. I\u2019m not going to expose her, but this is a bit much for me right now. \n\nAITA\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for breaking up with his girlfriend after finding her on a site like GoneWild. The author found her posting NSFW content online, which he saw as cheating. The girlfriend argued that since it's the internet, it's not cheating. The author then ended the relationship.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the cultural context around what's considered cheating. Some people might view sharing explicit content online as a form of infidelity, especially if it's done secretly. Others might not, arguing that it's a public platform and not an active betrayal. The key here is the perception and the agreed-upon boundaries in the relationship.\n\nThe author mentioned he was upset and said some harsh things, which might indicate he was in a heightened emotional state. However, the decision to break up because of something that the partner didn't see as cheating could be seen as his personal boundary being violated. But if the relationship didn't have prior discussions about online activities, it's possible both sides had different expectations.\n\nThe girlfriend's suggestion to make couple posts might imply she didn't see it as a problem and wanted to involve the author. The author, however, felt it was a deal-breaker. The question is whether his reaction was justified. If there's no mutual agreement on what's acceptable, then both might have valid points. But since the author made the choice to end the relationship, it's about whether that choice was fair given their differing views.\n\nIn some perspectives, the act of sharing explicit material without mutual consent can be a breach of trust. However, if it's public and not shared with others, some might not see it as cheating. The author's reaction might be based on his personal values, which he has the right to uphold. However, if the relationship was built on trust and communication, maybe he should have discussed this earlier instead of reacting impulsively.\n\nBut given that he did confront her and she didn't agree to stop, his decision to end things might be seen as his way of protecting his own boundaries. Alternatively, if he didn't communicate his expectations beforehand, he might be at fault for not setting clear terms. However, the scenario doesn't mention prior discussions, so it's unclear.\n\nIn summary, whether the author is in the wrong depends on the relationship's agreed norms. If he didn't set boundaries earlier, maybe he's partly at fault. But if her actions violated his trust and he had a right to his feelings, then he isn't. The answer might be a mix, but typically in such cases, the person ending the relationship based on personal boundaries isn't in the wrong unless there was prior agreement. So leaning towards B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
