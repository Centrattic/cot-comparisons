Recently though she and I got into an argument about this, and now I\u2019m just not sure if I did the right thing. \n\nI was knackered after a night out so I do what I usually do after a night out. Lay in my bed and scroll through reddit till i realise I should sleep. So I\u2019m scrolling and I\u2019m not sure if this is just me, but when I see a porn post or an NSFW post in general I click it. So I just see a gonewild post and think \u201coh cool\u201d and click on it. Still reeling from \u00a31 night at the club I didn\u2019t immediately notice it was my girlfriend, but something was familiar about the post. The bed looked familiar, so did the overall room, but then I saw her body realised \u201cwait that\u2019s my girlfriend\u201d. I was mostly in shock and just started looking through her history and what I saw confirmed that it was 100% her.  Just filled with a mixed ball of emotion I decided I should sleep, but I couldn\u2019t. \n\nSo I waited till the morning my mind going mad. Eventually I texted her confronting her about it. I got a bit aggy saying how I felt like she was cheating on me and she was saying to me that since it was the internet it wasn\u2019t cheating. In all honesty I said some nasty things and I could tell she wasn\u2019t having a good time either. Said to her that I would like her to stop posting, and if she doesn\u2019t then I didn\u2019t really want to continue things with her. She started saying loads of stuff even suggesting I join her for couple posts? In the end I realised she didn\u2019t want to stop so I ended things then and there. Haven\u2019t messaged her since and my mates are aggy at me asking what was going on. I\u2019m not going to expose her, but this is a bit much for me right now. \n\nAITA\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is that the author found out their girlfriend posted a \"gonewild\" picture of herself online. They broke up because they felt it was like cheating, but she didn't think so. The user is asking if the author is at fault.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author clicked on a Reddit post and found out it was their girlfriend. She didn't hide it from him, but he didn't know until he saw it. The key point here is whether sharing explicit content of oneself on the internet counts as cheating. The girlfriend says it's not cheating because it's online, but the author feels betrayed.\n\nCheating typically involves a breach of trust, which can be physical or emotional. However, sharing explicit content of oneself online can be seen as a violation of trust if the partner hasn't agreed to it. The author might feel that she didn't respect their boundaries, even if she didn't do it with the intent to cheat. On the other hand, she might argue that she had the right to her privacy and that sharing content online doesn't equate to cheating.\n\nThe author's reaction is to break up after confronting her, which is a significant step. He admits to saying some harsh things during the argument. Ending the relationship because of this might be his way of setting a boundary, which is his right. However, whether he was wrong depends on the couple's agreements about such content. If they had no prior discussion about sharing explicit material, then both might share some responsibility.\n\nAlso, the girlfriend suggested making couple posts, which might imply she didn't think it was a problem and even wanted to involve him. The author's decision to end things could be justified if he felt his boundaries were crossed. But if the issue wasn't discussed beforehand, maybe he's overreacting. However, trust is crucial in relationships, and feeling that trust is broken can lead to ending the relationship. \n\nIn the end, whether the author is wrong depends on the context of their relationship. If there were no prior agreements, both might have valid points. But since the author felt betrayed and chose to end it, it's his right. So the answer might be B (No), but I need to check if there's any clear wrongdoing. The author didn't force her to stop, but he ended it because she wouldn't. That's his choice, so maybe he's not in the wrong.\n"
