Recently though she and I got into an argument about this, and now I\u2019m just not sure if I did the right thing. \n\nI was knackered after a night out so I do what I usually do after a night out. Lay in my bed and scroll through reddit till i realise I should sleep. So I\u2019m scrolling and I\u2019m not sure if this is just me, but when I see a porn post or an NSFW post in general I click it. So I just see a gonewild post and think \u201coh cool\u201d and click on it. Still reeling from \u00a31 night at the club I didn\u2019t immediately notice it was my girlfriend, but something was familiar about the post. The bed looked familiar, so did the overall room, but then I saw her body realised \u201cwait that\u2019s my girlfriend\u201d. I was mostly in shock and just started looking through her history and what I saw confirmed that it was 100% her.  Just filled with a mixed ball of emotion I decided I should sleep, but I couldn\u2019t. \n\nSo I waited till the morning my mind going mad. Eventually I texted her confronting her about it. I got a bit aggy saying how I felt like she was cheating on me and she was saying to me that since it was the internet it wasn\u2019t cheating. In all honesty I said some nasty things and I could tell she wasn\u2019t having a good time either. Said to her that I would like her to stop posting, and if she doesn\u2019t then I didn\u2019t really want to continue things with her. She started saying loads of stuff even suggesting I join her for couple posts? In the end I realised she didn\u2019t want to stop so I ended things then and there. Haven\u2019t messaged her since and my mates are aggy at me asking what was going on. I\u2019m not going to expose her, but this is a bit much for me right now. \n\nAITA\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who broke up with his girlfriend for posting on gonewild is in the wrong. The situation is that he found her posts on a site where she's sharing explicit content, and he broke up with her because he felt she was cheating by posting there. The girlfriend argues that since it's the internet, it's not cheating. The author is now wondering if he was right to break up.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The key points are consent, boundaries, and mutual understanding in the relationship. The author didn't know about the posts until he saw his girlfriend's image there. The girlfriend didn't inform him about her posts, which he found out through a third-party site. \n\nIn a relationship, open communication is crucial. If the girlfriend was posting explicit content online, it's possible that the author had certain expectations about their relationship that weren't communicated. The girlfriend might not have considered that her online activity could be a deal-breaker for him. However, she might also believe that her personal choices, as long as they don't involve real-life infidelity, are her own. \n\nThe author's reaction was to confront her and then break up when she didn't agree to stop. He admits he was aggressive in his texts. The girlfriend suggested they do couple posts together, which might indicate she's trying to include him or see it as a shared activity. The author felt that this was a betrayal, but the girlfriend doesn't see it the same way. \n\nNow, whether the author is in the wrong depends on several factors. If the relationship had an expectation of no explicit content online without the partner's knowledge, then the girlfriend might have breached that by not being transparent. However, if there was no prior discussion about boundaries around online content, then the author's expectations might be his own, and he could be overreacting. \n\nThe author's decision to break up based on her online posts, without prior discussion, might be seen as impulsive. On the other hand, if sharing explicit content online is a violation of his trust and he can't reconcile that, then his choice is valid. \n\nThe question is whether the author had a right to expect such behavior to be off-limits. If the couple didn't discuss these boundaries before, then both might have a case. The author's anger and immediate breakup could be seen as hasty, but if the issue is a deal-breaker, then it's his right to end the relationship. \n\nIn terms of \"AITA,\" the answer often hinges on whether the person acted unreasonably. Here, the author didn't confront her immediately but waited until the morning. However, his reaction was aggressive, and he didn't give her a chance to explain before ending things. \n\nSo, considering all that, there's a balance between respecting personal choices and relationship boundaries. The author might not be in the wrong if the content was a deal-breaker for him, but he could have handled it more constructively.\n"
