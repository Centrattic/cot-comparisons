Recently though she and I got into an argument about this, and now I\u2019m just not sure if I did the right thing. \n\nI was knackered after a night out so I do what I usually do after a night out. Lay in my bed and scroll through reddit till i realise I should sleep. So I\u2019m scrolling and I\u2019m not sure if this is just me, but when I see a porn post or an NSFW post in general I click it. So I just see a gonewild post and think \u201coh cool\u201d and click on it. Still reeling from \u00a31 night at the club I didn\u2019t immediately notice it was my girlfriend, but something was familiar about the post. The bed looked familiar, so did the overall room, but then I saw her body realised \u201cwait that\u2019s my girlfriend\u201d. I was mostly in shock and just started looking through her history and what I saw confirmed that it was 100% her.  Just filled with a mixed ball of emotion I decided I should sleep, but I couldn\u2019t. \n\nSo I waited till the morning my mind going mad. Eventually I texted her confronting her about it. I got a bit aggy saying how I felt like she was cheating on me and she was saying to me that since it was the internet it wasn\u2019t cheating. In all honesty I said some nasty things and I could tell she wasn\u2019t having a good time either. Said to her that I would like her to stop posting, and if she doesn\u2019t then I didn\u2019t really want to continue things with her. She started saying loads of stuff even suggesting I join her for couple posts? In the end I realised she didn\u2019t want to stop so I ended things then and there. Haven\u2019t messaged her since and my mates are aggy at me asking what was going on. I\u2019m not going to expose her, but this is a bit much for me right now. \n\nAITA\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for breaking up with his girlfriend after she posted on Gonewild. \n\nFirst, the key points: The girlfriend posted explicit content online, which the author discovered. The author felt cheated because of the post, even if it wasn't actual cheating. The girlfriend argued that since it was on the internet, it's not cheating. The argument escalated, and the author ended the relationship.\n\nNow, to determine if the author is in the wrong. Cheating is typically defined as engaging in sexual or romantic activity with someone else. However, the girlfriend's actions involved sharing explicit photos, which is a form of infidelity in many relationships. The author's reaction is based on trust issues and betrayal, which are valid in some contexts. \n\nThe girlfriend suggested continuing the posts or even doing couple posts, which the author found unacceptable. The author's decision to end the relationship stems from a violation of their trust. Whether he's in the wrong depends on societal views and the specific relationship boundaries. Some might argue that using the internet as a defense for not cheating is valid, but others would say sharing explicit content without the partner's consent is a breach of trust. \n\nThe author's actions\u2014confronting her and ending the relationship\u2014could be seen as a reasonable response given the breach of trust. However, some might say he overreacted if the girlfriend wasn't intentionally cheating but just shared content. But in many relationships, sharing explicit material online without consent is considered a serious issue. Therefore, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong for ending the relationship over this.\n"
