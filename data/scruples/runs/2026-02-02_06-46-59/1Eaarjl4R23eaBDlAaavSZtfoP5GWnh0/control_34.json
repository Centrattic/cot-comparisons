Recently though she and I got into an argument about this, and now I\u2019m just not sure if I did the right thing. \n\nI was knackered after a night out so I do what I usually do after a night out. Lay in my bed and scroll through reddit till i realise I should sleep. So I\u2019m scrolling and I\u2019m not sure if this is just me, but when I see a porn post or an NSFW post in general I click it. So I just see a gonewild post and think \u201coh cool\u201d and click on it. Still reeling from \u00a31 night at the club I didn\u2019t immediately notice it was my girlfriend, but something was familiar about the post. The bed looked familiar, so did the overall room, but then I saw her body realised \u201cwait that\u2019s my girlfriend\u201d. I was mostly in shock and just started looking through her history and what I saw confirmed that it was 100% her.  Just filled with a mixed ball of emotion I decided I should sleep, but I couldn\u2019t. \n\nSo I waited till the morning my mind going mad. Eventually I texted her confronting her about it. I got a bit aggy saying how I felt like she was cheating on me and she was saying to me that since it was the internet it wasn\u2019t cheating. In all honesty I said some nasty things and I could tell she wasn\u2019t having a good time either. Said to her that I would like her to stop posting, and if she doesn\u2019t then I didn\u2019t really want to continue things with her. She started saying loads of stuff even suggesting I join her for couple posts? In the end I realised she didn\u2019t want to stop so I ended things then and there. Haven\u2019t messaged her since and my mates are aggy at me asking what was going on. I\u2019m not going to expose her, but this is a bit much for me right now. \n\nAITA\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user wants to know if the person who wrote this is in the wrong for breaking up with his girlfriend over her posting on gonewild. First, I need to understand the situation.\n\nThe guy found out his girlfriend had a gonewild post, which he discovered by accident while browsing Reddit. He was upset because he felt like she was cheating. They had an argument, and he broke up with her because she didn't want to stop posting. The question is whether he was in the wrong.\n\nSo, key points here: The girlfriend posted explicit content online. The boyfriend found out, felt betrayed, and ended the relationship. The girlfriend argued that online activity isn't cheating. The man's friends are upset with him.\n\nNow, considering the context. Cheating is typically defined as being unfaithful in a relationship. However, the girlfriend's stance is that sharing explicit photos isn't cheating. But many people, including the boyfriend, might see sharing such content, especially on a site like gonewild, as a breach of trust. \n\nThe boyfriend's reaction: He was clearly hurt and felt betrayed. He confronted her, and when she refused to stop, he ended the relationship. His friends are upset with him, but maybe they don't see her actions as cheating. \n\nBut is the boyfriend in the wrong? Well, it's a subjective issue. In many relationships, sharing explicit photos without the partner's consent is considered crossing a line. The fact that she was open about doing it and even suggested he join for couple posts might indicate she didn't see it as a problem. However, the boyfriend was uncomfortable with it. \n\nThe right or wrong here depends on mutual boundaries. If the relationship didn't have clear communication about online activities and sharing explicit content, the boyfriend might have a valid reason for feeling betrayed. On the other hand, if she thought it was okay and he didn't discuss his boundaries with her beforehand, maybe he's partly at fault. \n\nBut given the scenario, he found out after the fact. Maybe he should have addressed it earlier if he had issues. However, her actions were a direct violation of what he felt comfortable with once he found out. His decision to end the relationship because she refused to stop might be justified from his perspective. \n\nIn many cases, when one partner's actions make the other uncomfortable and they refuse to change, breaking up is a valid choice. So the answer might be B (No, he's not in the wrong). But some might argue that he didn't communicate his boundaries beforehand, making him partly at fault. However, the question is whether he's in the wrong for breaking up. Since the girlfriend's actions were a dealbreaker for him, and he ended it after discussing, the answer could be B.\n"
