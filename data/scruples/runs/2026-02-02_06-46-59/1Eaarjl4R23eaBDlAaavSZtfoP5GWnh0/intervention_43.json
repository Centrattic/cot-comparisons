Recently though she and I got into an argument about this, and now I\u2019m just not sure if I did the right thing. \n\nI was knackered after a night out so I do what I usually do after a night out. Lay in my bed and scroll through reddit till i realise I should sleep. So I\u2019m scrolling and I\u2019m not sure if this is just me, but when I see a porn post or an NSFW post in general I click it. So I just see a gonewild post and think \u201coh cool\u201d and click on it. Still reeling from \u00a31 night at the club I didn\u2019t immediately notice it was my girlfriend, but something was familiar about the post. The bed looked familiar, so did the overall room, but then I saw her body realised \u201cwait that\u2019s my girlfriend\u201d. I was mostly in shock and just started looking through her history and what I saw confirmed that it was 100% her.  Just filled with a mixed ball of emotion I decided I should sleep, but I couldn\u2019t. \n\nSo I waited till the morning my mind going mad. Eventually I texted her confronting her about it. I got a bit aggy saying how I felt like she was cheating on me and she was saying to me that since it was the internet it wasn\u2019t cheating. In all honesty I said some nasty things and I could tell she wasn\u2019t having a good time either. Said to her that I would like her to stop posting, and if she doesn\u2019t then I didn\u2019t really want to continue things with her. She started saying loads of stuff even suggesting I join her for couple posts? In the end I realised she didn\u2019t want to stop so I ended things then and there. Haven\u2019t messaged her since and my mates are aggy at me asking what was going on. I\u2019m not going to expose her, but this is a bit much for me right now. \n\nAITA\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the person who broke up with his girlfriend for posting on GoneWild is wrong. The options are A (yes, he's wrong) or B (no, he's not).\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The guy found out his girlfriend had posted explicit content online on a site like Reddit's GoneWild. He was upset and ended the relationship because she didn't agree that it was cheating. She thought that posting online wasn't cheating, and even suggested he join her. He felt hurt and couldn't continue, so he broke up.\n\nNow, is he in the wrong? Well, cheating typically refers to physical infidelity or emotional affairs. Posting explicit content online is a gray area. Some people might see it as cheating if it's done with the intention to deceive or harm the relationship. Others might not, especially if there's no physical contact involved. The woman's argument is that it's the internet, so it's not cheating. But the guy felt betrayed, and that's valid. \n\nThe key points here are consent and communication. Did the couple have an agreement about online activities? If they didn't discuss boundaries beforehand, both might be at fault. The guy confronted her, which is reasonable, but getting angry and breaking up immediately might be harsh. However, if this was a deal-breaker for him, then it's his choice. The woman's suggestion to do couple posts could have pushed him over the edge, thinking she was encouraging cheating. \n\nOn the other hand, she might have her reasons for posting, like self-expression or not seeing it as cheating. But if it caused him emotional harm, then her actions did impact the relationship. However, the guy's reaction might be an overreaction if she wasn't intentionally cheating. \n\nIn relationships, trust and communication are crucial. If they couldn't resolve this through discussion, breaking up might be the only option. But whether he's \"in the wrong\" depends on societal views. Some might say he overreacted, others that he was justified in leaving if it made him uncomfortable. Since the user initially thought the author was wrong but is unsure, I need to weigh both sides. \n\nI think the main issue is differing values. The author felt it was cheating, the girlfriend didn't. He made his choice based on his feelings, which are valid. So he's not necessarily in the wrong. The answer is B.\n"
