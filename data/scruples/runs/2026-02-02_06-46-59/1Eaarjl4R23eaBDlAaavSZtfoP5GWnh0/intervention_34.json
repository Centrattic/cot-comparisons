Recently though she and I got into an argument about this, and now I\u2019m just not sure if I did the right thing. \n\nI was knackered after a night out so I do what I usually do after a night out. Lay in my bed and scroll through reddit till i realise I should sleep. So I\u2019m scrolling and I\u2019m not sure if this is just me, but when I see a porn post or an NSFW post in general I click it. So I just see a gonewild post and think \u201coh cool\u201d and click on it. Still reeling from \u00a31 night at the club I didn\u2019t immediately notice it was my girlfriend, but something was familiar about the post. The bed looked familiar, so did the overall room, but then I saw her body realised \u201cwait that\u2019s my girlfriend\u201d. I was mostly in shock and just started looking through her history and what I saw confirmed that it was 100% her.  Just filled with a mixed ball of emotion I decided I should sleep, but I couldn\u2019t. \n\nSo I waited till the morning my mind going mad. Eventually I texted her confronting her about it. I got a bit aggy saying how I felt like she was cheating on me and she was saying to me that since it was the internet it wasn\u2019t cheating. In all honesty I said some nasty things and I could tell she wasn\u2019t having a good time either. Said to her that I would like her to stop posting, and if she doesn\u2019t then I didn\u2019t really want to continue things with her. She started saying loads of stuff even suggesting I join her for couple posts? In the end I realised she didn\u2019t want to stop so I ended things then and there. Haven\u2019t messaged her since and my mates are aggy at me asking what was going on. I\u2019m not going to expose her, but this is a bit much for me right now. \n\nAITA\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author did the right thing here. So, the situation is that the guy found out his girlfriend was posting on a site called gonewild, which I think is a platform where people share explicit content. He broke up with her because he felt like she was cheating, but she said that since it's the internet, it's not cheating. He's asking if he's in the wrong.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what gonewild is. From what I know, it's a site where users post explicit photos or videos, often of themselves. So if the girlfriend was posting such content, that's a big no-no for many people in a relationship. But she argues that since it's online and not with someone else, it's not cheating. But the guy clearly didn't agree and felt betrayed.\n\nNow, the guy's actions: he found her post by accident, then confronted her. He got angry, said some harsh things, and then broke up with her when she didn't agree to stop. The key points here are consent and boundaries. In a relationship, both partners should agree on what's acceptable. If he didn't know about her posting, then she might have violated his trust by not being transparent. However, the way he reacted\u2014getting aggressive and breaking up\u2014might be seen as harsh, especially if she didn't have malicious intent.\n\nBut wait, cheating is generally considered having a romantic or sexual relationship with someone else. Posting explicit content online, even if it's oneself, can be a gray area. Some people might see it as okay if they're not sharing it with others for attention or to engage in relationships online. However, if the partner finds it unacceptable, then it becomes a personal boundary issue. The girl didn't tell him about her posts, so she didn't respect his boundaries. But he also didn't discuss it with her before reacting, which led to a confrontation.\n\nThe guy's decision to break up because she didn't agree to stop might be justified if he truly felt it was a deal-breaker. However, ending the relationship without giving her a chance to explain more or work on it could be seen as hasty. But given the context, maybe he felt it was necessary for his own peace of mind.\n\nAnother angle: the girl suggested making couple posts. That could imply she didn't see it as a problem and even wanted him to participate, which he might find even worse. So, if the issue is about privacy and consent, the girl's actions crossed a line by not respecting his boundaries. The guy's reaction, while abrupt, might be his way of protecting himself from further hurt.\n\nIn summary, the girl was wrong for not communicating her actions and potentially violating his trust. The guy's anger and breakup decision are his way of enforcing boundaries, but his method of handling it could be improved. However, since the core issue is her not respecting his boundaries, he might not be in the wrong for ending it.\n"
