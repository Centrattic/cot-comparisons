Recently though she and I got into an argument about this, and now I\u2019m just not sure if I did the right thing. \n\nI was knackered after a night out so I do what I usually do after a night out. Lay in my bed and scroll through reddit till i realise I should sleep. So I\u2019m scrolling and I\u2019m not sure if this is just me, but when I see a porn post or an NSFW post in general I click it. So I just see a gonewild post and think \u201coh cool\u201d and click on it. Still reeling from \u00a31 night at the club I didn\u2019t immediately notice it was my girlfriend, but something was familiar about the post. The bed looked familiar, so did the overall room, but then I saw her body realised \u201cwait that\u2019s my girlfriend\u201d. I was mostly in shock and just started looking through her history and what I saw confirmed that it was 100% her.  Just filled with a mixed ball of emotion I decided I should sleep, but I couldn\u2019t. \n\nSo I waited till the morning my mind going mad. Eventually I texted her confronting her about it. I got a bit aggy saying how I felt like she was cheating on me and she was saying to me that since it was the internet it wasn\u2019t cheating. In all honesty I said some nasty things and I could tell she wasn\u2019t having a good time either. Said to her that I would like her to stop posting, and if she doesn\u2019t then I didn\u2019t really want to continue things with her. She started saying loads of stuff even suggesting I join her for couple posts? In the end I realised she didn\u2019t want to stop so I ended things then and there. Haven\u2019t messaged her since and my mates are aggy at me asking what was going on. I\u2019m not going to expose her, but this is a bit much for me right now. \n\nAITA\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, so the user is asking whether the author of this break-up story is in the wrong. Let me try to figure this out.\n\nFirst, the situation: The guy found out his girlfriend posted a \"gonewild\" post, which is essentially a sex tape or explicit content. He broke up with her because he felt it was cheating. The girlfriend argues that posting on the internet isn't cheating. The question is whether the guy was wrong to break up.\n\nI need to consider different angles. From a relationship expectations standpoint, trust and boundaries are key. If the couple hadn't discussed what they considered cheating before, then the guy's reaction might be based on his personal values. Some people might see online activity like this as a betrayal, even if it's consensual. Others might not. The fact that the girlfriend suggested he join in for couple posts could indicate she didn't see it as a big deal, but the guy did.\n\nThe guy's actions: He confronted her, got into an argument, and then broke up. The girlfriend didn't agree to stop, so he ended it. Is that right or wrong? Well, maybe it's not the action itself but the communication. If they didn't have prior discussions about boundaries and values, then both might have different expectations. The guy might have felt violated, but the girlfriend didn't. If it's a matter of differing values, then maybe it's not inherently wrong for him to break up, but it's also important to communicate and see if they can find a compromise. However, he did confront her, and she didn't want to stop, so he decided to end the relationship. That seems like a personal choice, but the question is if he's in the wrong.\n\nAnother angle: Did the girlfriend do something that the guy found unacceptable? If so, then acting on that is his choice. But if the definition of cheating is not clearly established, then it's a matter of their agreement. If they didn't set those boundaries, then both might have a valid perspective. The guy might be overreacting if the girlfriend didn't consider it cheating, but if it's a deal-breaker for him, then it's his right to leave.\n\nAlso, the guy admitted he said some nasty things during the confrontation. That could be seen as impulsive or not handling the situation well. However, the main issue is whether the break-up itself is justified. The user's initial thought is that the author is in the wrong, but I need to weigh the arguments.\n\nIn summary, the guy's actions are based on his perception of betrayal, but the girlfriend didn't share that view. If they didn't have prior discussions, then both might be in the wrong for not communicating expectations. However, the guy chose to end the relationship based on his values. Whether that's right or wrong depends on cultural norms and personal beliefs. Some might say he's not in the wrong if it's a deal-breaker, others might say he should have discussed it more before breaking up. Given the information, I think the answer is B (not in the wrong) because he's acting on his own boundaries, even if those boundaries weren't discussed beforehand.\n"
