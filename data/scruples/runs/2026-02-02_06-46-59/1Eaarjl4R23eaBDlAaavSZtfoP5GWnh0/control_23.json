Recently though she and I got into an argument about this, and now I\u2019m just not sure if I did the right thing. \n\nI was knackered after a night out so I do what I usually do after a night out. Lay in my bed and scroll through reddit till i realise I should sleep. So I\u2019m scrolling and I\u2019m not sure if this is just me, but when I see a porn post or an NSFW post in general I click it. So I just see a gonewild post and think \u201coh cool\u201d and click on it. Still reeling from \u00a31 night at the club I didn\u2019t immediately notice it was my girlfriend, but something was familiar about the post. The bed looked familiar, so did the overall room, but then I saw her body realised \u201cwait that\u2019s my girlfriend\u201d. I was mostly in shock and just started looking through her history and what I saw confirmed that it was 100% her.  Just filled with a mixed ball of emotion I decided I should sleep, but I couldn\u2019t. \n\nSo I waited till the morning my mind going mad. Eventually I texted her confronting her about it. I got a bit aggy saying how I felt like she was cheating on me and she was saying to me that since it was the internet it wasn\u2019t cheating. In all honesty I said some nasty things and I could tell she wasn\u2019t having a good time either. Said to her that I would like her to stop posting, and if she doesn\u2019t then I didn\u2019t really want to continue things with her. She started saying loads of stuff even suggesting I join her for couple posts? In the end I realised she didn\u2019t want to stop so I ended things then and there. Haven\u2019t messaged her since and my mates are aggy at me asking what was going on. I\u2019m not going to expose her, but this is a bit much for me right now. \n\nAITA\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the person who broke up with his girlfriend for posting on gonewild is in the wrong. So, first, I need to understand the situation.\n\nThe guy found out that his girlfriend was posting explicit content online, specifically on gonewild, which I know is a site for adult content. He was shocked and confronted her the next day, leading to an argument. He felt she was being unfaithful, even though she argued that since it's online, it's not cheating. He ended the relationship because she didn't want to stop posting, and now he's wondering if he was in the wrong.\n\nHmm, cheating is usually defined as being unfaithful with someone else. But if she's posting her own content online, does that count? Well, depending on the context. If she's using her real name and photos, maybe she's not cheating, but it could be a breach of trust. The guy felt betrayed because he believed she was being unfaithful. But technically, she didn't have a physical or emotional affair. However, sharing explicit content online can have other issues, like privacy, consent, or future consequences. \n\nHe was upset and said some harsh things. Maybe he overreacted? But given that he's in a relationship, expecting exclusivity and trust is reasonable. If she was comfortable sharing such content, maybe she didn't realize he would take it that way. But he did feel it was equivalent to cheating, which is a big deal in a relationship. \n\nSo, the question is whether breaking up over this is wrong. It depends on their agreement. If they had no prior discussion about sharing content, then maybe the guy's reaction was based on his personal boundaries, which are valid. However, if there was no prior agreement, he might have overstepped by ending the relationship without understanding her perspective. But she didn't want to stop, which complicates things. \n\nIn relationships, trust and communication are key. If he felt that her actions violated his trust, then ending the relationship isn't wrong. It's his choice to stay in a relationship where he feels betrayed. On the other hand, if she didn't consider it cheating and was unaware of his feelings, maybe he should have addressed it earlier. But given that he did confront her and she didn't want to stop, ending things makes sense. \n\nI think the main point is whether the act of posting explicit content online constitutes cheating. Since it's not an actual affair, but the guy felt it was, it's a matter of perspective. In that case, the guy isn't wrong for ending the relationship because he had boundaries that weren't respected. So the answer would be B, not in the wrong.\n"
