Recently though she and I got into an argument about this, and now I\u2019m just not sure if I did the right thing. \n\nI was knackered after a night out so I do what I usually do after a night out. Lay in my bed and scroll through reddit till i realise I should sleep. So I\u2019m scrolling and I\u2019m not sure if this is just me, but when I see a porn post or an NSFW post in general I click it. So I just see a gonewild post and think \u201coh cool\u201d and click on it. Still reeling from \u00a31 night at the club I didn\u2019t immediately notice it was my girlfriend, but something was familiar about the post. The bed looked familiar, so did the overall room, but then I saw her body realised \u201cwait that\u2019s my girlfriend\u201d. I was mostly in shock and just started looking through her history and what I saw confirmed that it was 100% her.  Just filled with a mixed ball of emotion I decided I should sleep, but I couldn\u2019t. \n\nSo I waited till the morning my mind going mad. Eventually I texted her confronting her about it. I got a bit aggy saying how I felt like she was cheating on me and she was saying to me that since it was the internet it wasn\u2019t cheating. In all honesty I said some nasty things and I could tell she wasn\u2019t having a good time either. Said to her that I would like her to stop posting, and if she doesn\u2019t then I didn\u2019t really want to continue things with her. She started saying loads of stuff even suggesting I join her for couple posts? In the end I realised she didn\u2019t want to stop so I ended things then and there. Haven\u2019t messaged her since and my mates are aggy at me asking what was going on. I\u2019m not going to expose her, but this is a bit much for me right now. \n\nAITA\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author broke up with his girlfriend for her posting on Gone Wild and if he's at fault.\n\nFirst, the situation: The girlfriend posted explicit content online. The author found out through her Reddit history, got upset, argued, and ended the relationship. He claims she didn't stop, so he ended it. The user thinks the author is in the wrong, but we need to evaluate both sides.\n\nFrom the author's perspective: He felt betrayed and possibly cheated, even if it's online. He confronted her, she didn't stop, and he ended things. He might believe that sharing explicit content without consent is a deal-breaker. Also, the argument got heated, with both sides saying harsh things.\n\nFrom the girlfriend's side: She might argue that posting online isn't cheating. Many people engage in online activities without it affecting their relationships. If they had an agreement about such content, that's one thing, but if not, she might not see it as a violation. Suggesting he join could indicate she didn't see it as private or that she wanted to share it.\n\nKey points to consider: Consent, privacy agreements, and trust. If the couple had discussed boundaries and she ignored them, he's justified. If there was no prior agreement, his reaction might be impulsive. Also, his friends being \"aggy\" (aggravated) might indicate social pressure, but that's not a factor in right or wrong.\n\nLegal perspective: In some places, sharing explicit content without consent is illegal, but this is a personal relationship issue. Legally, it's about consent, but ethically, it's about mutual respect and agreements.\n\nEmotional impact: The author felt cheating, which is a major issue. His decision to end the relationship is a personal choice, but whether he's at fault depends on the context of their relationship's boundaries. If he didn't address it sooner, maybe he's in the wrong. If she didn't respect his feelings, he's justified.\n\nConclusion: It's a complex situation. The author acted on his feelings of betrayal, but without prior discussion, his reaction could be seen as abrupt. The girlfriend might not see her actions as wrong. So, it's a 50-50 scenario where both sides have valid points. But the user thinks the author is wrong, while I need to decide based on the analysis. Considering that the author ended things after she refused to stop, and if there was no prior agreement, he might not be entirely at fault. However, the way he handled it (texting in the morning, not discussing calmly) could be a factor. Overall, maybe the answer is B (not the author's fault) because he acted based on his boundaries, but some might argue he overreacted. However, the key is whether she breached trust. Given that he felt it was cheating, even if she didn't, he's within his right to end the relationship. So B.\n"
