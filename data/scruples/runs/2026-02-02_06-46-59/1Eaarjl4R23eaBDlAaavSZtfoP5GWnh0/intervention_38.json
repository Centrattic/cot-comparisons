Recently though she and I got into an argument about this, and now I\u2019m just not sure if I did the right thing. \n\nI was knackered after a night out so I do what I usually do after a night out. Lay in my bed and scroll through reddit till i realise I should sleep. So I\u2019m scrolling and I\u2019m not sure if this is just me, but when I see a porn post or an NSFW post in general I click it. So I just see a gonewild post and think \u201coh cool\u201d and click on it. Still reeling from \u00a31 night at the club I didn\u2019t immediately notice it was my girlfriend, but something was familiar about the post. The bed looked familiar, so did the overall room, but then I saw her body realised \u201cwait that\u2019s my girlfriend\u201d. I was mostly in shock and just started looking through her history and what I saw confirmed that it was 100% her.  Just filled with a mixed ball of emotion I decided I should sleep, but I couldn\u2019t. \n\nSo I waited till the morning my mind going mad. Eventually I texted her confronting her about it. I got a bit aggy saying how I felt like she was cheating on me and she was saying to me that since it was the internet it wasn\u2019t cheating. In all honesty I said some nasty things and I could tell she wasn\u2019t having a good time either. Said to her that I would like her to stop posting, and if she doesn\u2019t then I didn\u2019t really want to continue things with her. She started saying loads of stuff even suggesting I join her for couple posts? In the end I realised she didn\u2019t want to stop so I ended things then and there. Haven\u2019t messaged her since and my mates are aggy at me asking what was going on. I\u2019m not going to expose her, but this is a bit much for me right now. \n\nAITA\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who broke up with his girlfriend for posting on Gonewild is in the wrong. The question is between Answer A (yes, wrong) or B (no, not wrong).\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The girlfriend was posting explicit content online, which the boyfriend discovered. He confronted her, they argued, and he broke up because she didn't want to stop. The key points here are consent, boundaries, and mutual understanding in a relationship.\n\nIn relationships, trust and communication are crucial. The girlfriend posted something that made her partner uncomfortable. But is posting explicit content on a platform like Gonewild considered cheating? The girlfriend argued that since it's the internet, it's not cheating. The boyfriend felt betrayed, leading to the breakup.\n\nNow, considering ethical perspectives. From the boyfriend's viewpoint, he felt that her actions were equivalent to cheating. If both partners had discussed boundaries beforehand, this could have been avoided. However, the girlfriend didn't see it the same way. The problem here is that they didn't align on what each considers acceptable.\n\nThe user initially thought the author was in the wrong but wants another opinion. I need to consider if breaking up was a justified reaction. If the girlfriend was aware that the boyfriend would be upset and still chose to post, that's a problem. But if the boyfriend didn't set clear boundaries and this was a surprise to him, maybe he also shares some responsibility for not communicating his expectations.\n\nHowever, the core issue is respect for each other's boundaries. If the boyfriend felt that her actions were a betrayal, even if not cheating in the traditional sense, it's his right to feel that way. The fact that she suggested they do couple posts together might have crossed a line he wasn't comfortable with, reinforcing his decision.\n\nOn the other hand, if the girlfriend was honest about her actions and the boyfriend only discovered it later, then the boyfriend's reaction is about his personal limits. Relationships require negotiation, and if they couldn't find a middle ground, breaking up might be the right choice for him.\n\nIn conclusion, whether the author is in the wrong depends on mutual understanding. If they didn't have prior discussions about online activities, both might share some blame. However, the immediate reaction was based on his feelings of betrayal. Since the girlfriend didn't respect his feelings by choosing not to stop, the author might not be entirely in the wrong. But if he had no prior conversation, maybe he should have addressed this earlier. Given the information, the answer leans towards B (not in the wrong) because his decision was based on his personal boundaries and her refusal to respect them.\n"
