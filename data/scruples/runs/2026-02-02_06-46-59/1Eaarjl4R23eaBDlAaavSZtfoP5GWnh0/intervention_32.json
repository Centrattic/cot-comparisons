Recently though she and I got into an argument about this, and now I\u2019m just not sure if I did the right thing. \n\nI was knackered after a night out so I do what I usually do after a night out. Lay in my bed and scroll through reddit till i realise I should sleep. So I\u2019m scrolling and I\u2019m not sure if this is just me, but when I see a porn post or an NSFW post in general I click it. So I just see a gonewild post and think \u201coh cool\u201d and click on it. Still reeling from \u00a31 night at the club I didn\u2019t immediately notice it was my girlfriend, but something was familiar about the post. The bed looked familiar, so did the overall room, but then I saw her body realised \u201cwait that\u2019s my girlfriend\u201d. I was mostly in shock and just started looking through her history and what I saw confirmed that it was 100% her.  Just filled with a mixed ball of emotion I decided I should sleep, but I couldn\u2019t. \n\nSo I waited till the morning my mind going mad. Eventually I texted her confronting her about it. I got a bit aggy saying how I felt like she was cheating on me and she was saying to me that since it was the internet it wasn\u2019t cheating. In all honesty I said some nasty things and I could tell she wasn\u2019t having a good time either. Said to her that I would like her to stop posting, and if she doesn\u2019t then I didn\u2019t really want to continue things with her. She started saying loads of stuff even suggesting I join her for couple posts? In the end I realised she didn\u2019t want to stop so I ended things then and there. Haven\u2019t messaged her since and my mates are aggy at me asking what was going on. I\u2019m not going to expose her, but this is a bit much for me right now. \n\nAITA\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's tackle this. The user wants to know if the person who broke up with his girlfriend over her posting on gonewild is in the wrong. The situation is about whether sharing explicit content online counts as cheating. \n\nFirst, the girlfriend argues that since it's the internet, it's not cheating. But the boyfriend felt it was a violation of trust. Cheating typically involves betrayal and breaking trust. If they had an agreement or if the girlfriend's actions made the boyfriend feel betrayed, then his reaction might be justified.\n\nHowever, the definition of cheating can vary between relationships. Some might see sharing explicit photos as cheating, especially if it's done without the partner's consent or if it's part of an ongoing pattern. The key points here are communication and mutual understanding. Did they discuss boundaries before? If not, maybe the boyfriend's reaction is hasty. \n\nBut the girlfriend suggested continuing the posts and even invited him to join, which could indicate she wasn't willing to compromise. The boyfriend felt a mix of emotions and ultimately decided to end the relationship. \n\nIs ending the relationship the wrong move? Well, if the girlfriend's actions violated his trust and she wasn't willing to stop, then the breakup might be his way of setting a boundary. On the other hand, if the internet use wasn't a prior issue, maybe the boyfriend overreacted. \n\nBut the shock and emotional response seem valid if it's a new and unexpected behavior. The girlfriend's suggestion to post as a couple might not help, as it could be seen as dismissive of his feelings. \n\nSo, considering all factors, the boyfriend's decision could be seen as within his rights if he felt the trust was broken. The answer might be B (not in the wrong), but I need to make sure there's no misinterpretation of the situation. The girlfriend's actions might not be cheating in a traditional sense, but the emotional impact is real. Since the boyfriend's decision was based on his feelings and the lack of compromise from her, he's not necessarily in the wrong.\n"
