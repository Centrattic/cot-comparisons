Recently though she and I got into an argument about this, and now I\u2019m just not sure if I did the right thing. \n\nI was knackered after a night out so I do what I usually do after a night out. Lay in my bed and scroll through reddit till i realise I should sleep. So I\u2019m scrolling and I\u2019m not sure if this is just me, but when I see a porn post or an NSFW post in general I click it. So I just see a gonewild post and think \u201coh cool\u201d and click on it. Still reeling from \u00a31 night at the club I didn\u2019t immediately notice it was my girlfriend, but something was familiar about the post. The bed looked familiar, so did the overall room, but then I saw her body realised \u201cwait that\u2019s my girlfriend\u201d. I was mostly in shock and just started looking through her history and what I saw confirmed that it was 100% her.  Just filled with a mixed ball of emotion I decided I should sleep, but I couldn\u2019t. \n\nSo I waited till the morning my mind going mad. Eventually I texted her confronting her about it. I got a bit aggy saying how I felt like she was cheating on me and she was saying to me that since it was the internet it wasn\u2019t cheating. In all honesty I said some nasty things and I could tell she wasn\u2019t having a good time either. Said to her that I would like her to stop posting, and if she doesn\u2019t then I didn\u2019t really want to continue things with her. She started saying loads of stuff even suggesting I join her for couple posts? In the end I realised she didn\u2019t want to stop so I ended things then and there. Haven\u2019t messaged her since and my mates are aggy at me asking what was going on. I\u2019m not going to expose her, but this is a bit much for me right now. \n\nAITA\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that the guy broke up with his girlfriend because she posted on gonewild.com, which is a platform for explicit content. He found her post while browsing Reddit, didn't realize it was her at first, and then confronted her the next day. She said that since it's the internet, it's not cheating. He felt betrayed and ended the relationship.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The guy's perspective: he found out his girlfriend was sharing explicit content of herself online. He felt like she was cheating because of that. Even though she might not have had a sexual relationship with someone else, he perceives her actions as a breach of trust. His reaction was to break up because he couldn't handle that. \n\nOn the other hand, the girl's perspective: she might see her actions as her personal choice. If she's sharing content of herself online, especially if it's consensual and she's the one creating it, she might not see it as cheating. She even suggested he join her for couple posts, which implies she was comfortable with it. However, she didn't consider how her partner would feel about it. There's a difference between what someone considers acceptable and how their partner reacts to it.\n\nCheating definitions can vary. Some people might consider sharing explicit content as cheating because it's a form of infidelity, especially if it's done with others. But in this case, the girl wasn't cheating in the traditional sense (no physical or emotional affair with someone else), just sharing her own content. However, the key issue here is consent and communication. The guy didn't know about her posts until he found them, and she didn't discuss it with him. That lack of transparency could be a problem.\n\nThe guy's reaction was to end the relationship after a heated argument where he said some harsh things. He might have been in the right to break up if he felt that her actions violated his trust, even if she didn't see it the same way. Relationships require mutual respect and boundaries. If he couldn't accept her choices, then breaking up might be his right. However, he also needs to consider if his reaction was proportionate. Did he give her a chance to explain? She did say she wasn't going to stop, so maybe he felt there was no way forward.\n\nBut the question is whether he is in the wrong. If the girl's actions were consensual and she wasn't cheating, then maybe the guy overreacted. However, if their relationship had an unspoken boundary that she crossed by sharing explicit content without discussing it, then he might have a valid reason. It's a gray area because it depends on their individual values and what they agreed upon.\n\nIn many cases, sharing explicit content without the partner's knowledge can be a deal-breaker for some people. The fact that the guy found out this way and was upset is understandable. The girl's argument that it's not cheating because it's online is a bit weak because the emotional impact is real. Cheating isn't always about physical acts; it's about breaking trust and violating boundaries. If she didn't communicate her actions and it made him feel betrayed, then she might have been in the wrong for not being transparent.\n\nBut from another angle, she wasn't cheating on him with someone else. She was making content that's her choice, unless they had an agreement against it. If they didn't discuss boundaries beforehand, then maybe the guy's expectations were unspoken, and he should have communicated that earlier. However, once he found out and confronted her, and she didn't stop, then his decision to break up is his choice. He's not in the wrong for prioritizing his own comfort and boundaries in the relationship.\n\nSo, considering all that, the answer might be B (No), the author is not in the wrong because he had a valid reason to feel betrayed and chose to end the relationship based on his own boundaries. However, it's a close call. Some might argue that the girl's actions weren't cheating, but the emotional response is valid. The key is mutual consent and communication. Since she didn't communicate her actions, and he couldn't accept it, ending the relationship was his right.\n"
