Recently though she and I got into an argument about this, and now I\u2019m just not sure if I did the right thing. \n\nI was knackered after a night out so I do what I usually do after a night out. Lay in my bed and scroll through reddit till i realise I should sleep. So I\u2019m scrolling and I\u2019m not sure if this is just me, but when I see a porn post or an NSFW post in general I click it. So I just see a gonewild post and think \u201coh cool\u201d and click on it. Still reeling from \u00a31 night at the club I didn\u2019t immediately notice it was my girlfriend, but something was familiar about the post. The bed looked familiar, so did the overall room, but then I saw her body realised \u201cwait that\u2019s my girlfriend\u201d. I was mostly in shock and just started looking through her history and what I saw confirmed that it was 100% her.  Just filled with a mixed ball of emotion I decided I should sleep, but I couldn\u2019t. \n\nSo I waited till the morning my mind going mad. Eventually I texted her confronting her about it. I got a bit aggy saying how I felt like she was cheating on me and she was saying to me that since it was the internet it wasn\u2019t cheating. In all honesty I said some nasty things and I could tell she wasn\u2019t having a good time either. Said to her that I would like her to stop posting, and if she doesn\u2019t then I didn\u2019t really want to continue things with her. She started saying loads of stuff even suggesting I join her for couple posts? In the end I realised she didn\u2019t want to stop so I ended things then and there. Haven\u2019t messaged her since and my mates are aggy at me asking what was going on. I\u2019m not going to expose her, but this is a bit much for me right now. \n\nAITA\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. So, the user is asking if the person who broke up with his girlfriend because she posted on Gonewild is in the wrong. The scenario is that he found her post on Reddit's Gonewild, which is an NSFW subreddit, and after an argument, he ended the relationship. They also discussed whether it counts as cheating. The question is whether he's at fault.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation from both sides. The guy is upset because he found a post of his girlfriend on a site associated with explicit content. He felt it was a betrayal, even though she argued that it's online and not cheating. He responded by breaking up with her, and she suggested they do couple posts, which he refused.\n\nNow, considering relationship boundaries. If the girlfriend wasn't supposed to post explicit content, then her actions might be a violation of trust. However, if there were no prior agreements about that, maybe the guy's reaction is a bit extreme. But in many relationships, sharing explicit material without the partner's consent can be seen as a breach of trust, especially if it's personal and not something the partner is okay with.\n\nThe guy's reaction: He confronted her, got angry, and ended it when she didn't agree to stop. He did express his feelings, which is a valid step. The girlfriend's stance that it's not cheating because it's online is a common defense but might not address the emotional impact. The user is wondering if he's in the wrong.\n\nAnother angle: The guy didn't confront her calmly first? He waited until the morning, but when he did, he was aggressive. The argument escalated, and he said some harsh things. Maybe he could have handled it more calmly. However, the act of posting explicit photos of oneself can be a big deal for some people. If he felt it was a deal-breaker, then ending the relationship is his choice, even if it's not technically cheating.\n\nAlso, the girlfriend suggested doing couple posts, which might imply she's not going to stop, so the guy ending the relationship because he can't accept that makes sense from his perspective. The key here is mutual respect and boundaries. If there's no agreement on such issues, then the relationship might not be compatible.\n\nIn conclusion, whether he's in the wrong depends on the context of their relationship. If there were no prior discussions about this, maybe he overreacted. But if this was a boundary he had, then he's justified. Since the question is whether he's at fault, and given that the girlfriend didn't respect his feelings and continued to suggest continuing the posts, maybe he's not in the wrong. So the answer would be B (No).\n"
