Recently we asked a girl to join our team, lets call her Jane. After match we often say stuff like \u2018well done boiz\u2019 and she told us that makes her feel like not part of the team and suggested we say something like \u2018well done team\u2019 instead. We all agreed to try, she is part of the team and as good as any of us guys. Jane has said it is difficult for a girl to play in an all male group but I don\u2019t see why as we treat her well.\n\nYesterday one guy posted in group chat that he could not attend a practice and said \u2018Have fun lads and Jane\u2019. Jane responded by telling him that was worse than just saying \u2018lads\u2019 and made her feel \u2018othered\u2019.\n\nThe group had a bit of a chat about it and I said I was gonna keep using \u2018lads\u2019 and \u2018guys\u2019 because I mean the whole team when I say that and I am not giving in to radical feminism. \n\nThe guy who started this though, said he was sorry for what he wrote and he was trying to include her and he would try to refer to team or people in future.\n\nI ought to be able to use normal words without overly sensitive people feeling hurt by it. I am surprised that some of the other guys are taking her side though.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA scenario is in the wrong. The situation involves using terms like \"lads\" and \"guys\" in a mixed group, which includes a female player named Jane. Jane has already expressed that these terms make her feel excluded, and the group agreed to use \"team\" instead. However, the author insists on using \"lads\" because they think Jane is being overly sensitive.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze the key points. The main issue here is about inclusive language and respecting others' feelings. Jane was asked to join a predominantly male team, and she's been vocal about feeling excluded by the male-centric terms. The author's stance is that they aren't giving in to \"radical feminism\" and that they mean the whole team when they say \"lads.\" The other guy apologized after Jane pointed out his exclusion, but the author is resisting changing their language.\n\nI should consider whether the author's use of \"lads\" is problematic. Even if the author intends to include everyone, the term \"lads\" is traditionally male and might not be inclusive, especially when there's a female member who feels excluded. The fact that Jane has already communicated her discomfort and the group agreed to use \"team\" suggests that the author is going against a collective agreement.\n\nThe author's response that they're not giving in to political correctness might come off as dismissive. Respecting Jane's feelings and the team's agreement is important for maintaining an inclusive environment. The author is not just using the term in isolation; it's part of a pattern where Jane has consistently felt othered. The other members apologized and adjusted, but the author is rigid in their stance.\n\nIn terms of social dynamics, inclusivity often requires adapting language to make everyone feel part of the group. The author's refusal to change despite feedback could be seen as not taking Jane's concerns seriously. Even if the author's intention is good, the impact on Jane is real, and intent vs. impact is a common issue in these situations.\n\nSo, considering all that, the answer would likely be that the author is in the wrong because they are dismissing Jane's valid feelings and not adhering to the group's agreement. They should be more considerate of how their language affects others, even if they don't see the problem themselves.\n"
