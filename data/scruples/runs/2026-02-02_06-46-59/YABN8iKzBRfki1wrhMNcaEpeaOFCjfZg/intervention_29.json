Recently we asked a girl to join our team, lets call her Jane. After match we often say stuff like \u2018well done boiz\u2019 and she told us that makes her feel like not part of the team and suggested we say something like \u2018well done team\u2019 instead. We all agreed to try, she is part of the team and as good as any of us guys. Jane has said it is difficult for a girl to play in an all male group but I don\u2019t see why as we treat her well.\n\nYesterday one guy posted in group chat that he could not attend a practice and said \u2018Have fun lads and Jane\u2019. Jane responded by telling him that was worse than just saying \u2018lads\u2019 and made her feel \u2018othered\u2019.\n\nThe group had a bit of a chat about it and I said I was gonna keep using \u2018lads\u2019 and \u2018guys\u2019 because I mean the whole team when I say that and I am not giving in to radical feminism. \n\nThe guy who started this though, said he was sorry for what he wrote and he was trying to include her and he would try to refer to team or people in future.\n\nI ought to be able to use normal words without overly sensitive people feeling hurt by it. I am surprised that some of the other guys are taking her side though.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so the user is asking whether the author of the AITA post is in the wrong. Let me try to break this down.\n\nFirst, the situation: The author is part of an online gaming team that's mostly male. They invited a girl named Jane to join. Jane felt excluded when they used terms like \"lads\" and \"guys,\" so she suggested using \"team\" instead. The group agreed. Then, one guy used \"lads and Jane,\" which Jane found even worse. The author defended using \"lads\" and \"guys,\" saying they mean the whole team and not giving in to radical feminism. The user thinks the author is wrong but wants to know others' opinions.\n\nSo, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. The options are A (yes) or B (no). Let me consider both sides.\n\nOn one hand, the author is using inclusive language as Jane requested. Jane feels that \"lads\" and \"guys\" exclude her, even if the intent is to refer to the whole team. The author's use of these terms might unintentionally make her feel othered. Even if the term is meant to be inclusive, the effect on Jane matters. The fact that Jane is part of the team and the group initially agreed to use \"team\" suggests that the author's continued use of \"lads\" might be ignoring Jane's feelings and the group's prior agreement. The author's comment about \"not giving in to radical feminism\" could also be seen as dismissive of Jane's valid concerns.\n\nOn the other hand, the author might argue that they're using common terms and not intentionally excluding Jane. They might believe that the intent is inclusive, so the terms shouldn't be an issue. The other guy who used \"lads and Jane\" was sorry, so maybe the author feels like they're overreacting. However, the problem isn't just about intent; it's about the impact. If Jane feels excluded, even with good intentions, the language can still be harmful.\n\nAnother point is that the group had already agreed to use \"team\" after Jane's initial feedback. The author's continued use of \"lads\" might be seen as not respecting that agreement. The fact that some other guys are taking Jane's side indicates that there's a shift in the group's attitude towards inclusivity. The author's stance could be causing division within the team, which is important for teamwork in a game.\n\nIn terms of social dynamics, using gendered terms in a mixed group can inadvertently create a sense of exclusion for those not part of the dominant group. The term \"lads\" is specifically male-oriented, so adding \"and Jane\" might highlight her as different, making her feel like an outsider despite being a team member. The author's use of the term \"radical feminism\" might also be a way to dismiss legitimate concerns about inclusivity and respect.\n\nTherefore, even if the author doesn't see the issue, Jane's experience is valid. The key here is empathy and respecting the team's agreement to use inclusive language. The author is in the wrong because they're not considering Jane's feelings and the agreed-upon changes, which affects team cohesion. The author's comment about \"not giving in to radical feminism\" further shows a lack of understanding and respect for Jane's perspective.\n"
