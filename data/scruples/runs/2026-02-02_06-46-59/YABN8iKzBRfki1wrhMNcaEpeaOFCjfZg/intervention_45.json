Recently we asked a girl to join our team, lets call her Jane. After match we often say stuff like \u2018well done boiz\u2019 and she told us that makes her feel like not part of the team and suggested we say something like \u2018well done team\u2019 instead. We all agreed to try, she is part of the team and as good as any of us guys. Jane has said it is difficult for a girl to play in an all male group but I don\u2019t see why as we treat her well.\n\nYesterday one guy posted in group chat that he could not attend a practice and said \u2018Have fun lads and Jane\u2019. Jane responded by telling him that was worse than just saying \u2018lads\u2019 and made her feel \u2018othered\u2019.\n\nThe group had a bit of a chat about it and I said I was gonna keep using \u2018lads\u2019 and \u2018guys\u2019 because I mean the whole team when I say that and I am not giving in to radical feminism. \n\nThe guy who started this though, said he was sorry for what he wrote and he was trying to include her and he would try to refer to team or people in future.\n\nI ought to be able to use normal words without overly sensitive people feeling hurt by it. I am surprised that some of the other guys are taking her side though.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking whether the author (AITA) is in the wrong for using terms like \"lads\" and \"guys\" in a mixed group, especially after Jane expressed discomfort.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the context. The team is mostly male, and Jane is the only female. They initially used \"boiz,\" which she found exclusionary. They agreed to switch to \"team.\" But then someone used \"lads and Jane,\" which she found worse because it made her feel singled out. The author then defends using \"lads\" and \"guys,\" saying they mean the whole team and they're not giving in to radical feminism.\n\nSo, the main issue here is about inclusive language. The author believes that the intent is to include everyone, but Jane's experience is feeling excluded. The key here is whether intent matters more than the impact. Even if the intention is inclusive, the impact on Jane is negative. The author dismisses her feelings by referencing \"radical feminism,\" which might be a way of avoiding responsibility.\n\nAnother point is that the team had already agreed to use \"team\" instead of gendered terms after Jane's initial complaint. Then the guy tried to include her by adding her name, which Jane found more exclusionary. The author then refuses to change their language, claiming it's about not being too sensitive.\n\nI think the author is in the wrong because they're not taking Jane's feelings seriously. Even if the intention is to include, the words used still highlight her as different. Using gendered terms in a mixed group can inadvertently exclude non-male members. The author's dismissal by mentioning \"radical feminism\" also shows a lack of empathy and understanding. The fact that other guys are taking her side suggests that the author's stance isn't the majority, which might indicate that the author is being resistant to necessary changes for inclusivity.\n"
