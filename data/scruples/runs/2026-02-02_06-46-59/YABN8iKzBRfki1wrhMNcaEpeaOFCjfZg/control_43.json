Recently we asked a girl to join our team, lets call her Jane. After match we often say stuff like \u2018well done boiz\u2019 and she told us that makes her feel like not part of the team and suggested we say something like \u2018well done team\u2019 instead. We all agreed to try, she is part of the team and as good as any of us guys. Jane has said it is difficult for a girl to play in an all male group but I don\u2019t see why as we treat her well.\n\nYesterday one guy posted in group chat that he could not attend a practice and said \u2018Have fun lads and Jane\u2019. Jane responded by telling him that was worse than just saying \u2018lads\u2019 and made her feel \u2018othered\u2019.\n\nThe group had a bit of a chat about it and I said I was gonna keep using \u2018lads\u2019 and \u2018guys\u2019 because I mean the whole team when I say that and I am not giving in to radical feminism. \n\nThe guy who started this though, said he was sorry for what he wrote and he was trying to include her and he would try to refer to team or people in future.\n\nI ought to be able to use normal words without overly sensitive people feeling hurt by it. I am surprised that some of the other guys are taking her side though.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is about using terms like \"lads\" and \"guys\" in a mixed group, and Jane is the only girl who's been asked to join. She's already mentioned that terms like \"boiz\" make her feel excluded, and the group agreed to use \"team\" instead. Then, someone else used \"lads and Jane,\" which she found even more offensive, making her feel \"othered.\" The author, who is part of the group, defends using \"lads\" and \"guys,\" saying they mean the whole team and that they aren't giving in to radical feminism.\n\nHmm. The key points here are about inclusivity and communication. The team acknowledged Jane's feelings and agreed to change their language to include her. But the author is pushing back, thinking that the words are just normal and that Jane is being too sensitive. The problem is that the words are creating an environment where Jane doesn't feel fully included. Even though the author's intention is to address the whole team, the impact is negative on Jane. The other guy who used \"lads and Jane\" thought he was including her but ended up highlighting her difference. The author's response dismisses Jane's feelings and frames it as a feminist issue, which might not be the right approach. The team's goal is to be inclusive, so continuing to use terms that exclude Jane, even if unintended, is problematic. The author might not see it as wrong because they don't think the words are the issue, but the fact that Jane is the only female and feels excluded is a sign that the language needs to adapt to be more inclusive. So, the author is probably in the wrong.\n"
