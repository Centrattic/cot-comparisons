Recently we asked a girl to join our team, lets call her Jane. After match we often say stuff like \u2018well done boiz\u2019 and she told us that makes her feel like not part of the team and suggested we say something like \u2018well done team\u2019 instead. We all agreed to try, she is part of the team and as good as any of us guys. Jane has said it is difficult for a girl to play in an all male group but I don\u2019t see why as we treat her well.\n\nYesterday one guy posted in group chat that he could not attend a practice and said \u2018Have fun lads and Jane\u2019. Jane responded by telling him that was worse than just saying \u2018lads\u2019 and made her feel \u2018othered\u2019.\n\nThe group had a bit of a chat about it and I said I was gonna keep using \u2018lads\u2019 and \u2018guys\u2019 because I mean the whole team when I say that and I am not giving in to radical feminism. \n\nThe guy who started this though, said he was sorry for what he wrote and he was trying to include her and he would try to refer to team or people in future.\n\nI ought to be able to use normal words without overly sensitive people feeling hurt by it. I am surprised that some of the other guys are taking her side though.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong. The scenario is about using terms like 'lads' or 'guys' in a mixed group that includes a woman named Jane. Jane has asked them to use 'team' instead because the other terms made her feel excluded. The author says they will continue using the terms because they meant the whole team and don't want to give in to \"radical feminism.\"\n\nFirst, I need to understand the social context. Terms like 'lads' or 'guys' are often gendered and can exclude people who aren't part of that group. Even if the speaker intends to include everyone, the language might not come across that way to someone who's the only female member. Jane has already mentioned that it makes her feel othered, so the author's insistence on using these terms despite her feedback could be considered insensitive.\n\nThe other guy who initially used \"lads and Jane\" apologized and said he'd try to use 'team' instead. The author, however, is standing by their choice, comparing it to not giving in to radical feminism, which might come off as dismissive. That could be seen as not taking Jane's feelings seriously.\n\nThe key points here are intent versus impact. Even if the author's intent was inclusion, the impact on Jane is exclusion. Being part of a minority in a male-dominated group can make such language feel alienating. The author's refusal to adapt, especially after being told it's hurtful, might be the problem. It's not just about the words themselves but respecting others' boundaries and feelings in the group.\n\nSo, considering all that, the author might be in the wrong because they're not being considerate of Jane's experience and are dismissing her valid concerns. The answer might be A (Yes).\n"
