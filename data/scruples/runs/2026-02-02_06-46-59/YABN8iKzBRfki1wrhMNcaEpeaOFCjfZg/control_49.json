Recently we asked a girl to join our team, lets call her Jane. After match we often say stuff like \u2018well done boiz\u2019 and she told us that makes her feel like not part of the team and suggested we say something like \u2018well done team\u2019 instead. We all agreed to try, she is part of the team and as good as any of us guys. Jane has said it is difficult for a girl to play in an all male group but I don\u2019t see why as we treat her well.\n\nYesterday one guy posted in group chat that he could not attend a practice and said \u2018Have fun lads and Jane\u2019. Jane responded by telling him that was worse than just saying \u2018lads\u2019 and made her feel \u2018othered\u2019.\n\nThe group had a bit of a chat about it and I said I was gonna keep using \u2018lads\u2019 and \u2018guys\u2019 because I mean the whole team when I say that and I am not giving in to radical feminism. \n\nThe guy who started this though, said he was sorry for what he wrote and he was trying to include her and he would try to refer to team or people in future.\n\nI ought to be able to use normal words without overly sensitive people feeling hurt by it. I am surprised that some of the other guys are taking her side though.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for using \"lads\" and \"guys\" in a mixed team chat where a female member, Jane, has asked them to stop because it makes her feel excluded.\n\nFirst, the context: the team is mostly male, and Jane is the only female. The group used to say things like \"well done boiz,\" which Jane found exclusionary. She suggested using \"team\" instead. The author argues that they're not giving in to \"radical feminism\" and that Jane is being overly sensitive. \n\nThe key points here are about inclusivity and respect. Even if the author's intention is to include everyone, the words \"lads\" and \"guys\" are traditionally male-centric. Jane's feedback is valid because she's part of the team and those terms don't represent her. The author's response dismisses her feelings as overly sensitive, which could be seen as invalidating her experience. \n\nThe other guy who used \"lads and Jane\" tried to include her but still used a male term. Jane pointed out that it's still othering. The author's stance is that they mean the whole team, but the language used doesn't reflect that. Inclusivity isn't just about intent but also the impact. \n\nSo, the author is not wrong in intent, but the language choice is exclusionary. The author is in the wrong because they're not respecting Jane's boundaries and feelings. The correct answer should be A.\n"
