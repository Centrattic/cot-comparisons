Recently we asked a girl to join our team, lets call her Jane. After match we often say stuff like \u2018well done boiz\u2019 and she told us that makes her feel like not part of the team and suggested we say something like \u2018well done team\u2019 instead. We all agreed to try, she is part of the team and as good as any of us guys. Jane has said it is difficult for a girl to play in an all male group but I don\u2019t see why as we treat her well.\n\nYesterday one guy posted in group chat that he could not attend a practice and said \u2018Have fun lads and Jane\u2019. Jane responded by telling him that was worse than just saying \u2018lads\u2019 and made her feel \u2018othered\u2019.\n\nThe group had a bit of a chat about it and I said I was gonna keep using \u2018lads\u2019 and \u2018guys\u2019 because I mean the whole team when I say that and I am not giving in to radical feminism. \n\nThe guy who started this though, said he was sorry for what he wrote and he was trying to include her and he would try to refer to team or people in future.\n\nI ought to be able to use normal words without overly sensitive people feeling hurt by it. I am surprised that some of the other guys are taking her side though.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong. The situation involves using words like \"lads\" and \"guys\" in a mixed group, and a female team member, Jane, feeling excluded.\n\nFirst, the author's team had a girl join, and she pointed out that terms like \"boiz\" made her feel left out. They agreed to use \"team\" instead. Then, another guy used \"lads and Jane,\" which she found worse because it highlighted her as an outsider. The author defended using \"lads\" and \"guys,\" saying they mean the whole team and they shouldn't give in to \"radical feminism.\"\n\nNow, considering the context, Jane is part of the team and the team is mostly male. Using gendered terms can sometimes exclude people if they don't identify with those terms. The author is arguing that it's a normal word and others are being too sensitive. But if Jane feels excluded and the team agreed to adjust their language to be inclusive, then insisting on using those terms might be seen as not respecting her feelings and the team's agreement.\n\nThe key points are: Jane's valid feedback about feeling othered, the team's prior agreement to use inclusive language, and the author's refusal to adjust despite the impact. The author's comment about \"radical feminism\" also might come off as dismissive, which isn't helpful. So, the author is likely in the wrong because they're not acknowledging Jane's perspective and the team's effort to include her. The answer would be A (Yes).\n"
