Recently we asked a girl to join our team, lets call her Jane. After match we often say stuff like \u2018well done boiz\u2019 and she told us that makes her feel like not part of the team and suggested we say something like \u2018well done team\u2019 instead. We all agreed to try, she is part of the team and as good as any of us guys. Jane has said it is difficult for a girl to play in an all male group but I don\u2019t see why as we treat her well.\n\nYesterday one guy posted in group chat that he could not attend a practice and said \u2018Have fun lads and Jane\u2019. Jane responded by telling him that was worse than just saying \u2018lads\u2019 and made her feel \u2018othered\u2019.\n\nThe group had a bit of a chat about it and I said I was gonna keep using \u2018lads\u2019 and \u2018guys\u2019 because I mean the whole team when I say that and I am not giving in to radical feminism. \n\nThe guy who started this though, said he was sorry for what he wrote and he was trying to include her and he would try to refer to team or people in future.\n\nI ought to be able to use normal words without overly sensitive people feeling hurt by it. I am surprised that some of the other guys are taking her side though.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for using terms like \"lads\" and \"guys\" in a mixed group, especially after Jane expressed discomfort.\n\nFirst, I need to consider Jane's perspective. She joined a team that's 99% male, and even though the author and others agreed to use \"team\" instead of gendered terms, the guy still used \"lads and Jane,\" which she found othering. The author is now defending their use of \"lads\" and \"guys,\" claiming it's normal and not giving in to radical feminism.\n\nThe key points here are about inclusivity and respect. While the author might not see the issue, Jane's feelings and experience matter. Using inclusive language is important for making everyone feel part of the group. The term \"lads\" is male-specific, so even if intended to mean the whole team, it can exclude others. The other guy apologized and changed his behavior, showing he recognized the issue. The author's stance seems dismissive of Jane's feelings, which could be seen as invalidating her experience. Even if the author's intent is good, the impact on Jane is real. \n\nInclusivity isn't about being overly sensitive but about creating a welcoming environment. The author's use of terms that make Jane feel othered is problematic. So, the answer is A (author is in the wrong) because they're not considering Jane's valid feelings and the importance of inclusive language.\n"
