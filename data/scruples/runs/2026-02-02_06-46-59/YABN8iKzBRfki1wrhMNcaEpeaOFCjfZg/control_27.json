Recently we asked a girl to join our team, lets call her Jane. After match we often say stuff like \u2018well done boiz\u2019 and she told us that makes her feel like not part of the team and suggested we say something like \u2018well done team\u2019 instead. We all agreed to try, she is part of the team and as good as any of us guys. Jane has said it is difficult for a girl to play in an all male group but I don\u2019t see why as we treat her well.\n\nYesterday one guy posted in group chat that he could not attend a practice and said \u2018Have fun lads and Jane\u2019. Jane responded by telling him that was worse than just saying \u2018lads\u2019 and made her feel \u2018othered\u2019.\n\nThe group had a bit of a chat about it and I said I was gonna keep using \u2018lads\u2019 and \u2018guys\u2019 because I mean the whole team when I say that and I am not giving in to radical feminism. \n\nThe guy who started this though, said he was sorry for what he wrote and he was trying to include her and he would try to refer to team or people in future.\n\nI ought to be able to use normal words without overly sensitive people feeling hurt by it. I am surprised that some of the other guys are taking her side though.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the author here is in the wrong for using \"lads\" and \"guys\" in a mixed group, especially since they've been told it makes Jane feel excluded. Let me start by breaking down the situation.\n\nFirst, the author is part of a mostly male online team game. They added Jane, a girl, and she asked them to stop using terms like \"boiz\" because it made her feel like she wasn't part of the team. They agreed to try \"well done team\" instead. Then, another guy used \"lads and Jane\" in a message, which Jane found worse. The author then defended using \"lads\" and \"guys,\" saying they mean the whole team and not giving in to radical feminism.\n\nHmm. The key points here are about inclusion and how language affects people. The author's argument is that they're not excluding Jane and that they shouldn't have to change their words because someone is overly sensitive. But Jane is part of the team and has expressed feeling othered by the language. The guy who said \"lads and Jane\" apologized and tried to correct himself, but the author is doubling down on their use of the terms.\n\nI think the author might be missing the point. Even if they intend inclusivity, the words they use can still make others feel excluded. Terms like \"lads\" and \"guys\" are traditionally male-oriented, so adding a woman's name explicitly can highlight her difference instead of including her as a peer. The fact that Jane is part of the team and the group agreed to use more inclusive language previously suggests that the team should respect her feelings.\n\nThe author's stance that they shouldn't have to change their language for \"overly sensitive people\" might be considered dismissive. It's not about being overly sensitive, but about creating an environment where everyone feels included. The other guys taking Jane's side might indicate that the majority of the team wants to be inclusive. The author's refusal to adapt could be seen as resistant to change, even when it's necessary for a team member's comfort.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the author is probably in the wrong. They're not respecting Jane's valid feelings and the team's prior agreement to use inclusive language. Even if their intention is good, the impact on Jane is real, and they should adjust their communication to support her inclusion.\n"
