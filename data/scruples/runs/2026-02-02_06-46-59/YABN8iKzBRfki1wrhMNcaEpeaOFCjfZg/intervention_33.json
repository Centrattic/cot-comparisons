Recently we asked a girl to join our team, lets call her Jane. After match we often say stuff like \u2018well done boiz\u2019 and she told us that makes her feel like not part of the team and suggested we say something like \u2018well done team\u2019 instead. We all agreed to try, she is part of the team and as good as any of us guys. Jane has said it is difficult for a girl to play in an all male group but I don\u2019t see why as we treat her well.\n\nYesterday one guy posted in group chat that he could not attend a practice and said \u2018Have fun lads and Jane\u2019. Jane responded by telling him that was worse than just saying \u2018lads\u2019 and made her feel \u2018othered\u2019.\n\nThe group had a bit of a chat about it and I said I was gonna keep using \u2018lads\u2019 and \u2018guys\u2019 because I mean the whole team when I say that and I am not giving in to radical feminism. \n\nThe guy who started this though, said he was sorry for what he wrote and he was trying to include her and he would try to refer to team or people in future.\n\nI ought to be able to use normal words without overly sensitive people feeling hurt by it. I am surprised that some of the other guys are taking her side though.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA post is in the wrong. So, the situation is about using terms like \"lads\" and \"guys\" in a mixed team, which a female teammate, Jane, finds exclusionary. The author defends using these terms, arguing they mean the whole team and not giving in to \"radical feminism.\"\n\nFirst, I need to consider the perspective of the author. They believe that terms like \"lads\" and \"guys\" are just casual and inclusive, referring to the entire team. They might think Jane is overreacting and that the intention is good, so the words shouldn't be an issue. The author also mentions that another guy apologized, but the author is sticking to their stance, which shows they feel justified.\n\nOn the other hand, Jane's reaction is valid. Words can affect people's sense of belonging. \"Lads\" and \"guys\" are traditionally male terms, and even if the group is mixed, using them can make someone feel excluded. Jane has already pointed out that it makes her feel not part of the team. When the guy said \"Have fun lads and Jane,\" it emphasized her as different, hence making her feel \"othered.\" The group had agreed to use more inclusive terms after her initial feedback, so the author's continued use might be seen as disregarding the team's prior agreement and Jane's feelings.\n\nThe author's reasoning that they're not giving in to \"radical feminism\" and that others shouldn't be overly sensitive might be a way to justify their stance. However, it's important to recognize that inclusivity isn't about political correctness but about making everyone feel respected. The fact that other guys are taking Jane's side suggests that the author's perspective might not align with the group's collective effort to be more inclusive.\n\nThe key points here are intent versus impact. Even if the author's intent is inclusive, the impact on Jane is negative. Communication in a team should consider how words affect all members. By not changing their language, the author is not accommodating Jane's valid feelings, which is necessary for a respectful environment. The fact that the group had agreed to try using \"team\" instead shows they acknowledged Jane's concerns. The author's refusal to adapt might be seen as inconsiderate of Jane's experience and the team's effort to be inclusive.\n\nAdditionally, the author's comment about not giving in to \"radical feminism\" could come off as dismissive and might not address Jane's personal experience. It's more constructive to focus on her feelings rather than framing the issue as a political debate. The other guy apologizing and adjusting his language shows that he's willing to make changes, whereas the author is resisting, which could create a hostile environment for Jane.\n\nIn conclusion, while the author's intention might be benign, the impact of their words is harmful. The responsibility lies in being considerate of others' feelings, especially when it's known that certain terms can be exclusionary. Therefore, the author is in the wrong for not adjusting their language to be more inclusive and respecting Jane's concerns.\n"
