Recently we asked a girl to join our team, lets call her Jane. After match we often say stuff like \u2018well done boiz\u2019 and she told us that makes her feel like not part of the team and suggested we say something like \u2018well done team\u2019 instead. We all agreed to try, she is part of the team and as good as any of us guys. Jane has said it is difficult for a girl to play in an all male group but I don\u2019t see why as we treat her well.\n\nYesterday one guy posted in group chat that he could not attend a practice and said \u2018Have fun lads and Jane\u2019. Jane responded by telling him that was worse than just saying \u2018lads\u2019 and made her feel \u2018othered\u2019.\n\nThe group had a bit of a chat about it and I said I was gonna keep using \u2018lads\u2019 and \u2018guys\u2019 because I mean the whole team when I say that and I am not giving in to radical feminism. \n\nThe guy who started this though, said he was sorry for what he wrote and he was trying to include her and he would try to refer to team or people in future.\n\nI ought to be able to use normal words without overly sensitive people feeling hurt by it. I am surprised that some of the other guys are taking her side though.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, so the user is asking whether the person in the AITA scenario is in the wrong. Let me break down the situation.\n\nThe author is part of a mostly male gaming team that invited a girl named Jane. Jane felt excluded when they used terms like \"boiz\" and \"lads,\" so she suggested using \"team\" instead. The group agreed to try that. Then, another guy used \"lads and Jane,\" which Jane found even more exclusionary. The author defends using \"lads\" and \"guys,\" arguing they mean the whole team and that they shouldn't give in to \"radical feminism.\"\n\nFirst, I need to consider Jane's perspective. She's the only girl in a male-dominated group, and the language used might make her feel like an outsider. Even if the intention is to include her, using terms that clearly refer to a male group can be alienating. The fact that Jane has already mentioned it's difficult for a girl to play in an all-male group supports her sensitivity here.\n\nThe key point is about inclusive language. Terms like \"lads\" and \"guys\" are traditionally male-oriented, and even if the speaker means the whole team, the words can subconsciously reinforce that the default is male. When the author insists on using these terms despite feedback, it shows a lack of consideration for Jane's feelings. The other guy who used \"lads and Jane\" tried to include her by name, but Jane found that worse because it highlighted her difference. The author's response about not giving in to radical feminism is dismissive and doesn't address Jane's valid concerns about feeling othered.\n\nThe author's stance that Jane is being overly sensitive is problematic. It's not about sensitivity but about creating an inclusive environment. The group had already agreed to use more inclusive terms after Jane's initial feedback, so reverting to \"lads\" when she feels it's hurtful shows inconsistency. Even if the author's intention is to be inclusive, the impact is what matters here. The fact that some other guys are taking Jane's side suggests that the author's position isn't universally accepted, indicating a possible misunderstanding of the issue.\n\nIn conclusion, the author is in the wrong because they are not respecting Jane's feelings and the agreed-upon effort to include her by using more neutral terms. The insistence on traditional male terms, despite knowing they hurt her, shows a failure to adapt and be considerate in a mixed group setting.\n"
