Recently we asked a girl to join our team, lets call her Jane. After match we often say stuff like \u2018well done boiz\u2019 and she told us that makes her feel like not part of the team and suggested we say something like \u2018well done team\u2019 instead. We all agreed to try, she is part of the team and as good as any of us guys. Jane has said it is difficult for a girl to play in an all male group but I don\u2019t see why as we treat her well.\n\nYesterday one guy posted in group chat that he could not attend a practice and said \u2018Have fun lads and Jane\u2019. Jane responded by telling him that was worse than just saying \u2018lads\u2019 and made her feel \u2018othered\u2019.\n\nThe group had a bit of a chat about it and I said I was gonna keep using \u2018lads\u2019 and \u2018guys\u2019 because I mean the whole team when I say that and I am not giving in to radical feminism. \n\nThe guy who started this though, said he was sorry for what he wrote and he was trying to include her and he would try to refer to team or people in future.\n\nI ought to be able to use normal words without overly sensitive people feeling hurt by it. I am surprised that some of the other guys are taking her side though.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, so I need to figure out if the person who wrote this is in the wrong. The situation is about using terms like \"lads\" and \"guys\" in a mixed group. The author is part of a mostly male online game team, and a girl named Jane joined. She felt excluded when they used \"boiz\" and suggested using \"team\" instead. Then someone used \"lads and Jane,\" which upset her again. The author defended using \"lads\" and \"guys,\" saying they mean the whole team and they're not giving in to radical feminism.\n\nFirst, I should consider the impact of the words. The key point is whether the terms make Jane feel excluded. Even if the intention is to include everyone, the effect is what matters here. \"Lads\" and \"guys\" are traditionally male terms, so using them in a mixed group might unintentionally exclude women. When the guy added \"and Jane,\" it highlighted her as different, which could make her feel othered.\n\nThe author's argument is that they're using normal words and shouldn't have to change because someone is sensitive. But the issue isn't about being overly sensitive; it's about creating an inclusive environment. The fact that Jane is part of the team and as good as the male players suggests that the team wants her to feel included. If the language consistently makes her feel excluded, that's a problem regardless of the author's intentions.\n\nAlso, the other guy apologized and tried to adjust, showing that effort to be inclusive is possible. The author's refusal to change their language, even after Jane expressed discomfort, might be seen as dismissive. The author's comment about \"radical feminism\" could also be seen as derogatory and not taking Jane's feelings seriously.\n\nOn the other hand, the author might feel that the terms are just slang and not meant to exclude. It's possible they don't see the issue, but that doesn't absolve them of responsibility if their words are making a teammate uncomfortable. Inclusive language is about making everyone feel welcome, so even if the terms seem harmless, changing them can help maintain a positive team environment.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the author's insistence on using terms that exclude Jane, despite her feedback, suggests that they are in the wrong. The answer is A.\n"
