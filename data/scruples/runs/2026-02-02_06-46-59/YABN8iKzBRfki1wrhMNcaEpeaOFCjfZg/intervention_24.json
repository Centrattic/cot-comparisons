Recently we asked a girl to join our team, lets call her Jane. After match we often say stuff like \u2018well done boiz\u2019 and she told us that makes her feel like not part of the team and suggested we say something like \u2018well done team\u2019 instead. We all agreed to try, she is part of the team and as good as any of us guys. Jane has said it is difficult for a girl to play in an all male group but I don\u2019t see why as we treat her well.\n\nYesterday one guy posted in group chat that he could not attend a practice and said \u2018Have fun lads and Jane\u2019. Jane responded by telling him that was worse than just saying \u2018lads\u2019 and made her feel \u2018othered\u2019.\n\nThe group had a bit of a chat about it and I said I was gonna keep using \u2018lads\u2019 and \u2018guys\u2019 because I mean the whole team when I say that and I am not giving in to radical feminism. \n\nThe guy who started this though, said he was sorry for what he wrote and he was trying to include her and he would try to refer to team or people in future.\n\nI ought to be able to use normal words without overly sensitive people feeling hurt by it. I am surprised that some of the other guys are taking her side though.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation involves a mixed-gender team where the majority are male players. Jane, the female member, asks them to stop using terms like \"lads\" and \"guys\" because it makes her feel excluded. They agreed to try \"team\" instead. Then one guy slips up by saying \"lads and Jane,\" which Jane takes as \"othering.\" The author stands by using \"lads\" and \"guys,\" claiming they are the whole team and not giving in to \"radical feminism.\"\n\nFirst, the key points here are about inclusivity and communication. Jane is making a valid point that certain terms can make her feel excluded, even if it's unintentional. The author is defending the use of these terms by saying they mean the whole team, but the impact is that Jane still feels othered. The guy who initially used \"lads and Jane\" apologized and agreed to change, showing some awareness. The author, however, is resistant, which might be seen as dismissive of Jane's feelings.\n\nThe author's argument is that they're using normal words and shouldn't have to change for being \"overly sensitive.\" But the issue isn't about sensitivity\u2014it's about Jane's experience and inclusion. Even if the author doesn't see the problem, the fact that Jane is uncomfortable and the group is trying to adjust suggests that the author's stance is part of the issue. The other guys taking Jane's side might indicate that the author is out of step here.\n\nSo, considering that the author is refusing to adapt their language despite Jane's clear discomfort and the group's effort to be inclusive, they're likely in the wrong. Using inclusive language is about respect and ensuring everyone feels part of the group. The author's dismissal of Jane's feelings as \"radical feminism\" also shows a lack of empathy and understanding.\n"
