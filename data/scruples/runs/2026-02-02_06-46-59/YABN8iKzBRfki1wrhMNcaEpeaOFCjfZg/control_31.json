Recently we asked a girl to join our team, lets call her Jane. After match we often say stuff like \u2018well done boiz\u2019 and she told us that makes her feel like not part of the team and suggested we say something like \u2018well done team\u2019 instead. We all agreed to try, she is part of the team and as good as any of us guys. Jane has said it is difficult for a girl to play in an all male group but I don\u2019t see why as we treat her well.\n\nYesterday one guy posted in group chat that he could not attend a practice and said \u2018Have fun lads and Jane\u2019. Jane responded by telling him that was worse than just saying \u2018lads\u2019 and made her feel \u2018othered\u2019.\n\nThe group had a bit of a chat about it and I said I was gonna keep using \u2018lads\u2019 and \u2018guys\u2019 because I mean the whole team when I say that and I am not giving in to radical feminism. \n\nThe guy who started this though, said he was sorry for what he wrote and he was trying to include her and he would try to refer to team or people in future.\n\nI ought to be able to use normal words without overly sensitive people feeling hurt by it. I am surprised that some of the other guys are taking her side though.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. Let's start by reading through the situation carefully.\n\nThe person is part of an online team game that's mostly male. They added Jane, a female player. After matches, they used terms like \"boiz,\" which Jane found exclusionary. She suggested using \"team\" instead. The group agreed to try that. Then, someone used \"lads and Jane,\" which Jane found even worse. The author defended using \"lads\" and \"guys,\" saying they mean the whole team and they shouldn't give in to radical feminism. The other guy apologized and tried to adjust, but the author is frustrated that others are taking Jane's side.\n\nHmm. The key points here are about inclusive language and how the author perceives their own intent versus Jane's feelings. The author argues that their intention was to include the whole team, but Jane still feels othered. The author is defensive, saying they're not giving in to radical feminism, which might be a red flag\u2014it could be dismissing valid concerns as overreactions.\n\nI know that inclusive language is important in mixed groups. Terms like \"lads\" and \"guys\" are historically male-centric, even if used informally. Even if the author uses them to mean the whole team, the impact is what matters. Jane's feeling of being excluded is real, and the author's insistence on continuing the terms despite multiple instances of her being hurt shows a lack of consideration for her experience.\n\nAlso, the author's comment about \"radical feminism\" might be a way to invalidate Jane's feelings as political correctness gone too far. This could be a sign that the author isn't taking her concerns seriously. The fact that the rest of the group is on Jane's side suggests that the author is the outlier here. They need to recognize that inclusive language isn't about political correctness but about making everyone feel welcome. \n\nSo, even if the author's intent was good, the effect on Jane is negative. The author is in the wrong for not adjusting their language after being made aware of its impact and for framing Jane's feedback as unnecessary sensitivity.\n"
