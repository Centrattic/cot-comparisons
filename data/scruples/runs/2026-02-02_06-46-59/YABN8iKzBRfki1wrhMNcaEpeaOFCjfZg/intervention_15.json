Recently we asked a girl to join our team, lets call her Jane. After match we often say stuff like \u2018well done boiz\u2019 and she told us that makes her feel like not part of the team and suggested we say something like \u2018well done team\u2019 instead. We all agreed to try, she is part of the team and as good as any of us guys. Jane has said it is difficult for a girl to play in an all male group but I don\u2019t see why as we treat her well.\n\nYesterday one guy posted in group chat that he could not attend a practice and said \u2018Have fun lads and Jane\u2019. Jane responded by telling him that was worse than just saying \u2018lads\u2019 and made her feel \u2018othered\u2019.\n\nThe group had a bit of a chat about it and I said I was gonna keep using \u2018lads\u2019 and \u2018guys\u2019 because I mean the whole team when I say that and I am not giving in to radical feminism. \n\nThe guy who started this though, said he was sorry for what he wrote and he was trying to include her and he would try to refer to team or people in future.\n\nI ought to be able to use normal words without overly sensitive people feeling hurt by it. I am surprised that some of the other guys are taking her side though.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user wants to know if the author of the AITA scenario is in the wrong. The situation revolves around using terms like \"lads\" and \"guys\" in a mixed group, which a female team member, Jane, finds exclusionary.\n\nFirst, the author mentions that Jane felt left out when the group used \"boiz\" and suggested using \"team\" instead. The group agreed to try her suggestion. However, the author insists on using \"lads\" and \"guys,\" arguing that Jane is being overly sensitive and that they mean the whole team. Another teammate, who initially used \"lads and Jane,\" apologized and agreed to use more inclusive terms. The author seems resistant to changing their language despite Jane's feedback.\n\nSo, the key points are: Jane expressed discomfort with certain terms, the group collectively agreed to adjust their language, but the author is pushing back, claiming it's about \"not giving in to radical feminism.\" The other guy who made the comment apologized and changed, while the author is not. This suggests the author might not be considering Jane's perspective or respecting the group's agreement. Using terms that exclude or make someone feel othered, even if unintended, can be harmful. The author's stance that Jane is being overly sensitive could be dismissive of her valid feelings. Therefore, the author's refusal to adapt despite the team's consensus and Jane's valid input indicates they are in the wrong.\n"
