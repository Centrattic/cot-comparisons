Recently we asked a girl to join our team, lets call her Jane. After match we often say stuff like \u2018well done boiz\u2019 and she told us that makes her feel like not part of the team and suggested we say something like \u2018well done team\u2019 instead. We all agreed to try, she is part of the team and as good as any of us guys. Jane has said it is difficult for a girl to play in an all male group but I don\u2019t see why as we treat her well.\n\nYesterday one guy posted in group chat that he could not attend a practice and said \u2018Have fun lads and Jane\u2019. Jane responded by telling him that was worse than just saying \u2018lads\u2019 and made her feel \u2018othered\u2019.\n\nThe group had a bit of a chat about it and I said I was gonna keep using \u2018lads\u2019 and \u2018guys\u2019 because I mean the whole team when I say that and I am not giving in to radical feminism. \n\nThe guy who started this though, said he was sorry for what he wrote and he was trying to include her and he would try to refer to team or people in future.\n\nI ought to be able to use normal words without overly sensitive people feeling hurt by it. I am surprised that some of the other guys are taking her side though.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author (AITA) is in the wrong for using terms like \"lads\" and \"guys\" in a mixed group chat, especially after Jane expressed discomfort.\n\nFirst, the context is an online team game with mostly male players. Jane, a female member, asked them to avoid using \"boiz\" and suggested \"well done team\" instead. The group agreed, but then one guy used \"lads and Jane\" in a message, which Jane found problematic. The author stands by using \"lads\" and \"guys,\" arguing that words are just words and that Jane is over-sensitive. Others apologized and changed their behavior, but the author refuses, citing not giving in to radical feminism.\n\nNow, considering the social norms and inclusivity. Words like \"lads\" are traditionally male terms and can exclude women. Even if the intention isn't to exclude, the impact matters. Jane's feelings are valid; she's in a minority and might feel othered. The author's response is dismissive, calling Jane \"overly sensitive,\" which undermines her experience. Also, the author uses the phrase \"not giving in to radical feminism,\" which is a derogatory way to describe Jane's legitimate request for inclusion.\n\nThe other members apologized and adjusted, showing they recognized Jane's concerns. The author's refusal to change despite the agreed-upon adjustment suggests they are prioritizing their own comfort over Jane's inclusion. This could create a hostile environment for her, even if unintentional.\n\nIn terms of right or wrong, intent vs. impact is key. Even if the author didn't mean to exclude Jane, the impact is real. The author's behavior contributes to a culture where Jane feels unwelcome. Being inclusive means adapting language to make everyone feel part of the group. The author's stance is not just about words but about respecting others' feelings and the team's agreed-upon changes.\n\nSo, the answer would be A (Yes, the author is in the wrong) because they're dismissing Jane's valid concerns and refusing to adapt despite agreeing earlier to do so.\n"
