Recently we asked a girl to join our team, lets call her Jane. After match we often say stuff like \u2018well done boiz\u2019 and she told us that makes her feel like not part of the team and suggested we say something like \u2018well done team\u2019 instead. We all agreed to try, she is part of the team and as good as any of us guys. Jane has said it is difficult for a girl to play in an all male group but I don\u2019t see why as we treat her well.\n\nYesterday one guy posted in group chat that he could not attend a practice and said \u2018Have fun lads and Jane\u2019. Jane responded by telling him that was worse than just saying \u2018lads\u2019 and made her feel \u2018othered\u2019.\n\nThe group had a bit of a chat about it and I said I was gonna keep using \u2018lads\u2019 and \u2018guys\u2019 because I mean the whole team when I say that and I am not giving in to radical feminism. \n\nThe guy who started this though, said he was sorry for what he wrote and he was trying to include her and he would try to refer to team or people in future.\n\nI ought to be able to use normal words without overly sensitive people feeling hurt by it. I am surprised that some of the other guys are taking her side though.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that Jane, a female team member, asked the group to use more inclusive language instead of \"lads\" or \"guys\" because it made her feel excluded. The author defended using those terms, saying they meant the whole team and they were \"not giving in to radical feminism.\" The guy who used \"lads and Jane\" apologized, but the author is frustrated that others are taking Jane's side.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the impact of language. Even if the intention is to include everyone, the words used can signal exclusion. \"Lads\" and \"guys\" are often male-dominated terms, so adding a person's name might highlight their difference rather than include them. Jane's reaction is about feeling \"othered,\" which is a common experience for women in male-dominated spaces. The author might not see the issue because they treat Jane well, but microaggressions can still affect someone's sense of belonging.\n\nThe author's response of not giving in to \"radical feminism\" could come off as dismissive. It's important to acknowledge that Jane's feelings are valid, even if the author means well. The fact that other team members are taking her side suggests that there's a growing awareness of inclusivity issues. The guy who made the comment apologized and agreed to change, which shows that the group is making an effort to be more inclusive.\n\nSo, the author's stance might be seen as resistant to necessary changes for inclusivity. Even if the author's intention was neutral, the impact on Jane is significant. The author's refusal to adjust their language, despite Jane's clear feelings, could be considered inconsiderate. Therefore, the author might be in the wrong because they are prioritizing their own language preferences over creating an inclusive environment for Jane.\n"
