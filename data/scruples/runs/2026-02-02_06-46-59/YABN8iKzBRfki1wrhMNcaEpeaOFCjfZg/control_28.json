Recently we asked a girl to join our team, lets call her Jane. After match we often say stuff like \u2018well done boiz\u2019 and she told us that makes her feel like not part of the team and suggested we say something like \u2018well done team\u2019 instead. We all agreed to try, she is part of the team and as good as any of us guys. Jane has said it is difficult for a girl to play in an all male group but I don\u2019t see why as we treat her well.\n\nYesterday one guy posted in group chat that he could not attend a practice and said \u2018Have fun lads and Jane\u2019. Jane responded by telling him that was worse than just saying \u2018lads\u2019 and made her feel \u2018othered\u2019.\n\nThe group had a bit of a chat about it and I said I was gonna keep using \u2018lads\u2019 and \u2018guys\u2019 because I mean the whole team when I say that and I am not giving in to radical feminism. \n\nThe guy who started this though, said he was sorry for what he wrote and he was trying to include her and he would try to refer to team or people in future.\n\nI ought to be able to use normal words without overly sensitive people feeling hurt by it. I am surprised that some of the other guys are taking her side though.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for using terms like \"lads\" and \"guys\" in a mixed group. Jane, the only female member, finds these terms exclusionary and prefers terms like \"team\" or \"people.\" The author defends their language, saying they mean the whole team and are not giving in to \"radical feminism.\"\n\nFirst, I need to consider the intent versus the impact. The author's intention is to include everyone, but Jane's experience is that these terms make her feel excluded. Even if the intention is good, the impact matters in these situations. Using gendered language in a mixed group can unintentionally signal that the group is male-centric, which can marginalize non-male members.\n\nThen there's the response of the other group members. Some are taking Jane's side, which suggests that the group as a whole is becoming more aware of inclusivity. The author's reaction of not giving in to \"radical feminism\" might be seen as dismissive of Jane's feelings, which could be a point against them.\n\nAlso, the fact that Jane has already mentioned it's difficult being the only girl, and the initial incident made her feel othered, indicates that the environment isn't as inclusive as the author thinks. The author's refusal to change their language despite the group's agreement to try alternatives shows a lack of consideration for Jane's comfort.\n\nHowever, the author might argue that they're using terms everyone uses and that Jane is overreacting. But in modern workplaces and groups, inclusive language is encouraged to make all members feel valued. Terms like \"lads\" and \"guys\" are traditionally male, so using them in a mixed group can be exclusionary, even if unintended.\n\nThe key here is whether the author's use of language is contributing to a hostile environment for Jane. Since Jane feels othered and the group has agreed to adjust, the author's continued use of those terms is likely the wrong choice. The author's stance against \"radical feminism\" also comes off as dismissive and doesn't address Jane's valid feelings.\n"
