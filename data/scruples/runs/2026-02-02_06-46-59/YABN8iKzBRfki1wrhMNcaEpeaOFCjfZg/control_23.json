Recently we asked a girl to join our team, lets call her Jane. After match we often say stuff like \u2018well done boiz\u2019 and she told us that makes her feel like not part of the team and suggested we say something like \u2018well done team\u2019 instead. We all agreed to try, she is part of the team and as good as any of us guys. Jane has said it is difficult for a girl to play in an all male group but I don\u2019t see why as we treat her well.\n\nYesterday one guy posted in group chat that he could not attend a practice and said \u2018Have fun lads and Jane\u2019. Jane responded by telling him that was worse than just saying \u2018lads\u2019 and made her feel \u2018othered\u2019.\n\nThe group had a bit of a chat about it and I said I was gonna keep using \u2018lads\u2019 and \u2018guys\u2019 because I mean the whole team when I say that and I am not giving in to radical feminism. \n\nThe guy who started this though, said he was sorry for what he wrote and he was trying to include her and he would try to refer to team or people in future.\n\nI ought to be able to use normal words without overly sensitive people feeling hurt by it. I am surprised that some of the other guys are taking her side though.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the author (AITA) is in the wrong for using terms like 'lads' and 'guys' in a mixed group, specifically when Jane, the female teammate, has expressed feeling excluded by such terms.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The team is mostly male, and Jane is the only girl. The team initially used 'boiz' and that made her feel excluded, so they agreed to switch to more inclusive terms. Then another member used 'lads and Jane', which she found worse. The author defends using 'lads' and 'guys', saying they mean the whole team and aren't giving in to 'radical feminism'.\n\nHmm, the key points here are about inclusivity and communication. Jane has already mentioned that these terms make her feel like an outsider. Even if the author and others don't see the issue, the fact that Jane is experiencing discomfort is significant. The author's stance is that it's just normal words and shouldn't be a problem. But from Jane's perspective, it's about feeling respected and included. \n\nThe author might be unintentionally causing harm by not recognizing Jane's feelings. The term 'lads' is a male-specific term, so when used in a mixed group, it naturally excludes the non-male members. The fact that the other guy apologized and agreed to use 'team' shows that he recognized the issue, but the author is resisting, which could be seen as not valuing Jane's perspective. \n\nAlso, the author's comment about not giving in to 'radical feminism' might come off as dismissive of Jane's valid concerns. This approach can create a hostile environment where Jane feels her feelings are not taken seriously. Even if the intent is inclusive, the impact matters. \n\nIn collaborative environments, fostering a sense of belonging is crucial. The author's continued use of these terms despite Jane's feedback could undermine team cohesion and Jane's confidence. So, the author is probably in the wrong here because they're not considering Jane's experience and are prioritizing their own comfort with language over her inclusion.\n"
