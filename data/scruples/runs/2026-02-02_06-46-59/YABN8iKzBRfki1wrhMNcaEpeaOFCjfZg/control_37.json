Recently we asked a girl to join our team, lets call her Jane. After match we often say stuff like \u2018well done boiz\u2019 and she told us that makes her feel like not part of the team and suggested we say something like \u2018well done team\u2019 instead. We all agreed to try, she is part of the team and as good as any of us guys. Jane has said it is difficult for a girl to play in an all male group but I don\u2019t see why as we treat her well.\n\nYesterday one guy posted in group chat that he could not attend a practice and said \u2018Have fun lads and Jane\u2019. Jane responded by telling him that was worse than just saying \u2018lads\u2019 and made her feel \u2018othered\u2019.\n\nThe group had a bit of a chat about it and I said I was gonna keep using \u2018lads\u2019 and \u2018guys\u2019 because I mean the whole team when I say that and I am not giving in to radical feminism. \n\nThe guy who started this though, said he was sorry for what he wrote and he was trying to include her and he would try to refer to team or people in future.\n\nI ought to be able to use normal words without overly sensitive people feeling hurt by it. I am surprised that some of the other guys are taking her side though.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of this AITA post is in the wrong. The situation involves a mixed-gender team in an online game where the majority are male. A girl, Jane, joined, and she felt excluded when they used terms like \"lads\" and \"guys.\" The author defended using these terms, saying they meant the whole team and didn't want to give in to radical feminism. Another guy apologized after using \"lads and Jane\" and agreed to change, but the author is upset that others are taking Jane's side.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the cultural context. Terms like \"lads\" and \"guys\" are often male-centric and can exclude women, even if unintentionally. Jane pointed out that it made her feel othered, which is a valid feeling. The author might not see the issue because they consider themselves inclusive, but the problem is about how the terms are perceived by others. \n\nThe key points here are intent vs. impact. The author's intent was to refer to the entire team, but the impact on Jane was negative. In inclusive communication, it's important to recognize that language can affect others even if the intent is neutral. The fact that Jane is part of the team and the group agreed to try using more inclusive terms shows that they are aware of the issue. The author's reaction of not wanting to \"give in to radical feminism\" might come off as dismissive of Jane's feelings, which could be seen as part of the problem.\n\nAlso, the other guy who apologized and changed his language is taking responsibility, while the author is doubling down. The author's frustration that others are taking Jane's side might indicate a lack of understanding about why the language matters. In such situations, adapting language to be more inclusive is often recommended to ensure all group members feel valued. \n\nSo, putting this together, the author is likely in the wrong because their language, though possibly well-intentioned, is excluding a team member. The response to Jane's feedback was dismissive, and the insistence on using non-inclusive terms despite agreement to change shows a lack of consideration for her feelings. Therefore, the answer should be A (Yes, the author is in the wrong).\n"
