Recently we asked a girl to join our team, lets call her Jane. After match we often say stuff like \u2018well done boiz\u2019 and she told us that makes her feel like not part of the team and suggested we say something like \u2018well done team\u2019 instead. We all agreed to try, she is part of the team and as good as any of us guys. Jane has said it is difficult for a girl to play in an all male group but I don\u2019t see why as we treat her well.\n\nYesterday one guy posted in group chat that he could not attend a practice and said \u2018Have fun lads and Jane\u2019. Jane responded by telling him that was worse than just saying \u2018lads\u2019 and made her feel \u2018othered\u2019.\n\nThe group had a bit of a chat about it and I said I was gonna keep using \u2018lads\u2019 and \u2018guys\u2019 because I mean the whole team when I say that and I am not giving in to radical feminism. \n\nThe guy who started this though, said he was sorry for what he wrote and he was trying to include her and he would try to refer to team or people in future.\n\nI ought to be able to use normal words without overly sensitive people feeling hurt by it. I am surprised that some of the other guys are taking her side though.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for using terms like \"lads\" and \"guys\" in a mixed group, especially after Jane expressed discomfort.\n\nFirst, the context: the team is mostly male, and Jane is the only girl. The group uses terms that exclude her, and she's asked them to use inclusive language like \"team\". The author defends using \"lads\" because they mean the whole team and don't want to give in to \"radical feminism\". Another member apologized for using \"lads and Jane\" and agreed to use \"team\" instead.\n\nNow, the key points here. The author is using language that Jane finds exclusionary. Even if the author's intention is to include everyone, the impact matters. Jane is feeling othered, which is a valid concern. The fact that other members are taking her side suggests that there's a broader awareness of inclusivity. The author's dismissal of Jane's feelings as being \"overly sensitive\" is problematic because it invalidates her experience. Inclusive language is about respecting others' feelings and creating a welcoming environment, even if the speaker doesn't see an issue. The author's stance of not changing their language despite Jane's feedback could be seen as not being considerate, hence in the wrong. So the answer is likely A.\n"
