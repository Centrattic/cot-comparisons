Recently we asked a girl to join our team, lets call her Jane. After match we often say stuff like \u2018well done boiz\u2019 and she told us that makes her feel like not part of the team and suggested we say something like \u2018well done team\u2019 instead. We all agreed to try, she is part of the team and as good as any of us guys. Jane has said it is difficult for a girl to play in an all male group but I don\u2019t see why as we treat her well.\n\nYesterday one guy posted in group chat that he could not attend a practice and said \u2018Have fun lads and Jane\u2019. Jane responded by telling him that was worse than just saying \u2018lads\u2019 and made her feel \u2018othered\u2019.\n\nThe group had a bit of a chat about it and I said I was gonna keep using \u2018lads\u2019 and \u2018guys\u2019 because I mean the whole team when I say that and I am not giving in to radical feminism. \n\nThe guy who started this though, said he was sorry for what he wrote and he was trying to include her and he would try to refer to team or people in future.\n\nI ought to be able to use normal words without overly sensitive people feeling hurt by it. I am surprised that some of the other guys are taking her side though.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is about using terms like 'lads' and 'guys' in a mixed group, which a female team member, Jane, finds exclusionary. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the context. The team is mostly male, and they added Jane. She asked them to use more inclusive terms like 'team' instead of 'lads' or 'guys'. The author, however, feels that Jane is being overly sensitive and that they're just using normal words. They even mention not giving in to radical feminism.\n\nSo, the key points here are about inclusivity and communication. When a group is predominantly male, using terms like 'guys' can sometimes exclude women, even if that's not the intent. Jane's feedback is that these terms make her feel othered. The author is resisting this change, thinking it's unnecessary.\n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong. From a communication and inclusivity perspective, respecting someone's feelings about language use is important. Even if the intention isn't to exclude, the impact matters. The author is dismissing Jane's feelings as being too sensitive, which can be seen as invalidating her experience. By not adapting the language as agreed, the author is not respecting Jane's boundaries and the team's earlier agreement to try using more inclusive terms. \n\nAlso, the other team member who initially used 'lads and Jane' apologized and committed to using 'team' in the future. The author, however, is doubling down, which might be perceived as being inconsiderate. The fact that other guys are taking Jane's side suggests that maybe the author isn't considering the broader perspective here.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the author is not in the wrong? Or are they? Wait, the user said they think the author is in the wrong. Let me check again. If the author is refusing to change the language despite Jane's valid feedback, then they are not respecting her wishes. Even if the intention is inclusive, the words used have a negative effect. The author's stance that they shouldn't have to change because it's a 'normal word' ignores Jane's experience. So in that case, the author is in the wrong. So answer A.\n"
