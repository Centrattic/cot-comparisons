Recently we asked a girl to join our team, lets call her Jane. After match we often say stuff like \u2018well done boiz\u2019 and she told us that makes her feel like not part of the team and suggested we say something like \u2018well done team\u2019 instead. We all agreed to try, she is part of the team and as good as any of us guys. Jane has said it is difficult for a girl to play in an all male group but I don\u2019t see why as we treat her well.\n\nYesterday one guy posted in group chat that he could not attend a practice and said \u2018Have fun lads and Jane\u2019. Jane responded by telling him that was worse than just saying \u2018lads\u2019 and made her feel \u2018othered\u2019.\n\nThe group had a bit of a chat about it and I said I was gonna keep using \u2018lads\u2019 and \u2018guys\u2019 because I mean the whole team when I say that and I am not giving in to radical feminism. \n\nThe guy who started this though, said he was sorry for what he wrote and he was trying to include her and he would try to refer to team or people in future.\n\nI ought to be able to use normal words without overly sensitive people feeling hurt by it. I am surprised that some of the other guys are taking her side though.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is about using terms like \"lads\" and \"guys\" in a mixed group where a female teammate, Jane, feels excluded. The author defends their use of these terms, saying they mean the whole team and not giving in to radical feminism. Others have apologized and changed their language, but the author still stands by their choice.\n\nFirst, I need to consider Jane's perspective. She's the only girl in a team that's 99% male. Even if the team treats her well, using male-centric terms might make her feel like she doesn't belong. When the other guy used \"lads and Jane,\" she found that even more exclusionary. The author argues that these words are just normal and that Jane is being overly sensitive.\n\nBut from Jane's point of view, if the team is predominantly male and uses language that's traditionally male, she might feel singled out or not part of the group, even if the intention isn't to exclude. The key here is about inclusive language. Terms like \"lads\" and \"guys\" are often used as generic male terms, but in mixed groups, they can be alienating. The team initially agreed to use \"team\" instead, so the author is going against a previous consensus.\n\nThe author's response that they're not giving in to radical feminism might be dismissive of Jane's valid feelings. It's possible that the author underestimates the impact of language on inclusivity. Even if the author's intention is to include the whole team, the effect on Jane is negative. The fact that others have apologized and changed their behavior suggests that the team is trying to be inclusive, but the author's stance is resistant to that effort.\n\nSo, even if using \"lads\" isn't inherently offensive, in this context, it's causing harm. The author's refusal to adjust their language despite Jane's feedback could be seen as inconsiderate. The right to use \"normal words\" might not override someone else's right to feel included. Therefore, the author is in the wrong because their language choice is excluding Jane, and they're dismissing her feelings as overly sensitive instead of addressing the issue.\n"
