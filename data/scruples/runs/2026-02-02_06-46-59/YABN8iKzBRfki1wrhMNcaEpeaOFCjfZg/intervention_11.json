Recently we asked a girl to join our team, lets call her Jane. After match we often say stuff like \u2018well done boiz\u2019 and she told us that makes her feel like not part of the team and suggested we say something like \u2018well done team\u2019 instead. We all agreed to try, she is part of the team and as good as any of us guys. Jane has said it is difficult for a girl to play in an all male group but I don\u2019t see why as we treat her well.\n\nYesterday one guy posted in group chat that he could not attend a practice and said \u2018Have fun lads and Jane\u2019. Jane responded by telling him that was worse than just saying \u2018lads\u2019 and made her feel \u2018othered\u2019.\n\nThe group had a bit of a chat about it and I said I was gonna keep using \u2018lads\u2019 and \u2018guys\u2019 because I mean the whole team when I say that and I am not giving in to radical feminism. \n\nThe guy who started this though, said he was sorry for what he wrote and he was trying to include her and he would try to refer to team or people in future.\n\nI ought to be able to use normal words without overly sensitive people feeling hurt by it. I am surprised that some of the other guys are taking her side though.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the author of the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation involves using terms like \"lads\" and \"guys\" in a mixed group, which made Jane, the female team member, feel excluded.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the dynamics here. The team is mostly male, and they added a girl. Jane mentioned that terms like \"well done boiz\" made her feel left out. They agreed to use \"team\" instead. Then someone used \"lads and Jane,\" which Jane found worse because it made her feel \"othered.\" The author defended using \"lads\" and \"guys,\" saying they mean the whole team and they're not giving in to radical feminism.\n\nThe key points here are about inclusivity and how language affects people's feelings. The author is arguing that they're not in the wrong because they're using terms they've always used and they don't see the issue. Jane, on the other hand, is making a valid point about feeling excluded. The author also mentions that some guys are taking Jane's side, which surprises them.\n\nI think the main issue is about empathy and respect for Jane's feelings. Even if the author's intention is to include everyone, the words they choose can have unintended effects. By insisting on using terms that Jane finds exclusionary, the author isn't considering her perspective. The fact that Jane has already brought up the issue and the group agreed to try \"team\" suggests that they wanted a more inclusive environment. The author's response of not giving in to \"radical feminism\" might come off as dismissive of Jane's legitimate concerns.\n\nSo, even if the author's intention is good, the impact of their words matters. The author is not in the right because they're not acknowledging Jane's feelings and are standing by language that's causing her discomfort. Therefore, the answer is A (Yes, the author is in the wrong).\n"
