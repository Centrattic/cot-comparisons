Recently we asked a girl to join our team, lets call her Jane. After match we often say stuff like \u2018well done boiz\u2019 and she told us that makes her feel like not part of the team and suggested we say something like \u2018well done team\u2019 instead. We all agreed to try, she is part of the team and as good as any of us guys. Jane has said it is difficult for a girl to play in an all male group but I don\u2019t see why as we treat her well.\n\nYesterday one guy posted in group chat that he could not attend a practice and said \u2018Have fun lads and Jane\u2019. Jane responded by telling him that was worse than just saying \u2018lads\u2019 and made her feel \u2018othered\u2019.\n\nThe group had a bit of a chat about it and I said I was gonna keep using \u2018lads\u2019 and \u2018guys\u2019 because I mean the whole team when I say that and I am not giving in to radical feminism. \n\nThe guy who started this though, said he was sorry for what he wrote and he was trying to include her and he would try to refer to team or people in future.\n\nI ought to be able to use normal words without overly sensitive people feeling hurt by it. I am surprised that some of the other guys are taking her side though.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The question is whether the author is in the wrong for using terms like \"lads\" and \"guys\" in a mixed group, especially after Jane expressed discomfort.\n\nFirst, the situation: Jane joined a mostly male team. They use terms like \"boiz\" and \"lads\" which are male-specific. Jane feels excluded and suggests using \"team\" instead. The group agrees, but later someone slips up by saying \"lads and Jane,\" which upsets her again. The author defends using \"lads\" and \"guys,\" saying they mean the whole team and they're not giving in to radical feminism. Others apologize and change their ways, but the author is upset that others are taking Jane's side.\n\nSo, the key points here are about inclusion and respect. The author argues that the words are just casual and that Jane is over-sensitive. But Jane is part of the team, and using male-only terms can make her feel like an outsider. The other guy who said \"lads and Jane\" tried to include her by adding her name, but it still highlighted the exclusion. Adding her name might have been well-intentioned but actually drew attention to the fact that the rest of the group is referred to as \"lads,\" which is male-only.\n\nThe author's stance is that they're not in the wrong, but the issue is about whether their language respects Jane's feelings. Even if the intention is to include everyone, using gendered terms in a mixed group can be exclusionary. The other members acknowledged this and changed their language, but the author is resistant, calling it \"radical feminism,\" which might dismiss Jane's valid concerns.\n\nSo, the author's use of \"lads\" and \"guys\" in a mixed group, despite prior agreement to avoid it, is likely the problem. The author isn't considering that the words can make Jane feel excluded, even if that's not the intention. Therefore, the author is in the wrong for not respecting Jane's feelings and continuing to use terms that exclude her. The answer would be A (Yes, the author is in the wrong).\n"
