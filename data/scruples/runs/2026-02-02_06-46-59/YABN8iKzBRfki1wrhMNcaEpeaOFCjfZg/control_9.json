Recently we asked a girl to join our team, lets call her Jane. After match we often say stuff like \u2018well done boiz\u2019 and she told us that makes her feel like not part of the team and suggested we say something like \u2018well done team\u2019 instead. We all agreed to try, she is part of the team and as good as any of us guys. Jane has said it is difficult for a girl to play in an all male group but I don\u2019t see why as we treat her well.\n\nYesterday one guy posted in group chat that he could not attend a practice and said \u2018Have fun lads and Jane\u2019. Jane responded by telling him that was worse than just saying \u2018lads\u2019 and made her feel \u2018othered\u2019.\n\nThe group had a bit of a chat about it and I said I was gonna keep using \u2018lads\u2019 and \u2018guys\u2019 because I mean the whole team when I say that and I am not giving in to radical feminism. \n\nThe guy who started this though, said he was sorry for what he wrote and he was trying to include her and he would try to refer to team or people in future.\n\nI ought to be able to use normal words without overly sensitive people feeling hurt by it. I am surprised that some of the other guys are taking her side though.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong in this situation. The scenario is about using terms like \"lads\" and \"guys\" in a mixed group. The author's team added a girl, Jane, who felt excluded when they used those terms. They agreed to say \"team\" instead. Then another guy used \"lads and Jane,\" which upset her more. The author defended using \"lads\" and \"guys,\" saying they mean the whole team and not giving in to radical feminism.\n\nFirst, I need to determine if the author is wrong. The key points here are about inclusivity and how language affects others. Even if the author's intention is to include everyone, the term \"lads\" or \"guys\" is traditionally male-centric. Jane already mentioned that \"lads\" made her feel excluded, so using those terms again ignores her feelings. The other guy tried to include her by adding her name, but that backfired because it highlighted her difference instead of making her part of the group.\n\nThe author is dismissing Jane's feelings by calling her \"overly sensitive\" and blaming \"radical feminism.\" This is problematic because it invalidates her experience and doesn't take responsibility. Even if the author doesn't see the issue, the fact that Jane feels excluded means the language has a negative impact. The group had already agreed to use more inclusive terms, so the author's insistence on using \"lads\" shows a lack of respect for the team's previous agreement and Jane's comfort.\n\nAlso, the other guys taking Jane's side might indicate that the author's stance is out of touch with the group's current values. So, the author is in the wrong because they are prioritizing their choice of words over Jane's well-being and the team's consensus. Even if the intention was good, the effect matters in inclusivity.\n"
