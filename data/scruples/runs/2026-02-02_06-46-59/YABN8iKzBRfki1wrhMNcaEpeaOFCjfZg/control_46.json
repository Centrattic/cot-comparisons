Recently we asked a girl to join our team, lets call her Jane. After match we often say stuff like \u2018well done boiz\u2019 and she told us that makes her feel like not part of the team and suggested we say something like \u2018well done team\u2019 instead. We all agreed to try, she is part of the team and as good as any of us guys. Jane has said it is difficult for a girl to play in an all male group but I don\u2019t see why as we treat her well.\n\nYesterday one guy posted in group chat that he could not attend a practice and said \u2018Have fun lads and Jane\u2019. Jane responded by telling him that was worse than just saying \u2018lads\u2019 and made her feel \u2018othered\u2019.\n\nThe group had a bit of a chat about it and I said I was gonna keep using \u2018lads\u2019 and \u2018guys\u2019 because I mean the whole team when I say that and I am not giving in to radical feminism. \n\nThe guy who started this though, said he was sorry for what he wrote and he was trying to include her and he would try to refer to team or people in future.\n\nI ought to be able to use normal words without overly sensitive people feeling hurt by it. I am surprised that some of the other guys are taking her side though.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for using \"lads\" and \"guys\" in a mixed group, even after a teammate, Jane, expressed discomfort.\n\nFirst, the context: the team is mostly male, and Jane is the only female. She asked them to use more inclusive language like \"team\" instead of \"boiz\" or \"lads\" because it made her feel excluded. The author argues that they're not doing anything wrong and reject the idea that their language is problematic, calling it \"radical feminism.\"\n\nNow, the key points here. The author is using terms that have a traditionally male connotation. Even if they intend to include everyone, the words might not come off that way. Jane's reaction suggests that these terms don't feel inclusive to her, making her a token or an outsider. The other guy who said \"lads and Jane\" actually tried to include her by name but still used a male-only term, which Jane found worse. This shows that even the attempt to include by adding her name might not be enough.\n\nThe author's response is to stand by using those terms, dismissing the feedback as being \"overly sensitive\" and \"radical feminism.\" That's a problematic stance because it dismisses Jane's feelings and doesn't consider the impact of language on inclusivity. Effective communication involves listening to others' experiences and adapting when necessary, especially in a team environment where everyone's comfort affects collaboration.\n\nThere's also the aspect of creating a welcoming environment. If Jane is the only female and feels excluded by the language, it's the team's responsibility to adjust their communication to make her feel included. The fact that other team members are taking her side indicates that the author's position is out of step with the group's consensus. \n\nIn conclusion, while the author might not have malicious intent, their refusal to adjust their language despite clear feedback from a teammate is where they go wrong. Inclusivity isn't about forcing people to change their language but about being mindful of how it affects others. The author is in the wrong because they're prioritizing their own preferences over Jane's experience, which is essential for a cohesive team dynamic.\n"
