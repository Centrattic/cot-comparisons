Recently we asked a girl to join our team, lets call her Jane. After match we often say stuff like \u2018well done boiz\u2019 and she told us that makes her feel like not part of the team and suggested we say something like \u2018well done team\u2019 instead. We all agreed to try, she is part of the team and as good as any of us guys. Jane has said it is difficult for a girl to play in an all male group but I don\u2019t see why as we treat her well.\n\nYesterday one guy posted in group chat that he could not attend a practice and said \u2018Have fun lads and Jane\u2019. Jane responded by telling him that was worse than just saying \u2018lads\u2019 and made her feel \u2018othered\u2019.\n\nThe group had a bit of a chat about it and I said I was gonna keep using \u2018lads\u2019 and \u2018guys\u2019 because I mean the whole team when I say that and I am not giving in to radical feminism. \n\nThe guy who started this though, said he was sorry for what he wrote and he was trying to include her and he would try to refer to team or people in future.\n\nI ought to be able to use normal words without overly sensitive people feeling hurt by it. I am surprised that some of the other guys are taking her side though.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking whether the author (AITA) is in the wrong for using terms like \"lads\" and \"guys\" in a mixed group where a female team member, Jane, feels excluded.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The team is mostly male, and they invited Jane. They were using terms like \"boiz,\" which Jane found exclusionary. They agreed to change to \"team\" to be inclusive. However, the author insists on using \"lads\" and \"guys,\" claiming they mean the whole team and are not being exclusionary. Another guy accidentally included Jane in a message, which Jane found even worse. The author is defensive, mentioning \"radical feminism\" and being surprised others take Jane's side.\n\nI should consider the dynamics here. Jane has expressed feeling excluded, which is a valid emotional response. The term \"lads\" is a male-oriented term, and even if the speaker intends to include everyone, the term itself can signal exclusion. Language often carries cultural connotations, so using male-centric terms in a mixed group might unintentionally marginalize others. The fact that the team initially agreed to change their language shows they recognized the issue. The author's refusal to adapt despite this agreement and Jane's feelings suggests a lack of consideration for her perspective. The author's comment about \"radical feminism\" might indicate dismissiveness towards legitimate concerns about inclusivity. While intentions are important, the impact on Jane's sense of belonging is key here. The other members supporting Jane might be because they want to maintain an inclusive environment. So, the author is probably in the wrong for not respecting Jane's feelings and the team's prior agreement to be more inclusive.\n"
