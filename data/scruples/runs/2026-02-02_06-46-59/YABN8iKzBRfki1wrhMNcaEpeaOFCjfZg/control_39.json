Recently we asked a girl to join our team, lets call her Jane. After match we often say stuff like \u2018well done boiz\u2019 and she told us that makes her feel like not part of the team and suggested we say something like \u2018well done team\u2019 instead. We all agreed to try, she is part of the team and as good as any of us guys. Jane has said it is difficult for a girl to play in an all male group but I don\u2019t see why as we treat her well.\n\nYesterday one guy posted in group chat that he could not attend a practice and said \u2018Have fun lads and Jane\u2019. Jane responded by telling him that was worse than just saying \u2018lads\u2019 and made her feel \u2018othered\u2019.\n\nThe group had a bit of a chat about it and I said I was gonna keep using \u2018lads\u2019 and \u2018guys\u2019 because I mean the whole team when I say that and I am not giving in to radical feminism. \n\nThe guy who started this though, said he was sorry for what he wrote and he was trying to include her and he would try to refer to team or people in future.\n\nI ought to be able to use normal words without overly sensitive people feeling hurt by it. I am surprised that some of the other guys are taking her side though.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is about using terms like \"lads\" and \"guys\" in a mixed group. The team is mostly male, but they added a girl named Jane. Jane felt excluded when they used \"boiz\" and suggested \"well done team\" instead. The group agreed, but the author still wants to use \"lads\" and \"guys,\" saying they mean the whole team and they shouldn't have to cater to \"overly sensitive\" people.\n\nFirst, I need to consider if the author's choice of words is appropriate. The term \"lads\" and \"guys\" are often seen as male-centric. Even though the author intends to include the whole team, the fact is that Jane is being singled out as not part of the \"lads\" group. The term \"lads\" is inherently gendered, so using it in a mixed group can make non-male members feel excluded, even if that's not the intention. \n\nJane had already expressed discomfort with \"boiz,\" and the group agreed to use alternative terms. The author's stance is that they're not giving in to \"radical feminism,\" which might indicate a misunderstanding of the issue. The problem here isn't about being overly sensitive, but about using language that reinforces gender divisions. The other guy, who initially used \"lads and Jane,\" also apologized and tried to adjust. The author's refusal to change could be seen as dismissive of Jane's feelings and the group's agreement to be more inclusive.\n\nAlso, the author is surprised that others are taking Jane's side. This suggests a lack of awareness or empathy for Jane's perspective. Just because the author doesn't see the issue doesn't mean there isn't one. Inclusive language is about creating a welcoming environment for everyone, even if the majority is male. The author's insistence on using terms that exclude a team member could be considered inconsiderate, even if unintentional.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the author might be in the wrong because their choice of words, despite their intent, perpetuates exclusion. The fact that Jane and others are affected by it, and the group had already agreed to change, means the author isn't respecting that agreement and the feelings of their teammate. It's about being considerate and adapting language to be inclusive, even if it means changing long-standing habits.\n"
