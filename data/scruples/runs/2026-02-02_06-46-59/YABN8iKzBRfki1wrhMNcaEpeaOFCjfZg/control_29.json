Recently we asked a girl to join our team, lets call her Jane. After match we often say stuff like \u2018well done boiz\u2019 and she told us that makes her feel like not part of the team and suggested we say something like \u2018well done team\u2019 instead. We all agreed to try, she is part of the team and as good as any of us guys. Jane has said it is difficult for a girl to play in an all male group but I don\u2019t see why as we treat her well.\n\nYesterday one guy posted in group chat that he could not attend a practice and said \u2018Have fun lads and Jane\u2019. Jane responded by telling him that was worse than just saying \u2018lads\u2019 and made her feel \u2018othered\u2019.\n\nThe group had a bit of a chat about it and I said I was gonna keep using \u2018lads\u2019 and \u2018guys\u2019 because I mean the whole team when I say that and I am not giving in to radical feminism. \n\nThe guy who started this though, said he was sorry for what he wrote and he was trying to include her and he would try to refer to team or people in future.\n\nI ought to be able to use normal words without overly sensitive people feeling hurt by it. I am surprised that some of the other guys are taking her side though.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is about using words like \"lads\" and \"guys\" in a mixed group that recently included a female teammate, Jane. Jane feels that these terms exclude her, and she prefers \"team\" or \"people\" instead.\n\nThe author argues that they mean the whole team when they use \"lads\" or \"guys\" and that they aren't giving in to \"radical feminism.\" They also mention that Jane's sensitivity is making it hard for them to use normal words. But Jane and others are taking her side, which the author finds surprising.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the perspective of the author. They see themselves as being inclusive because they're referring to the entire team, even if the words used are traditionally male-centric. However, the problem here is that Jane feels excluded by those terms. Even if the intention is inclusive, the effect on Jane is negative. That's a key point in communication\u2014intent vs. impact.\n\nWords like \"lads\" and \"guys\" are often used as gender-neutral terms colloquially, but they can still carry a male default. In a mixed group, especially when a female member has already pointed out the issue, continuing to use those terms might be seen as dismissive of her feelings. The author's refusal to adjust their language could be perceived as not taking Jane's valid concerns seriously.\n\nAlso, the author mentions that the other guys are taking Jane's side, which might indicate that the group as a whole is moving towards more inclusive language. The author's response about not giving in to \"radical feminism\" might come across as defensive or resistant to change, which could alienate others.\n\nOn the other hand, the author isn't intentionally trying to exclude Jane. They might not see the problem, thinking that the terms are just casual and not meant to exclude. But the key here is that Jane has communicated her discomfort, and the group has agreed to try using more inclusive language. The author's stance here could be seen as undermining the group's agreement and Jane's feelings.\n\nIn terms of social dynamics, when someone points out that a certain word or phrase makes them feel excluded, it's generally considered respectful to adjust the language to be more inclusive. The author's refusal to do so might be seen as prioritizing their own communication style over Jane's comfort and sense of belonging in the team.\n\nSo, putting it all together, even though the author's intention might be inclusive, the impact on Jane is exclusionary. The fact that the group had already agreed to try using \"team\" instead shows a collective effort to be inclusive, and the author's resistance to that could be seen as inconsiderate of Jane's feelings. Therefore, the author might be in the wrong.\n"
