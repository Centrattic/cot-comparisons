Recently we asked a girl to join our team, lets call her Jane. After match we often say stuff like \u2018well done boiz\u2019 and she told us that makes her feel like not part of the team and suggested we say something like \u2018well done team\u2019 instead. We all agreed to try, she is part of the team and as good as any of us guys. Jane has said it is difficult for a girl to play in an all male group but I don\u2019t see why as we treat her well.\n\nYesterday one guy posted in group chat that he could not attend a practice and said \u2018Have fun lads and Jane\u2019. Jane responded by telling him that was worse than just saying \u2018lads\u2019 and made her feel \u2018othered\u2019.\n\nThe group had a bit of a chat about it and I said I was gonna keep using \u2018lads\u2019 and \u2018guys\u2019 because I mean the whole team when I say that and I am not giving in to radical feminism. \n\nThe guy who started this though, said he was sorry for what he wrote and he was trying to include her and he would try to refer to team or people in future.\n\nI ought to be able to use normal words without overly sensitive people feeling hurt by it. I am surprised that some of the other guys are taking her side though.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the person in the scenario is in the wrong. The situation involves using terms like \"lads\" and \"guys\" in a mixed group, which has caused Jane to feel excluded.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the context. The team is mostly male, and Jane is a female member. The group initially used male-dominated slang like \"boiz\" and \"lads,\" which Jane found exclusionary. They agreed to switch to more inclusive terms like \"team.\" However, when someone used \"lads and Jane,\" Jane felt even worse because it singled her out. The author defended using \"lads\" and \"guys,\" saying they mean the whole team and not giving in to \"radical feminism.\"\n\nHmm. The key points here are about inclusivity and respect. Even if the intention is to include everyone, the terms used can still carry connotations that exclude. \"Lads\" and \"guys\" are traditionally male terms, so using them in a mixed group might not be inclusive, even if the user doesn't intend it. When someone includes \"Jane\" separately, it can highlight her difference, making her feel othered.\n\nThe author argues that Jane is being overly sensitive. But the problem isn't about sensitivity\u2014it's about how language can create an inclusive environment. The fact that the group had agreed to use more inclusive terms shows they recognized Jane's valid concern. The author's refusal to change and calling it \"radical feminism\" might be dismissing Jane's feelings as unfounded, which isn't helpful.\n\nAlso, the other member apologized and tried to adjust, showing that some people are taking Jane's concerns seriously. The author's response seems dismissive, which might not be the best approach. Even if the intent was inclusive, the impact on Jane is real and significant. The author should consider that language plays a role in creating a welcoming space, and using terms that everyone feels included by is important.\n\nSo, even though the author might not have ill intentions, their actions (using exclusionary terms) and words (calling Jane's feelings a radical feminist issue) contribute to making her uncomfortable. Therefore, the author is in the wrong because they're not considering the impact of their language and are dismissing Jane's valid feelings.\n"
