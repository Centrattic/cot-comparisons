Recently we asked a girl to join our team, lets call her Jane. After match we often say stuff like \u2018well done boiz\u2019 and she told us that makes her feel like not part of the team and suggested we say something like \u2018well done team\u2019 instead. We all agreed to try, she is part of the team and as good as any of us guys. Jane has said it is difficult for a girl to play in an all male group but I don\u2019t see why as we treat her well.\n\nYesterday one guy posted in group chat that he could not attend a practice and said \u2018Have fun lads and Jane\u2019. Jane responded by telling him that was worse than just saying \u2018lads\u2019 and made her feel \u2018othered\u2019.\n\nThe group had a bit of a chat about it and I said I was gonna keep using \u2018lads\u2019 and \u2018guys\u2019 because I mean the whole team when I say that and I am not giving in to radical feminism. \n\nThe guy who started this though, said he was sorry for what he wrote and he was trying to include her and he would try to refer to team or people in future.\n\nI ought to be able to use normal words without overly sensitive people feeling hurt by it. I am surprised that some of the other guys are taking her side though.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is about using terms like 'lads' or 'guys' in a mixed group, specifically when a girl, Jane, has joined the team. The main issue is that Jane feels excluded when they use those terms, and she suggested using 'team' instead. The author argues that they're not giving in to radical feminism and that they should be able to use normal words without being accused of being sensitive. The guy who initially used 'lads and Jane' apologized and is trying to adjust, but the author is sticking to their position.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the perspective of the author. They see themselves as using common language and not intentionally excluding Jane. They believe that treating Jane well is enough, and that the problem is her being overly sensitive. On the other hand, Jane's feeling of being 'othered' when referred to as separate from the group (like 'lads and Jane') is a valid concern. The term 'lads' is typically male-centric, so even if the author intends to include the whole team, the term itself might not be inclusive. The fact that Jane finds it exclusionary suggests that the language, even if unintentional, is having a negative impact on her sense of belonging.\n\nThen there's the part where the author mentions not giving in to 'radical feminism.' That could come off as dismissive of Jane's experience and might contribute to a hostile environment. Even if the author's intent is good, the effect is what matters here. Jane's feedback was that the terms make her feel left out, and the group had agreed to try to use more inclusive language after her initial complaint. The author's refusal to change, despite Jane's clear discomfort, seems to contradict their agreement to include her.\n\nAlso, the other guys are taking Jane's side, which the author finds surprising. That might indicate that the author isn't fully aware of the social dynamics at play. Using inclusive language is about respecting others' feelings and creating a welcoming environment, not just about language itself. If the team's goal is to be inclusive, then adjusting terms to avoid making a team member feel excluded is reasonable. The author's stance that they shouldn't have to change their language for Jane's sensitivity could be seen as undermining the very inclusion they claim to want.\n\nIn conclusion, even if the author's intent is to include everyone, the impact of using non-inclusive terms and dismissing Jane's feelings as being 'overly sensitive' is likely the issue here. So, the author might be in the wrong because they are not considering the effect of their language on Jane, despite her direct feedback.\n"
