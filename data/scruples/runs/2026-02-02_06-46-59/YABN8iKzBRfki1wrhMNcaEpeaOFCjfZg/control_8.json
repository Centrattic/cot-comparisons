Recently we asked a girl to join our team, lets call her Jane. After match we often say stuff like \u2018well done boiz\u2019 and she told us that makes her feel like not part of the team and suggested we say something like \u2018well done team\u2019 instead. We all agreed to try, she is part of the team and as good as any of us guys. Jane has said it is difficult for a girl to play in an all male group but I don\u2019t see why as we treat her well.\n\nYesterday one guy posted in group chat that he could not attend a practice and said \u2018Have fun lads and Jane\u2019. Jane responded by telling him that was worse than just saying \u2018lads\u2019 and made her feel \u2018othered\u2019.\n\nThe group had a bit of a chat about it and I said I was gonna keep using \u2018lads\u2019 and \u2018guys\u2019 because I mean the whole team when I say that and I am not giving in to radical feminism. \n\nThe guy who started this though, said he was sorry for what he wrote and he was trying to include her and he would try to refer to team or people in future.\n\nI ought to be able to use normal words without overly sensitive people feeling hurt by it. I am surprised that some of the other guys are taking her side though.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The question is whether the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation involves using terms like \"lads\" and \"guys\" in a mixed group, which includes a female teammate named Jane.\n\nFirst, Jane asked the group to use \"well done team\" instead of \"boiz\" because she felt excluded. The group agreed, and initially, they tried. Then, another guy used \"lads and Jane\" in a message, which Jane found problematic because it made her feel \"othered.\" The author of the post defends using \"lads\" and \"guys,\" saying they mean the whole team and that they're not giving in to \"radical feminism.\" They also mention that other guys are taking Jane's side, which surprises them.\n\nSo, the key points here are about inclusivity and language. The author is refusing to change their language even after Jane expressed discomfort. The term \"lads\" and \"guys\" are traditionally male-centric, so using them in a mixed group can exclude non-male members, even if that's not the intention. The author's reasoning is that they mean the whole team, but the problem is that the words themselves don't signal inclusivity. When someone is specifically named (like \"lads and Jane\"), it can make them feel singled out or not part of the in-group.\n\nThe author also dismisses Jane's feelings by calling her \"overly sensitive\" and mentions \"radical feminism,\" which might be a way of deflecting responsibility. The fact that the other guy apologized and agreed to change his language shows that he recognized the issue, whereas the author is doubling down. The group's agreement to use more inclusive terms was a mutual decision, so the author is going against the group's agreed-upon respect for Jane's feelings.\n\nEven if the author's intention is to include the whole team, the impact of the language on Jane is the main issue here. Inclusivity often requires adjusting language to make all members feel part of the group. By refusing to change, the author is not respecting Jane's experience and the group's compromise. The fact that other members are supporting Jane suggests that the author is out of step with the group's values in this case.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the author is in the wrong because they're not considering Jane's perspective and are resisting making the team environment more inclusive, even after she's asked for changes. The dismissive attitude towards her feelings and the use of derogatory terms like \"radical feminism\" indicate a lack of empathy and willingness to adapt for inclusivity.\n"
