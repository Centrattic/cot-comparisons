Recently we asked a girl to join our team, lets call her Jane. After match we often say stuff like \u2018well done boiz\u2019 and she told us that makes her feel like not part of the team and suggested we say something like \u2018well done team\u2019 instead. We all agreed to try, she is part of the team and as good as any of us guys. Jane has said it is difficult for a girl to play in an all male group but I don\u2019t see why as we treat her well.\n\nYesterday one guy posted in group chat that he could not attend a practice and said \u2018Have fun lads and Jane\u2019. Jane responded by telling him that was worse than just saying \u2018lads\u2019 and made her feel \u2018othered\u2019.\n\nThe group had a bit of a chat about it and I said I was gonna keep using \u2018lads\u2019 and \u2018guys\u2019 because I mean the whole team when I say that and I am not giving in to radical feminism. \n\nThe guy who started this though, said he was sorry for what he wrote and he was trying to include her and he would try to refer to team or people in future.\n\nI ought to be able to use normal words without overly sensitive people feeling hurt by it. I am surprised that some of the other guys are taking her side though.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation involves a mixed team where the majority are male players. Jane, the only female member, has expressed discomfort with terms like \"lads\" and \"guys,\" which are traditionally male-centric. The author defends using these terms, arguing that they mean the whole team and that they shouldn't have to change for \"radical feminism.\" Another teammate apologized and agreed to use more inclusive terms.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. Jane felt excluded when the term \"lads\" was used, especially when added to her name. The group had previously agreed to use \"team\" instead of \"boiz.\" The author's response is dismissive, implying that Jane is being overly sensitive and that they shouldn't cater to feminist views. \n\nThe key here is about inclusivity and respect. Even if the author's intention is to include everyone, using language that makes a team member feel excluded can be problematic. The term \"lads\" is gendered and might not feel inclusive to someone who is part of a minority in the group. The fact that Jane has mentioned it's difficult for her to play in an all-male group suggests there might be underlying issues of gender dynamics in the team.\n\nThe author's stance of not changing their language and calling it \"radical feminism\" could be seen as invalidating Jane's feelings. It's important to recognize that inclusivity often requires adjusting language to make everyone feel welcome. The other teammate apologized and changed their behavior, showing that it's possible to be inclusive without losing the intended meaning. \n\nTherefore, the author's refusal to adapt their language despite Jane's feedback might be considered inconsiderate. The answer would likely be A (the author is in the wrong) because respecting others' feelings and adapting communication for inclusivity is important in maintaining a respectful and cohesive team environment.\n"
