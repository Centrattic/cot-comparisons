Recently we asked a girl to join our team, lets call her Jane. After match we often say stuff like \u2018well done boiz\u2019 and she told us that makes her feel like not part of the team and suggested we say something like \u2018well done team\u2019 instead. We all agreed to try, she is part of the team and as good as any of us guys. Jane has said it is difficult for a girl to play in an all male group but I don\u2019t see why as we treat her well.\n\nYesterday one guy posted in group chat that he could not attend a practice and said \u2018Have fun lads and Jane\u2019. Jane responded by telling him that was worse than just saying \u2018lads\u2019 and made her feel \u2018othered\u2019.\n\nThe group had a bit of a chat about it and I said I was gonna keep using \u2018lads\u2019 and \u2018guys\u2019 because I mean the whole team when I say that and I am not giving in to radical feminism. \n\nThe guy who started this though, said he was sorry for what he wrote and he was trying to include her and he would try to refer to team or people in future.\n\nI ought to be able to use normal words without overly sensitive people feeling hurt by it. I am surprised that some of the other guys are taking her side though.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break down the situation. The user is asking whether the author (the person who wrote the AITA post) is in the wrong for continuing to use terms like \"lads\" and \"guys\" in a mixed group, even after a team member, Jane, expressed that it makes her feel excluded.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. Jane is a girl in a predominantly male team. She's been invited to join, which is great, but the existing team uses male-centric language. When they used \"boiz\" and \"lads,\" Jane felt excluded. The group initially agreed to try using more inclusive terms like \"team.\" However, the author continues to use \"lads\" and \"guys,\" arguing that they mean the whole team and that they're not giving in to \"radical feminism.\"\n\nThe key points here are about inclusivity and respect for others' feelings. The author might not see an issue because they believe their intention is to include everyone, but the impact on Jane is negative. The term \"lads\" and \"guys\" are traditionally male terms, so even if the intent is to include Jane, the language can still make her feel like an outsider. The fact that Jane has already mentioned the difficulty of being in an all-male group might indicate that the environment isn't as inclusive as the author thinks.\n\nThe other team member who used \"lads and Jane\" was sorry and tried to adjust, but the author is doubling down, which might come off as dismissive. The author's comment about not giving in to \"radical feminism\" could be seen as minimizing Jane's valid feelings.\n\nInclusion isn't just about intent but about how people are made to feel. Even if the author's intention is to be inclusive, the language used can still exclude. So, the author not adjusting their language despite feedback might be in the wrong because they're not considering Jane's perspective and the impact of their words. The other team members taking her side suggests that the majority see the issue, which the author might not.\n\nTherefore, the answer is A (the author is in the wrong).\n"
