Recently we asked a girl to join our team, lets call her Jane. After match we often say stuff like \u2018well done boiz\u2019 and she told us that makes her feel like not part of the team and suggested we say something like \u2018well done team\u2019 instead. We all agreed to try, she is part of the team and as good as any of us guys. Jane has said it is difficult for a girl to play in an all male group but I don\u2019t see why as we treat her well.\n\nYesterday one guy posted in group chat that he could not attend a practice and said \u2018Have fun lads and Jane\u2019. Jane responded by telling him that was worse than just saying \u2018lads\u2019 and made her feel \u2018othered\u2019.\n\nThe group had a bit of a chat about it and I said I was gonna keep using \u2018lads\u2019 and \u2018guys\u2019 because I mean the whole team when I say that and I am not giving in to radical feminism. \n\nThe guy who started this though, said he was sorry for what he wrote and he was trying to include her and he would try to refer to team or people in future.\n\nI ought to be able to use normal words without overly sensitive people feeling hurt by it. I am surprised that some of the other guys are taking her side though.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. So the question is whether the author is in the wrong for using terms like \"lads\" and \"guys\" in a mixed group, especially after a female teammate, Jane, expressed discomfort.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The team is mostly male, and they added Jane. They used terms like \"boiz,\" which she found excluding. She suggested using \"team\" instead. Then someone used \"lads and Jane,\" which she found worse. The author defended using \"lads\" and \"guys,\" saying they mean the whole team and not giving in to \"radical feminism.\"\n\nThe author's stance is that Jane is overly sensitive and that they aren't doing anything wrong. But the key point here is that Jane is part of the team and feels excluded by those terms. Terms like \"lads\" or \"guys\" are traditionally male-oriented, so using them in a mixed group can make non-male members feel left out even if it's unintentional. The fact that Jane has already mentioned it and the team agreed to try \"team\" instead shows they wanted to be inclusive. The author is resisting that change, which could be seen as not respecting Jane's feelings and the group's agreement.\n\nAlso, the author mentions that Jane said it's hard for her in a male group, but the author doesn't seem to acknowledge her experience. The other guy apologized and changed his behavior, but the author is doubling down. That resistance to inclusion might be problematic. It's not about being \"radical feminism\" but about creating an inclusive environment. The author's dismissal of Jane's feelings as oversensitivity could be the issue here. So, even if the author's intent is to include everyone, the impact on Jane matters. Therefore, the author might be in the wrong by not adapting their language to make Jane feel included.\n"
