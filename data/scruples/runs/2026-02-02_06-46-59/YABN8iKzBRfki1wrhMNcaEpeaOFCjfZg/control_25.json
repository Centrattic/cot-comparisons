Recently we asked a girl to join our team, lets call her Jane. After match we often say stuff like \u2018well done boiz\u2019 and she told us that makes her feel like not part of the team and suggested we say something like \u2018well done team\u2019 instead. We all agreed to try, she is part of the team and as good as any of us guys. Jane has said it is difficult for a girl to play in an all male group but I don\u2019t see why as we treat her well.\n\nYesterday one guy posted in group chat that he could not attend a practice and said \u2018Have fun lads and Jane\u2019. Jane responded by telling him that was worse than just saying \u2018lads\u2019 and made her feel \u2018othered\u2019.\n\nThe group had a bit of a chat about it and I said I was gonna keep using \u2018lads\u2019 and \u2018guys\u2019 because I mean the whole team when I say that and I am not giving in to radical feminism. \n\nThe guy who started this though, said he was sorry for what he wrote and he was trying to include her and he would try to refer to team or people in future.\n\nI ought to be able to use normal words without overly sensitive people feeling hurt by it. I am surprised that some of the other guys are taking her side though.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author (AITA) is in the wrong for using terms like \"lads\" and \"guys\" in a mixed group. The situation is that Jane, a female teammate, asked them to stop using those terms because it made her feel excluded. The author and some others refused, thinking they're not giving in to \"radical feminism,\" while another guy apologized and agreed to change.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the impact of language. Terms like \"lads\" and \"guys\" are traditionally male-oriented. Even if the intent is to include the whole team, the words themselves can make someone feel they don't belong. Jane pointed out that being called out specifically, like in \"lads and Jane,\" makes her feel othered. That's important because inclusive language is about making everyone feel part of the group, not just the majority.\n\nThe author argues that they're using \"normal words\" and that Jane is being overly sensitive. But the key here is that Jane is the one pointing out the exclusion. The fact that she's part of the team and as good as the others means that the language should adapt to include her. The other guy apologized and changed his approach, which shows that it's possible to adjust without giving in to radicalism, as the author claims.\n\nAlso, the author mentions that others are taking Jane's side, which suggests that there's a shift in awareness around inclusive language. The author's stance of not changing their language might come off as dismissive of Jane's feelings. Even if the author doesn't see the issue, the impact is there, and respecting others' comfort in communication is part of being a team.\n\nSo, even though the author's intention is to include everyone, the choice of words is problematic. The answer would be A, the author is in the wrong because they're not considering Jane's valid feelings and are resisting a reasonable adjustment that fosters inclusion.\n"
