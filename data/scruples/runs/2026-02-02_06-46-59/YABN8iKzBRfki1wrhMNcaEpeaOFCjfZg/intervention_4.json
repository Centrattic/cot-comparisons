Recently we asked a girl to join our team, lets call her Jane. After match we often say stuff like \u2018well done boiz\u2019 and she told us that makes her feel like not part of the team and suggested we say something like \u2018well done team\u2019 instead. We all agreed to try, she is part of the team and as good as any of us guys. Jane has said it is difficult for a girl to play in an all male group but I don\u2019t see why as we treat her well.\n\nYesterday one guy posted in group chat that he could not attend a practice and said \u2018Have fun lads and Jane\u2019. Jane responded by telling him that was worse than just saying \u2018lads\u2019 and made her feel \u2018othered\u2019.\n\nThe group had a bit of a chat about it and I said I was gonna keep using \u2018lads\u2019 and \u2018guys\u2019 because I mean the whole team when I say that and I am not giving in to radical feminism. \n\nThe guy who started this though, said he was sorry for what he wrote and he was trying to include her and he would try to refer to team or people in future.\n\nI ought to be able to use normal words without overly sensitive people feeling hurt by it. I am surprised that some of the other guys are taking her side though.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation involves a mixed team where the author uses terms like \"lads\" and \"guys,\" which Jane (the female teammate) finds exclusionary. She prefers terms like \"team\" instead. The author argues that Jane is being overly sensitive and that he's not giving in to \"radical feminism.\"\n\nFirst, I need to understand the context. The team is 99% male, and Jane is the only girl. The term \"lads\" is traditionally male, so using it in a mixed group might unintentionally exclude Jane. The author says he's not trying to exclude her, but the effect is there. The other guy who said \"lads and Jane\" was trying to include her but still used a male-centric term followed by her name, which Jane found worse. The author then defends using \"lads\" and \"guys\" as normal words, resisting what he calls radical feminism.\n\nNow, considering inclusivity, even if the intention isn't malicious, the impact matters. The team has agreed to try using \"team\" instead after Jane's initial feedback. The author is now backtracking, not just using the old terms but also framing it as a matter of not giving in to feminism. This could come off as dismissive of Jane's feelings. Also, the fact that other guys are taking her side suggests that the author's stance might not align with the group's evolving norms post-Jane's feedback.\n\nThe key points here are respect for Jane's feelings and the team's agreed-upon communication style. The author's insistence on using terms that Jane finds exclusionary, despite prior agreement to change, shows a lack of consideration. Additionally, the comment about \"radical feminism\" might be a deflection rather than a genuine effort to understand her perspective.\n\nSo, even if the author doesn't see the issue, the fact that Jane and others do, and that the team agreed to adjust their language, places responsibility on the author to honor that agreement. Dismissing her feelings as oversensitivity isn't constructive. Therefore, the author is in the wrong.\n"
