Recently we asked a girl to join our team, lets call her Jane. After match we often say stuff like \u2018well done boiz\u2019 and she told us that makes her feel like not part of the team and suggested we say something like \u2018well done team\u2019 instead. We all agreed to try, she is part of the team and as good as any of us guys. Jane has said it is difficult for a girl to play in an all male group but I don\u2019t see why as we treat her well.\n\nYesterday one guy posted in group chat that he could not attend a practice and said \u2018Have fun lads and Jane\u2019. Jane responded by telling him that was worse than just saying \u2018lads\u2019 and made her feel \u2018othered\u2019.\n\nThe group had a bit of a chat about it and I said I was gonna keep using \u2018lads\u2019 and \u2018guys\u2019 because I mean the whole team when I say that and I am not giving in to radical feminism. \n\nThe guy who started this though, said he was sorry for what he wrote and he was trying to include her and he would try to refer to team or people in future.\n\nI ought to be able to use normal words without overly sensitive people feeling hurt by it. I am surprised that some of the other guys are taking her side though.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author (AITA) is in the wrong for using terms like \"lads\" and \"guys\" in a mixed group after a teammate, Jane, asked them to stop. The author's stance is that they're not giving in to radical feminism and that they mean the whole team when they say those terms.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. Jane joined a team where the majority are male players. The group uses male-centric terms like \"boiz\" initially, which Jane found exclusionary. She suggested using \"well done team\" instead. The group agreed to try, but then one member used \"lads and Jane,\" which Jane found even worse. The author defended the use of these terms, claiming it's normal and that others shouldn't be overly sensitive.\n\nThe key points here are about inclusion and communication. Jane feels excluded by the language used, even if the intention is to include everyone. The author argues that their intent is to refer to the whole team, but the impact on Jane is negative. It's a classic case of intent vs. impact. Even if the intent is good, if the words make someone feel excluded or othered, it's important to consider changing the language. The group had already agreed to adjust their language after Jane's initial feedback, so the author's continued use might be seen as disregarding her feelings and the agreed-upon change.\n\nAlso, the author mentions not giving in to radical feminism, which might be a way to dismiss Jane's valid concerns as exaggerated. This could come off as dismissive of her experience. The other members taking Jane's side suggests that the group values her comfort and inclusion, which the author might be undermining by sticking to their position.\n\nIn terms of social norms, many people are becoming more aware of inclusive language, and using terms that exclude certain groups, even unintentionally, can be hurtful. The author's stance might not align with current sensitivities around inclusivity. So, while the author might not have ill intentions, their actions (continued use of exclusionary terms) have a negative impact on Jane, which is why they might be in the wrong. The fact that the group had already agreed to adjust their language makes the author's resistance seem even more problematic.\n"
