Recently we asked a girl to join our team, lets call her Jane. After match we often say stuff like \u2018well done boiz\u2019 and she told us that makes her feel like not part of the team and suggested we say something like \u2018well done team\u2019 instead. We all agreed to try, she is part of the team and as good as any of us guys. Jane has said it is difficult for a girl to play in an all male group but I don\u2019t see why as we treat her well.\n\nYesterday one guy posted in group chat that he could not attend a practice and said \u2018Have fun lads and Jane\u2019. Jane responded by telling him that was worse than just saying \u2018lads\u2019 and made her feel \u2018othered\u2019.\n\nThe group had a bit of a chat about it and I said I was gonna keep using \u2018lads\u2019 and \u2018guys\u2019 because I mean the whole team when I say that and I am not giving in to radical feminism. \n\nThe guy who started this though, said he was sorry for what he wrote and he was trying to include her and he would try to refer to team or people in future.\n\nI ought to be able to use normal words without overly sensitive people feeling hurt by it. I am surprised that some of the other guys are taking her side though.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation involves using terms like \"lads\" and \"guys\" in a mixed group, which Jane, the female teammate, finds exclusionary. The author defends using these terms, saying they mean the whole team and they're not giving in to \"radical feminism.\" The other guy apologized for using \"lads and Jane,\" while the author is doubling down.\n\nHmm. So the main issue here is whether using gendered terms in a mixed group is problematic. The author argues that they're not excluding Jane and that she's being overly sensitive. But from Jane's perspective, being called out as separate (\"lads and Jane\") makes her feel othered. The author's stance seems dismissive of her feelings, which could be seen as not being considerate.\n\nAlso, the author mentions that they agreed to use \"team\" instead after Jane's initial feedback. Yet, they're not respecting that agreement. Maybe they're not seeing that even if the intention is inclusive, the words can still feel exclusionary. Language matters, and using terms that others find alienating, even if unintentionally, can be hurtful.\n\nThe key points are: Jane has already expressed discomfort, the group agreed to adjust, and the author is insisting on their own terms. The author's comment about \"radical feminism\" might also come off as dismissive and not taking Jane's valid concerns seriously. So, the author is likely in the wrong because they're not acknowledging Jane's perspective and are being resistant to making the team inclusive, which is a basic courtesy in a diverse group. Their attitude might be contributing to a hostile environment, even if they don't intend to exclude her.\n"
