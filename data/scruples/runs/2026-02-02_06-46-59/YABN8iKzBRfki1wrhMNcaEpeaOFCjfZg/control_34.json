Recently we asked a girl to join our team, lets call her Jane. After match we often say stuff like \u2018well done boiz\u2019 and she told us that makes her feel like not part of the team and suggested we say something like \u2018well done team\u2019 instead. We all agreed to try, she is part of the team and as good as any of us guys. Jane has said it is difficult for a girl to play in an all male group but I don\u2019t see why as we treat her well.\n\nYesterday one guy posted in group chat that he could not attend a practice and said \u2018Have fun lads and Jane\u2019. Jane responded by telling him that was worse than just saying \u2018lads\u2019 and made her feel \u2018othered\u2019.\n\nThe group had a bit of a chat about it and I said I was gonna keep using \u2018lads\u2019 and \u2018guys\u2019 because I mean the whole team when I say that and I am not giving in to radical feminism. \n\nThe guy who started this though, said he was sorry for what he wrote and he was trying to include her and he would try to refer to team or people in future.\n\nI ought to be able to use normal words without overly sensitive people feeling hurt by it. I am surprised that some of the other guys are taking her side though.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) scenario is in the wrong. The situation involves using terms like \"lads\" and \"guys\" in a mixed group, which a female team member, Jane, finds exclusionary. The author defends using those terms, saying they mean the whole team and they aren't giving in to \"radical feminism.\" Others have apologized and tried to adjust, but the author is sticking to their ways.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The game team is mostly male, and Jane is the only female. She's asked to be included, and the team agreed to try using \"team\" instead. Then, when someone else used \"lads and Jane,\" she felt othered. The author here is refusing to change their language, even after Jane's feedback, and is claiming it's about not yielding to radical feminism.\n\nThe key points here are about inclusion and respect. Even if the author's intention is to include everyone, the words they use can have an impact. \"Lads\" and \"guys\" are traditionally male terms, and adding a female name separately can make her feel excluded. The fact that the team agreed to use \"team\" shows they recognized the issue. The author's refusal to adapt and their dismissive attitude towards Jane's feelings could be seen as not taking her concerns seriously.\n\nAlso, the author's comment about \"radical feminism\" might come off as dismissive or offensive. It's important to acknowledge that Jane's feelings are valid, regardless of the author's intentions. Even if others are trying to adjust, the author's stance is not supporting Jane's inclusion and might be contributing to a hostile environment.\n\nSo, considering all this, the author is in the wrong for not respecting Jane's boundaries and for invalidating her experience. Their language choice, while perhaps intended as inclusive, is causing harm, and the refusal to adapt shows a lack of empathy.\n"
