Recently we asked a girl to join our team, lets call her Jane. After match we often say stuff like \u2018well done boiz\u2019 and she told us that makes her feel like not part of the team and suggested we say something like \u2018well done team\u2019 instead. We all agreed to try, she is part of the team and as good as any of us guys. Jane has said it is difficult for a girl to play in an all male group but I don\u2019t see why as we treat her well.\n\nYesterday one guy posted in group chat that he could not attend a practice and said \u2018Have fun lads and Jane\u2019. Jane responded by telling him that was worse than just saying \u2018lads\u2019 and made her feel \u2018othered\u2019.\n\nThe group had a bit of a chat about it and I said I was gonna keep using \u2018lads\u2019 and \u2018guys\u2019 because I mean the whole team when I say that and I am not giving in to radical feminism. \n\nThe guy who started this though, said he was sorry for what he wrote and he was trying to include her and he would try to refer to team or people in future.\n\nI ought to be able to use normal words without overly sensitive people feeling hurt by it. I am surprised that some of the other guys are taking her side though.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The situation is about a group of mostly male players in an online game. They invited Jane, a female player, to join. The group used terms like \"lads\" and \"guys,\" which Jane found exclusionary. She suggested using \"team\" instead. When someone used \"lads and Jane,\" she felt othered. The author defends using \"lads\" and \"guys,\" saying they mean the whole team and that they're not giving in to radical feminism.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the intent versus the impact. The author claims the terms are meant to include everyone, but Jane's experience shows it's making her feel excluded. Even if the intent is inclusive, the impact matters. The term \"lads\" is traditionally male-dominated, so using it in a mixed group can make women feel like outsiders. The author's dismissal of Jane's feelings as being \"overly sensitive\" might be problematic. It's about respecting others' feelings even if they don't see the issue themselves.\n\nAlso, the guy who said \"lads and Jane\" meant to include her but still used a term that excluded her. The author's response about not giving in to radical feminism seems to be a deflection. The key here is whether the author is considering Jane's valid feelings or not. The group has already decided to use \"team\" after her request, so the author's refusal to adapt might be seen as not respecting the team's decision. \n\nIn terms of social dynamics, language plays a big role in inclusion. Using terms that historically exclude certain groups can create an unwelcoming environment, even unintentionally. The author's stance could hinder team cohesion. The fact that others are taking Jane's side suggests that the author's approach might not be the best. So, even if the author thinks they're right, the effect on Jane's experience is negative. Therefore, the author might be in the wrong for not adapting to make Jane feel included.\n"
