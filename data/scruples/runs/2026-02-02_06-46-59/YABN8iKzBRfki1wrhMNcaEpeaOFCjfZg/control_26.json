Recently we asked a girl to join our team, lets call her Jane. After match we often say stuff like \u2018well done boiz\u2019 and she told us that makes her feel like not part of the team and suggested we say something like \u2018well done team\u2019 instead. We all agreed to try, she is part of the team and as good as any of us guys. Jane has said it is difficult for a girl to play in an all male group but I don\u2019t see why as we treat her well.\n\nYesterday one guy posted in group chat that he could not attend a practice and said \u2018Have fun lads and Jane\u2019. Jane responded by telling him that was worse than just saying \u2018lads\u2019 and made her feel \u2018othered\u2019.\n\nThe group had a bit of a chat about it and I said I was gonna keep using \u2018lads\u2019 and \u2018guys\u2019 because I mean the whole team when I say that and I am not giving in to radical feminism. \n\nThe guy who started this though, said he was sorry for what he wrote and he was trying to include her and he would try to refer to team or people in future.\n\nI ought to be able to use normal words without overly sensitive people feeling hurt by it. I am surprised that some of the other guys are taking her side though.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. Let me start by reading through the situation again to make sure I understand it correctly.\n\nThe scenario is about someone who plays an online team game that's mostly male. They invited a girl named Jane to join. After matches, they used phrases like \"well done boiz,\" which Jane found exclusionary. She suggested using \"well done team\" instead. The group agreed, and they all treated her well. Then, a guy in the group wrote \"Have fun lads and Jane\" in the chat, which Jane found worse than just saying \"lads\" because she felt othered. The author defended using \"lads\" and \"guys\" by saying they mean the whole team and aren't giving in to radical feminism. The guy who wrote the problematic message apologized, but the author is frustrated that others are taking Jane's side.\n\nSo the question is whether the author is in the wrong. The options are A (yes) or B (no). \n\nFirst, I need to consider the impact of language. Words like \"lads\" and \"guys\" are traditionally male-focused terms. Even if the author intends to include everyone, the reality is that these terms can exclude women. Jane's reaction is valid because she's pointing out that she feels excluded when these terms are used in a male-dominated group. The author might argue that the intent was inclusive, but in communication, intent isn't always what matters most\u2014it's the impact on the other person. \n\nThe author also mentions that other guys are taking Jane's side, which might be frustrating. However, the fact that Jane has already expressed discomfort with such terms and the group agreed to adjust their language suggests that the author is not respecting the agreed-upon changes. By continuing to use \"lads\" and \"guys,\" the author is undermining Jane's feelings and the group's prior agreement. \n\nThe author's justification of \"not giving in to radical feminism\" is a bit concerning. It's a dismissive stance that could invalidate Jane's experience. Even if the author doesn't see an issue, the fact that Jane does and the group has acknowledged it means that the author's continued use of those terms is problematic. \n\nThe guy who wrote \"lads and Jane\" apologized and changed his approach, which the author might see as contradictory to their own stance. However, each person's actions should be evaluated on their own merits. The author's refusal to adjust their language despite Jane's clear discomfort suggests that they are not considering her perspective, which could be seen as wrong.\n\nOn the other hand, maybe the author is trying to maintain a casual, familiar tone that they've used before. But in this case, the group has made a conscious effort to be more inclusive. The author's resistance to that change could be seen as resisting necessary adjustments for inclusivity.\n\nIn summary, the author is not in the wrong because they aren't maliciously excluding Jane. However, their continued use of terms that Jane finds exclusionary, despite her feedback and the group's agreement to change, might make them complicit in creating an environment where Jane feels othered. The key point is that even if the intent was good, the impact is harmful, and the author isn't respecting the group's agreed-upon adjustments.\n\nBut wait, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. If the author is using language that someone in the group has specifically asked them not to use, then they are contributing to a hostile environment. So even if the author doesn't see the problem, their actions are part of the issue. Therefore, the answer might be A (yes, the author is in the wrong).\n"
