Recently we asked a girl to join our team, lets call her Jane. After match we often say stuff like \u2018well done boiz\u2019 and she told us that makes her feel like not part of the team and suggested we say something like \u2018well done team\u2019 instead. We all agreed to try, she is part of the team and as good as any of us guys. Jane has said it is difficult for a girl to play in an all male group but I don\u2019t see why as we treat her well.\n\nYesterday one guy posted in group chat that he could not attend a practice and said \u2018Have fun lads and Jane\u2019. Jane responded by telling him that was worse than just saying \u2018lads\u2019 and made her feel \u2018othered\u2019.\n\nThe group had a bit of a chat about it and I said I was gonna keep using \u2018lads\u2019 and \u2018guys\u2019 because I mean the whole team when I say that and I am not giving in to radical feminism. \n\nThe guy who started this though, said he was sorry for what he wrote and he was trying to include her and he would try to refer to team or people in future.\n\nI ought to be able to use normal words without overly sensitive people feeling hurt by it. I am surprised that some of the other guys are taking her side though.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is about using terms like \"lads\" and \"guys\" in a mixed group, specifically after a female teammate, Jane, expressed feeling excluded by those terms. The author defends their use of the terms, saying they mean the whole team and that they're not giving in to \"radical feminism.\" Others in the group apologized and tried to adjust, but the author is sticking to their stance.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The game is 99% male, so Jane is in the minority. She's already mentioned that being in an all-male group is difficult, even though the team treats her well. The terms \"lads\" and \"guys\" are traditionally male-centric. When Jane pointed out that these terms made her feel excluded, the team agreed to use \"team\" instead. However, when one member used \"lads and Jane,\" she felt even more othered. The author is now defending the use of these terms, arguing that they're normal words and that Jane is being overly sensitive.\n\nNow, the key points here are about inclusivity and respect. Even if the intention is to include everyone, if the language used makes someone feel excluded, it's important to consider their feelings. The author is dismissing Jane's feelings as being overly sensitive and using a derogatory term (\"radical feminism\") to describe her perspective. That's a red flag. Dismissing someone's valid feelings and using inflammatory language can be harmful.\n\nAlso, the fact that others in the group have apologized and are trying to adjust shows that they recognize the issue. The author, however, is doubling down. That could create a toxic environment where Jane feels her concerns aren't taken seriously. Even if the author doesn't intend to exclude her, the impact is real. Inclusivity often requires being mindful of language, especially when there's a power dynamic or history of exclusion (like in a male-dominated space).\n\nAdditionally, the author's use of the term \"radical feminism\" is a stereotype and could be a way to invalidate Jane's experience. This kind of language can be alienating and shows a lack of empathy. The author might not see the problem, but that doesn't mean there isn't one. The main issue here is the failure to respect Jane's comfort and the agreed-upon change to more inclusive language. Even if the author believes they're using terms that mean the whole team, the reality is that those terms are exclusionary by default in a mixed group, especially when there's a history of Jane feeling excluded.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the author is in the wrong because they're not respecting Jane's feelings, are using dismissive language, and are not adapting their communication to be inclusive. The fact that others are making an effort shows that the author is the outlier here, which might be why some others are taking Jane's side. The answer should be A (Yes, the author is in the wrong).\n"
