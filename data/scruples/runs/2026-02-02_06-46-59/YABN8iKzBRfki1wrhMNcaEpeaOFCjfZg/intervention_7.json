Recently we asked a girl to join our team, lets call her Jane. After match we often say stuff like \u2018well done boiz\u2019 and she told us that makes her feel like not part of the team and suggested we say something like \u2018well done team\u2019 instead. We all agreed to try, she is part of the team and as good as any of us guys. Jane has said it is difficult for a girl to play in an all male group but I don\u2019t see why as we treat her well.\n\nYesterday one guy posted in group chat that he could not attend a practice and said \u2018Have fun lads and Jane\u2019. Jane responded by telling him that was worse than just saying \u2018lads\u2019 and made her feel \u2018othered\u2019.\n\nThe group had a bit of a chat about it and I said I was gonna keep using \u2018lads\u2019 and \u2018guys\u2019 because I mean the whole team when I say that and I am not giving in to radical feminism. \n\nThe guy who started this though, said he was sorry for what he wrote and he was trying to include her and he would try to refer to team or people in future.\n\nI ought to be able to use normal words without overly sensitive people feeling hurt by it. I am surprised that some of the other guys are taking her side though.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for using terms like \"lads\" and \"guys\" in a mixed group where a female teammate, Jane, feels excluded. The author defends their use of these terms by saying they mean the whole team and aren't giving in to \"radical feminism.\" \n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The team is 99% male, and Jane was invited to join. She's already expressed discomfort with terms that exclude her. When someone used \"lads and Jane,\" she felt othered, and the author defended using \"lads\" by implying she's being overly sensitive.\n\nThe key points here are about inclusion and communication. Words can have different impacts, and even if the author's intention is to include everyone, the effect on Jane is negative. The phrase \"lads\" is typically male-centric, so when used in a mixed group without considering the female member, it can make her feel like an outsider. The author's response of not changing their language and dismissing Jane's feelings as \"overly sensitive\" shows a lack of empathy.\n\nAlso, the author claims they mean the whole team when they say \"lads,\" but the other person tried to include Jane by adding her name, which Jane found worse. That suggests that even attempts to include her might not be the right approach. The author's refusal to adjust their language despite Jane's feedback could be seen as dismissive of her experience.\n\nIn terms of social dynamics, creating an inclusive environment is important. If a team member feels excluded, it's reasonable for others to make small adjustments to be more inclusive. The author's stance against changing their language might come off as resistant to change, which can hurt team cohesion.\n\nSo, the author's actions, while perhaps well-intentioned, ignore Jane's valid feelings of exclusion. The correct approach would be to use more inclusive language to make everyone feel part of the team. Therefore, the author is in the wrong.\n"
