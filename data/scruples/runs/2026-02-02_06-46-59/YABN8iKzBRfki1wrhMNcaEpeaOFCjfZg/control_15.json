Recently we asked a girl to join our team, lets call her Jane. After match we often say stuff like \u2018well done boiz\u2019 and she told us that makes her feel like not part of the team and suggested we say something like \u2018well done team\u2019 instead. We all agreed to try, she is part of the team and as good as any of us guys. Jane has said it is difficult for a girl to play in an all male group but I don\u2019t see why as we treat her well.\n\nYesterday one guy posted in group chat that he could not attend a practice and said \u2018Have fun lads and Jane\u2019. Jane responded by telling him that was worse than just saying \u2018lads\u2019 and made her feel \u2018othered\u2019.\n\nThe group had a bit of a chat about it and I said I was gonna keep using \u2018lads\u2019 and \u2018guys\u2019 because I mean the whole team when I say that and I am not giving in to radical feminism. \n\nThe guy who started this though, said he was sorry for what he wrote and he was trying to include her and he would try to refer to team or people in future.\n\nI ought to be able to use normal words without overly sensitive people feeling hurt by it. I am surprised that some of the other guys are taking her side though.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let me try to work through this. So the question is whether the author is in the wrong for using the words \"lads\" and \"guys\" in a mixed group when a female teammate, Jane, has expressed discomfort. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the context. The team is mostly male, and Jane is the only girl. She asked them to use \"well done team\" instead of \"boiz\" because it made her feel excluded. Then, a guy used \"lads and Jane,\" which she found worse. The author argues that they mean the whole team when they say \"lads\" or \"guys\" and they don't want to give in to \"radical feminism.\" They're surprised others are taking Jane's side.\n\nSo, the key points here are about inclusive language and whether the author's choice of words is exclusionary despite their intention. The author's main argument is that they're not being exclusionary and that the words are normal. But Jane's experience is that she feels \"othered\" by these terms. The guy who said \"lads and Jane\" apologized and committed to using more inclusive terms. The author, however, is resisting and claims they're not in the wrong.\n\nI remember that in many discussions about inclusive language, terms like \"lads\" or \"guys\" are often considered gendered and might exclude non-male members. Even if the intention is to include everyone, the effect matters. Jane's feedback is that these terms make her feel like she doesn't belong, which is a valid concern. The author's dismissal of her feelings as being \"overly sensitive\" and using a derogatory term like \"radical feminism\" might be problematic. It's not just about the words themselves, but how they respond to the feedback. \n\nAlso, the fact that the group had a discussion and some are taking Jane's side suggests that there's a shift towards being more inclusive. The author's stance could be seen as not listening to Jane's feelings and possibly contributing to a hostile environment. Even if the team treats her well otherwise, the language used can still affect her sense of inclusion. \n\nSo, the author's refusal to adjust their language despite Jane's clear communication about how it makes her feel might be the issue. It's about being considerate and making changes to ensure all team members feel included, even if it's a matter of terminology. The author's position could be seen as invalidating Jane's experience. Therefore, the answer might be A (the author is in the wrong) because they are not respecting Jane's feelings and the group's effort to be inclusive.\n"
