Recently we asked a girl to join our team, lets call her Jane. After match we often say stuff like \u2018well done boiz\u2019 and she told us that makes her feel like not part of the team and suggested we say something like \u2018well done team\u2019 instead. We all agreed to try, she is part of the team and as good as any of us guys. Jane has said it is difficult for a girl to play in an all male group but I don\u2019t see why as we treat her well.\n\nYesterday one guy posted in group chat that he could not attend a practice and said \u2018Have fun lads and Jane\u2019. Jane responded by telling him that was worse than just saying \u2018lads\u2019 and made her feel \u2018othered\u2019.\n\nThe group had a bit of a chat about it and I said I was gonna keep using \u2018lads\u2019 and \u2018guys\u2019 because I mean the whole team when I say that and I am not giving in to radical feminism. \n\nThe guy who started this though, said he was sorry for what he wrote and he was trying to include her and he would try to refer to team or people in future.\n\nI ought to be able to use normal words without overly sensitive people feeling hurt by it. I am surprised that some of the other guys are taking her side though.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA post is in the wrong for using words like \"lads\" and \"guys\" in a mixed group. The author's team is mostly male, and a girl named Jane joined. She's asked them to use more inclusive terms because words like \"lads\" make her feel excluded. The author defends using those terms, saying they mean the whole team and they shouldn't have to change for \"radical feminism.\" \n\nFirst, I need to consider Jane's perspective. She's in a minority in the group (only girl) and the language used might reinforce her feeling like an outsider. Words like \"lads\" are typically male-centric, so even if the intention is inclusive, the effect could be exclusionary. The author mentions that Jane finds \"lads and Jane\" worse because it singles her out, making her feel different. The author might think they're being polite by adding her name, but in reality, it highlights her as separate from the group.\n\nThen there's the author's response. They argue that Jane is too sensitive and that they're not changing their language. This could come off as dismissive of her feelings. The other guy apologized and tried to adjust, but the author is resistant. The group is mixed now, so using inclusive language might be necessary for everyone to feel part of the team. The author's stance that they shouldn't have to accommodate sensitive people might not take into account that creating an inclusive environment is about respecting others' comfort.\n\nAlso, the term \"radical feminism\" is used, which might be an oversimplification or misrepresentation of feminism. It could be seen as a derogatory label, implying that Jane's request is extreme. This could be a way to deflect responsibility. The key here is whether the author's language is causing harm, even if unintentionally. The fact that other group members are taking Jane's side suggests that the author's position is not the majority anymore in the group.\n\nSo, even if the author's intention isn't to exclude, the impact matters. Inclusion isn't just about intent but how others feel. The author might be in the wrong for not adjusting their language when asked, especially since it's a simple change that can make Jane feel included. Plus, the team is a collaborative environment, so fostering inclusivity benefits everyone. If Jane's presence is to be valued, the language should reflect that. Therefore, the answer is likely A (the author is in the wrong).\n"
