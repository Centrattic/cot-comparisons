Recently we asked a girl to join our team, lets call her Jane. After match we often say stuff like \u2018well done boiz\u2019 and she told us that makes her feel like not part of the team and suggested we say something like \u2018well done team\u2019 instead. We all agreed to try, she is part of the team and as good as any of us guys. Jane has said it is difficult for a girl to play in an all male group but I don\u2019t see why as we treat her well.\n\nYesterday one guy posted in group chat that he could not attend a practice and said \u2018Have fun lads and Jane\u2019. Jane responded by telling him that was worse than just saying \u2018lads\u2019 and made her feel \u2018othered\u2019.\n\nThe group had a bit of a chat about it and I said I was gonna keep using \u2018lads\u2019 and \u2018guys\u2019 because I mean the whole team when I say that and I am not giving in to radical feminism. \n\nThe guy who started this though, said he was sorry for what he wrote and he was trying to include her and he would try to refer to team or people in future.\n\nI ought to be able to use normal words without overly sensitive people feeling hurt by it. I am surprised that some of the other guys are taking her side though.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author in this situation is in the wrong. The context is about using terms like \"lads\" and \"guys\" in a mixed group, which is mostly male except for one girl, Jane.\n\nFirst, the author's team included Jane, who felt excluded when they used terms like \"boiz\" or \"lads.\" Jane suggested using \"team\" instead. The author defended using \"lads\" and \"guys,\" arguing that they mean the whole team and that they're not giving in to radical feminism. \n\nNow, the key points here are about inclusive language and the impact of words. Even if the intent is to include everyone, the terms \"lads\" and \"guys\" are traditionally male-oriented. Using them in a mixed group can make non-male members feel excluded, even unintentionally. Jane pointed out that being singled out by adding her name after \"lads\" made her feel \"othered,\" which is a valid feeling. \n\nThe author dismissed Jane's feelings by calling her \"overly sensitive\" and accused her of radical feminism. This is problematic because it invalidates her experience and uses a derogatory label. The fact that other team members are supportive of Jane suggests that the author's stance is out of step with the group's effort to be inclusive.\n\nAdditionally, the author's response to the situation by doubling down on the use of exclusive terms shows a lack of willingness to adapt for inclusivity. The guy who initially used the term apologized and tried to adjust, which contrasts with the author's rigid stance.\n\nSo, even if the author's intention was to include everyone, the impact on Jane is significant. Language that excludes or makes someone feel othered is harmful. Therefore, the author is in the wrong for not respecting Jane's feelings and for resisting the inclusive language the team agreed on.\n"
