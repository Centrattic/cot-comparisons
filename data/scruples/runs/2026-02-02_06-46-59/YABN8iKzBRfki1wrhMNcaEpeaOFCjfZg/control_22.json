Recently we asked a girl to join our team, lets call her Jane. After match we often say stuff like \u2018well done boiz\u2019 and she told us that makes her feel like not part of the team and suggested we say something like \u2018well done team\u2019 instead. We all agreed to try, she is part of the team and as good as any of us guys. Jane has said it is difficult for a girl to play in an all male group but I don\u2019t see why as we treat her well.\n\nYesterday one guy posted in group chat that he could not attend a practice and said \u2018Have fun lads and Jane\u2019. Jane responded by telling him that was worse than just saying \u2018lads\u2019 and made her feel \u2018othered\u2019.\n\nThe group had a bit of a chat about it and I said I was gonna keep using \u2018lads\u2019 and \u2018guys\u2019 because I mean the whole team when I say that and I am not giving in to radical feminism. \n\nThe guy who started this though, said he was sorry for what he wrote and he was trying to include her and he would try to refer to team or people in future.\n\nI ought to be able to use normal words without overly sensitive people feeling hurt by it. I am surprised that some of the other guys are taking her side though.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for using the terms \"lads\" and \"guys\" in a mixed group, especially after Jane expressed discomfort.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the context. The team is mostly male, and they included Jane, a female player. Initially, they used male-centric terms like \"boiz,\" which made her feel excluded. Then they agreed to use \"team\" instead. But when someone used \"lads and Jane,\" she felt \"othered\" again. The author defends using \"lads\" and \"guys,\" arguing they mean the whole team and that they shouldn't give in to \"radical feminism.\"\n\nHmm. The key here is whether the terms \"lads\" and \"guys\" are inclusive enough in a mixed group. \"Lads\" is definitely a male term. \"Guys\" is often used as a gender-neutral term in modern English, but maybe not always. If the group is mixed, using male-only terms can make non-male members feel left out, even if the speaker intends to be inclusive. The fact that Jane specifically pointed out feeling excluded after the use of \"lads\" suggests that the term is still problematic for her. \n\nThe author's response is dismissive, labeling Jane's reaction as \"radical feminism.\" That's a bit concerning because it's not about feminism per se but about inclusion and respect. The other guy apologized and committed to using more inclusive language, but the author is doubling down, which might be seen as not taking Jane's feelings seriously. \n\nIn a team setting where someone has asked for more inclusive terms, continuing to use gendered language could be seen as not respecting their boundaries. The author might be in the wrong because using \"lads\" explicitly excludes Jane, even if unintentionally. The intention doesn't negate the impact. Also, the author's refusal to adapt labels Jane's feelings as overreactions, which can be hurtful and dismissive. \n\nSo, even if the author thinks the words mean the whole team, if the team includes non-male members, those terms inherently exclude them. The solution is to use terms that everyone in the group feels comfortable with. The author's stance might not be malicious, but it's not considerate of Jane's perspective. Therefore, the answer is likely A, the author is in the wrong.\n"
