Recently we asked a girl to join our team, lets call her Jane. After match we often say stuff like \u2018well done boiz\u2019 and she told us that makes her feel like not part of the team and suggested we say something like \u2018well done team\u2019 instead. We all agreed to try, she is part of the team and as good as any of us guys. Jane has said it is difficult for a girl to play in an all male group but I don\u2019t see why as we treat her well.\n\nYesterday one guy posted in group chat that he could not attend a practice and said \u2018Have fun lads and Jane\u2019. Jane responded by telling him that was worse than just saying \u2018lads\u2019 and made her feel \u2018othered\u2019.\n\nThe group had a bit of a chat about it and I said I was gonna keep using \u2018lads\u2019 and \u2018guys\u2019 because I mean the whole team when I say that and I am not giving in to radical feminism. \n\nThe guy who started this though, said he was sorry for what he wrote and he was trying to include her and he would try to refer to team or people in future.\n\nI ought to be able to use normal words without overly sensitive people feeling hurt by it. I am surprised that some of the other guys are taking her side though.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is wrong for wanting to use \"lads\" and \"guys\" in a mixed group. The situation is that Jane, a female team member, found these terms exclusionary. The author argues that they mean the whole team when using those terms and don't want to give in to \"radical feminism.\"\n\nFirst, I need to consider the impact of language. Even if the intention is to include everyone, the terms \"lads\" and \"guys\" are traditionally male-oriented. When a female team member points out that it makes her feel excluded, that's a valid concern. The key here is about inclusive language and respect for others' feelings.\n\nThe author is using phrases that the team agreed to avoid after Jane's initial feedback. Then, a teammate used \"lads and Jane,\" which Jane found worse. The author's response is a bit defensive, mentioning not giving in to radical feminism, which might come off as dismissive. This could be seen as not taking Jane's feelings seriously.\n\nIn professional or team settings, it's important to consider how language affects all members. Even if the author's intent is inclusion, the terms can be exclusionary. The team had agreed to use \"team\" instead, showing a prior understanding. The author's refusal to adapt might be seen as prioritizing their own communication style over the team's agreed-upon approach.\n\nAlso, the author's comment about \"overly sensitive people\" could be perceived as invalidating Jane's experience. It's about empathy and willingness to adjust for the comfort of all team members, especially when it's a known issue.\n\nSo, while the author might not have ill intentions, the insistence on using terms that others find exclusionary, after agreeing to change, does make them at fault. The answer would lean towards A, the author is in the wrong.\n"
