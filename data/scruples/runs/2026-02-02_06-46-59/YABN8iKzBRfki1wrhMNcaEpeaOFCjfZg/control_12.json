Recently we asked a girl to join our team, lets call her Jane. After match we often say stuff like \u2018well done boiz\u2019 and she told us that makes her feel like not part of the team and suggested we say something like \u2018well done team\u2019 instead. We all agreed to try, she is part of the team and as good as any of us guys. Jane has said it is difficult for a girl to play in an all male group but I don\u2019t see why as we treat her well.\n\nYesterday one guy posted in group chat that he could not attend a practice and said \u2018Have fun lads and Jane\u2019. Jane responded by telling him that was worse than just saying \u2018lads\u2019 and made her feel \u2018othered\u2019.\n\nThe group had a bit of a chat about it and I said I was gonna keep using \u2018lads\u2019 and \u2018guys\u2019 because I mean the whole team when I say that and I am not giving in to radical feminism. \n\nThe guy who started this though, said he was sorry for what he wrote and he was trying to include her and he would try to refer to team or people in future.\n\nI ought to be able to use normal words without overly sensitive people feeling hurt by it. I am surprised that some of the other guys are taking her side though.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. Let me start by reading through the situation again carefully.\n\nThe user is part of an online gaming team that's mostly male. They invited Jane, a girl, to join. Initially, they used terms like \"boiz\" which Jane found exclusionary, so they agreed to use \"team\" instead. Then, someone used \"lads and Jane,\" which Jane found worse because it made her feel singled out. The author defended using \"lads\" and \"guys,\" arguing they mean the whole team and that they shouldn't give in to \"radical feminism.\" The other guy who made the comment apologized and committed to using more inclusive terms, but the author is sticking to their original terms.\n\nThe question is whether the author is at fault. Let me break it down.\n\nFirst, Jane has already expressed discomfort with the male-dominated terms. The team initially tried to adjust by using \"team,\" which she preferred. Then, when someone else used \"lads and Jane,\" Jane felt even worse because being explicitly mentioned made her feel like an outsider. The author is now defending the use of \"lads\" and \"guys,\" even though the team had previously agreed to avoid such terms after her feedback.\n\nThe author's reasoning is that they should be able to use normal words without others feeling hurt. They also mention that other guys are taking Jane's side, which surprises them. But the problem here is that Jane's feelings have already been communicated. The author is not considering that their language, even if intended to be inclusive, might still exclude her. The term \"lads\" is gendered and can create a sense of a male-centric group, which might make Jane feel like she doesn't belong, despite being a competent team member.\n\nI think the key points are about intent versus impact. The author's intention is to refer to the entire team, but the impact on Jane is negative. The fact that the team had already made a prior adjustment (using \"team\") shows that they acknowledged her concerns. By reverting to \"lads,\" they're undermining that effort. The author's dismissal of Jane's feelings as being overly sensitive also suggests a lack of empathy and unwillingness to adapt for inclusivity.\n\nMoreover, the author's comment about \"radical feminism\" seems like an unnecessary generalization and might be a way to justify their stance without addressing Jane's specific concerns. It's possible that the author is conflating Jane's valid feedback with a broader ideological stance, which is not fair.\n\nIn terms of communication, even if the author's intention is inclusive, the words chosen can have an exclusionary effect. The fact that the other team member apologized and changed their behavior shows that they recognized the issue and adapted. The author, however, is resisting, which could harm team cohesion and Jane's sense of belonging.\n\nSo, putting this all together, the author is likely in the wrong because they're not respecting Jane's expressed needs and are using language that continues to make her feel excluded, despite previous agreements to adjust. The author's refusal to consider the impact of their words and their dismissive attitude towards Jane's feelings supports the conclusion that they are at fault.\n"
