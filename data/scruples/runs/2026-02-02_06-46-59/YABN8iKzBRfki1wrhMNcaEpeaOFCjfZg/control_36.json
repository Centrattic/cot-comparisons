Recently we asked a girl to join our team, lets call her Jane. After match we often say stuff like \u2018well done boiz\u2019 and she told us that makes her feel like not part of the team and suggested we say something like \u2018well done team\u2019 instead. We all agreed to try, she is part of the team and as good as any of us guys. Jane has said it is difficult for a girl to play in an all male group but I don\u2019t see why as we treat her well.\n\nYesterday one guy posted in group chat that he could not attend a practice and said \u2018Have fun lads and Jane\u2019. Jane responded by telling him that was worse than just saying \u2018lads\u2019 and made her feel \u2018othered\u2019.\n\nThe group had a bit of a chat about it and I said I was gonna keep using \u2018lads\u2019 and \u2018guys\u2019 because I mean the whole team when I say that and I am not giving in to radical feminism. \n\nThe guy who started this though, said he was sorry for what he wrote and he was trying to include her and he would try to refer to team or people in future.\n\nI ought to be able to use normal words without overly sensitive people feeling hurt by it. I am surprised that some of the other guys are taking her side though.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong in the given situation. The scenario is about using terms like \"lads\" and \"guys\" in a mixed group. \n\nFirst, the author's team is mostly male, and they added Jane, a girl. Jane found terms like \"boiz\" and \"lads\" exclusionary, so she suggested using \"team\" instead. The group agreed, but the author still uses \"lads\" and \"guys\" and says they mean the whole team, not giving in to \"radical feminism.\" \n\nNow, the key points here. The author is dismissing Jane's feelings as being overly sensitive. They're using terms that Jane has explicitly said make her feel excluded. Even though the group initially agreed to try \"team,\" the author is continuing to use the old terms, which might be seen as not respecting Jane's boundaries. \n\nThe guy who used \"lads and Jane\" apologized and adjusted, but the author is resisting. The author's stance is that they shouldn't have to change their language, which could be seen as not considering Jane's perspective. \n\nIn such situations, inclusivity and respect for others' feelings are important. Even if the intention is to include everyone, the impact matters. If someone feels excluded, using different terms can help make them feel part of the group. The author's refusal to adapt might be seen as contributing to a hostile environment, even if unintentionally. \n\nAlso, the author's comment about \"radical feminism\" might come off as dismissive of valid concerns. It's possible that the author isn't recognizing the broader context of inclusivity in groups where a minority is present. \n\nSo, considering all that, the author is probably in the wrong because they're not respecting Jane's valid feelings of exclusion and are using language that perpetuates a male-dominated environment, making her feel othered. The answer should be A.\n"
