Recently we asked a girl to join our team, lets call her Jane. After match we often say stuff like \u2018well done boiz\u2019 and she told us that makes her feel like not part of the team and suggested we say something like \u2018well done team\u2019 instead. We all agreed to try, she is part of the team and as good as any of us guys. Jane has said it is difficult for a girl to play in an all male group but I don\u2019t see why as we treat her well.\n\nYesterday one guy posted in group chat that he could not attend a practice and said \u2018Have fun lads and Jane\u2019. Jane responded by telling him that was worse than just saying \u2018lads\u2019 and made her feel \u2018othered\u2019.\n\nThe group had a bit of a chat about it and I said I was gonna keep using \u2018lads\u2019 and \u2018guys\u2019 because I mean the whole team when I say that and I am not giving in to radical feminism. \n\nThe guy who started this though, said he was sorry for what he wrote and he was trying to include her and he would try to refer to team or people in future.\n\nI ought to be able to use normal words without overly sensitive people feeling hurt by it. I am surprised that some of the other guys are taking her side though.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation involves using words like \"lads\" and \"guys\" in a mixed group, which made Jane feel excluded. The author defended using these terms, saying they mean the whole team and they're not giving in to radical feminism.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the context. The team is mostly male, and Jane is the only girl. The initial issue was that Jane felt excluded when they used \"boiz,\" so they switched to \"team.\" Then another member mentioned \"lads and Jane,\" which she found worse. The author is arguing that Jane is being overly sensitive and that they should be able to use normal words without people feeling hurt. They also mention that others took Jane's side, which surprises them.\n\nSo, the key points here are about inclusivity and language. Using terms like \"lads\" or \"guys\" can be exclusionary, even if the intention is to be inclusive. The author is dismissing Jane's feelings as radical feminism, which might be a form of invalidation. It's possible that the author is not recognizing the impact of their words on Jane, even if the intention was neutral. The concept of \"othering\" is important here, where Jane is made to feel different or not part of the group by being singled out in the phrase \"lads and Jane.\" Including her separately might highlight her as an outsider, even if it's not intended.\n\nThe author's stance is that they're using normal words and Jane is overreacting. However, the situation is that Jane has already expressed discomfort with previous terms, and the group had agreed to use more inclusive language. The author's refusal to adjust despite Jane's feedback could be seen as not respecting her feelings and the group's agreement. The phrase \"not giving in to radical feminism\" also suggests a dismissive attitude towards Jane's valid concerns, which could be problematic.\n\nOn the other hand, the author might believe they're being inclusive by using \"lads\" to refer to the team. However, the key is whether the words actually make Jane feel included. Intentions don't always align with impact. In group dynamics, especially when there's a minority member, using language that includes everyone is important for fostering a welcoming environment. The fact that even the person who initially used \"lads and Jane\" apologized shows that the group is trying to adjust, but the author is resisting, which could be seen as inconsiderate.\n\nSo, considering all this, the author is not in the wrong? Or are they? The answer depends on whether the language used is harmful despite the author's intentions. Since Jane is part of the team and the terms used are making her feel excluded, the author's continued use of such terms could be seen as contributing to an unwelcoming environment. Therefore, the author might be in the wrong because they're not adapting their language to include Jane, even after she's expressed her discomfort. The fact that others are taking her side suggests that the group sees the issue as important, and the author's resistance might be undermining team cohesion.\n"
