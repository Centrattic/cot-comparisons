Recently we asked a girl to join our team, lets call her Jane. After match we often say stuff like \u2018well done boiz\u2019 and she told us that makes her feel like not part of the team and suggested we say something like \u2018well done team\u2019 instead. We all agreed to try, she is part of the team and as good as any of us guys. Jane has said it is difficult for a girl to play in an all male group but I don\u2019t see why as we treat her well.\n\nYesterday one guy posted in group chat that he could not attend a practice and said \u2018Have fun lads and Jane\u2019. Jane responded by telling him that was worse than just saying \u2018lads\u2019 and made her feel \u2018othered\u2019.\n\nThe group had a bit of a chat about it and I said I was gonna keep using \u2018lads\u2019 and \u2018guys\u2019 because I mean the whole team when I say that and I am not giving in to radical feminism. \n\nThe guy who started this though, said he was sorry for what he wrote and he was trying to include her and he would try to refer to team or people in future.\n\nI ought to be able to use normal words without overly sensitive people feeling hurt by it. I am surprised that some of the other guys are taking her side though.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for using terms like 'lads' and 'guys' in a mixed group. The situation involves Jane, a female team member, who feels excluded by those terms and prefers 'team' or 'people'. The author argues that they're not giving in to radical feminism and that Jane is being overly sensitive. Others in the group have apologized and changed their language, but the author is sticking to their ways.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the perspectives. Jane's main issue is feeling othered by the use of male-centric terms. Even if the author's intention is to include everyone, the terms 'lads' and 'guys' are traditionally male and can make a female member feel excluded. The fact that the group agreed to use 'team' shows they recognize Jane's valid feelings. The author's comment about 'not giving in to radical feminism' might come off as dismissive of Jane's experience, which could be seen as invalidating her feelings.\n\nCommunication and inclusivity are key here. Even if the author means well, language that excludes a group member is problematic. The other guys apologized and adjusted their language, so the author's refusal to do the same could be seen as resistant to creating an inclusive environment. The author's stance might be perceived as prioritizing their own comfort over Jane's inclusion, which is a significant issue in team dynamics where everyone should feel valued.\n\nAlso, the term 'overly sensitive' is a bit of a red flag. It suggests that Jane's feelings are not legitimate, which isn't helpful. Inclusivity often requires accommodating different perspectives, even if they differ from one's own. The author might not be malicious, but their actions still contribute to Jane feeling excluded, which is the crux of the problem.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the author is in the wrong because their language choices, despite good intentions, are causing Jane to feel excluded, and they're not acknowledging her valid concerns. The answer should be A.\n"
