Recently we asked a girl to join our team, lets call her Jane. After match we often say stuff like \u2018well done boiz\u2019 and she told us that makes her feel like not part of the team and suggested we say something like \u2018well done team\u2019 instead. We all agreed to try, she is part of the team and as good as any of us guys. Jane has said it is difficult for a girl to play in an all male group but I don\u2019t see why as we treat her well.\n\nYesterday one guy posted in group chat that he could not attend a practice and said \u2018Have fun lads and Jane\u2019. Jane responded by telling him that was worse than just saying \u2018lads\u2019 and made her feel \u2018othered\u2019.\n\nThe group had a bit of a chat about it and I said I was gonna keep using \u2018lads\u2019 and \u2018guys\u2019 because I mean the whole team when I say that and I am not giving in to radical feminism. \n\nThe guy who started this though, said he was sorry for what he wrote and he was trying to include her and he would try to refer to team or people in future.\n\nI ought to be able to use normal words without overly sensitive people feeling hurt by it. I am surprised that some of the other guys are taking her side though.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is about using terms like 'lads' and 'guys' in a mixed group where a female team member, Jane, feels excluded.\n\nFirst, the initial problem was Jane being asked to join a mostly male team. The team used terms like 'boiz' which she found alienating. They agreed to switch to 'team' instead. Then, someone used 'lads and Jane' in a message, which Jane found worse because it made her feel othered. The author defended using 'lads' and 'guys', arguing that they mean the whole team and they're not giving in to radical feminism. The other guy apologized and tried to adjust, but the author is sticking to their original stance.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. Let me break down the key points. The team already agreed to be more inclusive after Jane's initial feedback. Then, when another member made a mistake, the author doubled down on using the terms they had agreed to avoid. The author's reasoning is that they're using normal words and shouldn't have to change because some people are too sensitive. However, Jane explicitly said those terms make her feel excluded. \n\nInclusivity in group communication is important. Even if the intention isn't to exclude, the impact on Jane matters. The fact that the team had already made a prior agreement to adjust their language shows they were aware of the issue. The author's refusal to comply with that agreement could be seen as dismissive of Jane's feelings. Also, the argument about \"not giving in to radical feminism\" might be an overgeneralization and could alienate Jane further by implying her concerns are politically motivated rather than genuine.\n\nOn the other hand, the author might believe that the terms are neutral and that Jane's sensitivity is unwarranted. But the core issue here is that Jane feels excluded, and the team had already taken steps to address her concerns. The author's continued use of those terms despite prior agreement and Jane's feedback seems to undermine that effort. The fact that other team members are taking Jane's side suggests that the author isn't the only one who needs to reflect.\n\nSo, considering that the author is aware of the harm their language causes and still chooses to use it, which goes against the team's prior resolution and Jane's explicit needs, it's likely the author is in the wrong. The answer would be A.\n"
