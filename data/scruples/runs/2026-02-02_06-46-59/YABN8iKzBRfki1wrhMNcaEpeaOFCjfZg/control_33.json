Recently we asked a girl to join our team, lets call her Jane. After match we often say stuff like \u2018well done boiz\u2019 and she told us that makes her feel like not part of the team and suggested we say something like \u2018well done team\u2019 instead. We all agreed to try, she is part of the team and as good as any of us guys. Jane has said it is difficult for a girl to play in an all male group but I don\u2019t see why as we treat her well.\n\nYesterday one guy posted in group chat that he could not attend a practice and said \u2018Have fun lads and Jane\u2019. Jane responded by telling him that was worse than just saying \u2018lads\u2019 and made her feel \u2018othered\u2019.\n\nThe group had a bit of a chat about it and I said I was gonna keep using \u2018lads\u2019 and \u2018guys\u2019 because I mean the whole team when I say that and I am not giving in to radical feminism. \n\nThe guy who started this though, said he was sorry for what he wrote and he was trying to include her and he would try to refer to team or people in future.\n\nI ought to be able to use normal words without overly sensitive people feeling hurt by it. I am surprised that some of the other guys are taking her side though.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, so I need to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. Let me start by reading through the situation again carefully.\n\nThe user is part of an online gaming team that's mostly male. They added a female player named Jane. They used terms like \"boiz\" after matches, which Jane found exclusionary. She suggested using \"well done team\" instead. The group agreed to try that. Then, a guy in the chat said \"Have fun lads and Jane,\" which Jane found even worse. The user defended using \"lads\" and \"guys,\" saying they mean the whole team and not giving in to \"radical feminism.\" The other guy apologized and said he'd try to be more inclusive. The user is surprised that others are taking Jane's side.\n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong. The options are A (yes) or B (no).\n\nFirst, let's break down the key points. The team is predominantly male, with Jane being the only female. The group made a conscious effort to adjust their language after Jane expressed discomfort with \"boiz.\" When another member used \"lads and Jane,\" Jane felt \"othered.\" The author is continuing to use \"lads\" and \"guys,\" arguing that their intention is inclusive and they don't want to give in to radical feminism. Others in the group are siding with Jane.\n\nNow, considering social dynamics and inclusivity. Words like \"lads\" and \"guys\" are often used as gender-neutral terms in casual speech, but they can have a history of being male-centric. In a mixed group where someone has already expressed discomfort, continuing to use such terms might be seen as dismissive of their feelings. The author's argument is about intent versus impact. They believe their intent is inclusive, but the impact on Jane is negative. The key here is whether intent matters more than the actual effect on others.\n\nAlso, the author's statement about not giving in to \"radical feminism\" might come off as defensive or dismissive of Jane's valid concerns. Even if the author's intent is good, the insistence on using terms that someone else finds exclusionary could be seen as not respecting their boundaries. In a team setting, especially after an agreement was made to adjust for Jane's comfort, the author's continued use of the term might be considered inconsiderate.\n\nThe other member who used \"lads and Jane\" was sorry and willing to adjust, but the author is doubling down. In group dynamics, when someone expresses that a term is hurtful, it's generally considered respectful to make an effort to change, unless there's a very good reason not to. The author's refusal might be perceived as not taking Jane's feelings seriously, even if unintentionally.\n\nSo, considering all that, the author is likely in the wrong because they're not respecting Jane's expressed discomfort, even if their intention is inclusive. The impact of their words is more important than the intent in this context. The answer would be A (Yes).\n"
