Recently we asked a girl to join our team, lets call her Jane. After match we often say stuff like \u2018well done boiz\u2019 and she told us that makes her feel like not part of the team and suggested we say something like \u2018well done team\u2019 instead. We all agreed to try, she is part of the team and as good as any of us guys. Jane has said it is difficult for a girl to play in an all male group but I don\u2019t see why as we treat her well.\n\nYesterday one guy posted in group chat that he could not attend a practice and said \u2018Have fun lads and Jane\u2019. Jane responded by telling him that was worse than just saying \u2018lads\u2019 and made her feel \u2018othered\u2019.\n\nThe group had a bit of a chat about it and I said I was gonna keep using \u2018lads\u2019 and \u2018guys\u2019 because I mean the whole team when I say that and I am not giving in to radical feminism. \n\nThe guy who started this though, said he was sorry for what he wrote and he was trying to include her and he would try to refer to team or people in future.\n\nI ought to be able to use normal words without overly sensitive people feeling hurt by it. I am surprised that some of the other guys are taking her side though.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author (AITA) is in the wrong for using terms like \"lads\" and \"guys\" in a mixed group. Jane, the girl on the team, has expressed discomfort with these terms, feeling excluded. The AITA here argues that they're using these terms to mean the whole team and that they shouldn't have to change their language because someone is \"overly sensitive.\"\n\nFirst, I need to consider Jane's perspective. She's in a predominantly male environment, and the team has already made an effort to include her by switching from \"boiz\" to \"team.\" But the term \"lads\" is still making her feel othered. Even if the author's intention is to include everyone, the impact on Jane's feelings matters. Communication is about how words are received, not just the intent behind them.\n\nThen, the author mentions that other guys are taking Jane's side, which the author finds surprising. This suggests that the team is trying to be inclusive, and the author's stance might be seen as resistant to that effort. The term \"lads\" has a gendered connotation, which might not be intentional, but it can create a sense of exclusion, especially for someone who's already in a minority in the group.\n\nThe key points here are intent vs. impact and the team's effort to be inclusive. The author might not see the issue, but if Jane and others are genuinely hurt, it's the author's responsibility to consider their words. Using \"team\" or other inclusive terms shows respect for Jane's feelings and the team's collective effort to include her. The author's dismissal of Jane's feelings as \"radical feminism\" also comes off as dismissive and not taking her concerns seriously.\n\nIn conclusion, even if the author's intention was to include everyone, the continued use of gendered terms in a mixed group where it's causing discomfort places some responsibility on the author to adjust their language. So, the answer would be A (Yes, the author is in the wrong).\n"
