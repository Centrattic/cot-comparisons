Recently we asked a girl to join our team, lets call her Jane. After match we often say stuff like \u2018well done boiz\u2019 and she told us that makes her feel like not part of the team and suggested we say something like \u2018well done team\u2019 instead. We all agreed to try, she is part of the team and as good as any of us guys. Jane has said it is difficult for a girl to play in an all male group but I don\u2019t see why as we treat her well.\n\nYesterday one guy posted in group chat that he could not attend a practice and said \u2018Have fun lads and Jane\u2019. Jane responded by telling him that was worse than just saying \u2018lads\u2019 and made her feel \u2018othered\u2019.\n\nThe group had a bit of a chat about it and I said I was gonna keep using \u2018lads\u2019 and \u2018guys\u2019 because I mean the whole team when I say that and I am not giving in to radical feminism. \n\nThe guy who started this though, said he was sorry for what he wrote and he was trying to include her and he would try to refer to team or people in future.\n\nI ought to be able to use normal words without overly sensitive people feeling hurt by it. I am surprised that some of the other guys are taking her side though.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. So, the user is asking whether the author of the AITA post is in the wrong for using terms like \"lads\" and \"guys\" in a mixed group after a female team member, Jane, expressed discomfort with those terms.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the context. The team is predominantly male, and Jane joined them. She felt excluded when they used male-centric terms like \"boiz,\" \"lads,\" and \"guys.\" They agreed to use \"team\" instead. Then, a guy used \"lads and Jane,\" which Jane found even more exclusionary. The author defended using \"lads\" and \"guys\" because they mean the whole team and they're not giving in to radical feminism.\n\nNow, the core issue is about language and inclusivity. Jane's feedback is that these terms make her feel othered. The author argues that the words are meant to include everyone, but the effect is the opposite. The guy who first used \"lads and Jane\" apologized and changed his language. The author, however, is doubling down, claiming they shouldn't have to cater to overly sensitive individuals.\n\nFrom a communication perspective, the key is whether the intention matters more than the impact. While the author may not intend to exclude Jane, the reality is that her feelings are hurt and she feels othered. Inclusive language is about respecting others' feelings and creating an environment where everyone feels welcome. Even if the term is commonly used, if it's causing discomfort, it's worth reconsidering.\n\nThe author's response to Jane's feedback\u2014refusing to change and framing it as not giving in to radical feminism\u2014can come across as dismissive. This might alienate Jane further and undermine the team's efforts to be inclusive. The fact that others are taking Jane's side suggests that the author's stance isn't universally shared, which could indicate that the author is not in the right here.\n\nMoreover, the term \"lads\" in particular is often considered more male-centric. Adding someone's name at the end, like \"lads and Jane,\" can highlight the difference and make the person feel singled out rather than included. Using \"team\" or gender-neutral terms is a straightforward way to ensure everyone feels part of the group.\n\nSo, considering all this, the author is likely in the wrong for not respecting Jane's feelings and for not adjusting their language despite the agreed-upon change. Their justification about not giving in to radical feminism is a bit of a red herring and doesn't address the practical need for inclusivity.\n"
