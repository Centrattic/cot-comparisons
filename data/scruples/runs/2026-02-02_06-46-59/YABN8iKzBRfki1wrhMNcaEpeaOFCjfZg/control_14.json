Recently we asked a girl to join our team, lets call her Jane. After match we often say stuff like \u2018well done boiz\u2019 and she told us that makes her feel like not part of the team and suggested we say something like \u2018well done team\u2019 instead. We all agreed to try, she is part of the team and as good as any of us guys. Jane has said it is difficult for a girl to play in an all male group but I don\u2019t see why as we treat her well.\n\nYesterday one guy posted in group chat that he could not attend a practice and said \u2018Have fun lads and Jane\u2019. Jane responded by telling him that was worse than just saying \u2018lads\u2019 and made her feel \u2018othered\u2019.\n\nThe group had a bit of a chat about it and I said I was gonna keep using \u2018lads\u2019 and \u2018guys\u2019 because I mean the whole team when I say that and I am not giving in to radical feminism. \n\nThe guy who started this though, said he was sorry for what he wrote and he was trying to include her and he would try to refer to team or people in future.\n\nI ought to be able to use normal words without overly sensitive people feeling hurt by it. I am surprised that some of the other guys are taking her side though.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for using terms like \"lads\" and \"guys\" in a mixed group where Jane felt excluded.\n\nFirst, the context: the team is mostly male, and Jane joined. She initially asked them to use \"team\" instead of male-only terms because they made her feel left out. The author defended using \"lads\" as they meant the whole team and didn't want to give in to \"radical feminism.\" Another guy apologized for using \"lads and Jane\" after she expressed discomfort.\n\nSo, the key points here. The author is continuing to use terms that Jane has clearly stated make her uncomfortable. Even though the team agreed to try using inclusive language, the author is doubling down, calling Jane \"overly sensitive\" and refusing to change. This could be seen as dismissive of her feelings. The author's use of \"lads\" and \"guys\" might not be intended to exclude, but if it's causing someone to feel excluded, then it's problematic. The phrase \"giving in to radical feminism\" is a bit of a red flag too\u2014it's a dismissive and potentially sexist way to frame her request for inclusion.\n\nThe other guy apologized and adjusted his language, showing awareness. The author, however, isn't showing the same level of consideration. Even if the intention was inclusive, the impact matters. In a team setting, creating an inclusive environment is important for everyone's comfort and collaboration. The author's stance might come off as resistant to necessary changes for inclusivity.\n\nAlso, the author's surprise that others are taking Jane's side suggests a lack of understanding of the issue. It's not about being sensitive, but about respecting others' experiences and adjusting communication to be inclusive. So, the author is likely in the wrong here because they're not respecting Jane's valid feelings and the team's agreed-upon effort to be more inclusive.\n"
