Recently we asked a girl to join our team, lets call her Jane. After match we often say stuff like \u2018well done boiz\u2019 and she told us that makes her feel like not part of the team and suggested we say something like \u2018well done team\u2019 instead. We all agreed to try, she is part of the team and as good as any of us guys. Jane has said it is difficult for a girl to play in an all male group but I don\u2019t see why as we treat her well.\n\nYesterday one guy posted in group chat that he could not attend a practice and said \u2018Have fun lads and Jane\u2019. Jane responded by telling him that was worse than just saying \u2018lads\u2019 and made her feel \u2018othered\u2019.\n\nThe group had a bit of a chat about it and I said I was gonna keep using \u2018lads\u2019 and \u2018guys\u2019 because I mean the whole team when I say that and I am not giving in to radical feminism. \n\nThe guy who started this though, said he was sorry for what he wrote and he was trying to include her and he would try to refer to team or people in future.\n\nI ought to be able to use normal words without overly sensitive people feeling hurt by it. I am surprised that some of the other guys are taking her side though.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation involves a mixed team where some male players use terms like \"lads\" and \"guys,\" which Jane finds exclusionary. The author defends their use of these terms, saying they mean the whole team and aren't giving in to radical feminism.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the dynamics here. Jane is part of a team that's predominantly male, and she's pointing out that the language used makes her feel excluded. The author and others have agreed to use \"team\" instead, but the author is now pushing back, insisting that their intent is inclusive. However, Jane's experience is that terms like \"lads\" and \"guys\" are gendered and exclude her, even if the speaker's intention is to include everyone.\n\nCommunication in teams relies on both intent and impact. While the author's intention might be to include Jane, the impact of using gendered language in a male-dominated group can still marginalize the female member. The key here is that Jane's feelings are valid because she's in the minority. The author's dismissal of her sensitivity as being \"overly sensitive\" or \"radical feminism\" undermines Jane's perspective and could create a hostile environment for her.\n\nThe other member who used \"lads and Jane\" apologized and agreed to change, showing awareness. The author, however, is resisting and using a combative stance. This resistance might make Jane feel that her concerns are not being heard or respected, which is important for her inclusion and the team's cohesion.\n\nIn team settings, creating an inclusive environment is crucial. The language used can affect group dynamics and individual well-being. Even if the majority feels that the terms are neutral, if a team member finds them exclusionary, the team should make an effort to adjust. The author's refusal to adapt their language despite knowing the impact on Jane suggests a lack of consideration for her experience, which can be considered wrong in this context.\n\nSo, the answer would be A (the author is in the wrong) because they are not acknowledging Jane's valid feelings and are resisting necessary changes to be more inclusive.\n"
