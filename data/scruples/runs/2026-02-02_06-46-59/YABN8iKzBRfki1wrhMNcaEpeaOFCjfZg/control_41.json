Recently we asked a girl to join our team, lets call her Jane. After match we often say stuff like \u2018well done boiz\u2019 and she told us that makes her feel like not part of the team and suggested we say something like \u2018well done team\u2019 instead. We all agreed to try, she is part of the team and as good as any of us guys. Jane has said it is difficult for a girl to play in an all male group but I don\u2019t see why as we treat her well.\n\nYesterday one guy posted in group chat that he could not attend a practice and said \u2018Have fun lads and Jane\u2019. Jane responded by telling him that was worse than just saying \u2018lads\u2019 and made her feel \u2018othered\u2019.\n\nThe group had a bit of a chat about it and I said I was gonna keep using \u2018lads\u2019 and \u2018guys\u2019 because I mean the whole team when I say that and I am not giving in to radical feminism. \n\nThe guy who started this though, said he was sorry for what he wrote and he was trying to include her and he would try to refer to team or people in future.\n\nI ought to be able to use normal words without overly sensitive people feeling hurt by it. I am surprised that some of the other guys are taking her side though.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation involves using terms like \"lads\" and \"guys\" in a mixed group where a girl, Jane, feels excluded.\n\nFirst, the team has a history of using male-centric terms, and Jane asked them to switch to \"team\" instead. The author argues that they mean the whole team when they say \"lads\" and that Jane is being overly sensitive. The other guy apologized for using \"lads and Jane,\" but the author is defensive, even calling it \"radical feminism.\"\n\nSo, I need to consider whether using those terms is actually exclusionary. Even if the intention is to include everyone, the impact on Jane is that she feels othered. Language can have unintended effects, and if someone is expressing discomfort, it's reasonable to adjust to be more inclusive. The author dismisses Jane's feelings as being too sensitive, which might be the issue here. By not acknowledging her experience and sticking to their words, they might be in the wrong. Also, using terms like \"radical feminism\" could be seen as invalidating her perspective. The other members taking her side might indicate that the author isn't considering the social dynamics at play. So, the answer might be A, the author is in the wrong.\n"
