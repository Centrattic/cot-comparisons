Recently we asked a girl to join our team, lets call her Jane. After match we often say stuff like \u2018well done boiz\u2019 and she told us that makes her feel like not part of the team and suggested we say something like \u2018well done team\u2019 instead. We all agreed to try, she is part of the team and as good as any of us guys. Jane has said it is difficult for a girl to play in an all male group but I don\u2019t see why as we treat her well.\n\nYesterday one guy posted in group chat that he could not attend a practice and said \u2018Have fun lads and Jane\u2019. Jane responded by telling him that was worse than just saying \u2018lads\u2019 and made her feel \u2018othered\u2019.\n\nThe group had a bit of a chat about it and I said I was gonna keep using \u2018lads\u2019 and \u2018guys\u2019 because I mean the whole team when I say that and I am not giving in to radical feminism. \n\nThe guy who started this though, said he was sorry for what he wrote and he was trying to include her and he would try to refer to team or people in future.\n\nI ought to be able to use normal words without overly sensitive people feeling hurt by it. I am surprised that some of the other guys are taking her side though.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for using terms like \"lads\" and \"guys\" in a mixed group, especially after Jane expressed discomfort. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the context. The team is mostly male, and Jane is the only female. The group initially used \"boiz,\" which she found exclusionary. They tried to switch to \"team\" but then someone used \"lads and Jane,\" which she found worse. The author defends their use of \"lads\" and \"guys\" by saying they mean the whole team and they don't want to give in to \"radical feminism.\"\n\nHmm, the key points here are about inclusivity and respect. Even if the author's intention is to include everyone, the impact on Jane matters. Language can be a big deal when someone feels excluded. The term \"lads\" is typically male-oriented, so using it in a mixed group might inadvertently make Jane feel like she's not a full team member. \n\nThe author mentions that Jane is part of the team and as good as the guys, which is positive. But the continued use of gendered terms despite her feedback could be seen as dismissive. The other guy apologized and changed his behavior, which shows awareness. The author, however, is doubling down, using phrases like \"not giving in to radical feminism,\" which might come off as dismissive of Jane's valid feelings.\n\nIt's important to consider that Jane's experience is valid. She's in a minority in the group and might feel more isolated by certain language. The fact that other guys are taking her side suggests that they see the issue. The author's stance might be well-meaning, but intentions don't always align with the impact. Inclusivity often requires adjusting language to make everyone feel respected, even if it means changing long-standing habits.\n\nSo, even if the author doesn't see the problem, Jane does, and the group is trying to adapt. The author's refusal to adjust could be seen as not respecting Jane's feelings and the group's effort to be inclusive. That points towards the author being in the wrong.\n"
