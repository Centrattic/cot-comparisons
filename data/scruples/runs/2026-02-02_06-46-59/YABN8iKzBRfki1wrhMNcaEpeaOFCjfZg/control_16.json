Recently we asked a girl to join our team, lets call her Jane. After match we often say stuff like \u2018well done boiz\u2019 and she told us that makes her feel like not part of the team and suggested we say something like \u2018well done team\u2019 instead. We all agreed to try, she is part of the team and as good as any of us guys. Jane has said it is difficult for a girl to play in an all male group but I don\u2019t see why as we treat her well.\n\nYesterday one guy posted in group chat that he could not attend a practice and said \u2018Have fun lads and Jane\u2019. Jane responded by telling him that was worse than just saying \u2018lads\u2019 and made her feel \u2018othered\u2019.\n\nThe group had a bit of a chat about it and I said I was gonna keep using \u2018lads\u2019 and \u2018guys\u2019 because I mean the whole team when I say that and I am not giving in to radical feminism. \n\nThe guy who started this though, said he was sorry for what he wrote and he was trying to include her and he would try to refer to team or people in future.\n\nI ought to be able to use normal words without overly sensitive people feeling hurt by it. I am surprised that some of the other guys are taking her side though.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote this is in the wrong. The situation involves a mixed team where the majority are males, and a girl named Jane joined. The team uses terms like \"boiz\" and \"lads\" which Jane finds exclusionary. The author of the post says they want to keep using \"lads\" and \"guys\" because they mean the whole team and they don't want to give in to \"radical feminism.\"\n\nFirst, I need to assess the context. The team is mostly male, and Jane is the only girl. The team initially tried to switch to more inclusive terms after Jane's feedback. However, when someone used \"lads and Jane,\" Jane felt othered again. The author is now refusing to change their language, claiming that it's a normal word and that they're not backing down. They even mention they don't want to give in to radical feminism, which sounds like a deflection.\n\nThe key points here are about inclusive language and respect for others' feelings. Even if the author's intention is to include the whole team, the words they choose are making Jane feel excluded. The fact that other team members are taking Jane's side might indicate that the author's stance isn't the only perspective. The author's comment about \"radical feminism\" could be a sign of dismissing Jane's valid concerns as overreactions rather than addressing the issue at hand.\n\nUsing terms that exclude someone, even unintentionally, can create a hostile environment. The team's initial agreement to try \"team\" shows they wanted to be inclusive. The author's refusal to adapt might be seen as not respecting Jane's experience and the team's consensus. Even if the author believes they're correct, the impact of their words matters here. The principle here is about considering others' feelings and being willing to adjust communication to be inclusive.\n\nSo, the author is likely in the wrong because they're not acknowledging Jane's valid feelings and the team's effort to be inclusive. The use of terms that have historically excluded certain groups, even if the intent is neutral, can perpetuate exclusion. The author's stance could be seen as dismissive and not taking Jane's concerns seriously, which is the crux of the issue.\n"
