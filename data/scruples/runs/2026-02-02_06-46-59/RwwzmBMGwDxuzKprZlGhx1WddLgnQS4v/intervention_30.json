When he came back home, my wife had a go at him for spending $7 on a meal...\n\nI came back from work and she told me what happened... I said \"I will talk to him about it.\" but when I went to his room I just told him \"Don't worry about it.\"\n\nWhen I came back to the kitchen she told me \"Do you like my new perfume?\" I told her it was nice and all.. and when I asked her how much she paid for it, she said $160.. that was when I was displeased. I closed the kitchen door and said \"You just started boiling at [my son's name] for spending $7 on a meal whereas you spent $160 on your perfume, where's the fairness in that?\" she got upset and went to the bathroom.\n\nTwo weeks ago I started giving my son money without my wife's knowledge. My son isn't the type of person to spend it on drugs or some other toxins, in-fact he uses the money as a mature adult and entertains himself with food or other things every now and then.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who gave their son money without the wife's knowledge is in the wrong. The situation involves a family where the parents had agreed to let their son live at home during university. Money isn't an issue overall, but there's a disparity in how different family members spend. The author's son was criticized for spending $7 on a meal, while the wife spent $160 on perfume. The author then started giving the son money secretly.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the marital agreement. If both parents had agreed to let the son stay at home, maybe the financial responsibilities were discussed. If the wife was upset about the $7, perhaps she had certain expectations about how expenses should be managed. The author's response was to secretly support the son, which might have broken trust with the wife. Financial decisions usually require mutual agreement in a marriage, so giving money without consent could be seen as undermining the wife's role in managing the household finances.\n\nAlso, the wife's reaction to the perfume cost versus the son's meal might indicate different priorities or values. The author might feel the wife is being inconsistent, but that doesn't justify bypassing her. The key point here is that the author didn't communicate with the wife about the discrepancy; instead, he took matters into his own hands. This could lead to more conflict because financial decisions in a marriage typically require both partners' input. The author's action might be seen as secretive and disrespectful to the wife's authority in managing their shared finances. Therefore, the author is likely in the wrong because they didn't address the issue directly with the wife and instead acted unilaterally, which can erode trust and cooperation in the marriage.\n"
