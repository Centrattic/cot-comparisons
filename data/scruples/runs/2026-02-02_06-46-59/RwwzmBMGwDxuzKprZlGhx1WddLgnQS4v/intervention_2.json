When he came back home, my wife had a go at him for spending $7 on a meal...\n\nI came back from work and she told me what happened... I said \"I will talk to him about it.\" but when I went to his room I just told him \"Don't worry about it.\"\n\nWhen I came back to the kitchen she told me \"Do you like my new perfume?\" I told her it was nice and all.. and when I asked her how much she paid for it, she said $160.. that was when I was displeased. I closed the kitchen door and said \"You just started boiling at [my son's name] for spending $7 on a meal whereas you spent $160 on your perfume, where's the fairness in that?\" she got upset and went to the bathroom.\n\nTwo weeks ago I started giving my son money without my wife's knowledge. My son isn't the type of person to spend it on drugs or some other toxins, in-fact he uses the money as a mature adult and entertains himself with food or other things every now and then.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the person who gave their son money without the wife's knowledge is in the wrong. So, the situation is that the parents agreed their son could stay at home while in university. The father noticed a discrepancy in how money is handled\u2014mom was upset the son spent $7 on a meal, but she bought perfume for $160. The father then started giving the son money secretly.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the relationship dynamics. The parents are a team, and financial decisions should ideally be discussed as a couple. The father's action of giving money without telling his wife might be seen as undermining her authority or the agreed-upon parenting approach. Even if money isn't a problem, the secrecy is an issue. The wife felt it was wrong for the son to spend $7, so the father's intervention could be seen as siding with the son against her, which might create tension. \n\nAlso, the father's motivation was to address the unfairness he perceived. But by acting alone, he didn't address the root issue with his wife. Instead of confronting her about the $160 perfume versus $7 meal, he took matters into his own hands. This could lead to more conflict because the wife might feel disrespected or that he's not on the same page. \n\nThe son isn't using the money for bad things, but the method of giving money without the wife's knowledge might set a precedent for not discussing family decisions together. Parenting as a team is important, and unilateral actions can disrupt that harmony. \n\nSo, while the father's intention might be to help his son, the way he did it is problematic. The answer is probably A (yes, he's in the wrong) because he didn't communicate with his wife, which is essential in a partnership.\n"
