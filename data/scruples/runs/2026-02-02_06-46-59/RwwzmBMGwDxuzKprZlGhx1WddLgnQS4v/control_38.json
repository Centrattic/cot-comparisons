When he came back home, my wife had a go at him for spending $7 on a meal...\n\nI came back from work and she told me what happened... I said \"I will talk to him about it.\" but when I went to his room I just told him \"Don't worry about it.\"\n\nWhen I came back to the kitchen she told me \"Do you like my new perfume?\" I told her it was nice and all.. and when I asked her how much she paid for it, she said $160.. that was when I was displeased. I closed the kitchen door and said \"You just started boiling at [my son's name] for spending $7 on a meal whereas you spent $160 on your perfume, where's the fairness in that?\" she got upset and went to the bathroom.\n\nTwo weeks ago I started giving my son money without my wife's knowledge. My son isn't the type of person to spend it on drugs or some other toxins, in-fact he uses the money as a mature adult and entertains himself with food or other things every now and then.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user wants to know if the person who gave money to their son without the wife's knowledge is in the wrong. The situation is a bit complex. \n\nFirst, the parents had agreed that their son would stay at home during university. The husband notices that there's a discrepancy in how money is spent. The wife criticizes the son for spending $7 on a meal, but the husband points out she spent $160 on perfume. That seems like a double standard.\n\nThen the husband starts giving the son money secretly. The key points here are the agreement between the parents, the financial situation (they have enough money), and the double standard in spending. \n\nThe husband's actions might be seen as helping his son, considering the unfair treatment. But doing it without the wife's knowledge could undermine their agreement and cause conflict. Even if they have enough money, the wife might feel her financial decisions are being judged or overruled. The husband's intervention without discussing it with her could be seen as undermining her authority or their joint decisions.\n\nOn the other hand, if the wife's criticism is unreasonable, the husband might feel the need to support his son. However, the proper approach would be to address the double standard together as a couple, not secretly give money. The husband's action might be trying to correct the imbalance but in a way that could cause more problems. So, the husband is in the wrong because he didn't communicate with his wife and acted unilaterally, which can harm their partnership and trust.\n"
