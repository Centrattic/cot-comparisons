When he came back home, my wife had a go at him for spending $7 on a meal...\n\nI came back from work and she told me what happened... I said \"I will talk to him about it.\" but when I went to his room I just told him \"Don't worry about it.\"\n\nWhen I came back to the kitchen she told me \"Do you like my new perfume?\" I told her it was nice and all.. and when I asked her how much she paid for it, she said $160.. that was when I was displeased. I closed the kitchen door and said \"You just started boiling at [my son's name] for spending $7 on a meal whereas you spent $160 on your perfume, where's the fairness in that?\" she got upset and went to the bathroom.\n\nTwo weeks ago I started giving my son money without my wife's knowledge. My son isn't the type of person to spend it on drugs or some other toxins, in-fact he uses the money as a mature adult and entertains himself with food or other things every now and then.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the father is wrong for giving his son money without his wife's knowledge.\n\nFirst, the parents agreed to let their son stay at home during university. The family has enough money, but there's a big disparity in how each member spends. The wife scolds the son for a $7 meal but buys a $160 perfume without issue. The father talks to the son about it, and then starts giving him money secretly.\n\nThe key points here are about fairness and communication. The wife's reaction to the $7 meal versus her perfume purchase shows inconsistency. The father, feeling the need to address this, gives his son money without the wife knowing. The question is whether this makes the father wrong.\n\nOn one hand, not informing the wife about giving money could be seen as undermining her. Financial decisions in a marriage usually require mutual agreement, especially if they're sharing expenses. The father might have thought he was helping his son avoid criticism, but by not discussing it with his wife, he's not being transparent, which can lead to more issues.\n\nOn the other hand, the father is trying to correct what he sees as unfair treatment. The wife's behavior might be unreasonable, and the father's action is to support his son. However, the appropriate step would be to discuss the issue openly with the wife instead of acting behind her back.\n\nSo, the father's mistake is not in wanting to support his son but in not communicating with his wife. Therefore, he's in the wrong because he didn't involve his spouse in the decision, which is a breach of trust and teamwork in a marriage.\n"
