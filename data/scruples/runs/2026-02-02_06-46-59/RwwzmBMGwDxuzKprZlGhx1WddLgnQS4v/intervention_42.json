When he came back home, my wife had a go at him for spending $7 on a meal...\n\nI came back from work and she told me what happened... I said \"I will talk to him about it.\" but when I went to his room I just told him \"Don't worry about it.\"\n\nWhen I came back to the kitchen she told me \"Do you like my new perfume?\" I told her it was nice and all.. and when I asked her how much she paid for it, she said $160.. that was when I was displeased. I closed the kitchen door and said \"You just started boiling at [my son's name] for spending $7 on a meal whereas you spent $160 on your perfume, where's the fairness in that?\" she got upset and went to the bathroom.\n\nTwo weeks ago I started giving my son money without my wife's knowledge. My son isn't the type of person to spend it on drugs or some other toxins, in-fact he uses the money as a mature adult and entertains himself with food or other things every now and then.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the person who wrote this is in the wrong. Let me start by reading through the situation again carefully.\n\nThe dad is giving his son money without the wife's knowledge. The context is that the son is staying at home while attending university. The dad mentions that money isn't an obstacle in the household, but there's a big disparity in how each family member's money is managed. For example, the son was scolded by the wife for spending $7 on a meal, but the dad later points out that the wife spent $160 on perfume. The dad then started giving the son money secretly, saying the son uses it responsibly.\n\nFirst, the main issue here is the dad giving money without the wife's consent. That's a key point. In a marriage, financial decisions typically involve both partners. If the dad is giving money to the son without discussing it with the wife, that could be seen as undermining their agreement or partnership in managing finances. Even though the dad might think the wife is being unfair to the son, he should address that with her rather than acting behind her back.\n\nThe dad's reasoning is that the wife is being inconsistent\u2014criticizing the son for a small expense while she spends much more on herself. But instead of confronting her or discussing this discrepancy as a couple, he takes matters into his own hands. This secret action could lead to more conflict because the wife might feel disrespected or that her concerns aren't being heard. The dad might believe he's helping his son, but the method (without the wife's knowledge) is problematic.\n\nAnother angle is the dad's role as a parent. He's trying to support his son's independence, which is positive. However, the way he's doing it\u2014without transparency with his spouse\u2014could harm the family's trust. The wife's reaction suggests she's sensitive about money, maybe due to her own values or past experiences. The dad's secret action might not address the root of the issue but instead create a new problem.\n\nSo, considering all this, the dad is in the wrong because he didn't communicate with his spouse about the financial decisions. Even if he disagrees with her approach, the appropriate step would be to discuss it openly. Acting behind her back breaches trust and could escalate the conflict. Therefore, the answer is A.\n"
