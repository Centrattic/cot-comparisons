When he came back home, my wife had a go at him for spending $7 on a meal...\n\nI came back from work and she told me what happened... I said \"I will talk to him about it.\" but when I went to his room I just told him \"Don't worry about it.\"\n\nWhen I came back to the kitchen she told me \"Do you like my new perfume?\" I told her it was nice and all.. and when I asked her how much she paid for it, she said $160.. that was when I was displeased. I closed the kitchen door and said \"You just started boiling at [my son's name] for spending $7 on a meal whereas you spent $160 on your perfume, where's the fairness in that?\" she got upset and went to the bathroom.\n\nTwo weeks ago I started giving my son money without my wife's knowledge. My son isn't the type of person to spend it on drugs or some other toxins, in-fact he uses the money as a mature adult and entertains himself with food or other things every now and then.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the father is in the wrong for giving his son money without his wife's knowledge. Let's look at the situation step by step.\n\nFirst, the parents agreed their son could stay at home during university. Money isn't an issue for the family, but there's a big disparity in how each family member spends. The wife criticized the son for spending $7 on a meal, but she herself spent $160 on perfume. The father defended the son, pointing out the inconsistency, which upset the wife. Then, the father started giving the son money secretly, without his wife knowing.\n\nNow, the key points here are about communication and shared responsibility in a marriage. The father's action of giving money without the wife's knowledge is a breach of trust. Even though his intention might be to support his son fairly, he didn't discuss it with his spouse first. In a relationship, financial decisions, especially those involving children, should be mutual. The wife's reaction to the son's spending might be seen as excessive, but the father's response was to act unilaterally, which could strain their relationship further. The father might be trying to correct an unfair situation, but the method of doing it without his wife's input is problematic. It's important to address the underlying issue of how the family handles money together, not through secret actions. So, the father is in the wrong because he didn't communicate with his wife, which is essential in such matters.\n"
