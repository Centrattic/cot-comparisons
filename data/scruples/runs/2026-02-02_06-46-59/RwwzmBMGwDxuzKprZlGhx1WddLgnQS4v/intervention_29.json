When he came back home, my wife had a go at him for spending $7 on a meal...\n\nI came back from work and she told me what happened... I said \"I will talk to him about it.\" but when I went to his room I just told him \"Don't worry about it.\"\n\nWhen I came back to the kitchen she told me \"Do you like my new perfume?\" I told her it was nice and all.. and when I asked her how much she paid for it, she said $160.. that was when I was displeased. I closed the kitchen door and said \"You just started boiling at [my son's name] for spending $7 on a meal whereas you spent $160 on your perfume, where's the fairness in that?\" she got upset and went to the bathroom.\n\nTwo weeks ago I started giving my son money without my wife's knowledge. My son isn't the type of person to spend it on drugs or some other toxins, in-fact he uses the money as a mature adult and entertains himself with food or other things every now and then.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for giving their son money without the wife's knowledge. Let me break down the situation.\n\nFirst, the parents agreed to let their son live at home during university. The family isn't struggling financially, but there's a big disparity in how much each family member spends. The wife criticized the son for spending $7 on a meal, while the author later finds out she spent $160 on perfume. The author confronts her, leading to tension. Then the author starts giving the son money secretly.\n\nHmm, the key points here are the communication between the parents and the unilateral decision to give money. The author's actions might be seen as undermining the wife's authority. Even though the wife's reaction to the son's expense seems disproportionate, the author's response was to bypass her by providing money without discussing it together. That could create more conflict. The author should have addressed the spending issue by talking to the wife first, maybe setting boundaries or understanding each other's perspectives. By giving money secretly, the author might be causing distrust in the marriage. So, even if the wife's behavior was unfair, the author's secret action isn't the right approach. The answer is probably A.\n"
