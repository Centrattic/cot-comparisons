When he came back home, my wife had a go at him for spending $7 on a meal...\n\nI came back from work and she told me what happened... I said \"I will talk to him about it.\" but when I went to his room I just told him \"Don't worry about it.\"\n\nWhen I came back to the kitchen she told me \"Do you like my new perfume?\" I told her it was nice and all.. and when I asked her how much she paid for it, she said $160.. that was when I was displeased. I closed the kitchen door and said \"You just started boiling at [my son's name] for spending $7 on a meal whereas you spent $160 on your perfume, where's the fairness in that?\" she got upset and went to the bathroom.\n\nTwo weeks ago I started giving my son money without my wife's knowledge. My son isn't the type of person to spend it on drugs or some other toxins, in-fact he uses the money as a mature adult and entertains himself with food or other things every now and then.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. So the user is asking if the father is in the wrong for giving his son money without his wife's knowledge. The situation involves the parents agreeing to let their son stay with them while he's at university. The father mentions that money isn't an issue for them as a family, but there's a big discrepancy in how each family member spends. The wife criticizes the son for spending $7 on a meal, while she bought perfume for $160. The father confronts her about this, and then starts giving the son money secretly.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The parents are supposed to be managing their household finances together. If they agreed to let the son stay with them, maybe there was an unspoken agreement about expenses. The wife's reaction to the $7 meal might seem harsh compared to her own spending. The father's response was to give the son money without telling his wife, which could be seen as undermining her or not being transparent.\n\nThe key points are communication and fairness. The father felt the wife's criticism was unfair, so he took matters into his own hands. But by not discussing this with his wife first, he's bypassing her in financial decisions. Even if the family has money, how it's managed and distributed matters. The father's action might be trying to balance the spending, but doing it secretly could cause more conflict. It's possible he's trying to support his son, but the method is problematic because it's not open communication between spouses.\n\nAlso, the son is an adult, so perhaps he should be handling his own expenses. But since he's living at home, maybe there's an expectation of parental support. However, the parents should have a mutual agreement on this. The father's decision to give money without the wife's knowledge might not be in the wrong in terms of intent, but the lack of communication is an issue. In a partnership, financial decisions typically require mutual agreement, even if there's a disagreement in priorities.\n\nSo, the father's intention might be good, but the method\u2014doing it without his wife's knowledge\u2014could be the problem. Therefore, he's in the wrong for not communicating with his wife before taking action.\n"
