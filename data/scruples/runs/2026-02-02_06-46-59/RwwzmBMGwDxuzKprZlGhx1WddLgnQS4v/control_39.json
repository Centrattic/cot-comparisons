When he came back home, my wife had a go at him for spending $7 on a meal...\n\nI came back from work and she told me what happened... I said \"I will talk to him about it.\" but when I went to his room I just told him \"Don't worry about it.\"\n\nWhen I came back to the kitchen she told me \"Do you like my new perfume?\" I told her it was nice and all.. and when I asked her how much she paid for it, she said $160.. that was when I was displeased. I closed the kitchen door and said \"You just started boiling at [my son's name] for spending $7 on a meal whereas you spent $160 on your perfume, where's the fairness in that?\" she got upset and went to the bathroom.\n\nTwo weeks ago I started giving my son money without my wife's knowledge. My son isn't the type of person to spend it on drugs or some other toxins, in-fact he uses the money as a mature adult and entertains himself with food or other things every now and then.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the father is in the wrong for giving his son money without the wife's knowledge. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the family situation: they're staying at home while attending university. Money isn't tight overall, but there's a big discrepancy in how different family members spend. The wife criticized the son for $7 on a meal, but the father gave her a compliment when she spent $160 on perfume. The father felt this was unfair and decided to secretly give his son money, knowing the son is responsible with it.\n\nNow, considering the dynamics. The father and wife had agreed to let the son live with them, so maybe there were unspoken financial expectations. The father's action of giving money without the wife's knowledge might be seen as undermining her authority or the agreement. Even if he thought the wife was being unreasonable, bypassing her could damage trust. The wife might feel disrespected or that the father is taking sides. Parenting decisions, especially financial ones, usually require mutual agreement in a marriage. The father's justification is about fairness, but the method of handling it without communication is a problem. So, even if the wife's criticism was harsh, the father's solution was not collaborative. That's likely where he's in the wrong.\n"
