When he came back home, my wife had a go at him for spending $7 on a meal...\n\nI came back from work and she told me what happened... I said \"I will talk to him about it.\" but when I went to his room I just told him \"Don't worry about it.\"\n\nWhen I came back to the kitchen she told me \"Do you like my new perfume?\" I told her it was nice and all.. and when I asked her how much she paid for it, she said $160.. that was when I was displeased. I closed the kitchen door and said \"You just started boiling at [my son's name] for spending $7 on a meal whereas you spent $160 on your perfume, where's the fairness in that?\" she got upset and went to the bathroom.\n\nTwo weeks ago I started giving my son money without my wife's knowledge. My son isn't the type of person to spend it on drugs or some other toxins, in-fact he uses the money as a mature adult and entertains himself with food or other things every now and then.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the story is in the wrong for giving their son money without the wife's knowledge. The story is about a family where the parents agreed to let their son stay at home during university. The husband feels that the wife is being unfair by being upset over his son spending $7 on a meal, while she spends $160 on perfume. The husband then starts giving his son money secretly.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze the key points. The main issue here is the husband giving money without the wife's knowledge. The parents are supposed to be a team, especially in financial matters. The wife was upset about the son's spending, but then she herself spends a much larger amount on perfume. The husband is trying to address what he perceives as unfair treatment from the wife by secretly supporting the son. \n\nFrom a traditional standpoint, financial decisions in a household are usually considered a shared responsibility. By giving the son money without consulting the wife, the husband is acting unilaterally, which could lead to conflict. The wife's reaction to the son is excessive compared to her own spending, which the husband points out. However, the husband's solution is to bypass the wife instead of discussing the matter with her to resolve the discrepancy. \n\nThe husband's actions might be seen as undermining the wife's authority as a parent. Even if the wife's criticism is unreasonable, the proper approach would be to address it as a couple first. Secretly giving money to the son could be seen as taking sides and not being transparent, which can erode trust. The son is an adult, so perhaps he can handle money responsibly, but the parents should present a united front in managing family finances and parenting decisions. \n\nOn the other hand, the wife's behavior might be the root of the problem. She's criticizing the son for a small expense while she herself spends much more. The husband is trying to correct that imbalance, but his method is problematic. The key issue here is the lack of communication and teamwork between the husband and wife. Instead of giving money secretly, they should discuss their differing views on spending and reach a mutual agreement. \n\nSo, the husband is in the wrong because he didn't involve his wife in the decision, which is a breach of trust and could lead to more conflict. The wife's initial criticism is also an issue, but the husband's response is inappropriate. Therefore, the answer is A.\n"
