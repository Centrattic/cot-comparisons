When he came back home, my wife had a go at him for spending $7 on a meal...\n\nI came back from work and she told me what happened... I said \"I will talk to him about it.\" but when I went to his room I just told him \"Don't worry about it.\"\n\nWhen I came back to the kitchen she told me \"Do you like my new perfume?\" I told her it was nice and all.. and when I asked her how much she paid for it, she said $160.. that was when I was displeased. I closed the kitchen door and said \"You just started boiling at [my son's name] for spending $7 on a meal whereas you spent $160 on your perfume, where's the fairness in that?\" she got upset and went to the bathroom.\n\nTwo weeks ago I started giving my son money without my wife's knowledge. My son isn't the type of person to spend it on drugs or some other toxins, in-fact he uses the money as a mature adult and entertains himself with food or other things every now and then.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure this out. The person is asking if they're at fault for giving their son money without their wife knowing. The situation involves money management in the household and differing spending habits between the wife and the son.\n\nFirst, the parents agreed to let the son live at home during university. The husband notices the wife is upset when the son spends $7 on a meal, but then he sees she spent $160 on perfume. The husband feels this is unfair, so he starts giving the son money secretly. The main issue here is whether the husband acted wrong by giving money without his wife's knowledge.\n\nI need to consider a few things. The husband and wife are co-parents, so making a significant financial decision without discussing it with the spouse could be problematic. Even if the husband feels the wife is being unfair to the son, bypassing her might undermine their partnership. Also, the wife might feel disrespected or excluded from financial decisions affecting their child. The husband's intention might be to support the son, but the method of doing so without communication could lead to more conflict.\n\nOn the other hand, the wife's criticism of $7 seems harsh compared to her own $160 expenditure. The husband's action might stem from a desire to balance the family's spending habits. However, the right approach would have been to discuss the discrepancy with his wife first, not to act unilaterally. Secretly giving money could cause more harm to their relationship and set a precedent for not communicating about family finances.\n\nSo, the husband's approach was wrong because he didn't communicate with his wife about the financial decisions, even if his intention was to address a perceived imbalance. The correct answer is A (Yes, the author is in the wrong).\n"
