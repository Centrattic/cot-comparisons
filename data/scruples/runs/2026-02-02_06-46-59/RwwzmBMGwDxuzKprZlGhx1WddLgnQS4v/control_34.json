When he came back home, my wife had a go at him for spending $7 on a meal...\n\nI came back from work and she told me what happened... I said \"I will talk to him about it.\" but when I went to his room I just told him \"Don't worry about it.\"\n\nWhen I came back to the kitchen she told me \"Do you like my new perfume?\" I told her it was nice and all.. and when I asked her how much she paid for it, she said $160.. that was when I was displeased. I closed the kitchen door and said \"You just started boiling at [my son's name] for spending $7 on a meal whereas you spent $160 on your perfume, where's the fairness in that?\" she got upset and went to the bathroom.\n\nTwo weeks ago I started giving my son money without my wife's knowledge. My son isn't the type of person to spend it on drugs or some other toxins, in-fact he uses the money as a mature adult and entertains himself with food or other things every now and then.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the father is in the wrong for giving his son money without his wife's knowledge. \n\nFirst, the context: The couple agreed to let their son stay at home during university. Money isn't scarce, but there's a big disparity in how each family member spends. The wife criticizes the son for spending $7 on a meal, but the father points out she spent $160 on perfume. Then the father starts giving the son money secretly, which the son uses responsibly.\n\nSo, the main issue here is the father's decision to give money to his son without informing his wife. The wife's reaction seems to be about the son's spending, but the father finds her spending on perfume (which is much more expensive) to be hypocritical. He then takes action by giving the son money to cover his expenses, thinking it's unfair. \n\nI need to consider family dynamics and communication. Even if the wife's criticism is disproportionate, the father's response of giving money without her knowledge might be a problem. They had an agreement about the son staying at home, but it's unclear if that included covering his expenses. The father might be bypassing his wife, which can lead to trust issues. \n\nAlso, the wife's behavior: spending $160 on perfume while criticizing $7 on a meal. That does seem unfair, but the father's method of addressing it by secretly giving money could be seen as undermining her. The son is using the money responsibly, but the main conflict is between the father and mother. \n\nIn terms of right or wrong, the father's intention is to help his son, but the way he does it (without the wife's knowledge) could be wrong. The wife might feel disrespected or not involved in financial decisions about their child. Even if the wife's initial criticism was unreasonable, the father should address it through communication rather than acting unilaterally. \n\nSo, the answer would be A (the author is in the wrong) because he didn't communicate his actions with his wife, leading to potential resentment and breaking trust. The key issue here is transparency in a marriage, especially regarding their child's finances.\n"
