When he came back home, my wife had a go at him for spending $7 on a meal...\n\nI came back from work and she told me what happened... I said \"I will talk to him about it.\" but when I went to his room I just told him \"Don't worry about it.\"\n\nWhen I came back to the kitchen she told me \"Do you like my new perfume?\" I told her it was nice and all.. and when I asked her how much she paid for it, she said $160.. that was when I was displeased. I closed the kitchen door and said \"You just started boiling at [my son's name] for spending $7 on a meal whereas you spent $160 on your perfume, where's the fairness in that?\" she got upset and went to the bathroom.\n\nTwo weeks ago I started giving my son money without my wife's knowledge. My son isn't the type of person to spend it on drugs or some other toxins, in-fact he uses the money as a mature adult and entertains himself with food or other things every now and then.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The person is asking if they're in the wrong for giving their son money without their wife's knowledge. The situation is that they live with their son while he's in university, and there's a perceived discrepancy in how money is spent. The wife criticized the son for spending $7 on a meal, but then the husband found out she spent $160 on perfume. Because of that, he started giving their son money secretly.\n\nFirst, I need to consider family dynamics and communication. When a couple shares a household, financial decisions usually require mutual agreement. The husband gave the son money without the wife knowing, which could be seen as undermining her authority or creating resentment. Even if the husband felt the wife was being unfair, the right approach would be to address it with her, not bypass her by giving the son money. This could lead to more conflict, especially if the wife later finds out and feels disrespected.\n\nAlso, the husband's reaction to the wife's perfume purchase might indicate a lack of trust in her judgment. But instead of discussing it openly, he chose to take matters into his own hands. That's a problem because it doesn't resolve the underlying issue and could damage the marriage. The wife might feel that her concerns are dismissed, and the husband's secret actions could erode trust. \n\nOn the other hand, the husband's intention was to support their son, which is understandable. But the method was flawed. Open communication is key in such situations. The husband should have talked to his wife about the discrepancy in spending and worked together to find a solution. Giving the son money without her knowledge might cause more harm, especially if it leads to a breakdown in trust.\n\nSo, while the husband's motive was good, the action was wrong because it violated the principle of transparency and mutual decision-making in a marriage. Therefore, the answer is A, the author is in the wrong.\n"
