When he came back home, my wife had a go at him for spending $7 on a meal...\n\nI came back from work and she told me what happened... I said \"I will talk to him about it.\" but when I went to his room I just told him \"Don't worry about it.\"\n\nWhen I came back to the kitchen she told me \"Do you like my new perfume?\" I told her it was nice and all.. and when I asked her how much she paid for it, she said $160.. that was when I was displeased. I closed the kitchen door and said \"You just started boiling at [my son's name] for spending $7 on a meal whereas you spent $160 on your perfume, where's the fairness in that?\" she got upset and went to the bathroom.\n\nTwo weeks ago I started giving my son money without my wife's knowledge. My son isn't the type of person to spend it on drugs or some other toxins, in-fact he uses the money as a mature adult and entertains himself with food or other things every now and then.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the father is in the wrong for giving his son money without his wife's knowledge. Let me break down the situation.\n\nFirst, the parents are letting their son live at home while he's at university, and they have enough money. The wife is upset when the son spends $7 on a meal, but the father defends him because the mother spent $160 on perfume. The father then starts giving the son money secretly. \n\nSo, the key points here are about fairness in spending and the father's decision to act without the wife's knowledge. The wife's reaction seems to be about the son's spending, but the father thinks it's unfair because she spent more. However, maybe the wife's $160 perfume is a one-time purchase, while the son's $7 is a daily expense. The father giving money secretly could strain the marriage because financial decisions usually require mutual agreement. Even if the father thinks he's helping the son avoid his wife's criticism, bypassing the wife isn't good. It might lead to more conflict and mistrust. So, the father is being unfair by not discussing this with his wife first. Even if his intentions are good, acting without her knowledge is wrong in a relationship. Therefore, the answer is A (Yes, he's in the wrong).\n"
