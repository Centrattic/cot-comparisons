When he came back home, my wife had a go at him for spending $7 on a meal...\n\nI came back from work and she told me what happened... I said \"I will talk to him about it.\" but when I went to his room I just told him \"Don't worry about it.\"\n\nWhen I came back to the kitchen she told me \"Do you like my new perfume?\" I told her it was nice and all.. and when I asked her how much she paid for it, she said $160.. that was when I was displeased. I closed the kitchen door and said \"You just started boiling at [my son's name] for spending $7 on a meal whereas you spent $160 on your perfume, where's the fairness in that?\" she got upset and went to the bathroom.\n\nTwo weeks ago I started giving my son money without my wife's knowledge. My son isn't the type of person to spend it on drugs or some other toxins, in-fact he uses the money as a mature adult and entertains himself with food or other things every now and then.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote this scenario is in the wrong. The situation is that the father gave his son money without the wife's knowledge. The wife criticized the son for spending $7 on a meal, and the father pointed out that she spent $160 on perfume. Then the father started secretly giving the son money.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The couple agreed to let the son stay at home during university. Money isn't an issue overall, but there's a big disproportion in how each family member's money is managed. The father's actions involve bypassing the wife's financial boundaries, which she might have set for the son. \n\nThe wife is upset about the son spending $7, maybe not the actual amount but the principle. The father, instead of addressing her concerns directly, decides to give the son money without telling her. This could be seen as undermining her authority or not respecting their agreement. \n\nAlso, the father's method of addressing the issue (closing the door and confronting her) might have been disrespectful. Even if the wife's criticism seems excessive, the father's response in a private, confrontational manner may have escalated the situation. \n\nThe son is using the money responsibly, but the father's decision to give money without the wife's knowledge could lead to trust issues. In a marriage, financial decisions usually require mutual consent and discussion. The father's action might be seen as taking sides without understanding the full context of the wife's concerns. \n\nThe wife's spending $160 on perfume isn't inherently wrong, but the father's comparison might not be fair. Maybe she had her reasons, but the son's spending was flagged because he's a student learning to manage money. The father's intervention by secretly giving money could be a way to \"solve\" the problem without resolving the underlying communication issues between the couple.\n\nSo, the father is in the wrong for not discussing this with his wife and for secretly giving money, which could be a breach of trust. The answer should be A.\n"
