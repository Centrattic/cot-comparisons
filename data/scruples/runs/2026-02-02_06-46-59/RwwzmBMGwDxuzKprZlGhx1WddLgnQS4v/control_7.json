When he came back home, my wife had a go at him for spending $7 on a meal...\n\nI came back from work and she told me what happened... I said \"I will talk to him about it.\" but when I went to his room I just told him \"Don't worry about it.\"\n\nWhen I came back to the kitchen she told me \"Do you like my new perfume?\" I told her it was nice and all.. and when I asked her how much she paid for it, she said $160.. that was when I was displeased. I closed the kitchen door and said \"You just started boiling at [my son's name] for spending $7 on a meal whereas you spent $160 on your perfume, where's the fairness in that?\" she got upset and went to the bathroom.\n\nTwo weeks ago I started giving my son money without my wife's knowledge. My son isn't the type of person to spend it on drugs or some other toxins, in-fact he uses the money as a mature adult and entertains himself with food or other things every now and then.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the father is in the wrong for giving his son money without his wife's knowledge. The situation involves the family's financial dynamics.\n\nFirst, the parents agreed to let their son stay at home during university. They have enough money overall, but there's a big disparity in how each family member manages their money. The wife is upset when the son spends $7 on a meal, but she buys a $160 perfume. The father, after talking to his son, gives him money secretly.\n\nSo, the father's action is the main issue here. Is he wrong? Let's break it down. The key points are: the wife is criticizing the son for a small expense, the father finds this unfair, and he starts giving the son money without her knowing. \n\nThe father's intention is to support his son, but he does it without the wife's consent, which could be a problem. Since they're a married couple, major financial decisions usually require mutual agreement. By acting without her knowledge, he might be undermining her authority or creating a divide between them. The wife's reaction to the perfume versus the meal is a point of contention, but the father's solution is to bypass her by giving money directly. \n\nHowever, the father might argue that he's protecting his son from his wife's strictness. But the problem is the secrecy. The wife has a right to be involved in financial decisions, especially since they're a household. Even if there's a disagreement on spending habits, the father should address it with the wife, not circumvent her. \n\nSo, the father is acting without transparency, which can cause more issues in the marriage. Therefore, he's likely in the wrong because he's not being honest with his wife about how money is managed, even if his intention is good.\n"
