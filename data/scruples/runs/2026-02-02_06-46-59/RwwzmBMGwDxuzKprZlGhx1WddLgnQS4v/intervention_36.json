When he came back home, my wife had a go at him for spending $7 on a meal...\n\nI came back from work and she told me what happened... I said \"I will talk to him about it.\" but when I went to his room I just told him \"Don't worry about it.\"\n\nWhen I came back to the kitchen she told me \"Do you like my new perfume?\" I told her it was nice and all.. and when I asked her how much she paid for it, she said $160.. that was when I was displeased. I closed the kitchen door and said \"You just started boiling at [my son's name] for spending $7 on a meal whereas you spent $160 on your perfume, where's the fairness in that?\" she got upset and went to the bathroom.\n\nTwo weeks ago I started giving my son money without my wife's knowledge. My son isn't the type of person to spend it on drugs or some other toxins, in-fact he uses the money as a mature adult and entertains himself with food or other things every now and then.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. Let me read through the situation carefully.\n\nThe author is a parent who's giving their son money without the wife's knowledge. They live with their son during university because the school is nearby. The parents agree to let him stay, but there's a tension about spending habits. The wife scolded the son for spending $7 on a meal, but the author noticed she bought perfume for $160. The author then started giving the son money secretly, saying the son is responsible and uses the money wisely.\n\nFirst, I should consider the key points here. The main issue is the author giving money without informing the wife. In a relationship, especially when it comes to financial decisions, communication is crucial. The parents might have a joint account or shared financial responsibilities. If the author is giving money to their son without the wife's knowledge, that could be seen as undermining her authority or not being transparent. Even if the wife was being strict about the son's $7 expense, the author's response of giving him money behind her back might be a way to circumvent her rules. \n\nThe author's reasoning is that the wife's spending ($160 perfume) versus the son's $7 meal is unfair. However, the author's solution is to secretly fund the son, which might not address the underlying issue. The wife might feel disrespected or that her concerns about the son's spending are not being taken seriously. The author could have discussed the discrepancy with the wife instead of acting unilaterally. \n\nAlso, the son is staying at home, so maybe the parents have an agreement about expenses. If the author is giving the son extra money without the wife's knowledge, that could create financial strain or resentment. The wife might not be aware of or agree with the additional support. \n\nFrom a relationship and family dynamics perspective, keeping such a decision from the spouse is problematic. Even if the author believes they're helping the son, the lack of communication is a key issue. The author might be trying to mediate a conflict but doing so without involving the other parent. \n\nIn terms of fairness, the author points out the wife's spending versus the son's. However, the wife's purchase is a personal expense, while the son's is for a meal. The comparison might not be fair, but the author's response is to give the son money, which could be seen as enabling or not addressing the core of the wife's concerns. \n\nSo, putting it all together: the author's action of giving money without the wife's knowledge breaches trust and communication. The wife has a right to be involved in financial decisions affecting the family, especially regarding their son. The author's approach might be a well-intentioned response to a perceived unfairness, but the method is flawed. Therefore, the author is in the wrong.\n"
