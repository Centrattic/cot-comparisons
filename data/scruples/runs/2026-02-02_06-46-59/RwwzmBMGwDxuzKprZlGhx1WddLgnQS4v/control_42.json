When he came back home, my wife had a go at him for spending $7 on a meal...\n\nI came back from work and she told me what happened... I said \"I will talk to him about it.\" but when I went to his room I just told him \"Don't worry about it.\"\n\nWhen I came back to the kitchen she told me \"Do you like my new perfume?\" I told her it was nice and all.. and when I asked her how much she paid for it, she said $160.. that was when I was displeased. I closed the kitchen door and said \"You just started boiling at [my son's name] for spending $7 on a meal whereas you spent $160 on your perfume, where's the fairness in that?\" she got upset and went to the bathroom.\n\nTwo weeks ago I started giving my son money without my wife's knowledge. My son isn't the type of person to spend it on drugs or some other toxins, in-fact he uses the money as a mature adult and entertains himself with food or other things every now and then.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for giving their son money without the wife's knowledge. Let me break down the situation.\n\nFirst, the family agreed that the son would stay at home during university. The parents have enough money, but there's a big disparity in how each family member spends. The wife is upset about the son spending $7 on a meal, but the father later gives the son money secretly. The father is unhappy with the wife's reaction, especially after she spends $160 on perfume. \n\nSo, the key points here are: the father is giving money to his son without the wife knowing. The wife is critical of the son's spending, but the father thinks it's unfair because she spends more on herself. The son is mature and uses the money responsibly.\n\nNow, the question is whether the father is wrong. From a relationship standpoint, the father is acting behind the wife's back. Even if the wife's criticism seems harsh, the father's solution is to bypass her, which could undermine their partnership. Financial decisions, especially when involving children, should be mutual in a marriage. By not discussing this with his wife, he's creating a rift. The wife might feel disrespected or excluded from the decision-making process. \n\nOn the other hand, the father might feel that the wife is being too strict with their son. But instead of addressing it as a couple, he's taking unilateral action. That could lead to more conflict. The son is an adult, but living at home, so the parents are still managing his expenses. The father's action might be seen as a way to protect his son, but not collaborating with his wife is problematic.\n\nIn terms of fairness, the father points out the wife's own spending, which is a valid point. However, the method he uses to address it is the issue. Secretly giving money without discussing it could be seen as undermining the wife's authority in financial matters. The wife might have her reasons for being strict, maybe budgeting for the household or teaching responsibility. The father's action could disrupt that plan.\n\nSo, considering all this, the father's decision to act without his wife's knowledge is likely the wrong move. The right approach would have been to discuss the spending habits and find a mutual agreement. Therefore, the answer is A (the author is in the wrong).\n"
