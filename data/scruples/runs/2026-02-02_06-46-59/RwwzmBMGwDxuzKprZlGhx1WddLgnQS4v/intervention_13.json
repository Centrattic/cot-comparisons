When he came back home, my wife had a go at him for spending $7 on a meal...\n\nI came back from work and she told me what happened... I said \"I will talk to him about it.\" but when I went to his room I just told him \"Don't worry about it.\"\n\nWhen I came back to the kitchen she told me \"Do you like my new perfume?\" I told her it was nice and all.. and when I asked her how much she paid for it, she said $160.. that was when I was displeased. I closed the kitchen door and said \"You just started boiling at [my son's name] for spending $7 on a meal whereas you spent $160 on your perfume, where's the fairness in that?\" she got upset and went to the bathroom.\n\nTwo weeks ago I started giving my son money without my wife's knowledge. My son isn't the type of person to spend it on drugs or some other toxins, in-fact he uses the money as a mature adult and entertains himself with food or other things every now and then.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong. The situation involves a parent giving their son money without the spouse's knowledge. Let me break it down.\n\nFirst, the parents agreed to let their son stay at home during university. The family is described as not having financial issues, but there's a big discrepancy in how each family member spends money. The wife criticizes the son for spending $7 on a meal, but then the husband finds out she spent $160 on perfume. He takes that as an example of unfairness and starts giving the son money without telling the wife.\n\nThe user thinks the author is in the wrong. Let me consider the key points. The husband gave money without the wife's knowledge. Even though they're not poor, financial decisions in a marriage usually require mutual agreement, especially when involving children. By secretly giving money, the husband might be undermining the wife's role in managing finances or the household's agreed-upon budget. Also, the wife's criticism of the son's spending versus her own spending on perfume could indicate different priorities, but that doesn't justify the husband acting unilaterally. The secrecy is a big factor here. Even if the husband believed he was being fair, not discussing it with his wife first likely caused conflict and mistrust. So, the answer would be A, the author is in the wrong.\n"
