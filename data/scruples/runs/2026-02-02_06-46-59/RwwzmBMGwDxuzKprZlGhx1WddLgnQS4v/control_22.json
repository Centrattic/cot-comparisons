When he came back home, my wife had a go at him for spending $7 on a meal...\n\nI came back from work and she told me what happened... I said \"I will talk to him about it.\" but when I went to his room I just told him \"Don't worry about it.\"\n\nWhen I came back to the kitchen she told me \"Do you like my new perfume?\" I told her it was nice and all.. and when I asked her how much she paid for it, she said $160.. that was when I was displeased. I closed the kitchen door and said \"You just started boiling at [my son's name] for spending $7 on a meal whereas you spent $160 on your perfume, where's the fairness in that?\" she got upset and went to the bathroom.\n\nTwo weeks ago I started giving my son money without my wife's knowledge. My son isn't the type of person to spend it on drugs or some other toxins, in-fact he uses the money as a mature adult and entertains himself with food or other things every now and then.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, so the user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. Let's break it down.\n\nThe situation is about a parent giving their son money without the spouse's knowledge. The key points here are the family's financial dynamics and how each person uses money. The husband and wife have different approaches to spending. The wife criticizes the son for spending $7 on a meal, but the husband notices she spends $160 on perfume. He then gives the son money secretly.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the marital agreement. If the couple agreed to let the son stay at home, maybe there's an unspoken understanding about financial support. But the husband is giving money without the wife's knowledge, which could be a breach of trust. Even though they have enough money, the husband's action might be seen as undermining the wife's authority, especially if they manage finances jointly.\n\nThe wife's reaction to the son's $7 meal versus her own $160 perfume might indicate different priorities or values. The husband points out the inconsistency, which is valid. However, the way he addresses it by secretly giving money to the son could be problematic. It might create tension between the couple, as the wife isn't involved in this decision. Financial decisions in a marriage usually require mutual consent, even if they have separate accounts. The husband's action could be seen as deceptive, which is wrong regardless of the intention.\n\nAlso, the son is an adult, so giving him money for his own use might be a good idea, but doing so without the spouse's knowledge could lead to more conflict. The husband should have discussed this with his wife to align their approach to supporting their son. The fact that the wife is upset and went to the bathroom after the argument suggests that there's existing tension, and the husband's secret action might exacerbate it.\n\nSo, even though the husband's intention was to support his son and address the spending disparity, the method he used (without the wife's knowledge) is likely wrong. The answer would be A (Yes, the author is in the wrong) because acting without the spouse's knowledge in financial matters can damage trust and marital harmony.\n"
