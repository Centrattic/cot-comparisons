When he came back home, my wife had a go at him for spending $7 on a meal...\n\nI came back from work and she told me what happened... I said \"I will talk to him about it.\" but when I went to his room I just told him \"Don't worry about it.\"\n\nWhen I came back to the kitchen she told me \"Do you like my new perfume?\" I told her it was nice and all.. and when I asked her how much she paid for it, she said $160.. that was when I was displeased. I closed the kitchen door and said \"You just started boiling at [my son's name] for spending $7 on a meal whereas you spent $160 on your perfume, where's the fairness in that?\" she got upset and went to the bathroom.\n\nTwo weeks ago I started giving my son money without my wife's knowledge. My son isn't the type of person to spend it on drugs or some other toxins, in-fact he uses the money as a mature adult and entertains himself with food or other things every now and then.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the father is in the wrong for giving his son money without his wife's knowledge.\n\nFirst, the family agreed that the son would stay at home while in university. The parents have enough money, but there's a disparity in how each family member is treated. The wife criticizes the son for spending $7 on a meal, but then the father notices she spends $160 on perfume. The father feels this is unfair, so he starts giving the son money secretly to balance things out.\n\nThe key points here are about fairness in financial treatment within the family. The father thinks his wife is being inconsistent or overly critical of the son's spending compared to her own. By giving the son money without the wife's knowledge, he's trying to address what he perceives as unfairness. However, the method he used\u2014without informing his wife\u2014could be problematic because it undermines their partnership. Financial decisions, especially involving children, should ideally be mutual. The father's action might be well-intentioned, but bypassing his wife's input could lead to trust issues. The wife's reaction suggests she feels disrespected or that her concerns are being dismissed. The father's solution (secretly funding the son) might not address the root cause, which is the communication and agreement on financial boundaries within the family. So, while the father's intention might be to help, the approach is flawed because it's unilateral and could cause more conflict. Therefore, the answer would be A, the father is in the wrong because he didn't address the issue through open communication with his wife.\n"
