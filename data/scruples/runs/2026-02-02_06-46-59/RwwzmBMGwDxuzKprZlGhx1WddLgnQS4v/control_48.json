When he came back home, my wife had a go at him for spending $7 on a meal...\n\nI came back from work and she told me what happened... I said \"I will talk to him about it.\" but when I went to his room I just told him \"Don't worry about it.\"\n\nWhen I came back to the kitchen she told me \"Do you like my new perfume?\" I told her it was nice and all.. and when I asked her how much she paid for it, she said $160.. that was when I was displeased. I closed the kitchen door and said \"You just started boiling at [my son's name] for spending $7 on a meal whereas you spent $160 on your perfume, where's the fairness in that?\" she got upset and went to the bathroom.\n\nTwo weeks ago I started giving my son money without my wife's knowledge. My son isn't the type of person to spend it on drugs or some other toxins, in-fact he uses the money as a mature adult and entertains himself with food or other things every now and then.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the story is at fault. The situation involves a father giving money to his son without his wife's knowledge. Let me break down the key points.\n\nFirst, the parents agreed to let their son stay at home during university. The father mentions that money isn't an issue for the household, but there's a big disparity in how each family member spends. The mother criticizes the son for spending $7 on a meal, while the father later gives the son money secretly after the mom spends $160 on perfume.\n\nThe father's reasoning is that he's helping the son, who uses the money responsibly. But he did this without his wife's knowledge. The main question is whether the father is in the wrong.\n\nFrom a relationship perspective, trust and transparency are important. By giving money to the son without his wife knowing, the father might be undermining their agreement. Even though his intention is good, not discussing it with his wife could lead to further conflict. The wife was already upset about the son's spending, so the father's action might be seen as taking sides without communication.\n\nAlso, the father's reaction to the wife's perfume purchase might have caused tension. By pointing out the discrepancy, he could have made the wife feel defensive. Then, giving money secretly might be a way to bypass the disagreement, but it's not addressing the root issue of how they manage finances as a family.\n\nIn terms of fairness, the father is trying to balance the son's spending, but the method of doing it without the wife's knowledge could be problematic. It's possible that the wife has valid reasons for her concerns, and the father's action might not be addressing those reasons. The key issue here is the lack of communication and mutual decision-making in their household's financial matters.\n\nSo, even though the father's intentions are good, the act of giving money without his wife's knowledge is where he might be at fault. It's about respecting each other's perspectives and working together rather than making unilateral decisions. Therefore, the answer would be A, the author is in the wrong.\n"
