When he came back home, my wife had a go at him for spending $7 on a meal...\n\nI came back from work and she told me what happened... I said \"I will talk to him about it.\" but when I went to his room I just told him \"Don't worry about it.\"\n\nWhen I came back to the kitchen she told me \"Do you like my new perfume?\" I told her it was nice and all.. and when I asked her how much she paid for it, she said $160.. that was when I was displeased. I closed the kitchen door and said \"You just started boiling at [my son's name] for spending $7 on a meal whereas you spent $160 on your perfume, where's the fairness in that?\" she got upset and went to the bathroom.\n\nTwo weeks ago I started giving my son money without my wife's knowledge. My son isn't the type of person to spend it on drugs or some other toxins, in-fact he uses the money as a mature adult and entertains himself with food or other things every now and then.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the dad is in the wrong here. So the situation is that the son is at university but stays with his parents. The parents agreed to let him live at home. The dad gives the son money secretly because he's upset with the mom for being strict about the son spending $7, while she spends $160 on perfume. \n\nFirst, the parents are supposed to be managing finances together. The dad gave the son money without telling the mom. That seems like a problem because it's a joint decision. Even if the mom was being unfair, the dad's solution was to bypass her. Maybe he should have talked it out with her first instead of acting behind her back. \n\nAlso, the mom criticized the son for $7 but spent $160 on perfume. The dad's reaction was to give the son money, but that might not address the root issue. The mom's criticism could be about the son's spending habits, but the dad's approach of giving money without discussing it with the wife could create more tension. \n\nThe dad might think he's helping his son, but he's causing conflict in the marriage. The wife might feel disrespected or that her financial decisions aren't being considered. Even though she spent more, the dad's secret action undermines their partnership. So the dad's action seems to be in the wrong because he didn't communicate with his wife and took matters into his own hands.\n"
