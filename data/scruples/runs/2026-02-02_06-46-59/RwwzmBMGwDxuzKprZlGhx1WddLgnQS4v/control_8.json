When he came back home, my wife had a go at him for spending $7 on a meal...\n\nI came back from work and she told me what happened... I said \"I will talk to him about it.\" but when I went to his room I just told him \"Don't worry about it.\"\n\nWhen I came back to the kitchen she told me \"Do you like my new perfume?\" I told her it was nice and all.. and when I asked her how much she paid for it, she said $160.. that was when I was displeased. I closed the kitchen door and said \"You just started boiling at [my son's name] for spending $7 on a meal whereas you spent $160 on your perfume, where's the fairness in that?\" she got upset and went to the bathroom.\n\nTwo weeks ago I started giving my son money without my wife's knowledge. My son isn't the type of person to spend it on drugs or some other toxins, in-fact he uses the money as a mature adult and entertains himself with food or other things every now and then.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the father is in the wrong for giving his son money without his wife's knowledge. \n\nFirst, the context: The family isn't struggling financially, but there's a big difference in how each member spends. The wife is upset about the son spending $7 on a meal, while the father notices she spends $160 on perfume. He then starts giving the son money secretly.\n\nSo, the main points here are about fairness and communication. The father's action was to balance what he perceives as unfair treatment by the wife. But giving money without the spouse's knowledge could be seen as undermining their joint decision-making about finances. Even if the father felt the wife was being too strict with the son, he might have handled it better by discussing it with her instead of acting behind her back.\n\nThe wife's reaction (getting upset) suggests that the father didn't consider her feelings when he went behind her back. The key issue here is the lack of communication and transparency in a shared financial matter. Even if the father's intention was good, the method of giving money without her knowledge could be seen as the wrong approach. \n\nSo, even though the situation shows possible unfairness from the wife's side, the father's decision to act without involving her is likely where he's in the wrong. Therefore, the answer should be A.\n"
