When he came back home, my wife had a go at him for spending $7 on a meal...\n\nI came back from work and she told me what happened... I said \"I will talk to him about it.\" but when I went to his room I just told him \"Don't worry about it.\"\n\nWhen I came back to the kitchen she told me \"Do you like my new perfume?\" I told her it was nice and all.. and when I asked her how much she paid for it, she said $160.. that was when I was displeased. I closed the kitchen door and said \"You just started boiling at [my son's name] for spending $7 on a meal whereas you spent $160 on your perfume, where's the fairness in that?\" she got upset and went to the bathroom.\n\nTwo weeks ago I started giving my son money without my wife's knowledge. My son isn't the type of person to spend it on drugs or some other toxins, in-fact he uses the money as a mature adult and entertains himself with food or other things every now and then.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the story is in the wrong for giving their son money without the wife's knowledge. The situation involves the parents allowing their son to live at home while attending university and managing finances.\n\nFirst, the parents agreed that the son would stay at home. The mother criticizes the son for spending $7 on a meal, while the father spends money without consulting her, like the $160 perfume. The father then confronts the mother about this discrepancy and starts giving the son money secretly.\n\nSo, the key points here are the financial dynamics and communication within the family. The father feels that the mother is being unfair by criticizing the son for a small expense while she spends more on herself. In response, he gives the son money without telling her. \n\nI need to consider whether the father's actions are wrong. The main factors would be transparency in a marriage, especially regarding finances. In many relationships, especially where they're co-parenting, both parents are expected to be honest and communicate about shared expenses and decisions affecting their children. By giving the son money without the wife's knowledge, the father is acting unilaterally, which could undermine trust. Even if the father's intention is to support the son and correct what he sees as unfair treatment, keeping the wife in the dark about this is problematic. \n\nThe father's decision might be based on his perception of fairness, but the method of secrecy is an issue. Marital partners typically share financial responsibilities, and hiding such a decision could lead to further conflict. The wife might feel disrespected or that her opinions aren't valued, especially if she was already upset about the perfume expense. The father's action, while possibly well-intentioned, lacks transparency and could be seen as undermining the wife's authority in managing the household finances. \n\nOn the other hand, the wife's reaction to the son's $7 expense while spending $160 on herself does seem disproportionate. The father's motivation might be to correct that imbalance. However, the appropriate approach would be to discuss this with the wife and reach a mutual agreement rather than acting behind her back. \n\nGiven that, the father is in the wrong because he didn't communicate his decision, which is a breach of trust in the marriage. Even if the wife's behavior was questionable, the father's solution of secrecy isn't the right approach. So the answer should be A.\n"
