When he came back home, my wife had a go at him for spending $7 on a meal...\n\nI came back from work and she told me what happened... I said \"I will talk to him about it.\" but when I went to his room I just told him \"Don't worry about it.\"\n\nWhen I came back to the kitchen she told me \"Do you like my new perfume?\" I told her it was nice and all.. and when I asked her how much she paid for it, she said $160.. that was when I was displeased. I closed the kitchen door and said \"You just started boiling at [my son's name] for spending $7 on a meal whereas you spent $160 on your perfume, where's the fairness in that?\" she got upset and went to the bathroom.\n\nTwo weeks ago I started giving my son money without my wife's knowledge. My son isn't the type of person to spend it on drugs or some other toxins, in-fact he uses the money as a mature adult and entertains himself with food or other things every now and then.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the father is in the wrong for giving his son money without his wife knowing. \n\nFirst, the context: The family has enough money, but there's a big disparity in how each member spends. The wife scolds the son for a $7 meal, but then the husband notices she spends $160 on perfume. He talks to her about the inconsistency, she gets upset, and he starts giving the son money without telling her.\n\nSo, the main points to consider are:\n\n1. **Communication and Agreement**: Did the parents agree on how to handle the son's expenses? The initial agreement was for the son to stay at home, but there's no mention of a financial agreement. The wife's reaction to the $7 meal suggests she might have her own rules about spending, but the husband disagrees.\n\n2. **Parental Authority**: Both parents share responsibility for their child. If the father believes the wife's spending is inconsistent, he might think he needs to counterbalance it. However, bypassing the mother by giving money without her knowledge could undermine their partnership.\n\n3. **Intentions of the Son**: The son uses the money responsibly, but the father's action without the mother's knowledge could lead to conflict. The wife might feel disrespected or that her opinions aren't considered.\n\n4. **Financial Management**: Since the family isn't short on money, the issue isn't about need but about how they manage resources. The father's action could be seen as a way to support his son against his wife's strictness, but it's done behind her back.\n\n5. **Marital Respect**: Decisions about a child's finances typically require mutual agreement. The father's unilateral action might be seen as taking sides and not respecting the wife's role in parenting.\n\nSo, while the father's intention might be to support his son and correct what he sees as unfairness, doing so without the wife's knowledge could be problematic. It's about how they handle their marital disagreements and whether the father should have addressed the issue directly with his wife rather than circumventing her. The key here is whether the action was taken in a way that respects both partners' roles and the agreed-upon parenting strategies.\n"
