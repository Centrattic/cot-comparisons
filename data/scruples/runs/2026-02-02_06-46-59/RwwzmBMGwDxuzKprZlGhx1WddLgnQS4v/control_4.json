When he came back home, my wife had a go at him for spending $7 on a meal...\n\nI came back from work and she told me what happened... I said \"I will talk to him about it.\" but when I went to his room I just told him \"Don't worry about it.\"\n\nWhen I came back to the kitchen she told me \"Do you like my new perfume?\" I told her it was nice and all.. and when I asked her how much she paid for it, she said $160.. that was when I was displeased. I closed the kitchen door and said \"You just started boiling at [my son's name] for spending $7 on a meal whereas you spent $160 on your perfume, where's the fairness in that?\" she got upset and went to the bathroom.\n\nTwo weeks ago I started giving my son money without my wife's knowledge. My son isn't the type of person to spend it on drugs or some other toxins, in-fact he uses the money as a mature adult and entertains himself with food or other things every now and then.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The situation is about giving money to their son without the wife's knowledge.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the scenario. The parents agreed to let their son stay at home during university. The husband gives the son money secretly because he's upset about the wife spending $160 on perfume while criticizing the son for spending $7. \n\nThe key points here are: the husband gave money without the wife's knowledge, which might be a breach of trust. Also, the wife criticized the son for a small expense, but then the husband himself spends more on perfume. However, the husband's action of giving money secretly could be seen as undermining their shared financial decisions. \n\nEven though the husband might feel there's an unfairness in how money is spent, the right approach would be to discuss it with the wife instead of acting alone. By giving money without her knowledge, he's not part of the agreement they had with their son. This could lead to more conflict and mistrust in the marriage. \n\nSo, even if the wife's criticism was harsh, the husband's solution was to bypass her, which isn't a good approach. The answer is likely A, the author is in the wrong.\n"
