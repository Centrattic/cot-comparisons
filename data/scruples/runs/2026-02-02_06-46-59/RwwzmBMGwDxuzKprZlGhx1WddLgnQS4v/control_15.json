When he came back home, my wife had a go at him for spending $7 on a meal...\n\nI came back from work and she told me what happened... I said \"I will talk to him about it.\" but when I went to his room I just told him \"Don't worry about it.\"\n\nWhen I came back to the kitchen she told me \"Do you like my new perfume?\" I told her it was nice and all.. and when I asked her how much she paid for it, she said $160.. that was when I was displeased. I closed the kitchen door and said \"You just started boiling at [my son's name] for spending $7 on a meal whereas you spent $160 on your perfume, where's the fairness in that?\" she got upset and went to the bathroom.\n\nTwo weeks ago I started giving my son money without my wife's knowledge. My son isn't the type of person to spend it on drugs or some other toxins, in-fact he uses the money as a mature adult and entertains himself with food or other things every now and then.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote this scenario is in the wrong for giving their son money without the wife's knowledge. The options are A or B. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The parents have agreed to let their son live at home while he's in university. They're not short on money, but there's a big disparity in how different family members spend. The wife criticizes the son for spending $7 on a meal, while she spent $160 on perfume. The father talks to the son, tells him not to worry, and then starts giving the son money secretly.\n\nThe father's reasoning is that the son is a mature adult and spends responsibly. The wife is upset about the $7 meal, but the father finds it unfair compared to her $160 perfume. He decides to support his son financially without his wife knowing.\n\nNow, the main question is whether the father is in the wrong. The key points here are communication within the marital relationship and shared financial responsibility. Even though the parents aren't poor, they're in a partnership. Financial decisions, especially when they involve giving money to a child without the spouse's knowledge, could be seen as undermining the spouse's role. The father might have thought he was helping the son, but he didn't involve his wife, which could lead to conflict. \n\nBut there's also the aspect of the wife being overly critical of the son's spending while spending more herself. The father's action could be a way to balance that perceived unfairness. However, the way to address this should be through open communication with the wife, not by secretly giving money to the son. \n\nIn most relationships, financial decisions, even those involving children, should be mutual. The father's action might be seen as a lack of respect for his wife's input. Even if he felt her criticism was harsh, the correct approach would be to discuss it together rather than making unilateral decisions. \n\nSo, the father is in the wrong because he didn't communicate with his wife before giving the son money. The answer should be A.\n"
