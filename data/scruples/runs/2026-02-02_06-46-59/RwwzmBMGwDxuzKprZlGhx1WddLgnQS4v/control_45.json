When he came back home, my wife had a go at him for spending $7 on a meal...\n\nI came back from work and she told me what happened... I said \"I will talk to him about it.\" but when I went to his room I just told him \"Don't worry about it.\"\n\nWhen I came back to the kitchen she told me \"Do you like my new perfume?\" I told her it was nice and all.. and when I asked her how much she paid for it, she said $160.. that was when I was displeased. I closed the kitchen door and said \"You just started boiling at [my son's name] for spending $7 on a meal whereas you spent $160 on your perfume, where's the fairness in that?\" she got upset and went to the bathroom.\n\nTwo weeks ago I started giving my son money without my wife's knowledge. My son isn't the type of person to spend it on drugs or some other toxins, in-fact he uses the money as a mature adult and entertains himself with food or other things every now and then.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the father is in the wrong for giving his son money without his wife's knowledge. \n\nFirst, the parents agreed to let their son stay at home while he's in university. The key point here is that they've made an agreement to support him financially. The father mentions that they have enough money, but there's a discrepancy in how each family member spends. The son was scolded for a $7 meal, while the mother bought a $160 perfume. The father then gives the son money secretly.\n\nSo, the main issues here are about financial fairness and communication within the marriage. The wife's reaction to the son's spending versus her own seems inconsistent. The father's action of giving money without telling his wife might be a response to that inconsistency. But in a marriage, making decisions that affect shared finances without discussing them with a spouse can be problematic. Even if the father feels the wife is being unfair, the right approach would be to address the issue with her rather than act alone. This could lead to further resentment and breakdown in communication. \n\nThe father's intention is to help his son, but the method undermines the partnership with his wife. The wife might feel disrespected or excluded from financial decisions. While the father's action was motivated by a desire to support his son and correct what he sees as unfair treatment, bypassing his wife's knowledge is not the best approach. Therefore, he's in the wrong because he didn't communicate with his wife, which is essential in a marriage, even if his motives were good.\n"
