When he came back home, my wife had a go at him for spending $7 on a meal...\n\nI came back from work and she told me what happened... I said \"I will talk to him about it.\" but when I went to his room I just told him \"Don't worry about it.\"\n\nWhen I came back to the kitchen she told me \"Do you like my new perfume?\" I told her it was nice and all.. and when I asked her how much she paid for it, she said $160.. that was when I was displeased. I closed the kitchen door and said \"You just started boiling at [my son's name] for spending $7 on a meal whereas you spent $160 on your perfume, where's the fairness in that?\" she got upset and went to the bathroom.\n\nTwo weeks ago I started giving my son money without my wife's knowledge. My son isn't the type of person to spend it on drugs or some other toxins, in-fact he uses the money as a mature adult and entertains himself with food or other things every now and then.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user wants to know if the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong. The situation involves a father giving money to his son without the wife's knowledge, especially after the wife criticized the son for spending $7 while she spent $160 on perfume. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The parents agreed to let their son stay at home during university, so they're likely sharing the costs of his living expenses. The father points out the wife is being inconsistent by reprimanding the son for a small expense but spending a much larger amount herself. This discrepancy might have led the father to feel the need to support his son financially secretly.\n\nThe key points are: the father's action of giving money without the wife's knowledge, the wife's criticism, and the father's defense about fairness. The question is whether the father was wrong. \n\nIn terms of fairness, the wife's reaction to the son's $7 expense versus her own $160 purchase could be seen as hypocritical. The father's decision to provide money might be an attempt to correct that imbalance. However, the father didn't discuss this with the wife, which could be problematic. Financial decisions in a marriage usually require mutual agreement, so acting unilaterally might be the issue here.\n\nThe father's intention is to help his son, which is good, but the method might not be appropriate. By not involving the wife, he's bypassing her input and possibly creating tension. The wife might feel disrespected or that her views are not being considered. Even if the parents have differing opinions on spending, they should communicate and agree on a consistent approach to financial matters, both for themselves and their child's upbringing.\n\nAlso, the son is in university, which is a time to learn financial responsibility. If the father is giving him money without the mother's knowledge, it might prevent the son from understanding the value of money or lead to dependency. However, the father mentions the son uses the money maturely, so that's a positive aspect.\n\nAnother angle is the parents' role in managing their child's finances. If they had a prior agreement on how to handle the son's expenses during university, the father's action might breach that agreement. The wife's criticism might be part of teaching the son budgeting, while the father's intervention could undermine that lesson.\n\nOn the other hand, if the wife's reaction is overly harsh and inconsistent, the father's action might be justified as a way to support his son. But the method still needs to involve the wife to maintain trust and partnership in the marriage.\n\nSo, the father's mistake might not be the act of giving money per se, but not discussing it with his wife first. Financial decisions in a marriage typically require mutual consent to avoid conflicts and respect each other's roles. The father's action could be seen as undermining the wife's authority or not respecting her financial boundaries. Therefore, the father is in the wrong not because of giving money, but because he did so without involving his wife in the decision-making process.\n"
