When he came back home, my wife had a go at him for spending $7 on a meal...\n\nI came back from work and she told me what happened... I said \"I will talk to him about it.\" but when I went to his room I just told him \"Don't worry about it.\"\n\nWhen I came back to the kitchen she told me \"Do you like my new perfume?\" I told her it was nice and all.. and when I asked her how much she paid for it, she said $160.. that was when I was displeased. I closed the kitchen door and said \"You just started boiling at [my son's name] for spending $7 on a meal whereas you spent $160 on your perfume, where's the fairness in that?\" she got upset and went to the bathroom.\n\nTwo weeks ago I started giving my son money without my wife's knowledge. My son isn't the type of person to spend it on drugs or some other toxins, in-fact he uses the money as a mature adult and entertains himself with food or other things every now and then.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for giving their son money without the wife's knowledge. \n\nFirst, the context: The family isn't struggling financially, but there's a big disparity in how each family member spends money. The wife criticized the son for spending $7 on a meal, while the author then notices the wife spent $160 on perfume. The author gives the son money secretly, thinking the wife is being unfair.\n\nThe key points here are about communication and shared financial responsibility in a marriage. Even though the author might feel the wife is being inconsistent, the right approach would be to address the issue with her directly rather than bypassing her. By giving the son money without her knowledge, the author is essentially taking sides and not respecting the wife's role in their shared parenting and financial decisions. \n\nFinancial decisions in a marriage typically require mutual agreement. The author's action could undermine the wife's authority and create more conflict. The wife might feel disrespected or that her concerns aren't being heard. Even if the author believes the wife's criticism is unfair, the method of dealing with it\u2014secretly supporting the son\u2014could be seen as manipulative or undermining the wife's role as a parent. \n\nAlso, the author's initial response to the wife's criticism was to take a side with the son, which sets a precedent for not supporting the wife's perspective. The author should have discussed the spending habits as a couple first, perhaps addressing the inconsistency in their expectations rather than acting alone.\n\nIn terms of fairness, while the wife's reaction to $7 might seem excessive compared to her own $160 purchase, the author's solution of secretly giving money to the son doesn't resolve the underlying issue of communication and shared values. The author is in the wrong because they didn't communicate openly with their spouse about their concerns and instead took unilateral action, which could lead to further conflict and erode trust.\n"
