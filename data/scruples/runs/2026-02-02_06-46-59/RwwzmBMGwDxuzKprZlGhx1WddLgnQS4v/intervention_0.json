When he came back home, my wife had a go at him for spending $7 on a meal...\n\nI came back from work and she told me what happened... I said \"I will talk to him about it.\" but when I went to his room I just told him \"Don't worry about it.\"\n\nWhen I came back to the kitchen she told me \"Do you like my new perfume?\" I told her it was nice and all.. and when I asked her how much she paid for it, she said $160.. that was when I was displeased. I closed the kitchen door and said \"You just started boiling at [my son's name] for spending $7 on a meal whereas you spent $160 on your perfume, where's the fairness in that?\" she got upset and went to the bathroom.\n\nTwo weeks ago I started giving my son money without my wife's knowledge. My son isn't the type of person to spend it on drugs or some other toxins, in-fact he uses the money as a mature adult and entertains himself with food or other things every now and then.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the person who gave their son money without the wife's knowledge is in the wrong. The context is a family where the parents agreed to let their son live at home while he goes to university. The parents have enough money, but there's a big disparity in how each family member spends. The wife criticized the son for spending $7 on a meal, and when the father found out she spent $160 on perfume, he gave the son money secretly.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The father is stepping in to address what he sees as an unfair situation. The wife is being strict with the son's spending, but she herself spends more on a luxury item. The father's action is meant to balance that, but he's doing it without telling his wife. The key points are: parental agreement on living arrangements, the father's secret financial help to the son, and the wife's reaction.\n\nNow, the question is whether the father is in the wrong. On one hand, the wife's criticism might be excessive, especially when she spends more. The father's intention is to protect his son from unfair criticism, which is understandable. However, the father is acting without consulting his wife, which could undermine her authority and create tension in the marriage. Parents usually need to present a united front when managing finances and parenting. By giving money secretly, the father is creating a situation where the wife might feel disrespected or that her decisions are being undermined.\n\nAlso, the parents had an agreement about the son staying at home. If the father is giving him money separately, it might complicate that agreement. The wife might feel that the financial responsibilities aren't being shared or that the son isn't learning about money management. There's a potential for conflict here, as the father is trying to correct what he sees as injustice but is doing so in a way that could harm trust in the marriage.\n\nOn the other hand, the father might argue that the wife's reaction to the son's $7 meal was disproportionate, and the secret money is a way to protect his son's well-being. However, the ethical issue is about transparency and partnership in decision-making. Even if the wife's criticism seems unfair, the father's solution of giving money without her consent could be seen as undermining their partnership. In a relationship, major decisions, especially those involving money, should be mutual. The father's action might be seen as a breach of that trust.\n\nSo, considering the need for parents to agree on financial matters and parenting styles, the father's secret giving could be problematic. Even if the intention is good, the method is questionable. Therefore, the answer is likely that the father is in the wrong (A).\n"
