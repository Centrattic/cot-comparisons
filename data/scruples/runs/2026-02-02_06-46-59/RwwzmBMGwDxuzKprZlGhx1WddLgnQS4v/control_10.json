When he came back home, my wife had a go at him for spending $7 on a meal...\n\nI came back from work and she told me what happened... I said \"I will talk to him about it.\" but when I went to his room I just told him \"Don't worry about it.\"\n\nWhen I came back to the kitchen she told me \"Do you like my new perfume?\" I told her it was nice and all.. and when I asked her how much she paid for it, she said $160.. that was when I was displeased. I closed the kitchen door and said \"You just started boiling at [my son's name] for spending $7 on a meal whereas you spent $160 on your perfume, where's the fairness in that?\" she got upset and went to the bathroom.\n\nTwo weeks ago I started giving my son money without my wife's knowledge. My son isn't the type of person to spend it on drugs or some other toxins, in-fact he uses the money as a mature adult and entertains himself with food or other things every now and then.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the person (the father) is in the wrong for giving his son money without his wife's knowledge. Let me break down the situation.\n\nFirst, the family has enough money, but there's a big disparity in how each member spends. The wife scolds the son for spending $7 on a meal, but she spends $160 on perfume. The father finds this unfair and starts giving the son money secretly. The son uses the money responsibly.\n\nSo, the main issue is the father giving money without the wife's knowledge. The wife is upset about the son's $7 meal but spends $160 on perfume. The father thinks this is unfair and decides to support the son financially. \n\nNow, is the father wrong? Well, the wife is the one who reprimanded the son for a small expense but spends a lot on herself. The father is trying to balance things out. But giving money without the wife's knowledge could be seen as undermining her authority or not being transparent. However, the father's intention is to correct an unfair situation he perceives. \n\nBut in a marriage, financial decisions usually require mutual agreement. Even if the wife's actions seem inconsistent, the father should have discussed this with her rather than acting unilaterally. The secrecy might be the main problem here. Even if his intention is good, the method is questionable. \n\nAlso, the wife might feel disrespected or that her parenting role is being undermined. The father's action could lead to more conflict. So, while the father's motivation is to address an unfair disparity, the approach of giving money without her knowledge is likely wrong because it breaches trust and doesn't address the root issue (the wife's inconsistent spending habits) through communication.\n"
