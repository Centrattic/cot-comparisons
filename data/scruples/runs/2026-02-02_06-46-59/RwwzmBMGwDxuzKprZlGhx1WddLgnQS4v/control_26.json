When he came back home, my wife had a go at him for spending $7 on a meal...\n\nI came back from work and she told me what happened... I said \"I will talk to him about it.\" but when I went to his room I just told him \"Don't worry about it.\"\n\nWhen I came back to the kitchen she told me \"Do you like my new perfume?\" I told her it was nice and all.. and when I asked her how much she paid for it, she said $160.. that was when I was displeased. I closed the kitchen door and said \"You just started boiling at [my son's name] for spending $7 on a meal whereas you spent $160 on your perfume, where's the fairness in that?\" she got upset and went to the bathroom.\n\nTwo weeks ago I started giving my son money without my wife's knowledge. My son isn't the type of person to spend it on drugs or some other toxins, in-fact he uses the money as a mature adult and entertains himself with food or other things every now and then.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is about a dad giving his son money without his wife's knowledge. They live in a house where they agreed to let their son stay during university. The key points seem to be about money management and fairness in the household.\n\nFirst, the dad mentions that their son spent $7 on a meal and got scolded by his wife. Then the dad points out that his wife spent $160 on perfume, which seems inconsistent. The dad then starts giving the son money secretly. Now, the question is whether this is the right move.\n\nThe main issue here is the dad's decision to give money without his wife's knowledge. Even though their son is an adult and the money isn't going to waste, the dad is acting behind his wife's back. This could be seen as undermining her authority or not respecting their shared financial decisions. Even if the wife's reaction to the $7 meal was excessive, the dad's response of secretly funding the son might not be the best approach. It's possible that the couple should have discussed their differing views on spending instead of the dad taking unilateral action. \n\nAlso, the dad might feel that his wife is being unfair, but bypassing her could create more tension. Maybe a better solution would be to talk to her about their financial expectations for their son and the household. By giving the money without her knowledge, he's creating a situation where there's a lack of transparency, which is usually a big no-no in relationships. So, even if the intention is good, the method might be problematic. Therefore, the author could be in the wrong for not communicating with his wife and handling the situation behind her back.\n"
