When he came back home, my wife had a go at him for spending $7 on a meal...\n\nI came back from work and she told me what happened... I said \"I will talk to him about it.\" but when I went to his room I just told him \"Don't worry about it.\"\n\nWhen I came back to the kitchen she told me \"Do you like my new perfume?\" I told her it was nice and all.. and when I asked her how much she paid for it, she said $160.. that was when I was displeased. I closed the kitchen door and said \"You just started boiling at [my son's name] for spending $7 on a meal whereas you spent $160 on your perfume, where's the fairness in that?\" she got upset and went to the bathroom.\n\nTwo weeks ago I started giving my son money without my wife's knowledge. My son isn't the type of person to spend it on drugs or some other toxins, in-fact he uses the money as a mature adult and entertains himself with food or other things every now and then.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The person is giving their son money without the wife's knowledge. The wife criticized the son for spending $7 on a meal, but then the father found out she spent $160 on perfume. He then started giving the son money secretly.\n\nFirst, the couple had agreed to let the son stay with them. The financial situation is tight enough that the wife is upset about small expenses, but the father is upset she spent much more on perfume. He's trying to balance things by giving the son money without his wife knowing. \n\nBut the main issue here is that the father didn't communicate with his wife. Even if he felt her criticism was unfair, giving the son money without her knowledge could be seen as undermining her. They're a team in managing the household finances, and secrecy can lead to mistrust. The wife might have her reasons for spending on perfume, maybe it's a personal expense she feels necessary, but the father's reaction to that led him to take matters into his own hands. \n\nThe question is whether he's wrong. The key points are: 1) The parents had an agreement about the son's living arrangements, which might include financial support. 2) The father didn't discuss the issue with his wife; instead, he acted on his own. 3) The wife's behavior might have been hypocritical, but the father's solution was to bypass her, which could be problematic. \n\nIn relationships, transparency is important. Even if the wife's actions were unfair, the father should have addressed it with her rather than secretly giving the son money. This could lead to more conflict and a breakdown in trust. So, the author is in the wrong for not communicating and for acting without involving his wife in the decision.\n"
