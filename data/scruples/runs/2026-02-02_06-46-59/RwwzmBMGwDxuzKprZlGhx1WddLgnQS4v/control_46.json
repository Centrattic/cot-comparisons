When he came back home, my wife had a go at him for spending $7 on a meal...\n\nI came back from work and she told me what happened... I said \"I will talk to him about it.\" but when I went to his room I just told him \"Don't worry about it.\"\n\nWhen I came back to the kitchen she told me \"Do you like my new perfume?\" I told her it was nice and all.. and when I asked her how much she paid for it, she said $160.. that was when I was displeased. I closed the kitchen door and said \"You just started boiling at [my son's name] for spending $7 on a meal whereas you spent $160 on your perfume, where's the fairness in that?\" she got upset and went to the bathroom.\n\nTwo weeks ago I started giving my son money without my wife's knowledge. My son isn't the type of person to spend it on drugs or some other toxins, in-fact he uses the money as a mature adult and entertains himself with food or other things every now and then.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong. So the situation is that the father gave his son money without the wife's knowledge. The wife was upset at the son for spending $7 on a meal, but then the father found out she spent $160 on a perfume. The father then started giving the son money secretly because he thought the wife was being unfair.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points here. The family is not struggling financially, but there's a big disparity in how each person spends. The wife is upset about the son's small expense, while the father is upset about her larger expense. The father's action was to secretly give money to the son. \n\nNow, the question is whether the father did something wrong. The father's reasoning is that the wife was being inconsistent and unfair. However, giving money without the wife's knowledge could be a problem because it's a shared responsibility. Even if the father disagrees with the wife's approach, bypassing her directly might undermine their partnership and financial decisions. \n\nAlso, the father didn't address the wife's behavior directly. Instead, he took matters into his own hands. The wife might feel disrespected or that her concerns aren't being taken seriously. Even if the father thought the wife was overreacting, it's important to communicate and find a solution together, not act unilaterally. \n\nAnother angle is the son's maturity. The father mentions the son is a mature adult, but giving him money without the spouse's knowledge could lead to dependency or set a precedent for other family members to bypass the spouse. It might also create tension between the parents if their financial decisions aren't aligned.\n\nIn terms of fairness, the father is trying to balance the spending, but the method might be flawed. The right approach would be to discuss the issue with the wife, address her concerns about the son's spending, and maybe agree on a more balanced approach. Secretly giving money could be seen as undermining the wife's authority or not respecting her role in managing the household finances.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the father's action, while well-intentioned, might be considered wrong because he didn't involve his wife in the decision-making process, which is a key aspect of a partnership. The answer here is likely A, the author is in the wrong.\n"
