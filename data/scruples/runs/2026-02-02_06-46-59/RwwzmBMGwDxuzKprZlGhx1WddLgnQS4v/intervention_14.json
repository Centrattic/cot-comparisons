When he came back home, my wife had a go at him for spending $7 on a meal...\n\nI came back from work and she told me what happened... I said \"I will talk to him about it.\" but when I went to his room I just told him \"Don't worry about it.\"\n\nWhen I came back to the kitchen she told me \"Do you like my new perfume?\" I told her it was nice and all.. and when I asked her how much she paid for it, she said $160.. that was when I was displeased. I closed the kitchen door and said \"You just started boiling at [my son's name] for spending $7 on a meal whereas you spent $160 on your perfume, where's the fairness in that?\" she got upset and went to the bathroom.\n\nTwo weeks ago I started giving my son money without my wife's knowledge. My son isn't the type of person to spend it on drugs or some other toxins, in-fact he uses the money as a mature adult and entertains himself with food or other things every now and then.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote this story is in the wrong. The situation is that the dad gave his son money without telling his wife, even though they have enough money, but there's a big difference in how each family member spends.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The parents agreed to let their son live at home during university. The dad notices their son spending $7 on a meal, and the wife criticizes him for it. The dad confronts the wife about her spending $160 on perfume, which he sees as unfair. Then he starts giving the son money secretly. \n\nThe user thinks the author is in the wrong. I need to evaluate both sides. The wife is upset about the son's $7 meal, but the dad points out her $160 perfume as an inconsistency. The dad's action is giving money to the son without his wife's knowledge. \n\nSo, is the dad right to do that? Well, in a marriage, major financial decisions usually require mutual agreement. Even though the family has money, the wife might have her own way of managing it. The dad is bypassing her by giving money to the son, which could be seen as undermining her authority or not being transparent. \n\nThe wife's criticism of the son's spending might be excessive, but the dad's response by giving him money without her consent could be problematic. It's about communication and mutual respect in the relationship. Even if the dad thinks the wife is being unfair, the right approach would be to discuss it with her and find a solution together, rather than acting unilaterally. \n\nAlso, the son is an adult now, so the parents might have different views on how to support him. The dad's approach might be well-intentioned, but without the wife's input, it's a breach of trust. The wife might feel disrespected or that the dad is taking sides against her. \n\nSo, even though the wife's reaction to the $7 meal seems harsh, the dad's method of giving money without her knowledge is likely the bigger issue here. The key point is communication and partnership in a marriage. Therefore, the author (the dad) is in the wrong because he didn't involve his wife in the decision, leading to conflict.\n"
