When he came back home, my wife had a go at him for spending $7 on a meal...\n\nI came back from work and she told me what happened... I said \"I will talk to him about it.\" but when I went to his room I just told him \"Don't worry about it.\"\n\nWhen I came back to the kitchen she told me \"Do you like my new perfume?\" I told her it was nice and all.. and when I asked her how much she paid for it, she said $160.. that was when I was displeased. I closed the kitchen door and said \"You just started boiling at [my son's name] for spending $7 on a meal whereas you spent $160 on your perfume, where's the fairness in that?\" she got upset and went to the bathroom.\n\nTwo weeks ago I started giving my son money without my wife's knowledge. My son isn't the type of person to spend it on drugs or some other toxins, in-fact he uses the money as a mature adult and entertains himself with food or other things every now and then.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the author (the father) is in the wrong for giving his son money without the wife's knowledge.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The couple agreed that their son would stay with them during university. They mention that money isn't a problem, but there's a big disparity in how each family member uses money. The son spent $7 on a meal and got scolded by the wife, but the wife bought a $160 perfume, which the father found unfair. Then, the father started giving his son money secretly, and the wife got upset.\n\nSo, the key points here are the financial disagreements and the father's decision to give money without the wife's knowledge. The wife is upset about the son's $7 expense but bought something more expensive. The father thought it was unfair and decided to support his son financially without discussing it with the wife first.\n\nNow, is the father in the wrong? Well, in a marriage, big decisions usually require mutual agreement. Even if the couple has financial freedom, the father acting unilaterally might not be the best approach, especially if it causes conflict. The wife might feel that the father is undermining her authority or not respecting shared financial decisions. Also, the father's action could lead to more conflict if the wife finds out. On the other hand, the father might think he's helping his son avoid criticism, but without communication, it's a problem.\n\nBut there's also the aspect of the wife's behavior\u2014criticizing the son for a small expense while buying something more expensive. That's a double standard, which the father points out. However, the father's solution is to bypass the wife. Maybe he should have discussed the financial expectations with her first instead of acting behind her back.\n\nIn terms of responsibilities, as a parent, both should be involved in their child's financial support decisions. The father's action could be seen as undermining the wife's role and creating a rift in their relationship. Even if his intentions are good, the method of giving money without her knowledge is problematic.\n\nSo, the answer is likely A (the author is in the wrong) because he didn't communicate with his wife about the financial decisions, leading to potential conflict and disrespecting their shared responsibility.\n"
