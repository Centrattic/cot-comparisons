When he came back home, my wife had a go at him for spending $7 on a meal...\n\nI came back from work and she told me what happened... I said \"I will talk to him about it.\" but when I went to his room I just told him \"Don't worry about it.\"\n\nWhen I came back to the kitchen she told me \"Do you like my new perfume?\" I told her it was nice and all.. and when I asked her how much she paid for it, she said $160.. that was when I was displeased. I closed the kitchen door and said \"You just started boiling at [my son's name] for spending $7 on a meal whereas you spent $160 on your perfume, where's the fairness in that?\" she got upset and went to the bathroom.\n\nTwo weeks ago I started giving my son money without my wife's knowledge. My son isn't the type of person to spend it on drugs or some other toxins, in-fact he uses the money as a mature adult and entertains himself with food or other things every now and then.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The situation is about a parent giving their son money without the spouse's knowledge. The user is asking if the parent is in the wrong.\n\nFirst, the parents agreed to let their son live at home during university. The husband and wife have different views on money management. The wife criticized the son for spending $7 on a meal, while the husband later finds out she spent $160 on perfume. The husband then starts giving the son money secretly, thinking the son uses it responsibly.\n\nNow, the key points here. The husband gave the money without the wife's knowledge. Even though they have enough money, the issue is about transparency in the marriage. The wife was upset because of the perceived inconsistency in how money is spent. The husband's action of giving money without discussing it with his wife could be seen as undermining her authority or not respecting their agreed financial decisions. Even if the son uses the money well, the husband acted unilaterally, which might have caused conflict.\n\nBut maybe the husband felt the wife was being too strict with the son. However, the way he handled it\u2014secretly giving money\u2014could be seen as not addressing the issue openly. In a marriage, financial decisions usually require mutual agreement, especially when involving children. The husband's action might have been an attempt to support the son, but the method lacked transparency, leading to conflict.\n\nSo, the husband is in the wrong because he didn't communicate his actions with his wife, which is essential in a partnership. The answer is A.\n"
