When he came back home, my wife had a go at him for spending $7 on a meal...\n\nI came back from work and she told me what happened... I said \"I will talk to him about it.\" but when I went to his room I just told him \"Don't worry about it.\"\n\nWhen I came back to the kitchen she told me \"Do you like my new perfume?\" I told her it was nice and all.. and when I asked her how much she paid for it, she said $160.. that was when I was displeased. I closed the kitchen door and said \"You just started boiling at [my son's name] for spending $7 on a meal whereas you spent $160 on your perfume, where's the fairness in that?\" she got upset and went to the bathroom.\n\nTwo weeks ago I started giving my son money without my wife's knowledge. My son isn't the type of person to spend it on drugs or some other toxins, in-fact he uses the money as a mature adult and entertains himself with food or other things every now and then.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about a parent giving their son money without the wife's knowledge. The main points are about financial fairness and communication.\n\nFirst, the parents agreed to let their son stay at home during university. The author mentions that money isn't an issue, but there's a big disparity in how each family member spends. The son spent $7 on a meal, and the wife criticized him, but then the author found out the wife spent $160 on perfume. The author then starts giving the son money secretly.\n\nSo, the question is whether the author is wrong for doing this. On one hand, the wife's reaction to the son's spending seems excessive compared to her own spending. The author might feel that the son is being unfairly targeted. On the other hand, the author didn't discuss this with the wife first. Even though the author's intention is to help the son, acting without the spouse's knowledge could be seen as undermining the wife's authority or not respecting their joint decision-making.\n\nFinancial decisions in a marriage typically require mutual agreement. By giving the son money without informing the wife, the author is making a unilateral decision that affects their shared household. The wife might feel disrespected or that her concerns about the son's spending are valid, even if they seem small. The author's action could lead to more conflict if the wife finds out, especially since she was already upset about the initial incident.\n\nEven if the author's goal is to balance the spending, the method of doing it secretly might not address the root issue. The couple might need to communicate better about their financial values and how to handle their children's expenses. The author's action could be seen as taking sides and not addressing the underlying communication problem with the wife.\n\nSo, considering all that, the author is in the wrong because they didn't communicate with their spouse about giving money to the son, even if their intention was to correct an imbalance. The right approach would have been to discuss the issue with the wife first and find a mutual solution.\n"
