When he came back home, my wife had a go at him for spending $7 on a meal...\n\nI came back from work and she told me what happened... I said \"I will talk to him about it.\" but when I went to his room I just told him \"Don't worry about it.\"\n\nWhen I came back to the kitchen she told me \"Do you like my new perfume?\" I told her it was nice and all.. and when I asked her how much she paid for it, she said $160.. that was when I was displeased. I closed the kitchen door and said \"You just started boiling at [my son's name] for spending $7 on a meal whereas you spent $160 on your perfume, where's the fairness in that?\" she got upset and went to the bathroom.\n\nTwo weeks ago I started giving my son money without my wife's knowledge. My son isn't the type of person to spend it on drugs or some other toxins, in-fact he uses the money as a mature adult and entertains himself with food or other things every now and then.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for giving their son money without the wife's knowledge. \n\nFirst, the parents agreed to let their son live at home during university. Money isn't an issue in the household, but there's a discrepancy in how each family member spends. The wife scolds the son for a $7 meal, while the husband later notices she spent $160 on perfume. The husband then starts giving the son money secretly, which the wife isn't aware of.\n\nNow, the author's actions: giving money without the wife's knowledge. The main point here is the secrecy. Even if the husband thinks the wife is being unfair, bypassing her is a problem. Marital decisions, especially regarding finances, should ideally be mutual. By keeping it a secret, he's undermining the wife's role and possibly creating resentment. \n\nThe wife's reaction to the son's spending might be valid or not, but the husband's response was to act behind her back. That could lead to bigger issues, like lack of trust in the marriage. Even if the son is responsible with the money, the way the husband handled it is problematic. \n\nSo, the key issue is the lack of communication and transparency between the married couple. The husband's action, while motivated by a desire to balance the son's spending, is done without the wife's consent, which is a breach of trust. Therefore, the author is in the wrong.\n"
