When he came back home, my wife had a go at him for spending $7 on a meal...\n\nI came back from work and she told me what happened... I said \"I will talk to him about it.\" but when I went to his room I just told him \"Don't worry about it.\"\n\nWhen I came back to the kitchen she told me \"Do you like my new perfume?\" I told her it was nice and all.. and when I asked her how much she paid for it, she said $160.. that was when I was displeased. I closed the kitchen door and said \"You just started boiling at [my son's name] for spending $7 on a meal whereas you spent $160 on your perfume, where's the fairness in that?\" she got upset and went to the bathroom.\n\nTwo weeks ago I started giving my son money without my wife's knowledge. My son isn't the type of person to spend it on drugs or some other toxins, in-fact he uses the money as a mature adult and entertains himself with food or other things every now and then.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the father is in the wrong for giving his son money without his wife's knowledge. So first, I need to analyze the situation based on the details provided.\n\nThe family has enough money overall, but there's a big disparity in how each member spends. The son spent $7 on a meal, which the wife criticized, but then the wife spent $160 on perfume. The father felt this was unfair, so he started giving the son money without the wife knowing. The son uses it responsibly for food or other things, not on drugs or anything.\n\nSo, the main points here are: the parents had agreed the son would live at home during university. The father felt the wife was being overly critical of the son's small expense while she spent much more on herself. He wanted to support the son by giving him money covertly to balance things out.\n\nNow, is the father in the wrong? Well, in a marriage, financial decisions usually require mutual agreement, especially when it's about giving money to a child. Even though the father's intention was to correct an imbalance, he didn't discuss it with his wife. That could be seen as undermining her in the parenting role. The wife's criticism of the son's $7 meal might be excessive, but the father's response was to bypass her rather than address the issue together. That could lead to more conflict and a lack of trust in the marriage. Parents should ideally present a united front in financial matters. So even if the wife's reaction was harsh, the father's action of giving money without her knowledge is a breach of that partnership. Therefore, the answer might be that he's in the wrong because he didn't communicate and involved himself in a way that could harm marital trust, even if his intent was good.\n"
