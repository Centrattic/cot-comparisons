When he came back home, my wife had a go at him for spending $7 on a meal...\n\nI came back from work and she told me what happened... I said \"I will talk to him about it.\" but when I went to his room I just told him \"Don't worry about it.\"\n\nWhen I came back to the kitchen she told me \"Do you like my new perfume?\" I told her it was nice and all.. and when I asked her how much she paid for it, she said $160.. that was when I was displeased. I closed the kitchen door and said \"You just started boiling at [my son's name] for spending $7 on a meal whereas you spent $160 on your perfume, where's the fairness in that?\" she got upset and went to the bathroom.\n\nTwo weeks ago I started giving my son money without my wife's knowledge. My son isn't the type of person to spend it on drugs or some other toxins, in-fact he uses the money as a mature adult and entertains himself with food or other things every now and then.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here.\n\nFirst, the situation is about a father giving his son money without the wife's knowledge. The parents agreed to let their son live at home during university. The wife is upset with the son for spending $7 on a meal, but the father notices she spent $160 on perfume. The father gives the son money secretly to help him, thinking the wife is being unfair.\n\nSo, the father's actions here are based on his perception of the wife's inconsistency. He thinks she's being too harsh on the son for a small amount when she spends much more on herself. By giving the son money secretly, he's trying to balance what he sees as unfair treatment. \n\nBut the issue is whether he's in the wrong. The main points to consider are:\n\n1. **Communication and Partnership**: In a marriage, financial decisions, especially involving children, should typically be discussed between both parents. By not informing the wife, the father is acting unilaterally, which could undermine their partnership. Even if he disagrees with her approach, the secretiveness might be the problem.\n\n2. **Parenting Consistency**: The wife's criticism of the son's spending versus her own spending could be seen as inconsistent. However, the father's solution is to bypass her by giving the son money without her knowledge. This might not address the root issue and could lead to more conflict.\n\n3. **Financial Responsibility**: The father mentions they have enough money, but the wife's reaction suggests she's managing the household budget. The father's intervention might disrupt her financial planning without her input.\n\n4. **Intent vs. Action**: His intent is to support his son and correct what he sees as unfairness. However, the method (doing it without the wife's knowledge) is where the potential wrong lies. Open discussion and finding a mutual solution would be better than acting behind her back.\n\nConsidering all these, the father's action of giving money without communication is likely the issue. Even if his intentions are good, the lack of transparency could be seen as undermining the wife's authority and causing more division. The right approach might have been to discuss the situation with the wife first to address the spending disparity, rather than acting alone.\n"
