When he came back home, my wife had a go at him for spending $7 on a meal...\n\nI came back from work and she told me what happened... I said \"I will talk to him about it.\" but when I went to his room I just told him \"Don't worry about it.\"\n\nWhen I came back to the kitchen she told me \"Do you like my new perfume?\" I told her it was nice and all.. and when I asked her how much she paid for it, she said $160.. that was when I was displeased. I closed the kitchen door and said \"You just started boiling at [my son's name] for spending $7 on a meal whereas you spent $160 on your perfume, where's the fairness in that?\" she got upset and went to the bathroom.\n\nTwo weeks ago I started giving my son money without my wife's knowledge. My son isn't the type of person to spend it on drugs or some other toxins, in-fact he uses the money as a mature adult and entertains himself with food or other things every now and then.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong for giving their son money without their wife's knowledge. The situation involves some financial tensions between the parents and their son.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the parents' agreement. They both agreed to let their son stay at home while he's in university, probably to save him money. But the wife is upset about the $7 he spent on a meal, while the husband points out she spent $160 on perfume. This shows a double standard in their household's approach to money. The husband felt the need to support his son, so he started giving him money secretly. \n\nThe key points here are: 1. The husband is giving money without the wife's knowledge, which could be a breach of trust. 2. There's a double standard in how they handle spending. 3. The wife's reaction to the son's spending versus her own.\n\nSo, is the husband in the wrong? Well, even though there's a financial discrepancy, giving money without his wife's knowledge could be problematic. They are a couple, and major financial decisions, even for their child, should be mutual. By not discussing it with his wife, he might be undermining their partnership. However, the wife's behavior is also questionable because of her double standard. \n\nBut the question is specifically about the husband's actions. The act of giving money without her knowledge is where the potential wrong lies. Even if the wife is being unreasonable, the husband should have addressed the spending issue with her first, maybe found a compromise, instead of secretly providing funds. That could lead to further conflict and a lack of transparency in their relationship. \n\nSo, considering that, the answer would be A (the author is in the wrong) because he kept it secret, which can harm trust. Even if the wife's actions are unfair, the husband's solution was to act unilaterally, which isn't the healthiest approach in a partnership. It's important to communicate and find solutions together, especially regarding family finances.\n"
