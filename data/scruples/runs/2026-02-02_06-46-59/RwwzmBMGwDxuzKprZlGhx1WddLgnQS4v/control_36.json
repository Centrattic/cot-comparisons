When he came back home, my wife had a go at him for spending $7 on a meal...\n\nI came back from work and she told me what happened... I said \"I will talk to him about it.\" but when I went to his room I just told him \"Don't worry about it.\"\n\nWhen I came back to the kitchen she told me \"Do you like my new perfume?\" I told her it was nice and all.. and when I asked her how much she paid for it, she said $160.. that was when I was displeased. I closed the kitchen door and said \"You just started boiling at [my son's name] for spending $7 on a meal whereas you spent $160 on your perfume, where's the fairness in that?\" she got upset and went to the bathroom.\n\nTwo weeks ago I started giving my son money without my wife's knowledge. My son isn't the type of person to spend it on drugs or some other toxins, in-fact he uses the money as a mature adult and entertains himself with food or other things every now and then.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is that the dad gave his son money without telling his wife. The wife was upset because the son spent $7 on a meal, but she spent $160 on perfume. The dad felt it was unfair and started giving the son money secretly.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics between the parents and their child. The parents agreed to let the son stay at home during university. The dad is trying to support his son, maybe because he feels the wife is too strict on the son's spending. But by giving the son money without the wife's knowledge, the dad might be undermining her authority or creating a situation where the wife isn't aware of the financial support. \n\nMoney management in a household is usually a shared responsibility. If the dad is making financial decisions without consulting his wife, that could be a problem. Even if the wife's reaction to the $7 meal seems harsh, the dad's solution was to bypass her by giving the son money. That might lead to resentment or conflict because the wife might feel she's not being respected in financial matters.\n\nAlso, the dad's reason is that he\u89c9\u5f97 the wife is being unfair by spending $160 on perfume while criticizing the son's $7. But is comparing these two things fair? The dad might think the son deserves more spending freedom, but the wife might have her own reasons for her purchases. The key issue here is whether the dad should have discussed this with his wife before giving the son money, rather than doing it behind her back. \n\nSo, the dad's action of giving money without the wife's knowledge could be seen as a breach of trust in the marriage. Even if the intention was good, the method of keeping it secret might be wrong. The wife might feel disrespected, and the son might get mixed messages about financial responsibility if the parents aren't on the same page.\n\nTherefore, the author (the dad) is in the wrong because he made a financial decision without involving his wife, which could lead to more conflicts and undermines their partnership in managing the household finances.\n"
