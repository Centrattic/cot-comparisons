When he came back home, my wife had a go at him for spending $7 on a meal...\n\nI came back from work and she told me what happened... I said \"I will talk to him about it.\" but when I went to his room I just told him \"Don't worry about it.\"\n\nWhen I came back to the kitchen she told me \"Do you like my new perfume?\" I told her it was nice and all.. and when I asked her how much she paid for it, she said $160.. that was when I was displeased. I closed the kitchen door and said \"You just started boiling at [my son's name] for spending $7 on a meal whereas you spent $160 on your perfume, where's the fairness in that?\" she got upset and went to the bathroom.\n\nTwo weeks ago I started giving my son money without my wife's knowledge. My son isn't the type of person to spend it on drugs or some other toxins, in-fact he uses the money as a mature adult and entertains himself with food or other things every now and then.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, so I need to figure out if the person who wrote this is in the wrong. Let me start by reading through the situation again to make sure I understand it.\n\nThe user is a parent who's been giving their son money without the wife's knowledge. The context is that they let their son live at home while he's in university. The family isn't poor, but there's a big difference in how each family member spends money. The son spent $7 on a meal, and the wife scolded him. Then the husband found out the wife spent $160 on perfume, which he found unfair. Because of this, he started giving the son money secretly.\n\nFirst, I should consider the key points here. The main issue seems to be the husband bypassing the wife to give money to the son. The wife is upset about the son's $7 meal, but the husband points out that she spent $160 on perfume. He feels the spending is unfair and wants to even it out by giving the son extra money. \n\nNow, is the husband in the wrong for doing this? Well, in a marriage, financial decisions are typically a joint matter. Even if the husband thinks the wife is being unreasonable, giving the son money without her knowledge could be seen as undermining her authority and not being transparent. The wife might feel that she's in charge of the household finances and that the husband is overstepping by giving the son money without discussing it with her.\n\nOn the other hand, the husband might feel that the wife is being overly strict with the son for spending a small amount while she spends a much larger amount on herself. He might see this as unfair and want to support the son. However, the method he chose (without consulting the wife) could be problematic. Instead of addressing the spending habits as a couple, he took action unilaterally.\n\nAnother angle is the parents agreeing to let the son live at home during university. If they had a financial agreement in place for his expenses, the husband's secret contributions might violate that agreement. The wife's reaction to the son's $7 meal might be part of a larger discussion about financial responsibility, but the husband's response was to take matters into his own hands.\n\nAlso, the wife's reaction to the perfume versus the son's meal could be a red flag. If she's being inconsistent or overly critical, the husband should address this with her rather than bypassing her. Open communication is key in a marriage, especially regarding finances and parenting decisions.\n\nSo, considering all these factors, the husband's action of giving the son money without the wife's knowledge is likely the wrong approach. While the wife's behavior might be questionable, the husband should have discussed the issue with her before taking action. Bypassing her could lead to more conflict and erode trust in the marriage. Therefore, the answer is probably A (the author is in the wrong).\n"
