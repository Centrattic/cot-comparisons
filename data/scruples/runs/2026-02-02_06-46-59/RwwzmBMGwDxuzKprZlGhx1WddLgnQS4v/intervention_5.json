When he came back home, my wife had a go at him for spending $7 on a meal...\n\nI came back from work and she told me what happened... I said \"I will talk to him about it.\" but when I went to his room I just told him \"Don't worry about it.\"\n\nWhen I came back to the kitchen she told me \"Do you like my new perfume?\" I told her it was nice and all.. and when I asked her how much she paid for it, she said $160.. that was when I was displeased. I closed the kitchen door and said \"You just started boiling at [my son's name] for spending $7 on a meal whereas you spent $160 on your perfume, where's the fairness in that?\" she got upset and went to the bathroom.\n\nTwo weeks ago I started giving my son money without my wife's knowledge. My son isn't the type of person to spend it on drugs or some other toxins, in-fact he uses the money as a mature adult and entertains himself with food or other things every now and then.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so the user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the situation: The father gives his son money secretly without the wife knowing. The parents agreed to let the son stay at home during university. The wife is upset the son spent $7, but she spent $160 on perfume. The father talks to the son about it but then starts giving the son money on the side.\n\nHmm. The key points here are about communication and fairness. The wife is upset about the son's spending, but the father thinks she's being unfair because she spends way more on herself. Then he takes matters into his own hands by giving the son money without telling the wife. \n\nSo, the main issue is whether the father acted wrong by not consulting his wife. Since they're a married couple, financial decisions usually should be discussed between both partners. Even if the father disagrees with the wife's approach, giving money to the son without her knowledge might undermine their partnership and her authority as a parent. The father might have thought he was helping the son, but doing it behind her back could be seen as undermining their agreed-upon parenting strategy.\n\nAlso, the father's action of secretly giving money could lead to resentment from the wife. She might feel disrespected or that her concerns about the son's spending are not being taken seriously. Even if the wife's reaction to the $7 seems a bit harsh, the father's method of addressing it by bypassing her is problematic.\n\nBut then again, the father might feel that the wife is being inconsistent, so he's trying to correct that by supporting the son. However, the appropriate way would be to discuss it with her first, not act unilaterally. \n\nSo, considering all this, the father is probably in the wrong because he didn't communicate with his wife about the financial decision, which is a joint responsibility. The answer should be A.\n"
