When he came back home, my wife had a go at him for spending $7 on a meal...\n\nI came back from work and she told me what happened... I said \"I will talk to him about it.\" but when I went to his room I just told him \"Don't worry about it.\"\n\nWhen I came back to the kitchen she told me \"Do you like my new perfume?\" I told her it was nice and all.. and when I asked her how much she paid for it, she said $160.. that was when I was displeased. I closed the kitchen door and said \"You just started boiling at [my son's name] for spending $7 on a meal whereas you spent $160 on your perfume, where's the fairness in that?\" she got upset and went to the bathroom.\n\nTwo weeks ago I started giving my son money without my wife's knowledge. My son isn't the type of person to spend it on drugs or some other toxins, in-fact he uses the money as a mature adult and entertains himself with food or other things every now and then.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong for giving their son money without their wife's knowledge.\n\nFirst, the situation: The parents have agreed to let their son live at home during university. They mention money isn't an obstacle, but there's a big disparity in how each family member is treated. The wife criticizes the son for spending $7 on a meal, while the husband later reveals she spent $160 on perfume. The husband then starts giving the son money secretly, which the wife didn't know about.\n\nThe key points here are about transparency in a marriage and fairness in spending. The husband is upset about the wife's criticism of the son's spending but then takes matters into his own hands by giving the son money without her knowledge. This could be seen as undermining the wife's authority or decisions regarding finances. \n\nEven though the husband might believe he's being fair, the act of giving money without the spouse's knowledge can be seen as a breach of trust. In a marriage, especially when it comes to finances, open communication is usually expected. By not discussing this with his wife, the husband is not being transparent. Additionally, the wife's reaction might stem from her own values or financial priorities, which the husband isn't respecting by secretly providing funds to the son.\n\nSo, the husband's actions, while possibly well-intentioned, are likely in the wrong because he's acting behind his wife's back without discussing the issue openly. The right approach would have been to address the discrepancy in their spending priorities together, rather than making a unilateral decision that affects their shared finances.\n"
