When he came back home, my wife had a go at him for spending $7 on a meal...\n\nI came back from work and she told me what happened... I said \"I will talk to him about it.\" but when I went to his room I just told him \"Don't worry about it.\"\n\nWhen I came back to the kitchen she told me \"Do you like my new perfume?\" I told her it was nice and all.. and when I asked her how much she paid for it, she said $160.. that was when I was displeased. I closed the kitchen door and said \"You just started boiling at [my son's name] for spending $7 on a meal whereas you spent $160 on your perfume, where's the fairness in that?\" she got upset and went to the bathroom.\n\nTwo weeks ago I started giving my son money without my wife's knowledge. My son isn't the type of person to spend it on drugs or some other toxins, in-fact he uses the money as a mature adult and entertains himself with food or other things every now and then.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the person (the dad) is in the wrong for giving his son money without his wife's knowledge. So, first, I need to understand the situation.\n\nThe family agreed to let their son live at home during university. The dad mentions that money isn't an issue for the household but there's a big disparity in how each family member spends. An example given is the son spending $7 on a meal, while the mom spends $160 on a perfume. The dad got upset about the inconsistency, so he started giving the son money secretly. The question is whether the dad is wrong for doing this.\n\nNow, I need to analyze the possible angles. The main points here are the parents' agreement on finances, the disparity in spending, and the dad's secret action. \n\nFirst, the parents had an agreement for the son to stay at home. If the parents had a shared financial plan, then one parent giving money without the other's knowledge might break that agreement. Even if money isn't tight, the way it's managed could be a point of contention. The wife is upset about the son's $7 meal, which the dad dismissed, but then she spent $160 on perfume, which the dad criticized. The dad's reaction shows he's aware of the inconsistency, but his solution was to give the son money secretly. \n\nThis could be problematic because it's a financial decision made without the other parent's consent. In a marriage, major financial decisions usually require mutual agreement. Even if the dad thinks the wife is being unfair, going behind her back might undermine the partnership. The son is an adult, but living at home with the parents' agreement, so the parents might have a shared responsibility in managing his allowances. \n\nOn the other hand, the dad might feel the wife is being overly critical of the son's spending, while she's being more lenient with her own. The dad's action could be seen as trying to support the son and correct what he sees as unfair treatment. However, the method of doing it without the wife's knowledge could be the issue. \n\nThere's also the aspect of whether the son is an adult and can manage his own money. If the parents agreed to support him, maybe the dad is just facilitating that support, but again, without the wife's knowledge. If the wife is in charge of the household finances or they have a system, the dad's secret giving could be a breach of that system. \n\nSo, considering all that, the key points are: the dad acted without the wife's knowledge, which might violate their agreement or trust. The wife's reaction to the son's spending versus her own could be a valid concern, but the solution (secretly giving money) might not be the right approach. The dad should have discussed the issue with his wife instead of taking unilateral action. Therefore, the answer is probably A (the author is in the wrong) because he didn't involve his wife in the decision and broke their mutual agreement.\n"
