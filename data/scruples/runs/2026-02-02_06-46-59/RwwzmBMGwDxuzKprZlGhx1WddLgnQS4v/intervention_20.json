When he came back home, my wife had a go at him for spending $7 on a meal...\n\nI came back from work and she told me what happened... I said \"I will talk to him about it.\" but when I went to his room I just told him \"Don't worry about it.\"\n\nWhen I came back to the kitchen she told me \"Do you like my new perfume?\" I told her it was nice and all.. and when I asked her how much she paid for it, she said $160.. that was when I was displeased. I closed the kitchen door and said \"You just started boiling at [my son's name] for spending $7 on a meal whereas you spent $160 on your perfume, where's the fairness in that?\" she got upset and went to the bathroom.\n\nTwo weeks ago I started giving my son money without my wife's knowledge. My son isn't the type of person to spend it on drugs or some other toxins, in-fact he uses the money as a mature adult and entertains himself with food or other things every now and then.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to work through this. The user is asking if the father is in the wrong for giving his son money without the wife's knowledge. The situation is a bit complex, so I need to break it down.\n\nFirst, the parents agreed to let their son stay at home during university. The father mentions that money isn't an obstacle, but there's a big disparity in how each family member spends. The wife is upset with the son for spending $7 on a meal, while she spends $160 on a perfume. The father talks to the son, and the wife gets upset when the father points out the inconsistency. Then the father starts giving the son money without telling the wife.\n\nNow, the key points here are about the father's actions. The main question is whether he's wrong for giving money without the wife's knowledge. Let me consider the dynamics. The parents are a team, so major decisions about finances usually require mutual agreement. Even though the father might think the wife is being unfair, by secretly giving money to the son, he's undermining the wife's authority and the household's financial management. The wife's reaction to the son's spending might be excessive, but it's her role to manage the household budget (assuming they share it). The father's secret action could lead to conflicts, as the wife might not be aware of the extra money the son is getting. \n\nAlso, the father's motivation is to support the son because he disagrees with the wife's approach. But bypassing the wife in financial decisions could create more problems. The wife might feel disrespected or that her input is disregarded. Even if the father's intention is good, the method is problematic. In a marriage, transparency and communication are key, especially regarding shared finances. The father might not be wrong in wanting to support his son, but the way he did it without discussing it with his wife is where he's at fault. So, the answer is likely A (Yes, he's in the wrong).\n"
