When he came back home, my wife had a go at him for spending $7 on a meal...\n\nI came back from work and she told me what happened... I said \"I will talk to him about it.\" but when I went to his room I just told him \"Don't worry about it.\"\n\nWhen I came back to the kitchen she told me \"Do you like my new perfume?\" I told her it was nice and all.. and when I asked her how much she paid for it, she said $160.. that was when I was displeased. I closed the kitchen door and said \"You just started boiling at [my son's name] for spending $7 on a meal whereas you spent $160 on your perfume, where's the fairness in that?\" she got upset and went to the bathroom.\n\nTwo weeks ago I started giving my son money without my wife's knowledge. My son isn't the type of person to spend it on drugs or some other toxins, in-fact he uses the money as a mature adult and entertains himself with food or other things every now and then.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author (the person who wrote the story) is in the wrong for giving their son money without the wife's knowledge.\n\nFirst, the situation: They agreed to let their son live at home while he's in university. The family has enough money, but there's a big disparity in how each member spends. The wife is upset when the son spends $7 on a meal, but she bought a $160 perfume. The author confronts the wife about this, and then starts giving money to the son secretly.\n\nSo, the key points here are about fairness in spending, communication between the parents, and the author's decision to bypass the wife. The author thinks the wife is being hypocritical by criticizing the son for a small expense while spending much more on herself. But then, the author decides to give the son money without telling the wife, which is the main issue here.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. Let's consider the arguments. On one hand, the author is trying to support their son and correct what they see as an unfair situation. They believe the wife is being unreasonable. On the other hand, the author is being dishonest by not involving the wife in financial decisions, which could lead to bigger problems. The wife might feel disrespected or manipulated. Also, even if the author thinks the wife is wrong, giving money without her knowledge undermines the partnership in the marriage. Financial decisions, especially involving children, should ideally be made together to maintain trust and transparency.\n\nIn many relationships, keeping such a secret could be seen as a breach of trust. The author's intention might be good, but the method is problematic. The wife's reaction to the son's spending might be valid or not, but the author shouldn't bypass her to make a point. The secret action of giving money could cause more conflict than it resolves. So, the author is in the wrong for not communicating with the wife and making unilateral decisions that affect the family's finances.\n"
