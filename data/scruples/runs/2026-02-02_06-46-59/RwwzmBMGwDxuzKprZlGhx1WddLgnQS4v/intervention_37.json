When he came back home, my wife had a go at him for spending $7 on a meal...\n\nI came back from work and she told me what happened... I said \"I will talk to him about it.\" but when I went to his room I just told him \"Don't worry about it.\"\n\nWhen I came back to the kitchen she told me \"Do you like my new perfume?\" I told her it was nice and all.. and when I asked her how much she paid for it, she said $160.. that was when I was displeased. I closed the kitchen door and said \"You just started boiling at [my son's name] for spending $7 on a meal whereas you spent $160 on your perfume, where's the fairness in that?\" she got upset and went to the bathroom.\n\nTwo weeks ago I started giving my son money without my wife's knowledge. My son isn't the type of person to spend it on drugs or some other toxins, in-fact he uses the money as a mature adult and entertains himself with food or other things every now and then.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The person is asking if it's their fault for giving their son money secretly without the wife knowing. They mention that they and their wife agreed to let the son live at home during university. The conflict arises when the wife criticizes the son for a $7 meal, while the husband spends $160 on a perfume. The husband then starts giving the son money without the wife's knowledge, probably to help him avoid such criticism.\n\nFirst, the husband's actions of giving money secretly might be a breach of trust. He didn't discuss this with his wife, even though they have agreed on other things like the son living at home. The wife's reaction to the $7 meal could be seen as excessive, but the husband's own purchase of $160 perfume is significantly more expensive. The husband's response to his wife was confrontational, leading to her upset.\n\nThe key issue here is the lack of communication and trust. The husband gave money without discussing it with his wife, which could undermine their joint decision-making regarding their son's finances. Even if the wife's criticism was unfair, the husband's solution was to act behind her back instead of addressing the issue together. This secretive action might cause more harm by creating distrust in the relationship.\n\nAdditionally, the husband's reasoning that money isn't an obstacle but the distribution is an issue is valid, but the method of handling it (secrecy) is problematic. They should have a conversation about their family's financial values and how to support the son appropriately without one parent undermining the other's boundaries.\n\nSo, while the wife's reaction seems harsh, the husband's decision to act without her consent is a bigger issue. Therefore, the husband is in the wrong for not communicating and for undermining his wife's authority in their co-parenting and financial decisions.\n"
