When he came back home, my wife had a go at him for spending $7 on a meal...\n\nI came back from work and she told me what happened... I said \"I will talk to him about it.\" but when I went to his room I just told him \"Don't worry about it.\"\n\nWhen I came back to the kitchen she told me \"Do you like my new perfume?\" I told her it was nice and all.. and when I asked her how much she paid for it, she said $160.. that was when I was displeased. I closed the kitchen door and said \"You just started boiling at [my son's name] for spending $7 on a meal whereas you spent $160 on your perfume, where's the fairness in that?\" she got upset and went to the bathroom.\n\nTwo weeks ago I started giving my son money without my wife's knowledge. My son isn't the type of person to spend it on drugs or some other toxins, in-fact he uses the money as a mature adult and entertains himself with food or other things every now and then.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the father is in the wrong for giving his son money without his wife's knowledge. Let me break down the situation.\n\nFirst, the parents agreed to let their son live at home during university. The father mentions that money isn't an issue, but there's a big disparity in how each family member spends. The wife criticizes the son for spending $7 on a meal, but she spends $160 on a perfume. The father confronts her about this, and then starts giving the son money without her knowing.\n\nSo, the key points here are the financial disparity and the father's actions to secretly support his son. The wife is upset about the son's $7, but spends $160 on herself. The father feels the need to balance this by giving the son money. But he did it without telling his wife, which is the main issue here.\n\nNow, considering family dynamics and partnerships, when you're married, you typically make financial decisions together, especially when it involves supporting children. The father didn't consult his wife, which might have been a breach of trust. Even if he thought it was unfair, the way he handled it by acting alone could be the problem. The wife might feel disrespected or excluded from the decision, leading to conflict.\n\nAlso, giving money to an adult child without the spouse's knowledge could have implications. If the wife is managing the household finances, the father's action might disrupt that. Even though the son is an adult, the parents might have agreed on a certain approach to supporting him, and the father going behind the wife's back could undermine that agreement.\n\nHowever, the father's intention was to correct what he saw as an unfair double standard. The wife's reaction to the son was harsh compared to her own spending, which he found unjust. His action was a response to that, but the method was secret. So, while the intention might be understandable, the secrecy is problematic.\n\nIn terms of right or wrong, the father's action of not informing his wife is likely the main issue. Even if the wife was being unfair, the proper approach would be to discuss it with her and reach a mutual understanding, possibly adjusting their approach to supporting the son. Acting alone could lead to further conflict and a breakdown in communication.\n\nSo, the answer is probably A (Yes, the author is in the wrong) because he didn't communicate with his wife and acted unilaterally, which is a breach of trust in a partnership.\n"
