When he came back home, my wife had a go at him for spending $7 on a meal...\n\nI came back from work and she told me what happened... I said \"I will talk to him about it.\" but when I went to his room I just told him \"Don't worry about it.\"\n\nWhen I came back to the kitchen she told me \"Do you like my new perfume?\" I told her it was nice and all.. and when I asked her how much she paid for it, she said $160.. that was when I was displeased. I closed the kitchen door and said \"You just started boiling at [my son's name] for spending $7 on a meal whereas you spent $160 on your perfume, where's the fairness in that?\" she got upset and went to the bathroom.\n\nTwo weeks ago I started giving my son money without my wife's knowledge. My son isn't the type of person to spend it on drugs or some other toxins, in-fact he uses the money as a mature adult and entertains himself with food or other things every now and then.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The situation involves giving their son money without the wife's knowledge. First, I need to break down the key points.\n\nThe parents agreed to let their son live at home during university. They mention that money isn't an issue, but there's a big disparity in how family members spend. The wife criticizes the son for spending $7 on a meal, while the father notices she spent $160 on perfume. The father then starts giving the son money secretly to balance things out.\n\nSo, the main issue here is the father giving money without the wife's knowledge. Is that wrong? Well, in a marriage, financial decisions are usually shared. Even if the wife's reaction seems unfair, the father's solution is to act behind her back. That could be problematic because it undermines the wife's input and might create tension. The father should communicate his concerns to the wife instead of bypassing her. Also, the father's action might be seen as taking sides in a family matter without addressing the root issue of their differing spending habits.\n\nThe wife's criticism of the son for $7 while spending $160 herself is indeed unfair, but the father's response of giving money secretly isn't the right approach. He should have discussed this with the wife to find a mutual solution. So, the father is in the wrong for not involving the wife in the decision and for not addressing the problem through communication.\n"
