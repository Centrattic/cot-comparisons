When he came back home, my wife had a go at him for spending $7 on a meal...\n\nI came back from work and she told me what happened... I said \"I will talk to him about it.\" but when I went to his room I just told him \"Don't worry about it.\"\n\nWhen I came back to the kitchen she told me \"Do you like my new perfume?\" I told her it was nice and all.. and when I asked her how much she paid for it, she said $160.. that was when I was displeased. I closed the kitchen door and said \"You just started boiling at [my son's name] for spending $7 on a meal whereas you spent $160 on your perfume, where's the fairness in that?\" she got upset and went to the bathroom.\n\nTwo weeks ago I started giving my son money without my wife's knowledge. My son isn't the type of person to spend it on drugs or some other toxins, in-fact he uses the money as a mature adult and entertains himself with food or other things every now and then.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong for giving their son money without their wife's knowledge.\n\nFirst, the situation: The parents agreed to let their son live at home while he's in university. Money isn't an issue for the family, but there's a big disparity in how each family member spends. The wife criticizes the son for spending $7 on a meal, but then the husband notices she spent $160 on perfume. He gets upset, and then starts giving the son money secretly.\n\nSo, the main question is about the husband's actions. Is he wrong for giving the son money without the wife knowing?\n\nHmm. The husband's reasoning is that the wife's $160 perfume is unfair compared to the son's $7 meal. But is that a valid reason to bypass the wife? The wife probably wanted to be involved in decisions about the son's expenses since they had agreed to let him stay at home. By giving money secretly, the husband is undermining the wife's authority and possibly creating a double standard. The wife might feel her concerns aren't being respected, even if she's being overly critical. The husband's action could be seen as meddling in their finances without transparency, which is a problem in any relationship. Even if the money isn't an issue, the secrecy and lack of communication could cause more harm. So, yes, the husband is in the wrong for not discussing this with his wife first. Answer A.\n"
