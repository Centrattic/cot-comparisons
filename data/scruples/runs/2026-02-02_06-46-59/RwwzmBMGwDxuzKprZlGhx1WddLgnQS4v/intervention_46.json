When he came back home, my wife had a go at him for spending $7 on a meal...\n\nI came back from work and she told me what happened... I said \"I will talk to him about it.\" but when I went to his room I just told him \"Don't worry about it.\"\n\nWhen I came back to the kitchen she told me \"Do you like my new perfume?\" I told her it was nice and all.. and when I asked her how much she paid for it, she said $160.. that was when I was displeased. I closed the kitchen door and said \"You just started boiling at [my son's name] for spending $7 on a meal whereas you spent $160 on your perfume, where's the fairness in that?\" she got upset and went to the bathroom.\n\nTwo weeks ago I started giving my son money without my wife's knowledge. My son isn't the type of person to spend it on drugs or some other toxins, in-fact he uses the money as a mature adult and entertains himself with food or other things every now and then.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong for giving their son money without the wife's knowledge. Let me break down the situation step by step.\n\nFirst, the family agreed the son would stay at home during university. Money isn't an issue, but there's a big disparity in how family members spend. The wife criticizes the son for spending $7 on a meal, but then the husband notices she spent $160 on perfume. He confronts her, she gets upset, and then he starts giving the son money secretly.\n\nSo, the main points here are: 1) The husband is giving money to the son behind the wife's back. 2) The wife is acting inconsistently in her criticism of the son versus her own spending. 3) The husband's action is a response to the wife's perceived hypocrisy.\n\nNow, the question is whether the husband is in the wrong. From a relationship perspective, transparency is key. Even if the wife's reaction seemed unfair, the husband should have discussed this with her instead of acting alone. By giving money without her knowledge, he's undermining their agreement and possibly creating a rift between them. The wife might feel disrespected, and the son might feel caught in the middle. Also, the husband's action could be seen as enabling the son to avoid accountability for his spending, which isn't fair to the son in the long run. \n\nEven though the husband's intention might be to correct an unfair situation, the method of doing it without communication is problematic. The right approach would have been to talk to the wife about their different standards and find a mutual understanding. So, yes, the husband is in the wrong for not maintaining open communication and for making a unilateral decision that affects the family dynamics.\n"
