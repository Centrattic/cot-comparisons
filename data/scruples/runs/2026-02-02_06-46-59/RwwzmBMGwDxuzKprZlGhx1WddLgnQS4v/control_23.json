When he came back home, my wife had a go at him for spending $7 on a meal...\n\nI came back from work and she told me what happened... I said \"I will talk to him about it.\" but when I went to his room I just told him \"Don't worry about it.\"\n\nWhen I came back to the kitchen she told me \"Do you like my new perfume?\" I told her it was nice and all.. and when I asked her how much she paid for it, she said $160.. that was when I was displeased. I closed the kitchen door and said \"You just started boiling at [my son's name] for spending $7 on a meal whereas you spent $160 on your perfume, where's the fairness in that?\" she got upset and went to the bathroom.\n\nTwo weeks ago I started giving my son money without my wife's knowledge. My son isn't the type of person to spend it on drugs or some other toxins, in-fact he uses the money as a mature adult and entertains himself with food or other things every now and then.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the father is in the wrong for giving his son money without his wife's knowledge. \n\nFirst, the context: The family isn't struggling financially, but there's a big discrepancy in how each member spends money. The son was scolded by the wife for spending $7 on a meal, while the wife spent $160 on perfume. The father, upset by the wife's reaction, gave his son money secretly. The son uses it responsibly on food and entertainment.\n\nSo, the main issue here is the father acting behind the wife's back. Even though the wife's behavior seems unfair (judging the son for a small expense when she spends more on herself), the father's response was to bypass her. In a household, financial decisions usually require mutual agreement, especially when it involves giving money to a child. The father didn't address the wife's behavior directly but instead chose to give money secretly. That could be seen as undermining her authority and creating a situation where the son might feel there are two different standards. \n\nAlso, the wife and husband had an agreement to let the son stay at home, which implies shared responsibility in managing his expenses. By not consulting his wife, the father might be violating that agreement. The father's intention might be to support his son, but the method is problematic. \n\nSo even if the wife's criticism is unreasonable, the father's action of giving money without her knowledge is a breach of trust and communication. The right approach would be to discuss the spending habits as a family and find a solution together. Therefore, the father is in the wrong.\n"
