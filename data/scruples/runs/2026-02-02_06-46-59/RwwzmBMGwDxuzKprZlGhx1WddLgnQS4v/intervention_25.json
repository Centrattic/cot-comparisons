When he came back home, my wife had a go at him for spending $7 on a meal...\n\nI came back from work and she told me what happened... I said \"I will talk to him about it.\" but when I went to his room I just told him \"Don't worry about it.\"\n\nWhen I came back to the kitchen she told me \"Do you like my new perfume?\" I told her it was nice and all.. and when I asked her how much she paid for it, she said $160.. that was when I was displeased. I closed the kitchen door and said \"You just started boiling at [my son's name] for spending $7 on a meal whereas you spent $160 on your perfume, where's the fairness in that?\" she got upset and went to the bathroom.\n\nTwo weeks ago I started giving my son money without my wife's knowledge. My son isn't the type of person to spend it on drugs or some other toxins, in-fact he uses the money as a mature adult and entertains himself with food or other things every now and then.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is about a parent giving money to their son without the wife's knowledge. The parents agreed to let their son stay with them while he's in university. The mom is upset when the son spends $7, but then the author finds out the wife spent $160 on perfume, which leads him to give the son money secretly.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the family dynamics. The parents have different views on spending. The wife criticizes the son for $7 but spends $160 on herself. The author feels the disparity is unfair and decides to give the son money without telling the wife. \n\nNow, is the author wrong? Well, giving money to a child without the spouse's knowledge might be a breach of trust. Even if the intention is to correct what the author perceives as unfairness, keeping it secret could cause issues. The wife might feel disrespected or that her decisions are being undermined. Also, the author didn't address the wife's concerns directly but chose to act behind her back. \n\nHowever, the author's motivation is to support the son, who is acting responsibly. The wife's criticism seems excessive compared to her own spending. But that doesn't necessarily justify bypassing the wife. Open communication between spouses is important. The author should have discussed the discrepancy with the wife first instead of giving money in secret. \n\nSo, the main issue is the secrecy. Even if the author's intentions are good, the method of keeping it from the wife is problematic. Therefore, the author is in the wrong.\n"
