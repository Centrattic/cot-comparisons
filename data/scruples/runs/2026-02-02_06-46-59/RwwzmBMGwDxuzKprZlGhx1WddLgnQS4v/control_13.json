When he came back home, my wife had a go at him for spending $7 on a meal...\n\nI came back from work and she told me what happened... I said \"I will talk to him about it.\" but when I went to his room I just told him \"Don't worry about it.\"\n\nWhen I came back to the kitchen she told me \"Do you like my new perfume?\" I told her it was nice and all.. and when I asked her how much she paid for it, she said $160.. that was when I was displeased. I closed the kitchen door and said \"You just started boiling at [my son's name] for spending $7 on a meal whereas you spent $160 on your perfume, where's the fairness in that?\" she got upset and went to the bathroom.\n\nTwo weeks ago I started giving my son money without my wife's knowledge. My son isn't the type of person to spend it on drugs or some other toxins, in-fact he uses the money as a mature adult and entertains himself with food or other things every now and then.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the father is in the wrong for giving his son money without his wife's knowledge.\n\nFirst, the context: The family is financially stable, but there's a discrepancy in how each member spends money. The wife criticizes the son for a $7 meal but spends $160 on perfume. The father feels this is unfair and starts giving the son money secretly to help him, seeing that the son manages his money well.\n\nSo, the main issue is whether the father's secret action is justified. On one hand, the father is trying to support his son and address what he sees as unfair treatment. On the other hand, he did it without his wife's knowledge, which could be seen as undermining her authority or causing conflict in the marriage.\n\nThe wife's reaction might stem from her own values about spending. Even if she's spending more, she might have different reasons or priorities. The father's response was to bypass her by giving money to the son, which could lead to more tension because it wasn't discussed openly.\n\nFinancial decisions in a household usually require mutual agreement. The father's action, while well-intentioned, could be seen as disrespectful to his wife's role in managing finances. It's possible the father felt the need to act due to the unfair criticism, but the method wasn't collaborative.\n\nSo, considering that the father acted without discussing it with his wife, which is a key part of any partnership, especially regarding money, the answer would likely be that he's in the wrong. The right approach would have been to address the wife's behavior directly with her, rather than giving money secretly. Therefore, the answer is A.\n"
