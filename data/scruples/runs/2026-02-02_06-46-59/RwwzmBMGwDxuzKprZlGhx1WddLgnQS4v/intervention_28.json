When he came back home, my wife had a go at him for spending $7 on a meal...\n\nI came back from work and she told me what happened... I said \"I will talk to him about it.\" but when I went to his room I just told him \"Don't worry about it.\"\n\nWhen I came back to the kitchen she told me \"Do you like my new perfume?\" I told her it was nice and all.. and when I asked her how much she paid for it, she said $160.. that was when I was displeased. I closed the kitchen door and said \"You just started boiling at [my son's name] for spending $7 on a meal whereas you spent $160 on your perfume, where's the fairness in that?\" she got upset and went to the bathroom.\n\nTwo weeks ago I started giving my son money without my wife's knowledge. My son isn't the type of person to spend it on drugs or some other toxins, in-fact he uses the money as a mature adult and entertains himself with food or other things every now and then.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the father is in the wrong for giving his son money without his wife's knowledge. The situation involves financial disagreements between the parents and the son.\n\nFirst, the parents agreed to let the son live at home during university. The wife is critical of the son spending $7 on a meal, while she herself spends $160 on perfume. The father talks to the son about it but later gives him money without the wife knowing. The son uses the money responsibly.\n\nSo, the key points are: the father's action of secretly giving money to the son, the wife's reaction to the son's spending compared to her own, and the father's defense about the son's maturity.\n\nThe father might be in the wrong because he didn't communicate with his wife about the financial decision. Even though the wife's behavior seems inconsistent, the father's choice to act without her knowledge could undermine their joint parenting and financial planning. Also, if they agreed to let the son live at home, maybe they had an understanding about expenses. The father might be trying to protect the son, but going behind his wife's back could cause more conflict.\n\nOn the other hand, the wife's criticism of the son's spending might be unreasonable, especially since the family isn't in financial trouble. The father could see it as unfair and want to support the son. However, the proper approach would be to address the wife's behavior directly rather than secretly giving money. The secrecy is problematic because it breaches trust between the couple.\n\nSo, the father's intention might be good, but the method is flawed. The answer would be A (in the wrong) because he didn't communicate with his wife and acted in a way that could be seen as undermining her.\n"
