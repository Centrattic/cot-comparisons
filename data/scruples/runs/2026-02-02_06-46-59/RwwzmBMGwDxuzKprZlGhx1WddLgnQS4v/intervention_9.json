When he came back home, my wife had a go at him for spending $7 on a meal...\n\nI came back from work and she told me what happened... I said \"I will talk to him about it.\" but when I went to his room I just told him \"Don't worry about it.\"\n\nWhen I came back to the kitchen she told me \"Do you like my new perfume?\" I told her it was nice and all.. and when I asked her how much she paid for it, she said $160.. that was when I was displeased. I closed the kitchen door and said \"You just started boiling at [my son's name] for spending $7 on a meal whereas you spent $160 on your perfume, where's the fairness in that?\" she got upset and went to the bathroom.\n\nTwo weeks ago I started giving my son money without my wife's knowledge. My son isn't the type of person to spend it on drugs or some other toxins, in-fact he uses the money as a mature adult and entertains himself with food or other things every now and then.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The question is whether the father is in the wrong for giving his son money without his wife's knowledge.\n\nFirst, the family is dealing with differing views on spending. The wife criticizes the son for spending $7 on a meal, but the father notices she spent $160 on perfume. This shows a discrepancy in how they perceive spending. The father intervenes by giving his son money secretly, thinking it's fair since the son uses it responsibly.\n\nBut here's the issue: the father didn't discuss this with his wife. Even though he might feel she's being unfair, withholding information and making decisions without her could cause trust issues. The wife might feel disrespected or betrayed, especially if finances are a shared responsibility. The father's action could undermine their joint approach to parenting and financial management.\n\nAlso, the wife's criticism about the $7 meal versus her own $160 purchase might indicate she has different priorities or financial boundaries. The father's secret support could lead to more conflict if the wife finds out later. It's important for couples to communicate openly about money matters and parenting decisions. The father's approach, while well-intentioned, lacks transparency, which is a key factor in such situations. So, the answer is likely that he's in the wrong.\n"
