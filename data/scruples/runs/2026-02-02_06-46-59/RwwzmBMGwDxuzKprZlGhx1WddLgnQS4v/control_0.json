When he came back home, my wife had a go at him for spending $7 on a meal...\n\nI came back from work and she told me what happened... I said \"I will talk to him about it.\" but when I went to his room I just told him \"Don't worry about it.\"\n\nWhen I came back to the kitchen she told me \"Do you like my new perfume?\" I told her it was nice and all.. and when I asked her how much she paid for it, she said $160.. that was when I was displeased. I closed the kitchen door and said \"You just started boiling at [my son's name] for spending $7 on a meal whereas you spent $160 on your perfume, where's the fairness in that?\" she got upset and went to the bathroom.\n\nTwo weeks ago I started giving my son money without my wife's knowledge. My son isn't the type of person to spend it on drugs or some other toxins, in-fact he uses the money as a mature adult and entertains himself with food or other things every now and then.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for giving his son money without his wife's knowledge.\n\nFirst, the family situation: the son is in university close by, living at home. The parents agree to this. The family isn't short on money, but there's a big difference in how each member's money is managed. The wife criticizes the son for spending $7 on a meal, while the husband later finds out she spent $160 on perfume. The husband is upset about the double standard and starts giving the son money secretly.\n\nSo, the main issue here is the lack of communication between the husband and wife. The husband didn't talk to his wife about his actions. Instead of addressing the discrepancy together, he took matters into his own hands by providing money to the son without her knowing. That seems like a problem because it undermines their partnership in parenting and financial decisions. Even if the wife's reaction to the son's spending was harsh, the husband's solution was to bypass her, which could lead to more conflict. The right approach might have been to discuss the spending habits and agree on a consistent method for supporting the son, rather than acting unilaterally. So, the husband is in the wrong for not communicating and for not involving his wife in the decision. Therefore, the answer is A.\n"
