When he came back home, my wife had a go at him for spending $7 on a meal...\n\nI came back from work and she told me what happened... I said \"I will talk to him about it.\" but when I went to his room I just told him \"Don't worry about it.\"\n\nWhen I came back to the kitchen she told me \"Do you like my new perfume?\" I told her it was nice and all.. and when I asked her how much she paid for it, she said $160.. that was when I was displeased. I closed the kitchen door and said \"You just started boiling at [my son's name] for spending $7 on a meal whereas you spent $160 on your perfume, where's the fairness in that?\" she got upset and went to the bathroom.\n\nTwo weeks ago I started giving my son money without my wife's knowledge. My son isn't the type of person to spend it on drugs or some other toxins, in-fact he uses the money as a mature adult and entertains himself with food or other things every now and then.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong for giving money to their son without the wife's knowledge. The answer options are A (yes) or B (no). I need to figure out based on the details provided.\n\nFirst, the situation: The parents let their son live at home while he's in university. The husband gives the son money secretly because he's upset about the wife spending $160 on perfume while criticizing the son for $7. The husband thinks the wife is being unfair, so he takes action by giving the son money without her knowing. The key points here are the parents' agreement to let the son stay, the financial aspects, and the husband's actions.\n\nNow, considering the ethical angle. The parents are supposed to work together on managing their household finances, even if they have different views. The husband's action of giving money without the wife's knowledge might be seen as undermining their partnership. Even if the wife's criticism of the son seems excessive, the husband's response is to bypass her by directly giving money. That could be a problem because it doesn't address the underlying issue between them and might create more conflict. \n\nOn the other hand, the husband might feel that his wife is being unfair, and he wants to support his son. However, the proper approach would be to discuss the issue with his wife rather than act unilaterally. By giving the son money without her knowledge, he's not solving the problem but creating another one. The wife might feel disrespected, and the son might not learn about financial responsibility if his father is secretly subsidizing him. \n\nAlso, the husband's justification is that the family has enough money, but the distribution is unequal. However, how they manage their finances is a mutual decision. If the husband is giving money to the son without the wife's consent, it's a breach of trust. The wife might have her own reasons for being strict with the son's spending, and the husband's actions could be seen as meddling in the parenting role. \n\nIn summary, even if the husband's intentions are good, acting without the spouse's knowledge in financial matters is generally considered wrong. It's about respecting the partnership and addressing issues through communication rather than unilateral actions. So the answer is likely A (the author is in the wrong).\n"
