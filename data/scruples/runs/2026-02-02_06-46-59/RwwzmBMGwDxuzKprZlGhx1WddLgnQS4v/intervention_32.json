When he came back home, my wife had a go at him for spending $7 on a meal...\n\nI came back from work and she told me what happened... I said \"I will talk to him about it.\" but when I went to his room I just told him \"Don't worry about it.\"\n\nWhen I came back to the kitchen she told me \"Do you like my new perfume?\" I told her it was nice and all.. and when I asked her how much she paid for it, she said $160.. that was when I was displeased. I closed the kitchen door and said \"You just started boiling at [my son's name] for spending $7 on a meal whereas you spent $160 on your perfume, where's the fairness in that?\" she got upset and went to the bathroom.\n\nTwo weeks ago I started giving my son money without my wife's knowledge. My son isn't the type of person to spend it on drugs or some other toxins, in-fact he uses the money as a mature adult and entertains himself with food or other things every now and then.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this scenario. The user is asking whether the author (the father) is in the wrong for giving his son money without his wife's knowledge.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the situation. The couple agreed to let their son live at home while attending university. They have enough money, but there's a big disparity in how each family member spends. The wife criticized the son for a $7 meal, then the father found out she spent $160 on perfume. The father then started giving the son money secretly.\n\nSo, the main points are: the father is trying to balance what he sees as unfair spending. The wife spends $160 on perfume while criticizing her son for $7. The father's action is a response to this, but he did it without his wife's knowledge.\n\nNow, considering family dynamics. The wife and husband might have different views on money management. The father's action could be seen as undermining the wife's authority. If they are co-parenting, making decisions without the other parent might be a problem. Also, giving money without telling the spouse could lead to trust issues.\n\nFrom a fairness perspective, the father is addressing a perceived imbalance. But the method\u2014secrecy\u2014might be the issue. The wife might feel disrespected or that her parenting decisions are being overruled. The son might also get confused if one parent is giving money while the other is scolding for spending. This could create conflict in the household.\n\nAnother angle: financial management in marriage. Couples usually share financial responsibilities. If the father made a decision without discussing it with his wife, that could be seen as a breach of trust, regardless of the intent. Even if the wife's behavior was harsh, the father's solution is to bypass her, which might not be the right approach. They should have communicated and found a mutual solution instead of acting unilaterally.\n\nAlso, the son is an adult, but living at home and being given money by one parent might affect his financial independence. But the father's intention is to help the son, which is positive, but the method is problematic.\n\nSo, putting it all together: The father's action is a response to his wife's behavior, but the way he did it (without her knowledge) is the problem. The father should have discussed this with his wife instead of acting alone. Therefore, he is in the wrong for not being transparent and for not addressing the issue through communication.\n"
