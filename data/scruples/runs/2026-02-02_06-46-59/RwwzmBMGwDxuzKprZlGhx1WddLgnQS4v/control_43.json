When he came back home, my wife had a go at him for spending $7 on a meal...\n\nI came back from work and she told me what happened... I said \"I will talk to him about it.\" but when I went to his room I just told him \"Don't worry about it.\"\n\nWhen I came back to the kitchen she told me \"Do you like my new perfume?\" I told her it was nice and all.. and when I asked her how much she paid for it, she said $160.. that was when I was displeased. I closed the kitchen door and said \"You just started boiling at [my son's name] for spending $7 on a meal whereas you spent $160 on your perfume, where's the fairness in that?\" she got upset and went to the bathroom.\n\nTwo weeks ago I started giving my son money without my wife's knowledge. My son isn't the type of person to spend it on drugs or some other toxins, in-fact he uses the money as a mature adult and entertains himself with food or other things every now and then.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The user wants a yes or no answer based on the given scenario. Let me start by breaking down the situation.\n\nFirst, the parents agreed that their son would stay at home during university. The father gives money to his son secretly, without the wife's knowledge. The wife scolded the son for spending $7 on a meal, while the father later points out that she spent $160 on perfume. The father's action is giving money to the son without informing the wife.\n\nSo, the main issues here are: 1) Did the father overstep by giving money without the wife's knowledge? 2) Is there a fairness issue in how money is managed in the household?\n\nStarting with the first point: the wife and husband are co-parents, and if they made an agreement about their son living at home, they should be on the same page regarding any financial support. By giving money to the son without telling the wife, the father might be undermining their shared agreement. Even if money isn't tight, the wife's authority and perspective are important. The father's action could lead to conflict because the wife isn't informed, which might make her feel disrespected or betrayed, especially if she had a different approach to managing expenses.\n\nSecond point: The father is pointing out the wife's own spending as contradictory. While the wife criticized the son for $7, he points out her $160 perfume. This could lead to a double standard, but the father's approach of secretly giving money might not be the right way to address it. Instead of confronting her with the perfume purchase, maybe discussing their financial priorities as a couple would have been better.\n\nAlso, the father's intention is to support his son, which is understandable. However, the method of doing so without the wife's consent might be problematic. Even if the son is responsible with money, the parents should coordinate their approach to avoid conflict and ensure they're both involved in decisions affecting their finances and their child's upbringing.\n\nIn many households, major financial decisions are made jointly. Even if they agreed to let the son live at home, any additional support like giving him money could be considered part of that agreement. The father's action could be seen as bypassing the wife's role in financial decisions, which is a breach of trust and teamwork in the marriage.\n\nThe wife's reaction to the son's spending might be her way of instilling financial responsibility, which the father is challenging. But instead of giving money secretly, they should have discussed their differing views on expenses. The father's approach might have caused more harm by creating a divide between him and his wife rather than addressing the underlying issue together.\n\nSo, putting this all together, the father did act in the son's best interest, but the method of doing so without the wife's knowledge is likely where he's in the wrong. The key here is the lack of transparency and communication between the spouses, which is essential in a partnership. Therefore, the answer would be A (Yes, the author is in the wrong).\n"
