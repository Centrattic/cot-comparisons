When he came back home, my wife had a go at him for spending $7 on a meal...\n\nI came back from work and she told me what happened... I said \"I will talk to him about it.\" but when I went to his room I just told him \"Don't worry about it.\"\n\nWhen I came back to the kitchen she told me \"Do you like my new perfume?\" I told her it was nice and all.. and when I asked her how much she paid for it, she said $160.. that was when I was displeased. I closed the kitchen door and said \"You just started boiling at [my son's name] for spending $7 on a meal whereas you spent $160 on your perfume, where's the fairness in that?\" she got upset and went to the bathroom.\n\nTwo weeks ago I started giving my son money without my wife's knowledge. My son isn't the type of person to spend it on drugs or some other toxins, in-fact he uses the money as a mature adult and entertains himself with food or other things every now and then.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the story is in the wrong for giving their son money without the wife's knowledge.\n\nFirst, the parents had an agreement that the son would stay with them during university. The father noticed a discrepancy in how the wife and son were being treated regarding spending money. The son was criticized for spending $7 on a meal, while the wife bought a $160 perfume and wasn't reprimanded. The father felt this was unfair, so he started giving the son money secretly.\n\nHmm. The main issue here is whether the father overstepped by not discussing this with his wife. Money is a big topic in a marriage, and keeping such a significant decision from the spouse could be problematic. Even if the father thought the wife was being unfair to the son, the right approach might have been to talk to her about their differing standards rather than acting behind her back. By giving the son money without her knowledge, the father might be undermining their agreement and could create more conflict. The wife might feel disrespected or that her authority is being bypassed. \n\nAlso, the father's action could lead to financial strain if the wife isn't aware of these additional expenditures. Even though the family has enough money, transparency is key in a marriage, especially regarding shared responsibilities like supporting a child through university. The father's solution was a secret one, which might not be the healthiest way to handle the situation. \n\nOn the other hand, the wife's criticism of the son for a small expense while she spends more on herself might be seen as inconsistent. But the father's response was to act alone instead of addressing the issue together. So, while the wife's behavior might be part of the problem, the father's secrecy is a breach of trust. Therefore, the father is likely in the wrong for not communicating with his wife and handling the matter behind her back.\n"
