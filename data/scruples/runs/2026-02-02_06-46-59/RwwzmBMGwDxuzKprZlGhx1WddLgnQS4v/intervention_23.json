When he came back home, my wife had a go at him for spending $7 on a meal...\n\nI came back from work and she told me what happened... I said \"I will talk to him about it.\" but when I went to his room I just told him \"Don't worry about it.\"\n\nWhen I came back to the kitchen she told me \"Do you like my new perfume?\" I told her it was nice and all.. and when I asked her how much she paid for it, she said $160.. that was when I was displeased. I closed the kitchen door and said \"You just started boiling at [my son's name] for spending $7 on a meal whereas you spent $160 on your perfume, where's the fairness in that?\" she got upset and went to the bathroom.\n\nTwo weeks ago I started giving my son money without my wife's knowledge. My son isn't the type of person to spend it on drugs or some other toxins, in-fact he uses the money as a mature adult and entertains himself with food or other things every now and then.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong. The situation is that the author gave their son money without the wife's knowledge. The parents agreed to let the son stay at home during university. The wife criticized the son for spending $7 on a meal, while the author later gave the son money and the wife spent $160 on perfume, leading to a conflict.\n\nFirst, the author and wife are in a partnership, so financial decisions usually require mutual agreement. By giving the son money without the wife's knowledge, the author might have disregarded her input. The wife's reaction to the son's $7 meal versus her own $160 purchase shows a possible inconsistency in their household's approach to money. The author's action of secretly giving money could be seen as undermining the wife's authority or the agreed-upon family financial rules. Even though the author's intention was to support the son, the method involved secrecy, which can cause distrust. So, the author might be in the wrong for not communicating with the wife before making the decision. But maybe there's more to consider, like if the wife was being unfair in her criticism. However, the main issue here is the lack of transparency. Therefore, the answer is likely A.\n"
