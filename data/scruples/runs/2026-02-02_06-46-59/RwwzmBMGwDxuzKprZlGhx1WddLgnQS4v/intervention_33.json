When he came back home, my wife had a go at him for spending $7 on a meal...\n\nI came back from work and she told me what happened... I said \"I will talk to him about it.\" but when I went to his room I just told him \"Don't worry about it.\"\n\nWhen I came back to the kitchen she told me \"Do you like my new perfume?\" I told her it was nice and all.. and when I asked her how much she paid for it, she said $160.. that was when I was displeased. I closed the kitchen door and said \"You just started boiling at [my son's name] for spending $7 on a meal whereas you spent $160 on your perfume, where's the fairness in that?\" she got upset and went to the bathroom.\n\nTwo weeks ago I started giving my son money without my wife's knowledge. My son isn't the type of person to spend it on drugs or some other toxins, in-fact he uses the money as a mature adult and entertains himself with food or other things every now and then.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong for giving their son money without the wife's knowledge. Let me start by breaking down the situation.\n\nFirst, the parents agreed to have their son live at home during university. Money isn't a problem in the household, but there's a big disparity in how each family member spends. The wife criticized the son for spending $7 on a meal, but then the husband found out she spent $160 on perfume. He confronted her, she got upset, and then he started giving the son money secretly.\n\nHmm. The key points here are about fairness and communication. The husband feels the wife is being inconsistent with their son's spending versus her own. But by giving the son money without telling the wife, he's bypassing her and not addressing the issue openly. That could be a problem because financial decisions in a household usually require mutual agreement, especially if they're married. The author might be trying to support his son, but doing it behind his wife's back could lead to more conflict. It's possible the wife might feel disrespected or that her boundaries are being ignored. Even though the son is responsible, the husband's actions could undermine the wife's authority and create tension. The right approach might have been to discuss the spending habits as a couple first instead of taking unilateral action. So, I think the answer is A, the author is in the wrong because he didn't communicate with his wife and acted secretly, which could harm their relationship.\n"
