When he came back home, my wife had a go at him for spending $7 on a meal...\n\nI came back from work and she told me what happened... I said \"I will talk to him about it.\" but when I went to his room I just told him \"Don't worry about it.\"\n\nWhen I came back to the kitchen she told me \"Do you like my new perfume?\" I told her it was nice and all.. and when I asked her how much she paid for it, she said $160.. that was when I was displeased. I closed the kitchen door and said \"You just started boiling at [my son's name] for spending $7 on a meal whereas you spent $160 on your perfume, where's the fairness in that?\" she got upset and went to the bathroom.\n\nTwo weeks ago I started giving my son money without my wife's knowledge. My son isn't the type of person to spend it on drugs or some other toxins, in-fact he uses the money as a mature adult and entertains himself with food or other things every now and then.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let me try to work through this. The question is whether the person who wrote the story is in the wrong for giving their son money without the wife's knowledge.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The couple agreed to let their son live at home during university. Money isn't tight for the household, but there's a big disparity in how each family member spends. The wife criticizes the son for a $7 meal, but the husband later finds out she spent $160 on perfume. The husband is upset about the double standard and starts giving the son money secretly. The son uses it responsibly.\n\nSo, the main points here are the secrecy and the double standard. The husband didn't inform the wife about giving money to their son. That could be a breach of trust between spouses. Even if the wife's criticism was unfair, the husband's response was to act behind her back. That might not be the best approach. \n\nHusbands and wives usually share financial responsibilities, especially when it comes to their children. The husband might feel that the wife is being too strict, but giving money without her knowledge could undermine her authority and create more conflict. The wife might feel disrespected or excluded from decisions about their child's finances.\n\nOn the other hand, the husband might believe he's helping their son by balancing the apparent unfairness. But the right approach might have been to discuss the situation openly with his wife, address the double standard, and find a solution together. Acting in secrecy could lead to bigger issues, like lack of communication or trust.\n\nSo, even if the husband's intentions were good, the method of keeping it a secret is problematic. Therefore, he's in the wrong for not being transparent with his wife.\n"
