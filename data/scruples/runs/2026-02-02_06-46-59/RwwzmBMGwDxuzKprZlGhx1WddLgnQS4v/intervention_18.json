When he came back home, my wife had a go at him for spending $7 on a meal...\n\nI came back from work and she told me what happened... I said \"I will talk to him about it.\" but when I went to his room I just told him \"Don't worry about it.\"\n\nWhen I came back to the kitchen she told me \"Do you like my new perfume?\" I told her it was nice and all.. and when I asked her how much she paid for it, she said $160.. that was when I was displeased. I closed the kitchen door and said \"You just started boiling at [my son's name] for spending $7 on a meal whereas you spent $160 on your perfume, where's the fairness in that?\" she got upset and went to the bathroom.\n\nTwo weeks ago I started giving my son money without my wife's knowledge. My son isn't the type of person to spend it on drugs or some other toxins, in-fact he uses the money as a mature adult and entertains himself with food or other things every now and then.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, so the user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for giving their son money without the wife's knowledge. Let me break down the situation.\n\nFirst, the parents agreed to let their son live at home during university. Money isn't an issue for the household, but there's a big disparity in how each family member spends. The son spent $7 on a meal, and the wife criticized him. Then the husband found out the wife spent $160 on perfume and confronted her. He then started giving the son money secretly.\n\nHmm, the key points here are about communication and fairness. The husband didn't think the wife's criticism of the son's spending was fair, especially after her own expense. But by giving money to the son without telling the wife, he's breaking trust and not addressing the underlying issue in the marriage. \n\nThe wife's reaction might be about different priorities, but the husband's solution is to bypass her, which isn't a good way to resolve conflicts. Instead of discussing their differing spending habits and setting clear boundaries with the son, he took a secret action. That could lead to more resentment and problems. So, even if his intention was to support his son, the method was wrong because it involved deceit. Therefore, the author is in the wrong.\n"
