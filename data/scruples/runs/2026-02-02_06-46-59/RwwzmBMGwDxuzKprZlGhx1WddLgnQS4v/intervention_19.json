When he came back home, my wife had a go at him for spending $7 on a meal...\n\nI came back from work and she told me what happened... I said \"I will talk to him about it.\" but when I went to his room I just told him \"Don't worry about it.\"\n\nWhen I came back to the kitchen she told me \"Do you like my new perfume?\" I told her it was nice and all.. and when I asked her how much she paid for it, she said $160.. that was when I was displeased. I closed the kitchen door and said \"You just started boiling at [my son's name] for spending $7 on a meal whereas you spent $160 on your perfume, where's the fairness in that?\" she got upset and went to the bathroom.\n\nTwo weeks ago I started giving my son money without my wife's knowledge. My son isn't the type of person to spend it on drugs or some other toxins, in-fact he uses the money as a mature adult and entertains himself with food or other things every now and then.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The situation is about giving their son money without the wife's knowledge. I need to figure out if that's wrong.\n\nFirst, the parents agreed to let their son stay at home during university. They say money isn't an obstacle, but there's a big disparity in how family members are treated financially. The son spent $7 on a meal, and the wife criticized him. The dad defended him, then later gave the son money secretly after the wife spent $160 on perfume. The dad's reasoning is that the wife was being unfair, so he wanted to balance it out.\n\nNow, to determine if the dad is wrong. The key points are: giving money without the wife's knowledge, the wife's reaction to the son's spending versus her own, and the dad's actions to counterbalance that. \n\nOn one hand, the dad might think he's supporting his son and teaching fairness. On the other hand, giving money without the spouse's knowledge could be seen as undermining their partnership. The wife might feel disrespected or that her financial decisions are being challenged. Even if money isn't tight, the secrecy is a problem. Also, the dad's approach of giving money privately might not address the root issue between the wife and son's spending habits. It could lead to more conflict if the wife finds out and feels betrayed.\n\nSo, while the dad's intentions might be good, the method\u2014keeping it secret from his wife\u2014is problematic. It's about how he handled the situation rather than the act itself. The wrong here is likely the lack of communication with his spouse. Therefore, the answer would be A (the author is in the wrong).\n"
