When he came back home, my wife had a go at him for spending $7 on a meal...\n\nI came back from work and she told me what happened... I said \"I will talk to him about it.\" but when I went to his room I just told him \"Don't worry about it.\"\n\nWhen I came back to the kitchen she told me \"Do you like my new perfume?\" I told her it was nice and all.. and when I asked her how much she paid for it, she said $160.. that was when I was displeased. I closed the kitchen door and said \"You just started boiling at [my son's name] for spending $7 on a meal whereas you spent $160 on your perfume, where's the fairness in that?\" she got upset and went to the bathroom.\n\nTwo weeks ago I started giving my son money without my wife's knowledge. My son isn't the type of person to spend it on drugs or some other toxins, in-fact he uses the money as a mature adult and entertains himself with food or other things every now and then.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong for giving their son money without the wife's knowledge.\n\nFirst, the context: The parents agreed to let their son live at home during university. Money isn't tight, but there's a big disparity in how each family member spends. The wife criticized the son for a $7 meal, then the husband later saw she spent $160 on perfume. The husband gave the son extra money secretly, saying he uses it responsibly.\n\nSo, the key points here are about financial fairness and communication in the family. The husband felt the wife was being inconsistent by berating the son for a small expense while spending much more herself. He decided to give the son money without telling her, probably to balance things out.\n\nIs the husband wrong? Well, giving the son money without the wife's knowledge might be a problem. Even if the husband thought the wife was being unfair, bypassing her could lead to trust issues. The wife might feel disrespected or think there's a lack of transparency. Also, the husband's response to the wife's perfume purchase was confrontational, which might have escalated the situation.\n\nHowever, the husband's intention was to support his son, who's a mature adult using the money responsibly. The wife's criticism of the son for a small expense seems disproportionate compared to her own spending. The husband might feel he's correcting an imbalance.\n\nBut in a marriage, financial decisions typically require mutual agreement. Even if one spouse feels the other is being unreasonable, the appropriate step would be to discuss it openly rather than act unilaterally. The husband's action of giving money without consulting the wife could be seen as undermining her and creating a secret financial arrangement with the son.\n\nSo, while the husband's motivation might be to address the perceived unfairness, the method of handling it without communication was probably wrong. Therefore, he's in the wrong because he didn't address the issue with his wife directly instead of taking secret action.\n"
