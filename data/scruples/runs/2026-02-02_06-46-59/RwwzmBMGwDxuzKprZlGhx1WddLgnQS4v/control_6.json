When he came back home, my wife had a go at him for spending $7 on a meal...\n\nI came back from work and she told me what happened... I said \"I will talk to him about it.\" but when I went to his room I just told him \"Don't worry about it.\"\n\nWhen I came back to the kitchen she told me \"Do you like my new perfume?\" I told her it was nice and all.. and when I asked her how much she paid for it, she said $160.. that was when I was displeased. I closed the kitchen door and said \"You just started boiling at [my son's name] for spending $7 on a meal whereas you spent $160 on your perfume, where's the fairness in that?\" she got upset and went to the bathroom.\n\nTwo weeks ago I started giving my son money without my wife's knowledge. My son isn't the type of person to spend it on drugs or some other toxins, in-fact he uses the money as a mature adult and entertains himself with food or other things every now and then.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the father is in the wrong for giving his son money without his wife's knowledge. \n\nFirst, the family situation: They agreed to let the son stay at home during university. The mom criticized him for a $7 meal, then the dad found out she spent $160 on perfume. The dad felt the mom was being unfair, so he started giving the son money secretly.\n\nNow, considering the dynamics here. The parents have a joint responsibility for their son's upbringing. If the dad gave the son money without consulting his wife, that could be seen as undermining her authority. Even though the dad thought the mom was being too strict, the way he handled it by acting behind her back might not be the best approach. Communication is key in a marriage, especially when it comes to financial decisions affecting their child. \n\nAlso, the dad's action might create tension between the parents. The wife might feel disrespected or ignored, which could lead to more conflicts. The son might also get confused about financial boundaries if the parents aren't on the same page. \n\nOn the other hand, the dad's intention was to support his son fairly, given the mom's reaction seemed disproportionate. But the method\u2014acting unilaterally without discussing it with his wife\u2014is problematic. It's not just about the money; it's about how the parents handle their disagreements and co-parenting.\n\nSo, while the dad's intentions might be good, the action of giving money without his wife's knowledge is a breach of trust and cooperation. The right approach would have been to discuss the issue with his wife first and find a mutually agreeable solution. Therefore, the answer is A (Yes, the author is in the wrong).\n"
