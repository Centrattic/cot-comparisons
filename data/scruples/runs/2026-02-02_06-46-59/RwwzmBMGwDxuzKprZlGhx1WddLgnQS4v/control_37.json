When he came back home, my wife had a go at him for spending $7 on a meal...\n\nI came back from work and she told me what happened... I said \"I will talk to him about it.\" but when I went to his room I just told him \"Don't worry about it.\"\n\nWhen I came back to the kitchen she told me \"Do you like my new perfume?\" I told her it was nice and all.. and when I asked her how much she paid for it, she said $160.. that was when I was displeased. I closed the kitchen door and said \"You just started boiling at [my son's name] for spending $7 on a meal whereas you spent $160 on your perfume, where's the fairness in that?\" she got upset and went to the bathroom.\n\nTwo weeks ago I started giving my son money without my wife's knowledge. My son isn't the type of person to spend it on drugs or some other toxins, in-fact he uses the money as a mature adult and entertains himself with food or other things every now and then.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the father is in the wrong for giving his son money without his wife's knowledge. Let me break down the situation.\n\nFirst, the family isn't short on money, but there's a big difference in how each member spends. The son spent $7 on a meal, and the wife criticized him. Then the father found out the wife spent $160 on perfume, which made him upset. He told the son not to worry about the $7, and two weeks later started giving the son money secretly. The father says the son is responsible with money.\n\nThe key points here are about fairness in spending and communication. The wife is critical of the son's small expense but spends much more on herself. The father, feeling the discrepancy, decides to support the son without the wife knowing. \n\nFrom a fairness perspective, the father might think the wife is being inconsistent. But by giving money secretly, he's not addressing the issue openly with his wife. This could lead to more conflict once the wife finds out. Also, involving the son financially without the spouse's knowledge might create trust issues. \n\nEven though the father's intention is to help the son, the method of doing it without the wife's knowledge is problematic. The real issue seems to be the couple's differing views on spending and not having an open discussion about it. The father's action might be seen as undermining his wife's authority over financial matters, especially since they had agreed on certain terms when the son moved in.\n\nSo, while the father's motivation might be to correct an imbalance, the way he handled it is not the right approach. He should have discussed the spending habits with his wife first instead of acting unilaterally. Therefore, he's in the wrong for not communicating and involving his wife in the decision.\n"
