When he came back home, my wife had a go at him for spending $7 on a meal...\n\nI came back from work and she told me what happened... I said \"I will talk to him about it.\" but when I went to his room I just told him \"Don't worry about it.\"\n\nWhen I came back to the kitchen she told me \"Do you like my new perfume?\" I told her it was nice and all.. and when I asked her how much she paid for it, she said $160.. that was when I was displeased. I closed the kitchen door and said \"You just started boiling at [my son's name] for spending $7 on a meal whereas you spent $160 on your perfume, where's the fairness in that?\" she got upset and went to the bathroom.\n\nTwo weeks ago I started giving my son money without my wife's knowledge. My son isn't the type of person to spend it on drugs or some other toxins, in-fact he uses the money as a mature adult and entertains himself with food or other things every now and then.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong for giving their son money without the wife's knowledge. The situation involves family finances and differing views on spending.\n\nFirst, the parents agreed to let the son live at home during university. The father notices a discrepancy in how money is spent: the wife criticizes the son for spending $7 on a meal, but she spends $160 on perfume. The father then starts giving the son money secretly. \n\nThe key points here are about communication and fairness. The father feels the wife is being unfair, so he acts to balance it by giving the son extra money. But he does this without the wife's knowledge. The main issue is whether this action is wrong. \n\nPossible angles to consider: \n\n1. **Marital Communication**: Couples usually manage finances together. One parent making unilateral decisions about money, especially involving their child, might be problematic. The father didn't discuss this with his wife, which could lead to trust issues or conflicts.\n\n2. **Fairness and Parenting**: The father might feel he's helping his son avoid criticism, but giving money without the spouse's knowledge could set a precedent. It might also teach the son that he can get money without accountability. \n\n3. **Respect for Spousal Roles**: Even if the wife's criticism seems harsh, the father's response (giving money secretly) might undermine their partnership. Addressing financial values and communication within the couple is more constructive than acting in secret.\n\n4. **Financial Management**: The family isn't in financial trouble, but the way they handle money as a family matters. The father's action could disrupt their agreed-upon financial strategies or cause resentment from the wife.\n\nConsidering all this, the father's decision to act without discussing it with his wife is likely the root of the problem. The wife might feel disrespected or that her concerns aren't being addressed properly. The right approach would be to communicate openly with the wife about the discrepancy and find a mutual solution, rather than giving money in secret. So, the author is in the wrong.\n"
