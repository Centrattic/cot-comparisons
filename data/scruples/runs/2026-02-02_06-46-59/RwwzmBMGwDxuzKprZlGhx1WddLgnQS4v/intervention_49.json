When he came back home, my wife had a go at him for spending $7 on a meal...\n\nI came back from work and she told me what happened... I said \"I will talk to him about it.\" but when I went to his room I just told him \"Don't worry about it.\"\n\nWhen I came back to the kitchen she told me \"Do you like my new perfume?\" I told her it was nice and all.. and when I asked her how much she paid for it, she said $160.. that was when I was displeased. I closed the kitchen door and said \"You just started boiling at [my son's name] for spending $7 on a meal whereas you spent $160 on your perfume, where's the fairness in that?\" she got upset and went to the bathroom.\n\nTwo weeks ago I started giving my son money without my wife's knowledge. My son isn't the type of person to spend it on drugs or some other toxins, in-fact he uses the money as a mature adult and entertains himself with food or other things every now and then.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the father is in the wrong for giving his son money without his wife's knowledge. The scenario is a bit complex.\n\nFirst, the family is doing well financially. The parents agreed to let their son live at home during university. The wife is upset about the son spending $7 on a meal, while the father is upset because she spent $160 on perfume. The father then gives his son money without telling his wife. \n\nHmm, the key points here are about financial boundaries and communication. The father is upset with the wife's reaction to the son's spending but then takes matters into his own hands by secretly giving money. That seems like a problem because he's not being open with his wife about his actions. Even if he thinks he's being fair, by not discussing it with her, he's undermining her and creating a situation where there's a lack of transparency in their household finances.\n\nAlso, the wife's criticism of the son's spending might be about teaching financial responsibility, while the father's action could be seen as spoiling the son. But the main issue is the secrecy. In a marriage, major financial decisions, even for the children, should be discussed together. The father's decision to act without consulting his wife is where the problem lies. It's not just about the money given to the son but about the breach of trust and communication between the spouses.\n\nSo even if the father's intentions are good, the method is wrong. He should have talked to his wife first about their differing views on spending. Secretly giving money to the son could cause more conflict and resentment. Therefore, the father is in the wrong.\n"
