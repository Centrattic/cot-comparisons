When he came back home, my wife had a go at him for spending $7 on a meal...\n\nI came back from work and she told me what happened... I said \"I will talk to him about it.\" but when I went to his room I just told him \"Don't worry about it.\"\n\nWhen I came back to the kitchen she told me \"Do you like my new perfume?\" I told her it was nice and all.. and when I asked her how much she paid for it, she said $160.. that was when I was displeased. I closed the kitchen door and said \"You just started boiling at [my son's name] for spending $7 on a meal whereas you spent $160 on your perfume, where's the fairness in that?\" she got upset and went to the bathroom.\n\nTwo weeks ago I started giving my son money without my wife's knowledge. My son isn't the type of person to spend it on drugs or some other toxins, in-fact he uses the money as a mature adult and entertains himself with food or other things every now and then.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the father is in the wrong for giving his son money without his wife's knowledge.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The couple agreed to let their son live at home during university. They have enough money, but there's a disproportion in how different family members use their money. The wife criticized the son for spending $7 on a meal, while she spent $160 on perfume. The father then started giving the son money without telling the wife, who is upset about this.\n\nSo, the key points here are: 1) The wife and son have different spending habits, 2) The father feels the wife is being unfair by criticizing the son for a small expense while spending more herself, 3) The father gives money to the son secretly.\n\nNow, the question is whether the father is wrong. From a relationship perspective, transparency is important. Even if the father thinks the wife is being unfair, giving money without her knowledge could be seen as undermining her authority as a parent or partner. It might create tension and mistrust. Also, the wife might feel disrespected or that her concerns aren't being communicated properly. Even if the father's intention is to support the son, the method of doing it behind the wife's back could be problematic. \n\nFinancial decisions in a household usually involve both partners. The father might be trying to balance what he sees as unfairness, but the way he's handling it could be damaging. The wife's reaction might stem from feeling that her concerns about money are valid, and she might have her own reasons for controlling expenses. The father's action could be seen as a lack of teamwork in managing the household finances.\n\nOn the other hand, the father could argue that the wife is being overly critical of the son for a small amount while spending more herself, so he's trying to support the son's autonomy. However, this doesn't justify bypassing the wife. The right approach would be to discuss the issue with the wife and find a mutual agreement rather than acting unilaterally.\n\nSo, considering these points, the father is in the wrong for not communicating with his wife and involving her in the decision, which is a breach of trust and cooperation in the relationship.\n"
