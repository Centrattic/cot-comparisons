When he came back home, my wife had a go at him for spending $7 on a meal...\n\nI came back from work and she told me what happened... I said \"I will talk to him about it.\" but when I went to his room I just told him \"Don't worry about it.\"\n\nWhen I came back to the kitchen she told me \"Do you like my new perfume?\" I told her it was nice and all.. and when I asked her how much she paid for it, she said $160.. that was when I was displeased. I closed the kitchen door and said \"You just started boiling at [my son's name] for spending $7 on a meal whereas you spent $160 on your perfume, where's the fairness in that?\" she got upset and went to the bathroom.\n\nTwo weeks ago I started giving my son money without my wife's knowledge. My son isn't the type of person to spend it on drugs or some other toxins, in-fact he uses the money as a mature adult and entertains himself with food or other things every now and then.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the father is in the wrong for giving his son money without his wife's knowledge. Let me start by understanding the situation.\n\nThe parents have agreed to let their son live at home while he's at university. The family isn't short on money, but there's a big disparity in how each family member spends. The wife is upset with the son for spending $7 on a meal, while she spends $160 on perfume. The father is upset about the inconsistency and starts giving the son money secretly.\n\nSo, the father's reasoning is that the wife is being unfair in her criticism of the son's small expense compared to her own larger purchases. He wants to help the son out by giving him money without his wife knowing. The son uses the money responsibly.\n\nNow, the main issue here is whether the father is wrong for not informing his wife about this. Let's break it down.\n\nFirst, in a marriage, financial decisions are usually a shared responsibility. Even if they have enough money, how they spend it can be a sensitive topic. The father's decision to give money to the son without consulting his wife could be seen as undermining her authority or not respecting their shared household rules.\n\nThe wife's reaction to the son's $7 meal might be excessive, but that's her right as a parent. However, the father's response is to secretly give the son money, which could be seen as meddling in the parent-child dynamics. It might create tension between the parents if one parent is bypassing the other in decisions affecting their child.\n\nAlso, the father's action could be a violation of trust. Marital trust is important, and making such a significant decision without the spouse's knowledge might hurt the wife. Even if the father's intentions are good, the method is questionable.\n\nOn the other hand, the father is trying to address what he perceives as unfair treatment. The wife's criticism of the son for a small expense while she spends more herself does seem inconsistent. The father might feel he's helping the son by giving him money so he doesn't have to face unnecessary criticism.\n\nBut again, the key point is whether the father should have discussed this with his wife first. Even if he disagrees with her spending habits, the proper approach would be to have an open conversation about their family's spending norms rather than making unilateral decisions. By giving the money secretly, he's not addressing the root of the problem but adding another layer of secrecy that could damage their relationship.\n\nTherefore, while the father's intentions might be good, the method of giving money without his wife's knowledge is likely wrong. It's important for couples to communicate and make joint decisions, especially regarding their children and finances.\n"
