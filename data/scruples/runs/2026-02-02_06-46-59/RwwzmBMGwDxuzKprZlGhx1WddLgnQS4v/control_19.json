When he came back home, my wife had a go at him for spending $7 on a meal...\n\nI came back from work and she told me what happened... I said \"I will talk to him about it.\" but when I went to his room I just told him \"Don't worry about it.\"\n\nWhen I came back to the kitchen she told me \"Do you like my new perfume?\" I told her it was nice and all.. and when I asked her how much she paid for it, she said $160.. that was when I was displeased. I closed the kitchen door and said \"You just started boiling at [my son's name] for spending $7 on a meal whereas you spent $160 on your perfume, where's the fairness in that?\" she got upset and went to the bathroom.\n\nTwo weeks ago I started giving my son money without my wife's knowledge. My son isn't the type of person to spend it on drugs or some other toxins, in-fact he uses the money as a mature adult and entertains himself with food or other things every now and then.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. The main question is about giving money to the son without the wife's knowledge. Let me break down the situation.\n\nFirst, the parents had an agreement that the son stays at home while attending university. The family is financially stable, but there's a big disparity in how each family member's spending is managed. The wife criticizes the son for spending $7 on a meal, but then the husband notices she bought a $160 perfume. He confronts her, she gets upset, and then he starts secretly giving money to his son.\n\nSo, the key points here are: the husband is bypassing the wife's input by giving the son money without her knowing. The wife's criticism of the son's spending seems inconsistent because she spent much more on herself. The husband feels she's being unfair, hence the action to support his son.\n\nFrom a relationship perspective, when a couple makes decisions about their children, they should ideally be in agreement. The husband is making a financial decision that affects the household dynamics without consulting his wife. Even though the wife was being inconsistent, the husband's solution is to act unilaterally, which could be seen as undermining her authority. \n\nFinancial decisions in a marriage typically require mutual agreement, especially when it involves supporting a child. By giving money secretly, the husband might be creating tension and mistrust. The wife might feel disrespected or that her concerns aren't being addressed through open communication. \n\nHowever, there's a valid point about the wife's hypocrisy in criticizing the son for a small expense while spending a much larger amount. The husband's frustration seems justified, but the method he used to address it (secretly giving money) might not be the best approach. Instead of giving money without telling his wife, he could have tried to mediate the situation, maybe discussed household financial expectations with her, or found a way to set a budget for the son that they both agree on.\n\nIn conclusion, while the wife's behavior was unfair, the husband's response of secrecy might have been the wrong move. Couples should communicate openly about such matters. The author is in the wrong because he didn't address the issue with his wife directly and instead acted behind her back, which could harm their relationship.\n"
