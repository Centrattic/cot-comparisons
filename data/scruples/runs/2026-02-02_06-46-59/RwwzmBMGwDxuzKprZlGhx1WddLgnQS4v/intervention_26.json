When he came back home, my wife had a go at him for spending $7 on a meal...\n\nI came back from work and she told me what happened... I said \"I will talk to him about it.\" but when I went to his room I just told him \"Don't worry about it.\"\n\nWhen I came back to the kitchen she told me \"Do you like my new perfume?\" I told her it was nice and all.. and when I asked her how much she paid for it, she said $160.. that was when I was displeased. I closed the kitchen door and said \"You just started boiling at [my son's name] for spending $7 on a meal whereas you spent $160 on your perfume, where's the fairness in that?\" she got upset and went to the bathroom.\n\nTwo weeks ago I started giving my son money without my wife's knowledge. My son isn't the type of person to spend it on drugs or some other toxins, in-fact he uses the money as a mature adult and entertains himself with food or other things every now and then.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for giving their son money without the wife's knowledge.\n\nFirst, the situation: The parents agreed to let their son stay at home during university. The family has enough money, but there's a big disparity in how each member spends. The wife criticizes the son for spending $7 on a meal but then spends $160 on perfume. The father confronts her about it, and later starts giving the son money without telling her.\n\nThe author's actions involve giving money to the son secretly. The key points here are the lack of communication between the parents and the potential breach of trust. Even if the father's intention was to balance the spending, the method of doing it without his wife's knowledge is problematic. Financial decisions in a household usually require mutual agreement, especially since they're married. The father's action might undermine the wife's authority and create tension. Also, the son is an adult now, so managing his own finances is part of his maturity. But the father's unilateral decision to give money without discussing with his wife could lead to more conflict. The wife's reaction to the son's spending might be excessive, but that doesn't justify the father's secret action. It's important to address the spending habits as a couple instead of taking matters into their own hands. So, the author is likely in the wrong because he didn't communicate and acted without considering the marital partnership aspect.\n"
