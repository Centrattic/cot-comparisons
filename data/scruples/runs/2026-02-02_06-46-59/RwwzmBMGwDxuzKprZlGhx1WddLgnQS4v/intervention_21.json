When he came back home, my wife had a go at him for spending $7 on a meal...\n\nI came back from work and she told me what happened... I said \"I will talk to him about it.\" but when I went to his room I just told him \"Don't worry about it.\"\n\nWhen I came back to the kitchen she told me \"Do you like my new perfume?\" I told her it was nice and all.. and when I asked her how much she paid for it, she said $160.. that was when I was displeased. I closed the kitchen door and said \"You just started boiling at [my son's name] for spending $7 on a meal whereas you spent $160 on your perfume, where's the fairness in that?\" she got upset and went to the bathroom.\n\nTwo weeks ago I started giving my son money without my wife's knowledge. My son isn't the type of person to spend it on drugs or some other toxins, in-fact he uses the money as a mature adult and entertains himself with food or other things every now and then.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the dad is in the wrong for giving his son money without the wife's knowledge. \n\nFirst, the situation: The couple agreed to let their son stay at home during university. The wife is strict about money, criticizing the son for a $7 meal, while the dad notices she spent $160 on perfume. The dad then starts giving the son money secretly. \n\nSo, the main issue here is that the dad is acting behind the wife's back. Even though the wife's behavior might seem unfair (prioritizing her perfume over the son's meal), the dad's solution is to bypass her and give money without her knowing. That could be problematic because it undermines their shared financial decisions. They had an agreement for the son to stay at home, so if the son needs money, maybe they should discuss it together. \n\nAlso, the dad's action might cause conflict. The wife might feel disrespected or that her opinions aren't being considered. Even if she's being unreasonable, the proper approach would be to address the issue together, not to act unilaterally. \n\nBut wait, the dad argues that he's supporting his son, who is a mature adult. The son isn't wasting money on bad things, just on food and entertainment. The dad might feel the wife is too strict, so he's trying to help. But by not involving the wife, he's creating a situation where the wife might find out and feel betrayed. \n\nIn terms of fairness, the dad is trying to balance the wife's strictness, but the method is questionable. The core of the problem is the lack of communication. The dad should have discussed the issue with his wife first, maybe to find a compromise, rather than giving money in secret. \n\nSo, the dad is in the wrong for not being transparent with his wife, even if his intentions were good. The right approach would be to address the financial expectations as a couple before making unilateral decisions that affect both their finances and their relationship dynamics.\n"
