When he came back home, my wife had a go at him for spending $7 on a meal...\n\nI came back from work and she told me what happened... I said \"I will talk to him about it.\" but when I went to his room I just told him \"Don't worry about it.\"\n\nWhen I came back to the kitchen she told me \"Do you like my new perfume?\" I told her it was nice and all.. and when I asked her how much she paid for it, she said $160.. that was when I was displeased. I closed the kitchen door and said \"You just started boiling at [my son's name] for spending $7 on a meal whereas you spent $160 on your perfume, where's the fairness in that?\" she got upset and went to the bathroom.\n\nTwo weeks ago I started giving my son money without my wife's knowledge. My son isn't the type of person to spend it on drugs or some other toxins, in-fact he uses the money as a mature adult and entertains himself with food or other things every now and then.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote this is in the wrong for giving their son money without the wife's knowledge. The scenario is that the couple agreed to let their son live with them during university. The father gives the son money secretly because the wife is strict about spending, like criticizing the son for a $7 meal but buying a $160 perfume. The father thinks it's unfair, so he gives the son money without the wife knowing.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The parents are supposed to be a team in managing finances, especially when it's a joint household. The wife's criticism of the son's spending versus her own purchase might be seen as inconsistent, which the father points out. However, the father giving money without telling the wife could undermine the partnership. Even if the wife's behavior seems unfair, the father's action of not discussing it with her first might be problematic. It could lead to further conflict, breaches of trust, or financial mismanagement. \n\nThe father's intention is to support his son, but by not involving his wife, he's not addressing the root issue between the couple. The wife's spending habits might be a separate issue, but the father's solution of bypassing her could be seen as avoiding communication. The key issue here is whether acting unilaterally without communication is wrong, even if the motivation is good. The answer likely hinges on the importance of teamwork in a marriage versus individual actions taken to correct perceived unfairness. So, even if the wife's actions are questionable, the father's method of handling it without her input might be in the wrong.\n"
