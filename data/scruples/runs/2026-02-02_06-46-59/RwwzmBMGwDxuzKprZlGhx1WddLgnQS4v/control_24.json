When he came back home, my wife had a go at him for spending $7 on a meal...\n\nI came back from work and she told me what happened... I said \"I will talk to him about it.\" but when I went to his room I just told him \"Don't worry about it.\"\n\nWhen I came back to the kitchen she told me \"Do you like my new perfume?\" I told her it was nice and all.. and when I asked her how much she paid for it, she said $160.. that was when I was displeased. I closed the kitchen door and said \"You just started boiling at [my son's name] for spending $7 on a meal whereas you spent $160 on your perfume, where's the fairness in that?\" she got upset and went to the bathroom.\n\nTwo weeks ago I started giving my son money without my wife's knowledge. My son isn't the type of person to spend it on drugs or some other toxins, in-fact he uses the money as a mature adult and entertains himself with food or other things every now and then.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that the dad gave his son money without the wife's knowledge. The family isn't poor, but there's a big difference in how much each family member spends. The wife is upset that the son spent $7 on a meal, but the dad points out she spent $160 on a perfume. The dad then started giving the son money secretly because he thought it was unfair.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics. The couple agreed to let the son live at home, which probably involves some financial arrangements. The wife is criticizing the son for a small expense, but the dad sees it as hypocritical because she spends more on herself. He gives the son money without telling her, maybe to balance things out. \n\nBut wait, in a marriage, finances are usually a joint matter. Even if the dad is unhappy with the wife's criticism, giving the son money without her knowledge could be seen as undermining their agreement. The wife might feel disrespected or that her input is not considered. The dad's action could lead to more conflict because it's a secret. \n\nAlso, the wife's reaction might be about budgeting or teaching the son about money management. The dad might think he's helping, but by not discussing it with his wife, he's causing tension. The key issue here is whether the dad should have addressed the financial disparities through open communication with his wife instead of taking unilateral action. \n\nSo, the dad's intention was to help his son, but the method of doing it without informing his wife is problematic. It's about how they handle their finances as a couple. The answer would likely be that the author is in the wrong because he breached trust and didn't communicate properly. So the answer is A.\n"
