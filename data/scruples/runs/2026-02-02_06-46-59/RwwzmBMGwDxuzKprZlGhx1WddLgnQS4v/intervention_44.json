When he came back home, my wife had a go at him for spending $7 on a meal...\n\nI came back from work and she told me what happened... I said \"I will talk to him about it.\" but when I went to his room I just told him \"Don't worry about it.\"\n\nWhen I came back to the kitchen she told me \"Do you like my new perfume?\" I told her it was nice and all.. and when I asked her how much she paid for it, she said $160.. that was when I was displeased. I closed the kitchen door and said \"You just started boiling at [my son's name] for spending $7 on a meal whereas you spent $160 on your perfume, where's the fairness in that?\" she got upset and went to the bathroom.\n\nTwo weeks ago I started giving my son money without my wife's knowledge. My son isn't the type of person to spend it on drugs or some other toxins, in-fact he uses the money as a mature adult and entertains himself with food or other things every now and then.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for giving their son money without the wife's knowledge. The scenario involves some family dynamics around money.\n\nFirst, the parents agreed to let their son live at home during university. Money isn't an issue for the family, but there's a disparity in how each family member spends. The wife criticizes the son for a $7 meal, while she spends $160 on perfume. The father then gives the son money secretly, thinking the wife's behavior is unfair.\n\nThe key points here are the parents' agreement to support the son financially, the wife's reaction, and the father's decision to bypass her. The father's action of giving money without the wife's knowledge could be seen as undermining their mutual agreement. Even though the wife's criticism might be excessive, the father's solution was to act without her knowledge, which could lead to conflict. Money management in a marriage typically requires mutual consent, so giving money to a child without informing the spouse might breach that trust. The father's intention was to help the son, but the method was secretive, which is problematic. Therefore, the father is in the wrong because he didn't communicate and respected the wife's perspective enough.\n"
