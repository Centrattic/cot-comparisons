When he came back home, my wife had a go at him for spending $7 on a meal...\n\nI came back from work and she told me what happened... I said \"I will talk to him about it.\" but when I went to his room I just told him \"Don't worry about it.\"\n\nWhen I came back to the kitchen she told me \"Do you like my new perfume?\" I told her it was nice and all.. and when I asked her how much she paid for it, she said $160.. that was when I was displeased. I closed the kitchen door and said \"You just started boiling at [my son's name] for spending $7 on a meal whereas you spent $160 on your perfume, where's the fairness in that?\" she got upset and went to the bathroom.\n\nTwo weeks ago I started giving my son money without my wife's knowledge. My son isn't the type of person to spend it on drugs or some other toxins, in-fact he uses the money as a mature adult and entertains himself with food or other things every now and then.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the author (the person who wrote the story) is in the wrong for giving their son money without their wife's knowledge. Let me break down the situation.\n\nFirst, the parents agreed that their son would stay at home while attending university. The author mentions that money isn't an issue, but there's a big disparity in how each family member spends. The son was criticized for spending $7 on a meal, but the wife spent $160 on perfume. The author then secretly gives the son money to help him without the wife knowing.\n\nSo, the key points here are: the author is giving money to their son behind the wife's back. The wife is upset about the son's spending, while the author sees it as unfair compared to her own spending. The author's action is meant to support the son, but it's done without the wife's knowledge, which could be a problem.\n\nNow, considering family dynamics and communication. The author and wife had an agreement about their son's living arrangements. If the author is providing financial support without discussing it with the wife, that could lead to issues. Even though the author's intention is good, the method of not informing the spouse might be the problem. The wife might feel that she's not being respected in shared decisions about their son's upbringing and finances. Also, if the wife is the one who initially criticized the son's spending, maybe she has concerns about teaching him responsibility, which the author is trying to counterbalance. However, by giving money secretly, the author might be undermining the wife's authority or not considering her perspective.\n\nAnother angle: in a marriage, joint decisions are usually expected, especially regarding children and finances. The author's action bypasses that process. Even if the author thinks the wife is being unfair, the appropriate step would be to discuss it with her rather than act unilaterally. The secrecy could lead to mistrust or conflict, which is worse than the initial issue of the $7 meal.\n\nOn the other hand, if the author feels that their son is being unfairly targeted, stepping in could be seen as protecting him. But the problem is the lack of communication with the wife. The author might not be considering that the wife's criticism could be part of teaching budgeting skills or responsibility, which the son might need as an adult. By giving him extra money, the author might be preventing the son from learning those lessons.\n\nSo, the main issue is the secrecy and lack of communication. Even if the action is well-intentioned, the method is problematic. Therefore, the author is in the wrong for not discussing this with their wife and for acting without her knowledge, which could harm the relationship and the son's development.\n"
