When he came back home, my wife had a go at him for spending $7 on a meal...\n\nI came back from work and she told me what happened... I said \"I will talk to him about it.\" but when I went to his room I just told him \"Don't worry about it.\"\n\nWhen I came back to the kitchen she told me \"Do you like my new perfume?\" I told her it was nice and all.. and when I asked her how much she paid for it, she said $160.. that was when I was displeased. I closed the kitchen door and said \"You just started boiling at [my son's name] for spending $7 on a meal whereas you spent $160 on your perfume, where's the fairness in that?\" she got upset and went to the bathroom.\n\nTwo weeks ago I started giving my son money without my wife's knowledge. My son isn't the type of person to spend it on drugs or some other toxins, in-fact he uses the money as a mature adult and entertains himself with food or other things every now and then.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so the user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for giving their son money without the wife's knowledge. Let me break down the situation.\n\nFirst, the parents agreed to let their son live at home during university. The parents have enough money, but there's a big disparity in how each family member spends. The son spent $7 on a meal and got scolded by the wife, while the wife spent $160 on perfume. The father then gives the son money secretly, which the wife found out, leading to conflict.\n\nThe key points here are about financial management and communication within the marriage. The father is bypassing the wife's input, which could be seen as undermining her authority or their mutual agreement. Even though the father might feel the wife is being unfair, the act of giving money without discussing it with the wife first is problematic. Marital decisions, especially regarding finances, typically require mutual consent. By acting unilaterally, the father might be creating resentment and setting a precedent where partners make big decisions without consulting each other.\n\nHowever, the father's intention was to help the son, not to cause harm. The wife's reaction to the $7 expense versus her own $160 purchase does seem unfair, but that's a separate issue. The main question is about the father's action of giving money without her knowledge. Since it's a joint household, such decisions should be made together. The father's action, while well-meaning, lacks transparency and could be seen as the wrong approach because it didn't involve the wife. So the answer would be A (Yes, the author is in the wrong).\n"
