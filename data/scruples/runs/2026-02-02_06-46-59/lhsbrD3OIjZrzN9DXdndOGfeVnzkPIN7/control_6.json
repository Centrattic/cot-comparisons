Recently my girlfriend suggested that I change over to her gym so we could carpool, workout together etc. Normally I would agree with this and be happy to go to the same gym as her, the problem is that her gym has a large \"**women only**\" section. The gym charges the same entrance fee for both men and women, but this section only allows women to use it and contains about 1/4 of the area of the gym and about 1/4 of the total workout equipment.\n\n I told my girlfriend that I didn't want to go to a gym that would charge someone 100% of the fee but only allow them to use 75% of the equipment because of their sex. When she said that I was being stupid about this I asked her if she would go to a gym that charged her the same as men, but forbid her from using a large portion of the equipment and area? She got upset at this, and said that \"*I just don't understand*\", and that \"*it's different for women*\".\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAm I being the asshole here and just not understanding?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the situation is in the wrong. The question is about whether it's sexist for the author to refuse to switch to his girlfriend's gym because it has a women-only section. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The author and his girlfriend work out at different gyms. She suggests they switch to the same gym for convenience. The problem is the gym has a women-only section that takes up a quarter of the space and equipment. The author objects because it's sexist to charge men the same fee but restrict them to 75% of the equipment. The girlfriend thinks he's overreacting, saying it's different for women.\n\nSo, the key point is whether the author's objection is valid. The women-only section is a separate space, but the author is being charged the same as women who can use the entire gym. If the gym charges everyone the same fee but restricts what men can use, that could be seen as discriminatory. The author is pointing out an inconsistency: if you pay the same as someone else but can't use the same facilities, it's unfair. The girlfriend's response that \"it's different for women\" might be a justification she's heard before, perhaps from others, but that doesn't make it right.\n\nIn terms of fairness, if the gym offers a women-only section, it's a choice for women to have that space. However, charging men the full fee while restricting them in their access might be discriminatory. The author is drawing a parallel: if women were charged the same but couldn't use certain areas, he would find that unfair. The girlfriend's reaction suggests she doesn't see the issue as he does, but that doesn't necessarily mean he's wrong. \n\nThe question is whether the author is being the asshole. The AITA (Am I the Asshole) framework considers whether the person's actions are reasonable given the circumstances. The author is expressing a concern about fairness and equality. His reasoning is logical: if you pay the same fee, you should have equal access. The girlfriend's gym's policy might be intended to provide women with a safe space, but it does create a disparity in access for men who pay the same. \n\nSo, the author is not in the wrong here. His objection is based on principles of fairness and equal treatment. The girlfriend's dismissal of his concern as being \"stupid\" without addressing the validity of his point is where the issue lies. Therefore, the answer is B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
