Recently my girlfriend suggested that I change over to her gym so we could carpool, workout together etc. Normally I would agree with this and be happy to go to the same gym as her, the problem is that her gym has a large \"**women only**\" section. The gym charges the same entrance fee for both men and women, but this section only allows women to use it and contains about 1/4 of the area of the gym and about 1/4 of the total workout equipment.\n\n I told my girlfriend that I didn't want to go to a gym that would charge someone 100% of the fee but only allow them to use 75% of the equipment because of their sex. When she said that I was being stupid about this I asked her if she would go to a gym that charged her the same as men, but forbid her from using a large portion of the equipment and area? She got upset at this, and said that \"*I just don't understand*\", and that \"*it's different for women*\".\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAm I being the asshole here and just not understanding?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. Let's see. The situation is about a guy and his girlfriend wanting to go to the same gym for convenience, but the guy is against it because the gym has a \"women only\" section. The gym charges the same fee for everyone, but the women's section blocks access to some equipment for men. The guy argues that it's unfair to pay the same fee but have less access. The girlfriend thinks it's different for women and he's being too focused on this.\n\nFirst, I should consider the logic here. The guy is saying that if he paid the same as women, he should have access to all the equipment. But the gym allows women to have a section they can use exclusively. The question is whether this is sexist or not. The woman's perspective might be that women need that space for safety or comfort in a male-dominated environment. The guy might not see the need for it, thinking it's discriminatory against men by restricting their access.\n\nBut is the gym's policy actually discriminatory? If the gym is providing the same access to men in the rest of the facility, then maybe the policy is meant to create a safe space for women. However, the guy is being charged the same fee for less access compared to women. From his perspective, that's unfair. But from the woman's side, she might see it as a necessary accommodation for women to feel comfortable and safe.\n\nSo, the guy is raising a valid point about fairness, but the woman's reasoning is based on different social dynamics. The question is whether his objection is justified. If the gym is structured this way to address gender-based issues that women face in gyms, then the policy might be intended to correct an imbalance. However, the guy is being denied access to a portion of the gym, which could be seen as a form of discrimination from his side.\n\nBut in terms of societal context, women-only spaces are often created to address systemic issues where women feel unsafe or uncomfortable in mixed settings. If the gym is providing that as an option, it's likely to support women's comfort. The guy's objection is about equal access, but it's a case where the gym is intentionally creating a different access structure. The key here is whether the policy is discriminatory. If the gym isn't excluding men from other areas and the women's section is just a subset, then maybe the guy's issue is with the policy rather than the intention.\n\nHowever, the guy is being charged the same as women who have more access. That could be seen as the gym not providing equal value for the same price. But if the women's section is meant to address a different need, maybe it's not about the equipment quantity but about the environment. The guy might not understand that the women's section is for safety or comfort, not about the number of machines.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? If the woman is using the gym's policy to create a space that's necessary for her due to societal issues, then the guy's objection might be based on a misunderstanding. He might not grasp the importance of such spaces for women. In that case, the author could be seen as not understanding the reasoning, making him the asshole. On the other hand, if the policy is inherently discriminatory and the guy is just pointing out a fairness issue, then he's not in the wrong.\n\nBut given that the gym allows women to have a section and charges the same for both, it's possible that the gym is trying to balance access. The woman's response suggests that she thinks the situation is different for women, implying that the need for the women-only section is valid. The guy's argument is about equal access, but if the gym's policy is intended to correct an imbalance, then maybe the guy's objection is missing the point. Therefore, the author might be in the wrong for not understanding the rationale behind the women-only section and the reasons it exists.\n"
