Recently my girlfriend suggested that I change over to her gym so we could carpool, workout together etc. Normally I would agree with this and be happy to go to the same gym as her, the problem is that her gym has a large \"**women only**\" section. The gym charges the same entrance fee for both men and women, but this section only allows women to use it and contains about 1/4 of the area of the gym and about 1/4 of the total workout equipment.\n\n I told my girlfriend that I didn't want to go to a gym that would charge someone 100% of the fee but only allow them to use 75% of the equipment because of their sex. When she said that I was being stupid about this I asked her if she would go to a gym that charged her the same as men, but forbid her from using a large portion of the equipment and area? She got upset at this, and said that \"*I just don't understand*\", and that \"*it's different for women*\".\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAm I being the asshole here and just not understanding?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not wanting to switch to his girlfriend's gym because it has a women-only section. The key points here are about equality and perspective.\n\nThe author's main issue is that the gym charges the same fee for everyone but restricts access to 25% of the equipment for men. He finds this sexist. His girlfriend argues that it's different for women, which makes him think there's a double standard. \n\nFirst, I need to consider gender equality. If the gym allows a women-only section, it's possible they're catering to women who may feel more comfortable or safe in such an environment. But if the same gym doesn't have a men-only section, that could be seen as unequal treatment. The author is pointing out that he can't use a portion of the gym, which he sees as discrimination. \n\nHowever, the girlfriend's response indicates she feels the author doesn't understand the women's perspective. Maybe she believes that women need such spaces for various reasons, like safety or comfort, which the author isn't considering. The question is whether the author's stance is valid or if he's being overly sensitive. \n\nLegally, in many places, it's allowed to have separate facilities for different genders, but if both genders are paying the same, but one group gets restricted access, that could be a problem. However, if the women-only section is optional, and the author can still access the other 75%, maybe the author's issue is more about principle than practicality. \n\nThe author's comparison to the girlfriend's hypothetical situation might not be fair. If he's asking her to imagine being restricted, but in reality, women aren't restricted from the rest of the gym, while men can't access the women-only part. The gym might be providing a service (the women-only section) that the author doesn't want to pay for. \n\nThe girlfriend might see the women-only section as a benefit, while the author sees it as a drawback. The author's refusal to switch gyms is based on his discomfort with the unequal access. But if the gym is legal and the women-only section is a feature that some people want, maybe the author is just not considering the needs of the other gender. \n\nIs the author wrong for not wanting to accept unequal treatment? If he's advocating for equality, that's valid. But if the women-only section is a legitimate service provided by the gym, maybe his stance is too rigid. The answer hinges on whether the gym's policy is acceptable and if the author's objection is reasonable. \n\nIn summary, the author is not in the wrong because he's pointing out a potential inconsistency in treatment. His perspective is about equality, and if the gym is offering a service that's available only to one gender, it's reasonable for him to question that. Therefore, the answer would be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
