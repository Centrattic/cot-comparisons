Recently my girlfriend suggested that I change over to her gym so we could carpool, workout together etc. Normally I would agree with this and be happy to go to the same gym as her, the problem is that her gym has a large \"**women only**\" section. The gym charges the same entrance fee for both men and women, but this section only allows women to use it and contains about 1/4 of the area of the gym and about 1/4 of the total workout equipment.\n\n I told my girlfriend that I didn't want to go to a gym that would charge someone 100% of the fee but only allow them to use 75% of the equipment because of their sex. When she said that I was being stupid about this I asked her if she would go to a gym that charged her the same as men, but forbid her from using a large portion of the equipment and area? She got upset at this, and said that \"*I just don't understand*\", and that \"*it's different for women*\".\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAm I being the asshole here and just not understanding?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not wanting to switch to his girlfriend's gym because of the women-only section. The gym has a separate area that's only for women, which takes up a quarter of the space and equipment. The author's main issue is that he feels it's unfair that men can't use that section, even though they pay the same fee. His girlfriend thinks it's different for women, which is why she's upset.\n\nHmm. From the author's perspective, he sees it as a form of sexism because it's a reverse situation. If a gym had a men-only section and charged women the same but restricted their access, that would be seen as discriminatory. So he's drawing a parallel here. But his girlfriend argues that it's different for women, maybe because there are more women-only spaces in society, or because it's meant to encourage women to work out in a safer environment. \n\nBut is it actually discriminatory? If the gym is providing a specific area for women, maybe to accommodate their needs or create a more comfortable space, but it's not preventing men from using the rest of the gym. The author is being excluded from a quarter of the equipment, but he can still use the remaining 75%. So maybe the issue is about equal access to all areas. However, if the gym allows women-only spaces as a service, is that inherently wrong? Or is the author being too rigid about it?\n\nThe key point is whether the gym's policy is inherently sexist. If the gym charges the same fee regardless of gender but offers a women-only section, does that mean men are being discriminated against? It might depend on the context. For example, if the gym is trying to promote inclusivity for women, perhaps providing a safe space, but if the author feels excluded because he can't access all areas, he might feel it's unfair. However, the woman's perspective might be that she's benefiting from a space designed for her needs, and the author isn't being denied access to the entire facility. \n\nSo, is the author wrong for not wanting to switch gyms? It's possible he's not wrong because he's pointing out a potential inconsistency in the treatment of genders. However, if his argument is framed as being against women-only spaces in general, that could come off as dismissive of the reasons why such spaces exist. The girlfriend's frustration might stem from feeling that her needs are being overlooked. But the author's concern is about equal access. \n\nI think it's a bit nuanced. The author isn't necessarily in the wrong if he's highlighting the inconsistency in access. However, if he's not open to understanding why such a space exists, that could be where the issue is. The answer might be B, that he's not in the wrong, because he's raising a valid point about equal access, even if the other side has different priorities.\n"
