Recently my girlfriend suggested that I change over to her gym so we could carpool, workout together etc. Normally I would agree with this and be happy to go to the same gym as her, the problem is that her gym has a large \"**women only**\" section. The gym charges the same entrance fee for both men and women, but this section only allows women to use it and contains about 1/4 of the area of the gym and about 1/4 of the total workout equipment.\n\n I told my girlfriend that I didn't want to go to a gym that would charge someone 100% of the fee but only allow them to use 75% of the equipment because of their sex. When she said that I was being stupid about this I asked her if she would go to a gym that charged her the same as men, but forbid her from using a large portion of the equipment and area? She got upset at this, and said that \"*I just don't understand*\", and that \"*it's different for women*\".\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAm I being the asshole here and just not understanding?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is that the author's girlfriend wants to go to the same gym, but the gym has a women-only section that takes up a quarter of the space and equipment. The author is upset because he's paying the same fee but can't use all the equipment, and he thinks it's sexist. The girlfriend thinks he's being unreasonable.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the concept of gender-segregated spaces. Some places have women-only areas for reasons like safety, comfort, or to encourage participation. For example, some gyms have women-only sections to make women feel more comfortable, maybe because they're in a male-dominated environment. But does that make it sexist? The author argues that he's being charged equally but can't access the same resources, which is a form of discrimination. But the girlfriend says it's different for women, implying that the justification is separate.\n\nThe key points are: the gym charges the same rate for both genders, but men can't use the women-only section. The author is being denied access to part of the facility based on his gender, which he sees as unfair. From a legal standpoint, in many places, gender-segregated spaces are allowed if they have a legitimate purpose, like safety or tradition. But from an ethical perspective, it's more complicated. If the gym is providing a service (the women-only area) that's exclusive to women, is that equal treatment?\n\nThe author's analogy to the girlfriend is a good one. If the tables were turned and the gym charged women the same but restricted their access, would that be acceptable? He's pointing out a potential inconsistency. However, the girlfriend's response that it's \"different for women\" might be based on societal norms that accept such segregation for women to address historical underrepresentation or discomfort.\n\nBut from the author's perspective, he's being treated unequally. The gym is providing a service (full access) to men but only partial access to women, or vice versa. If the women's section is a separate service, maybe it's acceptable, but if it's part of the standard membership, then denying access based on gender could be seen as discriminatory. However, the gym might argue that the women-only section is an additional benefit, not part of the standard access. So if you pay for the gym, you get access to the main areas, and women can opt into the women-only section if they want. But the author can't access that section, so he's getting the main access, same as other members.\n\nWait, but the women-only section is part of the gym. If the gym is charging the same fee but some members can't access part of the facility, that seems unequal. Unless there's a separate fee for the women-only section, which isn't mentioned here. The author is paying for the entire gym but can't use a portion of it. That would be like a club that charges everyone the same but only women can use a certain wing. The author is being denied access based on gender, which is similar to how women would be denied access in the opposite scenario.\n\nBut the girlfriend might argue that the women-only section is for women's benefit, not a restriction on men. However, if the gym is open to all but has a restricted area for women, then men aren't restricted in the same way. The issue is whether the restriction is justifiable. If the gym claims it's for safety or to create a welcoming environment, maybe it's acceptable. But from the author's point of view, being denied access to part of the gym he's paying for because of his gender is discriminatory. \n\nIn terms of legal and social norms, in many places, gender-segregated spaces are permitted under certain conditions. For instance, in some Muslim countries, gyms are separated by gender. In the US, Title VII of the Civil Rights Act allows for gender-segregated facilities if they're reasonably necessary for privacy or safety. However, if the gym is providing a different level of service based on gender without a valid reason, it could be problematic. \n\nThe author's main issue is about fairness. He's paying the same but not getting the same access. If the women-only section is an extra service, then it's fair, but if it's part of the standard membership, it's not. The problem is the gym isn't clear on this. The author is being asked to go to a gym where part of it is off-limits to him because of his gender, which he finds sexist. The girlfriend, on the other hand, sees the women-only section as a positive feature for women and doesn't see the problem.\n\nSo is the author wrong? If the gym's policy is that women have a special area, and men don't, the author is being treated differently based on gender. However, if the gym is open to everyone and the women-only area is optional, maybe it's not the same. But the author can't use the women-only area, which is part of the gym. So he's not getting full access. If the gym charges the same but restricts access, that's unequal treatment. Therefore, the author's stance is about equality. However, the girlfriend sees the women-only area as a necessary provision for women's comfort, not a restriction on men. \n\nFrom a feminist perspective, some might argue that the women-only section is a way to address historical injustices and create safe spaces for women. Others might see it as reinforcing gender stereotypes. The author is challenging the double standard: if it's acceptable for women to have a space they can't go, why can't men have the same? But in reality, the justification for such spaces often hinges on addressing existing disparities and creating safe environments, which might not apply equally to men. \n\nIn conclusion, the author's argument is about equal treatment under the same fee. If the gym is providing a different experience based on gender, the author's complaint is valid. However, the girlfriend's perspective is about providing a specific service for women. Whether the author is in the wrong depends on whether the gym's policy is justified. Since the question is about the author's actions, if he's refusing to go to the gym because of a policy he finds discriminatory, he's not in the wrong. The gym's policy is the point of contention, not the author's refusal to comply. So the answer is B.\n"
