Recently my girlfriend suggested that I change over to her gym so we could carpool, workout together etc. Normally I would agree with this and be happy to go to the same gym as her, the problem is that her gym has a large \"**women only**\" section. The gym charges the same entrance fee for both men and women, but this section only allows women to use it and contains about 1/4 of the area of the gym and about 1/4 of the total workout equipment.\n\n I told my girlfriend that I didn't want to go to a gym that would charge someone 100% of the fee but only allow them to use 75% of the equipment because of their sex. When she said that I was being stupid about this I asked her if she would go to a gym that charged her the same as men, but forbid her from using a large portion of the equipment and area? She got upset at this, and said that \"*I just don't understand*\", and that \"*it's different for women*\".\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAm I being the asshole here and just not understanding?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong. The situation is about a gym that has a \"women only\" section. The author's girlfriend wants him to switch to her gym for convenience, but he objects because he thinks it's sexist that men have to pay the same fee but can't use that section.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the key points. The gym charges the same entrance fee for everyone, but women have a section that men can't access. The author is upset because he feels it's unfair to be excluded based on gender. His girlfriend, on the other hand, seems to accept the arrangement, maybe thinking it's necessary or different for women. \n\nThe author is drawing a parallel: if the tables were turned and women were excluded from a section, would she accept that? The girlfriend gets upset and says \"it's different for women.\" The question is whether the author is wrong for feeling this is sexist.\n\nI should consider the concept of equality. If the gym provides a section exclusively for women without charging them less, it could be seen as discriminatory against men because they're paying full price but have restricted access. However, sometimes women-only spaces are created for reasons like safety or comfort, which might be argued as justifying the separation. \n\nBut the main issue here is the author feeling that this setup is unfair because it's based on gender. If he's being charged the same but can't use all the facilities, that could be a legitimate concern. The girlfriend's response suggests she doesn't see it as an issue, which complicates things. \n\nThe question is whether the author is an asshole. If the gym's policy is discriminatory, then the author has a valid point. However, if the policy is intended to address historical disparities (like women having fewer safe spaces in the past), maybe the girlfriend's perspective is also valid. But the key is that the author is objecting on the grounds of equal access, which is a principle of fairness. \n\nIn terms of fairness, if the gym offers a women-only section but doesn't offer a similar option for men, it's unequal. The author's analogy about women being excluded if the situation were reversed is a classic example of applying the same standard. If women were excluded from a section, the author (and many others) would likely find that unacceptable. So when the same standard is applied to men, the author is pointing out the inconsistency. \n\nTherefore, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong. He's highlighting a potential issue with the gym's policy from an equality standpoint. The girlfriend's dismissal of his concern as being \"stupid\" might be her not recognizing the double standard. \n\nSo the answer would be B (No, the author is not in the wrong) because he's raising a valid point about gender-based restrictions leading to unequal access despite equal pricing. The gym's policy could be seen as discriminatory, and his objection is reasonable.\n"
