Recently my girlfriend suggested that I change over to her gym so we could carpool, workout together etc. Normally I would agree with this and be happy to go to the same gym as her, the problem is that her gym has a large \"**women only**\" section. The gym charges the same entrance fee for both men and women, but this section only allows women to use it and contains about 1/4 of the area of the gym and about 1/4 of the total workout equipment.\n\n I told my girlfriend that I didn't want to go to a gym that would charge someone 100% of the fee but only allow them to use 75% of the equipment because of their sex. When she said that I was being stupid about this I asked her if she would go to a gym that charged her the same as men, but forbid her from using a large portion of the equipment and area? She got upset at this, and said that \"*I just don't understand*\", and that \"*it's different for women*\".\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAm I being the asshole here and just not understanding?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong. The author is saying they don't want to switch gyms with their girlfriend because the gym has a women-only section. Their reasoning is that it's sexist because men pay the same fee but can't use that part, while women have access to the whole gym. The girlfriend is upset and says \"it's different for women.\"\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal and ethical aspects. In many places, gender-segregated spaces are allowed, especially in contexts like gyms where they might be for women's comfort or safety. For example, some women prefer a space where they can work out without feeling judged or harassed. However, the author is arguing that it's unfair because men aren't allowed to use that section, even though they pay the same price. \n\nBut is that a valid argument? The gym is providing the same membership access to all equipment for everyone. The women-only section is an optional part, not a restriction on men. So men aren't being excluded from any equipment; they just can't use a specific section that's reserved for women. The author is comparing it to a hypothetical where women are excluded from a large portion, which isn't the case here. \n\nThe girlfriend's point that \"it's different for women\" might stem from the fact that gender disparities often affect women more in terms of access and safety. The author's analogy might not be parallel because the women-only section is a choice to create a safe space, not a restriction imposed on women. \n\nSo, the author is pointing out a perceived inconsistency in the gym's policy, but the girlfriend sees it as a necessary accommodation. The key here is whether the author's refusal is a legitimate concern or if they're not understanding the context of why such sections exist. \n\nIn terms of fairness, the gym isn't excluding men from the entire facility, just a part of it. If the author is uncomfortable with that, switching gyms might be the compromise, but they're choosing not to go at all because of that. The girlfriend might feel that the author isn't respecting the reasons behind the women-only section. \n\nI think the author isn't wrong to have concerns about equality, but they might not be considering the perspective of why such sections are necessary. The real issue is whether the author is overreacting to a situation where the gym's policy serves a different purpose than the author's interpretation. So, the answer might be that the author isn't in the wrong because they're raising a valid point about fairness, but they might not be understanding the context of the women-only section. However, the situation is nuanced, and both sides have valid points.\n"
