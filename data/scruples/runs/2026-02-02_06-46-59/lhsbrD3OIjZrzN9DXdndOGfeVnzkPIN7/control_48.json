Recently my girlfriend suggested that I change over to her gym so we could carpool, workout together etc. Normally I would agree with this and be happy to go to the same gym as her, the problem is that her gym has a large \"**women only**\" section. The gym charges the same entrance fee for both men and women, but this section only allows women to use it and contains about 1/4 of the area of the gym and about 1/4 of the total workout equipment.\n\n I told my girlfriend that I didn't want to go to a gym that would charge someone 100% of the fee but only allow them to use 75% of the equipment because of their sex. When she said that I was being stupid about this I asked her if she would go to a gym that charged her the same as men, but forbid her from using a large portion of the equipment and area? She got upset at this, and said that \"*I just don't understand*\", and that \"*it's different for women*\".\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAm I being the asshole here and just not understanding?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not wanting to switch gyms because of the women-only section. The main issue is the gym's policy that allows women to use a quarter of the equipment and area, while men can use all of it, even though the entrance fee is the same. The author argues that it's sexist because it restricts access based on gender. The girlfriend thinks it's different for women, but the author doesn't see why that's a valid distinction.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the concept of equality here. If both genders pay the same, but one has restricted access, that seems unequal. The author's point is about fairness\u2014why should someone pay full price for limited access? The girlfriend's response suggests that there's a different rationale for women, but the author is questioning why that difference exists.\n\nFrom a logical standpoint, if you charge the same price but provide less access to one gender, that's a form of discrimination. The author is pointing out the inconsistency: if women can't use certain areas, why should men be allowed to use all areas when they pay the same? But the girlfriend's reaction implies that there's an unspoken reason for this setup, maybe related to creating a safe space for women, which the author isn't considering.\n\nHowever, the key here is whether the gym's policy is inherently sexist. If the women-only section is there to provide a safe environment for women, that could be a legitimate reason. But if it's a way to limit women's access without a valid justification, then it is discriminatory. The author is not wrong to question the fairness of being charged the same while having less access. The girlfriend might be defending a policy she sees as necessary for women, but the author's argument is about equal treatment.\n\nSo, the author isn't being an asshole. They're pointing out a potential inequality. The girlfriend's response that it's \"different for women\" without a clear explanation might be the issue here. The author isn't wrong for wanting to be treated equally.\n"
