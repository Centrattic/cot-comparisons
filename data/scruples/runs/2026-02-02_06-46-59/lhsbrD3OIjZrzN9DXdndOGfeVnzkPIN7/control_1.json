Recently my girlfriend suggested that I change over to her gym so we could carpool, workout together etc. Normally I would agree with this and be happy to go to the same gym as her, the problem is that her gym has a large \"**women only**\" section. The gym charges the same entrance fee for both men and women, but this section only allows women to use it and contains about 1/4 of the area of the gym and about 1/4 of the total workout equipment.\n\n I told my girlfriend that I didn't want to go to a gym that would charge someone 100% of the fee but only allow them to use 75% of the equipment because of their sex. When she said that I was being stupid about this I asked her if she would go to a gym that charged her the same as men, but forbid her from using a large portion of the equipment and area? She got upset at this, and said that \"*I just don't understand*\", and that \"*it's different for women*\".\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAm I being the asshole here and just not understanding?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not wanting to join his girlfriend's gym because it has a women-only section. The main issue is about the fairness of the gym's structure.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. Both the author and his girlfriend like working out and have been at different gyms. She suggested he switch to her gym for convenience, like carpooling. But her gym has a section exclusively for women, which takes up a quarter of the space and equipment. The author objects because he feels it's discriminatory\u2014paying the same but not having access to the same resources. The girlfriend thinks he's overreacting, saying it's different for women.\n\nNow, the key here is gender-based discrimination in access. The author is comparing his potential experience to how women would be treated. If a gym denied men access to part of the facility but charged them the same, that would be discriminatory. The author is pointing out the inconsistency. His girlfriend argues that it's different for women, but that might reflect a misunderstanding or acceptance of gendered spaces without considering the equality aspect.\n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong. Legally and ethically, discrimination based on gender in the provision of services is a problem. If the gym offers a women-only section, but everyone pays the same, there's a disparity in access. The author's argument is that if the same rule applied to men, they'd be upset, so it's hypocritical to accept it when it benefits women. \n\nHowever, some might argue that women-only spaces are intended to create a safe or welcoming environment for women, which is a different consideration. But if the gym is charging everyone the same rate without accounting for the restricted access, that's where the issue lies. The core of the problem is unequal access for equal cost, which is discriminatory regardless of the gender it affects.\n\nThe girlfriend's reaction might stem from a belief that women-only spaces are necessary or justified, but the author's point is about the principle of equal treatment. The author isn't against women-only sections per se, but against the inequity of paying full price for limited access. \n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? He's raising a valid point about fairness and equality. The girlfriend might not see it that way, but the author isn't being unreasonable in his stance. Therefore, the answer would be B (Not in the wrong).\n"
