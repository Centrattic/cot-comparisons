Recently my girlfriend suggested that I change over to her gym so we could carpool, workout together etc. Normally I would agree with this and be happy to go to the same gym as her, the problem is that her gym has a large \"**women only**\" section. The gym charges the same entrance fee for both men and women, but this section only allows women to use it and contains about 1/4 of the area of the gym and about 1/4 of the total workout equipment.\n\n I told my girlfriend that I didn't want to go to a gym that would charge someone 100% of the fee but only allow them to use 75% of the equipment because of their sex. When she said that I was being stupid about this I asked her if she would go to a gym that charged her the same as men, but forbid her from using a large portion of the equipment and area? She got upset at this, and said that \"*I just don't understand*\", and that \"*it's different for women*\".\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAm I being the asshole here and just not understanding?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is that the author and his girlfriend both work out at different gyms. She wants him to switch to her gym so they can carpool and work out together. The problem is that her gym has a \"women only\" section which takes up a quarter of the gym and a quarter of the equipment. The author is uncomfortable with this because he sees it as sexist\u2014he's paying the same fee but can't use all the equipment. The girlfriend gets upset when he questions why it's okay for women to have that restriction but not for men.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the concept of gender-segregated spaces. In many places, women-only sections in gyms are allowed because they provide a space where women might feel safer or more comfortable. However, from a legal standpoint, if the gym is charging the same fee for both genders but restricting access to parts of the facility based on sex, that could be a problem. In some countries, anti-discrimination laws might apply here. If the gym is offering a service (access to equipment and facilities) but denying it to one gender, that's discrimination. But the twist here is that the women-only section isn't the entire gym\u2014only a quarter. So the men can use the rest, but women can use the entire gym plus the women-only area. The author is paying full price but can't use the women's section, which might be a form of discrimination if the gym isn't providing equal access.\n\nThe author's argument is about fairness\u2014why should he pay the same for less access. The girlfriend's response that it's \"different for women\" suggests she sees the women's-only section as a necessary or beneficial provision for women. But the author is pointing out the inconsistency: if the gym were to restrict men the same way, she wouldn't be okay with it. \n\nNow, considering societal norms, some people might see the women's-only section as a positive step to encourage women to exercise in a space where they feel more comfortable. However, if the restriction is not based on legal requirements and is purely a policy decision by the gym, it might be seen as discriminatory. The key here is whether the gym's policy violates any anti-discrimination laws. If it does, then the gym is in the wrong, and the author is right to have a problem with it. If not, maybe the author's issue is more about personal discomfort rather than legal wrongdoing.\n\nThe girlfriend's reaction that the author is \"being stupid\" and not understanding could indicate a lack of awareness of the reasons behind the women-only sections. However, the author is highlighting a logical inconsistency in the setup. If the gym allowed only men to use a section and charged women the same fee, that would be a clear issue. Applying the same logic here, the author's stance is about equality of access for all paying members.\n\nIn conclusion, the author isn't being sexist by pointing out the inconsistency. He's raising a valid concern about equal access and fair treatment based on the same fee. Therefore, he's not in the wrong here.\n"
