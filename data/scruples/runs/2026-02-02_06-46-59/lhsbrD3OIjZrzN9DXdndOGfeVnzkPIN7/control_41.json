Recently my girlfriend suggested that I change over to her gym so we could carpool, workout together etc. Normally I would agree with this and be happy to go to the same gym as her, the problem is that her gym has a large \"**women only**\" section. The gym charges the same entrance fee for both men and women, but this section only allows women to use it and contains about 1/4 of the area of the gym and about 1/4 of the total workout equipment.\n\n I told my girlfriend that I didn't want to go to a gym that would charge someone 100% of the fee but only allow them to use 75% of the equipment because of their sex. When she said that I was being stupid about this I asked her if she would go to a gym that charged her the same as men, but forbid her from using a large portion of the equipment and area? She got upset at this, and said that \"*I just don't understand*\", and that \"*it's different for women*\".\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAm I being the asshole here and just not understanding?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person (the author) is in the wrong for not wanting to go to their girlfriend's gym because it has a women-only section. The main issue here is the author's objection to being charged the same fee but only allowed to use 75% of the equipment. Their girlfriend thinks the author is being unreasonable, saying \"it's different for women.\"\n\nFirst, I need to consider the concept of equality. The author is upset about being charged the same but restricted from using part of the facility. That seems like a clear case of unequal treatment based on gender. If the gym charges everyone the same but restricts access to certain areas based on sex, that's discriminatory. The argument here is about fair access and equal rights. The author is pointing out a discrepancy, which is valid.\n\nThen there's the girlfriend's response. She says \"it's different for women,\" which might imply that she believes the women-only section is justified. That could be a point of contention. The author is arguing that if the policy were reversed, women would be upset too. The girlfriend's reaction\u2014getting upset and calling the author stupid\u2014suggests there's a conflict in perspectives here.\n\nThe key question is whether the gym's policy is inherently sexist. If the gym offers a women-only section, which is common for reasons like safety or comfort, but still charges men the same price without restricting their access, that's a problem. It's like paying full price for limited access. The author is highlighting a form of gender-based discrimination, which is a valid concern.\n\nHowever, the girlfriend's perspective might be that the women-only section serves a purpose for women, and the author isn't recognizing that. But from the author's viewpoint, the gym isn't offering equal value for money. The fact that the women-only section takes up a quarter of the space and equipment means that men are effectively paying for access to 75% of the gym. That's a significant limitation, regardless of the existence of the women-only area.\n\nSo, the author isn't wrong for pointing out that the pricing policy is unfair. They're advocating for equal treatment. The girlfriend's reaction might stem from not seeing the issue from her partner's perspective. The author's stance is about challenging a policy that they perceive as discriminatory, which is a reasonable position. Therefore, the answer is that the author is not in the wrong.\n"
