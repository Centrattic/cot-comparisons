Recently my girlfriend suggested that I change over to her gym so we could carpool, workout together etc. Normally I would agree with this and be happy to go to the same gym as her, the problem is that her gym has a large \"**women only**\" section. The gym charges the same entrance fee for both men and women, but this section only allows women to use it and contains about 1/4 of the area of the gym and about 1/4 of the total workout equipment.\n\n I told my girlfriend that I didn't want to go to a gym that would charge someone 100% of the fee but only allow them to use 75% of the equipment because of their sex. When she said that I was being stupid about this I asked her if she would go to a gym that charged her the same as men, but forbid her from using a large portion of the equipment and area? She got upset at this, and said that \"*I just don't understand*\", and that \"*it's different for women*\".\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAm I being the asshole here and just not understanding?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. Let me start by reading the situation carefully. The author and their girlfriend both work out and have been going to different gyms. The girlfriend suggested they both join her gym so they can carpool and work out together. The problem is that her gym has a women-only section, which takes up a quarter of the gym's area and equipment. The author is objecting because they think it's sexist that men have to pay the same fee but can't use that section. The girlfriend got upset when he asked if she would go to a gym that did the same to women, and she said it's different for women.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the arguments from both sides. The author's main point is about fairness\u2014paying full price but having restricted access based on gender. That seems like a valid concern. If a gym charges everyone the same but has gender-based restrictions, it could be seen as discriminatory. However, the existence of a women-only section might be for reasons like safety or comfort. Many gyms have such sections to provide a space where women can work out without feeling intimidated or harassed, which is a legitimate need.\n\nThe author is drawing a parallel between his situation and the hypothetical scenario his girlfriend presented. He's pointing out the inconsistency in her stance if the roles were reversed. His girlfriend's response indicates that she sees a difference in how the situation affects women versus men, which might be due to societal context where women often face more barriers in male-dominated spaces.\n\nNow, considering fairness and equality. If the gym is allowing a section exclusive to women, but charging men the same, it does seem unequal. But the other side is that the rest of the gym is accessible to everyone. So maybe the author is focusing on the 25% restriction while ignoring the 75% that's available. However, if the pricing doesn't differentiate based on access, then it's a problem. It's like if you're charged the same price but have less access because of gender.\n\nBut why would the gym have a women-only section? It's a common practice to create safe spaces for women in gyms where they might feel uncomfortable. So the girlfriend's stance might be rooted in the need for such spaces. The author is not considering that maybe the women-only section serves a purpose that's important to her. He's arguing from a position of equal access, but his girlfriend might value the women-only space for reasons beyond just equipment access, like feeling safe.\n\nIs the author wrong for not wanting to go to a place that enforces such restrictions? He's not wrong per se, but maybe he's not understanding the deeper reasons behind the women-only section. The girlfriend's frustration might come from the author not acknowledging the necessity of that space for women. So while the author's point about fairness is valid, his girlfriend's perspective is also valid because the women-only section addresses a different issue.\n\nSo, is he the asshole? It depends on whether the comparison he made is fair. If the women-only section is a response to a real issue that women face in gyms, then his hypothetical scenario might not be equivalent. The problem is that he's equating both sides not having access, but the underlying reasons differ. Therefore, the author might be missing the context in which the women-only section exists, making him at least partially in the wrong for not understanding his girlfriend's perspective.\n"
