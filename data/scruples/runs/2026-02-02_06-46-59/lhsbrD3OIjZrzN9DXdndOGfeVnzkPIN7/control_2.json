Recently my girlfriend suggested that I change over to her gym so we could carpool, workout together etc. Normally I would agree with this and be happy to go to the same gym as her, the problem is that her gym has a large \"**women only**\" section. The gym charges the same entrance fee for both men and women, but this section only allows women to use it and contains about 1/4 of the area of the gym and about 1/4 of the total workout equipment.\n\n I told my girlfriend that I didn't want to go to a gym that would charge someone 100% of the fee but only allow them to use 75% of the equipment because of their sex. When she said that I was being stupid about this I asked her if she would go to a gym that charged her the same as men, but forbid her from using a large portion of the equipment and area? She got upset at this, and said that \"*I just don't understand*\", and that \"*it's different for women*\".\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAm I being the asshole here and just not understanding?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong. The situation is about a couple considering working out at the same gym, but the author is uncomfortable with the \"women only\" section because it feels sexist. The gym charges the same fee for both genders, but only allows women to use that section, which is 1/4 of the gym's area and equipment.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the core issue. The author argues that since the gym charges the same rate, men aren't getting the full value because they can't access the women-only section. The girlfriend, on the other hand, seems to support the women-only section, perhaps for reasons like feeling safer, less intimidated, or more comfortable in a space designed for women. \n\nI should consider the concept of gender-segregated spaces. In many contexts, like women-only gyms or sections, the rationale is to address specific needs or provide a safe environment. The author's perspective is that it's unfair because it's a form of discrimination. However, the girlfriend might see it as a positive initiative, giving women a dedicated area. \n\nThe key here is whether the \"women only\" section is inherently sexist. If the gym is offering a service that women can use without the presence of men, and it's part of their business model (even if they charge the same and men can't use it), is that acceptable? Or does it become sexist if it's not reciprocal for men? The author's main point is about equal access for the same price, which is a valid concern. But the girlfriend might view the section as a necessary accommodation, not discrimination. \n\nAnother angle: the author is approached by the girlfriend to switch gyms, and he's objecting because of the women-only section. The girlfriend's reaction suggests she's not seeing it as an issue. Is the author overstepping by not agreeing, or is the girlfriend's stance problematic? \n\nAlso, the question is about whether the author is in the wrong for not wanting to switch gyms due to this policy. The answer hinges on whether the policy is discriminatory. If the gym offers a premium area for women only, that might be different. But here, the author is paying the same fee and not getting access to the same portion of the gym. That could be seen as unequal treatment based on gender, which is a form of sexism. However, some argue that such sections are created to empower women, not to exclude men. \n\nI need to check if there's any legal or ethical precedent. In many places, public accommodations can't discriminate based on gender, but if a business chooses to offer separate spaces, it might be allowed as long as both are accessible. However, if the pricing is the same and the services aren't equivalent, that's a different issue. \n\nThe author's reasoning is that for the same price, men should have access to all areas. The girlfriend's response indicates she doesn't see the issue, perhaps because she benefits from the women-only section. The conflict is between the author's belief in equal access and the girlfriend's (and the gym's) belief in creating a women-specific space. \n\nSo, is the author wrong? If the gym is providing a service that only women can access for the same price, then the author's concern is about fairness and equality. But if the women-only section is a legitimate business decision to cater to a specific demographic, then the author's stance might be considered not understanding the purpose of such sections. \n\nIn relationships, compromise is important. The author might be standing by his principles, while the girlfriend is standing by hers. Whether one is wrong depends on the context. If the gym's policy is legal and intended to support women, then the author's objection might be viewed as not being the asshole, but rather having a different perspective. However, if the policy is seen as discriminatory, then the author could be right to object. \n\nBut the user is asking for a binary answer (A or B). In similar discussions, people often argue that such spaces can be positive for women, especially in environments where they might feel uncomfortable. The author is not being sexist himself by objecting to what he perceives as sexism, but the situation is nuanced. The girlfriend's reaction suggests she feels the section is justified, so the author might not be in the wrong for not agreeing to switch gyms. \n\nTherefore, the answer is B (No), the author is not in the wrong.\n"
