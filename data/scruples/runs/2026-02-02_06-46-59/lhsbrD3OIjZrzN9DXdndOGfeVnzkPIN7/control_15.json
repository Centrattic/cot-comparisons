Recently my girlfriend suggested that I change over to her gym so we could carpool, workout together etc. Normally I would agree with this and be happy to go to the same gym as her, the problem is that her gym has a large \"**women only**\" section. The gym charges the same entrance fee for both men and women, but this section only allows women to use it and contains about 1/4 of the area of the gym and about 1/4 of the total workout equipment.\n\n I told my girlfriend that I didn't want to go to a gym that would charge someone 100% of the fee but only allow them to use 75% of the equipment because of their sex. When she said that I was being stupid about this I asked her if she would go to a gym that charged her the same as men, but forbid her from using a large portion of the equipment and area? She got upset at this, and said that \"*I just don't understand*\", and that \"*it's different for women*\".\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAm I being the asshole here and just not understanding?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the post is in the wrong. The situation involves a girlfriend suggesting they go to the same gym, but the guy objects because her gym has a women-only section. He thinks it's sexist because men can't use that part, even though they pay the same fee. His girlfriend thinks he's being unreasonable.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The gym charges the same price for both genders but has a section reserved exclusively for women. The man is upset about not having access to 25% of the equipment and area, which he sees as unfair. The woman argues that it's different for women, maybe implying that the women-only section serves a purpose, like safety or comfort.\n\nFrom a fairness standpoint, if both genders are paying the same but one group has restricted access, that could be seen as discriminatory. The man's argument is about equal access for equal price. However, the gym might offer the women-only section as a service, which could be a business decision to attract more women, ensuring their safety or comfort. The woman might feel that this section is important for her, and the gym's structure is intended to support inclusivity for women.\n\nBut the man's perspective is that if he can't use all the facilities he's paying for, it's unfair. He's comparing it to a hypothetical where a woman would be upset if she couldn't use part of the gym. The girlfriend's reaction suggests she doesn't see the same issue from his angle, which could be due to differing views on gender roles or experiences. \n\nLegally and ethically, the gym isn't violating any laws by having a women-only section as long as it's not part of a discriminatory policy. However, from a fairness perspective, if the man is paying for full access but can't use all areas, it's a valid concern. The conflict here is between the woman's need for a safe space and the man's expectation of equal access.\n\nThe question is whether the author is wrong for not wanting to go. The answer depends on whether the gym's policy is considered discriminatory. Since the gym is charging the same and offering a separate section (which some might argue is a service, not discrimination), the author might be in the wrong for not accepting this arrangement. However, the author's point about equal access is also valid. But in many cases, such segregated sections are allowed to promote inclusivity, so the author's stance could be seen as not understanding the context. Therefore, the answer might lean towards A, but I need to verify the reasoning.\n"
