Recently my girlfriend suggested that I change over to her gym so we could carpool, workout together etc. Normally I would agree with this and be happy to go to the same gym as her, the problem is that her gym has a large \"**women only**\" section. The gym charges the same entrance fee for both men and women, but this section only allows women to use it and contains about 1/4 of the area of the gym and about 1/4 of the total workout equipment.\n\n I told my girlfriend that I didn't want to go to a gym that would charge someone 100% of the fee but only allow them to use 75% of the equipment because of their sex. When she said that I was being stupid about this I asked her if she would go to a gym that charged her the same as men, but forbid her from using a large portion of the equipment and area? She got upset at this, and said that \"*I just don't understand*\", and that \"*it's different for women*\".\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAm I being the asshole here and just not understanding?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for not wanting to switch gyms because they have a women-only section. The key points here are about gender equality and the gym's policy. The author's main argument is that the gym charges the same fee for both genders but restricts access based on sex, which they find sexist. The girlfriend, on the other hand, sees it as different for women, possibly due to historical context or the need for safer spaces.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal and ethical aspects. In many places, gender-based restrictions can be problematic unless there's a legitimate reason, like legal protections for marginalized groups. However, if the gym is providing a women-only section for reasons such as safety or community building, that might be seen as a positive for women. The author's concern is about equal access to facilities for the same price, which is a valid point if there's no justification for the restriction.\n\nNext, the social context. Some gyms have women-only hours or sections to address issues like harassment or to create a more comfortable environment for women. The author might not see this as a necessary accommodation, but for the women using it, it's an important feature. The girlfriend's frustration could stem from the author not recognizing the value of such spaces. \n\nThen there's the personal relationship aspect. The author is trying to maintain their preferences, which is okay, but if it's causing conflict and the girlfriend feels her needs are not being respected, that's a problem. The question is whether the author's stance is reasonable. If the gym's policy is legally and ethically sound, then the author might be the one in the wrong for not accepting it. However, if the policy itself is seen as discriminatory from the author's perspective, then they aren't in the wrong.\n\nI also need to check if the gym's policy is within legal boundaries. In many jurisdictions, businesses can have women-only services if they provide a legitimate reason, such as addressing historical exclusion. So the policy might not be illegal, but the author's objection is about fairness. The crux is whether the author is being sexist by not recognizing the necessity of the women-only section or if the gym is indeed being discriminatory by restricting access.\n\nThe girlfriend's response that the author is \"stupid\" and not understanding might indicate a communication issue. The author is trying to highlight inconsistency, but the girlfriend feels her perspective isn't being validated. This is a common point of contention in relationships where both parties have different values.\n\nIn conclusion, whether the author is in the wrong depends on the legitimacy of the gym's policy. If the policy is justified, then the author's objection might be the problem. But if the policy is seen as a form of segregation without just cause, then the author isn't in the wrong. However, given that the women-only section is a common practice and often considered a positive for inclusivity, the author's stance could be viewed as not understanding the necessity, making them the asshole in the situation.\n"
