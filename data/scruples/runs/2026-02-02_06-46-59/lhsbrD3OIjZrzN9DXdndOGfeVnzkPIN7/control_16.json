Recently my girlfriend suggested that I change over to her gym so we could carpool, workout together etc. Normally I would agree with this and be happy to go to the same gym as her, the problem is that her gym has a large \"**women only**\" section. The gym charges the same entrance fee for both men and women, but this section only allows women to use it and contains about 1/4 of the area of the gym and about 1/4 of the total workout equipment.\n\n I told my girlfriend that I didn't want to go to a gym that would charge someone 100% of the fee but only allow them to use 75% of the equipment because of their sex. When she said that I was being stupid about this I asked her if she would go to a gym that charged her the same as men, but forbid her from using a large portion of the equipment and area? She got upset at this, and said that \"*I just don't understand*\", and that \"*it's different for women*\".\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAm I being the asshole here and just not understanding?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that the author and his girlfriend both work out, but at different gyms. The girlfriend suggests they switch to the same gym for convenience. The problem is that the girlfriend's gym has a women-only section, which takes up a quarter of the space and equipment. The author is against this because he thinks it's unfair to pay the same fee but have less access if you're a man. The girlfriend thinks he's being stupid and says it's different for women.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the core issue. The author is objecting to the gym having a women-only section because it's discriminatory from a gender-neutral pricing perspective. If you pay the same fee regardless of gender, but women get a section that men can't use, then effectively, men are paying for access to a part of the gym they can't use, and vice versa. But the gym might be doing this to accommodate women who prefer a space without men, which could be about comfort or safety.\n\nBut the author's argument is that it's sexist because the pricing isn't adjusted to reflect the access. If the gym charges the same for both genders but restricts access based on gender, that could be seen as discriminatory against men. On the other hand, the women-only section is a form of positive discrimination, meant to support women in a space where they might feel more comfortable, which is a common practice in some gyms and other institutions.\n\nSo, is the author wrong for objecting? From a fairness standpoint, if the pricing isn't adjusted for the access, then the author has a point. However, the gym might be providing this section as a service to female members, which is a different kind of service. The girlfriend might not see the issue because she benefits from the section. The author is trying to apply a principle of equal access and equal pricing. If you pay the same, you should get the same value. But the gym is segmenting the space, which might not be fair if it's not priced differently.\n\nBut maybe the author is not considering the social context. The women-only section is meant to address historical underrepresentation or to create a safe space for women. So, is it sexist to have such a section? Not necessarily. It's about inclusion and empowering women. The author's issue is with the pricing model. If the gym charges the same regardless of access, that could be seen as unfair. However, the gym might argue that the women-only section is a feature that adds value for female members, and male members don't pay for it because they don't use it. Wait, but if the fee is the same, then effectively male members are subsidizing that section. That's where the author's point comes in.\n\nBut maybe the gym's total fee includes all the equipment and space, including the women-only section. So, if the women-only section is part of the gym, then male members are paying for it, but can't use it. That would be a problem. If the gym's total area and equipment are split into sections, and men can't access one of the sections, but pay the same price, that's a discrepancy. So the author's argument is valid in that case.\n\nHowever, the girlfriend might not see it that way because she benefits from the women-only section. She might think it's a good service that's worth the same price. The author is trying to point out that it's a form of sex-based discrimination in pricing. So, is the author wrong? It depends on the gym's structure. If the fee is the same but access is restricted based on sex, then the author is not wrong in pointing out the inconsistency. However, the women-only section is a different context. It's a space for women, which might be considered a form of affirmative action or inclusion.\n\nIn terms of the question, the user is asking if the author is in the wrong. The options are A for yes, B for no. The author's argument is about fairness in pricing and access. If the gym's structure is indeed charging the same fee but restricting access based on gender, the author is pointing out a potential inequity. However, the existence of the women-only section isn't inherently sexist; it's about inclusion. So the author might be missing the reason why the section exists. But his point about the pricing is valid. The girlfriend's reaction might be defensive because she's used to the section and doesn't see the issue. \n\nIn conclusion, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong for questioning the pricing structure. The gym's policy might be problematic if it's not adjusting pricing based on access. However, the author might not fully understand the rationale behind the women-only section. So, the answer would be B (he's not in the wrong) because his argument about the pricing and access is a valid concern, even if the girlfriend doesn't see it that way.\n"
