Recently my girlfriend suggested that I change over to her gym so we could carpool, workout together etc. Normally I would agree with this and be happy to go to the same gym as her, the problem is that her gym has a large \"**women only**\" section. The gym charges the same entrance fee for both men and women, but this section only allows women to use it and contains about 1/4 of the area of the gym and about 1/4 of the total workout equipment.\n\n I told my girlfriend that I didn't want to go to a gym that would charge someone 100% of the fee but only allow them to use 75% of the equipment because of their sex. When she said that I was being stupid about this I asked her if she would go to a gym that charged her the same as men, but forbid her from using a large portion of the equipment and area? She got upset at this, and said that \"*I just don't understand*\", and that \"*it's different for women*\".\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAm I being the asshole here and just not understanding?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that the author and their girlfriend both go to the gym, but they're at different places. The girlfriend wants them to go to her gym so they can carpool and work out together. The author is okay with that, but there's a problem: her gym has a \"women only\" section that takes up a quarter of the gym and a quarter of the equipment. The author feels that if they pay the same fee as women, they should have access to all areas, not just 75% because of their sex.\n\nFirst, the author is pointing out a potential inconsistency in how the gym treats its members based on gender. If the gym charges everyone the same but restricts access to certain areas based on sex, that could be seen as discriminatory. The author is making a logical argument: if women can have a section that's off-limits to men, why can't men have the same? The girlfriend, however, responds that it's \"different for women,\" which suggests she doesn't see the issue the same way.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author is wrong for not wanting to go to a gym with such a policy. The author isn't refusing to work out with the girlfriend out of spite or selfishness; they're raising a valid point about equal treatment. The gym's policy might be intended to create a safe space for women, which is a common practice in some gyms. However, if the gym is charging men the same but limiting their access, that could be discriminatory against men. \n\nThe girlfriend's reaction seems dismissive. She accuses the author of being stupid and doesn't engage with the logical question he asks. Her response, \"I just don't understand,\" and \"it's different for women,\" might indicate she's not considering the reciprocal situation. The author is essentially pointing out a potential double standard. If the roles were reversed and the gym had a \"men only\" section that women couldn't use, the author might be upset. So, by that logic, the author's stance is about equality.\n\nHowever, there's also the context of the relationship. The author is trying to accommodate the girlfriend by switching gyms, but the policy makes them uncomfortable. It's possible that the girlfriend feels the women-only section is important for her personal comfort and safety, and she might not see the issue the author is pointing out. The author's refusal to switch gyms could be seen as a valid stance if they believe in equal access, but it could also be seen as not being considerate of the girlfriend's needs.\n\nIn terms of legal and ethical standards, many places have laws against gender discrimination in public accommodations. If the gym is doing this, it might be illegal. However, the context here is about personal relationships rather than legal action. From a social perspective, the author's argument is about fairness, while the girlfriend's stance is about the necessity of the women-only section. \n\nSo, the author isn't necessarily wrong for not wanting to go to a gym with a policy they find discriminatory. They're addressing a logical inconsistency. The girlfriend, on the other hand, might not see it as a problem because the women-only section serves a purpose she values. The key is whether the gym's policy is discriminatory, which the author is pointing out. Therefore, the author isn't the asshole here; they're standing up for their principles regarding equal treatment.\n"
