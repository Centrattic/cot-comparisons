Recently my girlfriend suggested that I change over to her gym so we could carpool, workout together etc. Normally I would agree with this and be happy to go to the same gym as her, the problem is that her gym has a large \"**women only**\" section. The gym charges the same entrance fee for both men and women, but this section only allows women to use it and contains about 1/4 of the area of the gym and about 1/4 of the total workout equipment.\n\n I told my girlfriend that I didn't want to go to a gym that would charge someone 100% of the fee but only allow them to use 75% of the equipment because of their sex. When she said that I was being stupid about this I asked her if she would go to a gym that charged her the same as men, but forbid her from using a large portion of the equipment and area? She got upset at this, and said that \"*I just don't understand*\", and that \"*it's different for women*\".\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAm I being the asshole here and just not understanding?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about a couple who both work out but go to different gyms. The girlfriend suggests they switch to the same gym to carpool and work out together. The author is reluctant because the gym has a \"women only\" section, which takes up 1/4 of the space and equipment. The author argues that it's unfair to pay the same fee but have access to only 75% of the equipment. The girlfriend gets upset when he questions if she would accept the reverse situation.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the concept of single-gender spaces. In many contexts, like locker rooms or certain yoga classes, women-only spaces are accepted as providing a safe environment. Gyms might have these sections to cater to women who feel more comfortable working out without men, which could be a valid reason. The author is arguing from a fairness perspective\u2014paying the same but having less access. But the gym's policy isn't about charging more; it's about offering a space where women can work out alone if they choose. The women can still use the entire gym if they want; the women-only section is an option. So maybe the author's reasoning is flawed because he's assuming that the women-only section restricts their access. Wait, the description says the women-only section is separate, but the rest of the gym is open to everyone. So women can use the entire gym, but they have an exclusive area. Men can't use the women-only section, but they can use the rest. So the author is saying that if he goes to this gym, he can only use 75% of the equipment, but the women can use all of it. But actually, women can use all the equipment\u2014they just have an option for a women-only area. Men would only have access to the non-women-only sections. So the author is not being charged for the women-only section, but he can't access it. But the fee is the same for both. So if the gym charges the same fee regardless of access, is that unfair? \n\nThe author's argument is that it's discriminatory because he's paying the same but getting less access. However, the gym's structure is designed to provide a specific service to women (a safe space) without charging them extra. The author might not see that the women-only section isn't meant to exclude men from the entire gym but to offer an option for women. The girlfriend's response that \"it's different for women\" might be pointing out that such spaces address specific needs women have, which aren't the same for men. The author's comparison about women being forbidden from using equipment is not parallel because the women-only section is an added benefit, not a restriction. Therefore, the author might be misunderstanding the intent of the gym's policy and framing it as a personal issue rather than a service offering. So maybe the author is in the wrong because he's not respecting the purpose of the women-only section, which is to provide a choice for women, not to limit men's access beyond the fee structure. Alternatively, if the gym charges the same for both and men can't use a portion, is that inherently sexist? But the key is that women can use the entire gym plus the exclusive area. Men can't go into the women-only section, but they can use the rest. So the author's logic is flawed because he's assuming the women-only section is a subtraction from the total access, but it's actually an addition for women. Therefore, the author is wrong to not accept the gym's policy, as it's not about discrimination but about providing different options. Hence, the answer would be A, the author is in the wrong.\n"
