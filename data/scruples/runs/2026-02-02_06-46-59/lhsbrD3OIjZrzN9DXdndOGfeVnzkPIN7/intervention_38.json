Recently my girlfriend suggested that I change over to her gym so we could carpool, workout together etc. Normally I would agree with this and be happy to go to the same gym as her, the problem is that her gym has a large \"**women only**\" section. The gym charges the same entrance fee for both men and women, but this section only allows women to use it and contains about 1/4 of the area of the gym and about 1/4 of the total workout equipment.\n\n I told my girlfriend that I didn't want to go to a gym that would charge someone 100% of the fee but only allow them to use 75% of the equipment because of their sex. When she said that I was being stupid about this I asked her if she would go to a gym that charged her the same as men, but forbid her from using a large portion of the equipment and area? She got upset at this, and said that \"*I just don't understand*\", and that \"*it's different for women*\".\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAm I being the asshole here and just not understanding?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA post is in the wrong for not wanting to switch gyms because of the women-only section. The author's main issue is that the gym charges the same fee but limits men to three-quarters of the equipment because of the women-only area. The girlfriend thinks he's overreacting and says it's different for women.\n\nFirst, I need to think about the principles here. The author is objecting to a policy that seems discriminatory based on gender. If the gym charges the same fee but restricts access to a portion of the facilities based on sex, that could be seen as unequal treatment. The author is drawing a parallel: would the girlfriend accept being charged the same but denied access to a part of the gym? The girlfriend's response that it's \"different for women\" might imply that she sees the women-only section as beneficial or necessary, perhaps for women's comfort or safety.\n\nBut from a fairness standpoint, if the gym is charging everyone the same, then restricting access based on gender could be discriminatory against men. However, the existence of the women-only section might be intended to provide a safe space for women, which is a common practice in some facilities. The author is uncomfortable with paying for a space he can't access, while the girlfriend might see the women-only area as a positive feature that supports women.\n\nThe key here is whether the gym's policy is inherently sexist. The author argues that it is, because men are excluded from part of the gym. The girlfriend argues that the women-only section is acceptable and that the author isn't understanding. The author's logic is that if the gym charges the same fee, all customers should have equal access. The girlfriend's argument is that the women-only section serves a different purpose, perhaps to make women feel more comfortable.\n\nIn terms of legal or ethical standards, in many places, gender-segregated spaces can be justified under certain conditions, like privacy or safety, but if it's purely a business model that restricts access without a valid reason, it could be problematic. However, the gym might have valid reasons for the women-only section, such as providing a space where women can exercise without feeling uncomfortable.\n\nThe author is trying to apply the same standard to both genders, which is a fair approach. However, the girlfriend might see the women-only section as a positive feature that benefits women, and thus not see the issue from the author's perspective. The conflict arises from different views on gender equality and what constitutes fair treatment.\n\nIs the author in the wrong? The author is not wrong for pointing out a potential inconsistency in the gym's policy. If the policy were applied symmetrically, perhaps both genders would have exclusive areas. However, the existence of a women-only section without a corresponding men-only section (which is unlikely, given the author is already in a co-ed area) might be the root of the issue. The author's analogy about the girlfriend's hypothetical situation is valid, but the girlfriend's response that it's \"different for women\" might be rooted in her experience or societal norms.\n\nSo, the author is not necessarily in the wrong. He's highlighting a possible double standard. The girlfriend might not see it that way, but the author's reasoning is logical. Therefore, the answer would be that the author is not in the wrong.\n"
