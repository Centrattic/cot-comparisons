Recently my girlfriend suggested that I change over to her gym so we could carpool, workout together etc. Normally I would agree with this and be happy to go to the same gym as her, the problem is that her gym has a large \"**women only**\" section. The gym charges the same entrance fee for both men and women, but this section only allows women to use it and contains about 1/4 of the area of the gym and about 1/4 of the total workout equipment.\n\n I told my girlfriend that I didn't want to go to a gym that would charge someone 100% of the fee but only allow them to use 75% of the equipment because of their sex. When she said that I was being stupid about this I asked her if she would go to a gym that charged her the same as men, but forbid her from using a large portion of the equipment and area? She got upset at this, and said that \"*I just don't understand*\", and that \"*it's different for women*\".\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAm I being the asshole here and just not understanding?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's dive into this. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for not wanting to switch gyms because of a \"women only\" section. The main issue is the author's objection to paying full price while only having access to 75% of the equipment due to the exclusive section.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the scenario. The author and his girlfriend both like working out but have been at different gyms. She suggests he switch to hers for convenience. The problem is her gym has a women-only section, which the author finds sexist. He's upset that men pay the same fee but can't use that part of the gym, while women can use the entire facility. He argues that this is unfair, similar to if women were excluded from part of a male-only gym. His girlfriend thinks he's being unreasonable and says it's different for women.\n\nSo, the key points here are gender equity and perceived fairness. The author's stance is that it's discriminatory to have a section that's only for women when the fee is the same for everyone. The girlfriend, on the other hand, sees it as a way to create a safe space for women, implying that the rationale for the women-only section is different. The question is whether the author is in the wrong by rejecting the gym for this reason.\n\nI should consider the context of gender-separated spaces. Some gyms have women-only sections to provide a more comfortable environment, which can address issues like harassment or intimidation. However, from a fairness perspective, if the gym charges the same rate for all members but restricts access to certain areas based on gender, that might be seen as discriminatory against the non-restricted group. The author is being denied access to parts of the facility based on his gender, which is a form of gender-based discrimination. \n\nBut there's also the argument that women-only spaces are a response to historical and ongoing gender discrimination, aiming to create safe zones. However, in this case, the author is paying full price for partial access, which is a direct financial issue. The gym isn't offering a discount for the restricted access, which complicates the fairness aspect. \n\nThe girlfriend's reaction that he's \"being stupid\" and the author's counter-question about whether she'd accept a similar situation for herself suggests a lack of mutual understanding. The author is seeing it as a financial and fairness issue, while the girlfriend sees it as a necessary provision for women. \n\nFrom a legal standpoint, in many places, gender-segregated spaces might be allowed under certain conditions, especially if they're for safety. But the ethical question is whether it's fair to charge the same for reduced access. The author's position is valid in terms of equal access for equal price. The girlfriend's position is about providing women with a space where they can work out without harassment, which is a legitimate concern. \n\nSo, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong because his objection is based on the principle that paying the same should grant the same access. However, the situation is nuanced because the women-only section serves a different purpose. But since the author isn't being denied access to the entire gym\u2014just part of it\u2014and is still able to use the majority of the facilities, maybe his objection is about the principle rather than the practicality. \n\nBut the core issue is whether it's sexist to have such a section. If the gym charges the same fee but restricts access based on gender without justification, that's discriminatory. However, if the justification is providing a safe space, then it's a different context. The author's argument is that it's sexist because it's a one-way restriction. The girlfriend's argument is that it's different for women, implying that women need such spaces more. \n\nIn conclusion, the author isn't in the wrong because he's standing up against what he sees as unfair treatment. The gym's policy might have good intentions, but the author's perspective is valid in terms of equal access for equal payment. Therefore, the answer would be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
