Recently my girlfriend suggested that I change over to her gym so we could carpool, workout together etc. Normally I would agree with this and be happy to go to the same gym as her, the problem is that her gym has a large \"**women only**\" section. The gym charges the same entrance fee for both men and women, but this section only allows women to use it and contains about 1/4 of the area of the gym and about 1/4 of the total workout equipment.\n\n I told my girlfriend that I didn't want to go to a gym that would charge someone 100% of the fee but only allow them to use 75% of the equipment because of their sex. When she said that I was being stupid about this I asked her if she would go to a gym that charged her the same as men, but forbid her from using a large portion of the equipment and area? She got upset at this, and said that \"*I just don't understand*\", and that \"*it's different for women*\".\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAm I being the asshole here and just not understanding?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking if the person in the scenario is in the wrong for not wanting to switch gyms because of the women-only section.\n\nFirst, the situation: The man's girlfriend wants him to change to her gym for carpooling and working out together. The gym has a women-only section, which makes up a quarter of the equipment and area. The man objects because he feels it's sexist\u2014he's being charged the same but can't use all the equipment. His girlfriend gets upset, saying he doesn't understand and that it's different for women.\n\nI need to determine if the man is in the wrong. Let's break it down. The key issue is gender segregation in a co-ed gym. The man is arguing against a policy where women have a restricted area, which he sees as unequal. His argument is that if he can't access all the equipment, it's unfair. The girlfriend defends it, implying that women have specific needs that justify the separation.\n\nFrom a fairness perspective, if the gym charges everyone the same but restricts access based on gender, that seems discriminatory. Both parties are paying the same fee, so they should have equal access. The existence of a women-only section might be intended to create a safe space for women, but if it results in unequal access for men, that could be problematic. \n\nHowever, the girlfriend might argue that the women-only section serves a purpose\u2014perhaps to make women feel more comfortable in an otherwise male-dominated environment. But if the gym is co-ed in the remaining 75%, and the women's section is a smaller, separate area, then the man's point about unequal access stands. The gym isn't providing equal value for the same price. \n\nAnother angle: The man is not opposing the women-only section per se, but the fact that it limits his access. If the gym had a men-only section but allowed women to use most of the gym, he might have a similar issue. So his objection is about unequal treatment, not the existence of the women's section itself.\n\nThe girlfriend's response that \"it's different for women\" might be a form of justifying the segregation without addressing the inequality. If she's okay with the current setup and doesn't see the problem, she might not recognize the double standard. \n\nLegally, in many places, it's allowed to have single-sex facilities if they're for health, safety, or privacy reasons. But in a commercial setting like a gym, if the charge is the same but access is restricted based on gender, it could be considered discriminatory. The man is pointing out the inconsistency, which isn't necessarily being an asshole.\n\nSo, he's standing up for his beliefs about equality and pointing out a potential issue. His girlfriend is frustrated because she might not see it the same way. The man isn't in the wrong for highlighting the inequality. Therefore, the answer is B (he's not in the wrong).\n"
