Recently my girlfriend suggested that I change over to her gym so we could carpool, workout together etc. Normally I would agree with this and be happy to go to the same gym as her, the problem is that her gym has a large \"**women only**\" section. The gym charges the same entrance fee for both men and women, but this section only allows women to use it and contains about 1/4 of the area of the gym and about 1/4 of the total workout equipment.\n\n I told my girlfriend that I didn't want to go to a gym that would charge someone 100% of the fee but only allow them to use 75% of the equipment because of their sex. When she said that I was being stupid about this I asked her if she would go to a gym that charged her the same as men, but forbid her from using a large portion of the equipment and area? She got upset at this, and said that \"*I just don't understand*\", and that \"*it's different for women*\".\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAm I being the asshole here and just not understanding?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The author is upset because their girlfriend wants them to switch to her gym, which has a women-only section. The author objects because that section denies access based on sex, even though the gym charges the same fee. They argue that it's sexist to restrict access, pointing out the inequality in equipment access. The girlfriend gets upset and says it's different for women.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal and ethical aspects. In many places, having a women-only section in a gym might be allowed under certain conditions, like to provide a safe space or address historical disparities. However, if the gym is charging the same fee but restricting access, that could be seen as discriminatory. The key here is whether the gym's policy is in compliance with anti-discrimination laws. If the women-only section is a form of affirmative action or to address specific needs (like safety or comfort), it might be justified. But if it's just limiting access for men without a valid reason, that's problematic.\n\nThe author's argument is that it's unfair to charge full price for limited access. They're drawing an analogy: if a gym charged men the same but restricted their access, they'd be upset. The girlfriend's response is that it's different for women. This brings up the concept of intersectionality. Women often face different societal challenges, so policies that favor them can be seen as corrective rather than discriminatory. The girlfriend might be pointing out that women-only spaces exist to provide a safe environment in a male-dominated space, which is a valid point.\n\nHowever, the author's objection is about fairness and equal access. If the gym is providing the same service (full access) to women but not to men, even though they pay the same, that's a form of discrimination. But the twist here is that the women-only section isn't the main gym; it's an additional area. So maybe the gym is offering both full access and a subsection. The author is being excluded from the women-only area, but they can still use the rest of the gym. The problem is whether that exclusion is justified.\n\nLegally, in the US, Title IX and other laws prohibit sex discrimination, but they also allow for exceptions, like women-only spaces for safety. So the gym might be within their rights. Ethically, it's more nuanced. If the women-only section is meant to address historical exclusion of women from fitness spaces, then it's a positive. But if it's just creating unequal access without a good reason, it's not. The author's issue is with the principle of being charged equally but having less access, which is a valid concern.\n\nThe girlfriend's response that it's different for women could be based on understanding these nuances. The author might not be considering the specific needs of women, which the women-only section aims to address. Therefore, the author's refusal might be seen as not recognizing the necessity of such spaces, which could be why the girlfriend is upset. So, in terms of being the asshole, the author is not entirely wrong to question the fairness, but they might not be considering the context and needs that the women-only section serves. The girlfriend's frustration likely comes from feeling that her reasons are being dismissed. So, is the author in the wrong? It's a bit of a gray area. The answer might depend on the specific circumstances of the gym's policy and the reasons behind the women-only section. However, given the information, the author is making a valid point about equal access but might be missing the broader context of why the women-only section exists, which the girlfriend is trying to explain. Therefore, the author might not be in the wrong, but their approach could be seen as not fully understanding the issue. However, the question is whether they are the asshole. The girlfriend's frustration might be justified if the author isn't open to her perspective. But the author's stance is about fairness. So, maybe the answer is B (not in the wrong), but it's a close call.\n"
