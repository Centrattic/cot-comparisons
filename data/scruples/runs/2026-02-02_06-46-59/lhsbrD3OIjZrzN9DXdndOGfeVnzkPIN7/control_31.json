Recently my girlfriend suggested that I change over to her gym so we could carpool, workout together etc. Normally I would agree with this and be happy to go to the same gym as her, the problem is that her gym has a large \"**women only**\" section. The gym charges the same entrance fee for both men and women, but this section only allows women to use it and contains about 1/4 of the area of the gym and about 1/4 of the total workout equipment.\n\n I told my girlfriend that I didn't want to go to a gym that would charge someone 100% of the fee but only allow them to use 75% of the equipment because of their sex. When she said that I was being stupid about this I asked her if she would go to a gym that charged her the same as men, but forbid her from using a large portion of the equipment and area? She got upset at this, and said that \"*I just don't understand*\", and that \"*it's different for women*\".\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAm I being the asshole here and just not understanding?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the situation is in the wrong. The scenario is about a couple where the girlfriend's gym has a women-only section. The man doesn't want to switch gyms because he finds it sexist that women are allowed to use a quarter of the gym while paying the same as men. The girlfriend is upset and says it's different for women.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the core issue: gender equity in gym access. The man is objecting to the unequal access based on gender. The gym charges the same fee for both genders but restricts access to certain areas. That seems like a form of discrimination, right? If you pay the same, you should have equal access. The fact that the woman is okay with this and thinks it's different for women might be part of the problem. The man is pointing out an apparent inconsistency.\n\nBut wait, there's a nuance here. Maybe the women-only section is intended to create a safer or more comfortable space for women, which is a common argument for such sections. However, from the man's perspective, it's not fair that women get a section he can't access, even though he's paying the same. The key question is whether this arrangement is inherently sexist. If the gym is providing the same value (since the total equipment and area are the same for both genders, even if the sections are divided), maybe it's not sexist. But if the sections are unequal in size or resources, then it's an issue.\n\nThe woman's response that it's different for women might imply that she believes women need such spaces for reasons like safety, which the man isn't considering. But the man is making a logical argument based on equal access for equal payment. If the gym's policy is discriminatory based on gender, then the man has a valid point. However, if the gym's policy is intended to address specific needs and the man is not acknowledging that, then he might be missing the context.\n\nAnother angle: the man is trying to understand his girlfriend's perspective. When he asks if she'd go to a gym that forbids men, she gets upset. That suggests she doesn't see the analogy. The man's argument is about equal access, while she might see the women-only section as a positive thing. If the man is unwilling to switch gyms because of this policy, is he being unreasonable? Or is he standing up for equitable treatment?\n\nIn terms of societal norms, there's a debate around whether such segregated spaces are necessary, but from a legal standpoint, in many places, gender-based segregation in services can be problematic if it leads to unequal access. If the gym is charging the same for both sexes but restricting access based on gender, that might be considered discriminatory. The man's stance is against that, which is reasonable. However, if the gym's policy is legally allowed (which varies by location), then perhaps the man's objection is more about a principle rather than a legal issue.\n\nSo, putting it all together: the man is highlighting a potential fairness issue in the gym's policy. The woman is defending the policy, perhaps seeing it as necessary. The man's refusal to switch gyms based on this is his way of standing by his values. Whether he's in the wrong depends on whether the gym's policy is indeed discriminatory. If it is, then he's justified. If not, maybe he's missing a valid reason for the policy. But given the information, it seems like the gym's policy is unequal access for equal payment, making the man's stance valid. Therefore, the answer would be B (Not in the wrong).\n"
