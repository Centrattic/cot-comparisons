Recently my girlfriend suggested that I change over to her gym so we could carpool, workout together etc. Normally I would agree with this and be happy to go to the same gym as her, the problem is that her gym has a large \"**women only**\" section. The gym charges the same entrance fee for both men and women, but this section only allows women to use it and contains about 1/4 of the area of the gym and about 1/4 of the total workout equipment.\n\n I told my girlfriend that I didn't want to go to a gym that would charge someone 100% of the fee but only allow them to use 75% of the equipment because of their sex. When she said that I was being stupid about this I asked her if she would go to a gym that charged her the same as men, but forbid her from using a large portion of the equipment and area? She got upset at this, and said that \"*I just don't understand*\", and that \"*it's different for women*\".\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAm I being the asshole here and just not understanding?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person in the scenario is the asshole for not wanting to go to a gym that has a women-only section, which they find sexist. The girlfriend suggests switching gyms for convenience, but the author objects because the gym charges the same fee but restricts access based on gender. The girlfriend gets upset when the author questions her about the same scenario if the roles were reversed.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze the situation from both perspectives. The author's main point is about fairness and equality. They argue that paying the same fee but having restricted access is discriminatory. That's a valid point because discrimination based on gender in such a context is generally considered unethical. The gym's policy of having a women-only section might be intended to create a safe space for women, which is understandable, but the fact that men are charged the same fee yet can't access all areas could be seen as unequal treatment.\n\nOn the other hand, the girlfriend might be defending the women-only section as a positive space for women, maybe where they can work out without feeling uncomfortable around men. However, if the gym charges the same price for everyone but limits access for men, that seems like a double standard. The author's analogy of asking if the girlfriend would go to a gym that barred her from 25% of the equipment is a fair way to highlight the inconsistency. If the gym allowed men to use all areas but women couldn't use certain parts, that would likely be seen as unacceptable, so the same standard should apply here.\n\nNow, considering societal norms and legal standards, in many places, it's illegal to discriminate based on gender in public accommodations, including gyms. If the gym is charging the same price but restricting access based on sex, that could be legally problematic. The author is pointing out a potential issue of unequal treatment, which is reasonable.\n\nThe girlfriend's response that \"it's different for women\" could imply that she believes the women-only section is justified, perhaps as a form of affirmative action or safety. But if the policy is not applied reciprocally, it might still be discriminatory. The key here is whether the gym's policy is allowed under the law and if both genders are treated equally in terms of access relative to their fees.\n\nThe author isn't necessarily wrong for highlighting this discrepancy. They're recognizing a potential inequity in the gym's policies. The girlfriend might not see it that way because she benefits from the women-only section, which is understandable, but the author's perspective is about fairness.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the author's stance is based on principles of equality and fairness. The gym's policy, as described, seems to create an unequal experience for members based on gender, which the author is rightly pointing out. Therefore, the author isn't in the wrong; they're raising a valid concern about discriminatory practices.\n"
