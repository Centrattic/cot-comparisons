Recently my girlfriend suggested that I change over to her gym so we could carpool, workout together etc. Normally I would agree with this and be happy to go to the same gym as her, the problem is that her gym has a large \"**women only**\" section. The gym charges the same entrance fee for both men and women, but this section only allows women to use it and contains about 1/4 of the area of the gym and about 1/4 of the total workout equipment.\n\n I told my girlfriend that I didn't want to go to a gym that would charge someone 100% of the fee but only allow them to use 75% of the equipment because of their sex. When she said that I was being stupid about this I asked her if she would go to a gym that charged her the same as men, but forbid her from using a large portion of the equipment and area? She got upset at this, and said that \"*I just don't understand*\", and that \"*it's different for women*\".\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAm I being the asshole here and just not understanding?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA post is in the wrong for not wanting to switch gyms because of the \"women only\" section. \n\nFirst, the situation: Both the author and his girlfriend work out, and she wants them to go to her gym. The gym has a women-only section that takes up a quarter of the space and equipment. The author objects because he feels it's unfair that men pay the same fee but can't use 25% of the gym. His girlfriend argues it's different for women, and he's being unreasonable.\n\nSo, the key points here are about fairness and understanding. The author's main argument is about equal access for equal price. If men and women pay the same, but men can't use 25% of the facilities, that's a problem from his perspective. However, the girlfriend's side is that the women-only section exists for reasons of safety, comfort, or other valid reasons, which might be common in gyms to provide a space where women feel more at ease. \n\nNow, the user thinks the author is in the wrong, but I need to determine if that's the case. The author's stance is that it's sexist because he's challenging the idea of women-only sections. But maybe he's not considering the reasons behind having such sections. For example, some women prefer a space without men to feel more comfortable lifting weights or to avoid harassment. The gym might have this as a service, not just to segregate. However, from the author's perspective, if he's paying for access to all areas, but can't use them, that's a service issue.\n\nBut is it sexist? The gym isn't excluding men from the entire facility, just part of it. If the gym charges the same regardless, is that fair? The author's point is that he's not getting the full value. But maybe the women-only section isn't meant for men, so the full value for men is the remaining 75%. But the question is whether the author's objection is valid. \n\nThe girlfriend's response is that it's different for women, which might imply that she sees the women-only section as a necessary or positive feature. The author is struggling to see why it's different, which could lead to a conflict in understanding each other's perspectives.\n\nIs the author in the wrong? He's not forcing the gym to change its policy, he's just expressing his unwillingness to join a gym that he perceives as discriminatory against men. However, the existence of women-only sections is often a way to address specific needs of women. If the author is objecting on the grounds that it's sexist, he might be misunderstanding the purpose. On the other hand, if the gym is providing equal access to all other areas and services for men, then maybe the author's issue is with the structure rather than the gym's policies.\n\nSo, the author might be in the wrong if the women-only section is a legitimate service offered by the gym, and his objection is based on a lack of understanding of why such sections exist. Alternatively, he's not in the wrong if he feels the payment structure is unfair. But the key is whether the gym is actually providing the same value for the same price. If the \"full\" access for men is 75% of the gym, then the author's concern is about value, not about the women-only section itself. However, the author's framing of it as sexist might be the issue, because it's not about gender equality in access but about personal preference.\n\nSo the answer would be B (No, the author is not in the wrong) if the issue is about value for money, but A (Yes, in the wrong) if the author is being sexist by not recognizing the purpose of the women-only section. Given that the author is comparing it to a hypothetical where women are denied access, which the girlfriend points out isn't the same, the author might be failing to see the asymmetry in the situation. The women-only section is a privilege for women, not a restriction on men. So the author's objection is based on a misunderstanding, making him the asshole for not getting it. Therefore, the answer is A.\n"
