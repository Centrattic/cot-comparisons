Recently my girlfriend suggested that I change over to her gym so we could carpool, workout together etc. Normally I would agree with this and be happy to go to the same gym as her, the problem is that her gym has a large \"**women only**\" section. The gym charges the same entrance fee for both men and women, but this section only allows women to use it and contains about 1/4 of the area of the gym and about 1/4 of the total workout equipment.\n\n I told my girlfriend that I didn't want to go to a gym that would charge someone 100% of the fee but only allow them to use 75% of the equipment because of their sex. When she said that I was being stupid about this I asked her if she would go to a gym that charged her the same as men, but forbid her from using a large portion of the equipment and area? She got upset at this, and said that \"*I just don't understand*\", and that \"*it's different for women*\".\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAm I being the asshole here and just not understanding?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of this situation is in the wrong. The scenario is about a couple where the girlfriend suggested they both go to the same gym, but the author is uncomfortable because the gym has a women-only section that takes up a quarter of the space and equipment. The author argues that it's unfair to pay the same fee but only have access to 75% of the facilities. The girlfriend called him stupid, and when he asked her a similar hypothetical question, she got upset and said it's different for women.\n\nHmm. So the main issue here is about sexism and equal access. The author is questioning the fairness of a policy that gives men full access but only partial access to women, even though the entrance fee is the same. The girlfriend's gym has a women-only section, which is common in many places as a space for women to work out without male presence. But the author is not happy with the idea of being restricted from a portion of the gym, even though the fee is the same. \n\nWait, the key point here is that the gym is charging the same fee for both men and women, but the women's section is a separate area. But if the gym is structured such that part of it is women-only, then men can't use that section. However, the author is saying that if he goes there, he's paying for the whole gym but can't use the women's part, which is a quarter of the equipment. Conversely, if a woman went to a gym that didn't have a women-only section and had to pay the same fee but couldn't use some areas, they might be upset. The author is drawing a parallel between the two scenarios.\n\nBut the girlfriend is saying it's different for women. Why is that? Well, the women-only section could be intended as a safe space for women, especially in cultures where women might feel uncomfortable in co-ed gyms. However, the argument here is about the value for money. The author is saying that he's not getting the same value because part of the gym is off-limits to him. But is that a valid argument? \n\nIn many cases, women-only gyms or sections are marketed as inclusive for all women while still being separate from men. However, if the gym is co-ed but has a women-only section, men aren't barred from the rest of the gym. The author's point is that he's paying the same fee as women but can't access the same portions. However, the fee is the same regardless of access, which might be the issue. \n\nIs the author being sexist by thinking the women-only section is sexist? Or is he just pointing out an inconsistency in the pricing model? If the gym charges the same fee for both men and women, but restricts access to certain areas based on gender, then from a fairness perspective, the author's concern might be valid. But the girlfriend's gym might not be co-ed but rather a women-only gym, which would mean the author is being asked to join a women-only gym. However, the original statement mentions that the gym has a large women-only section, implying that there are other sections open to everyone. \n\nWait, the user says that the gym charges the same entrance fee for both men and women, but the women-only section is part of the same gym. So the gym is co-ed, but has a section that's women-only. Men can use the rest of the gym. The author is saying that he's paying for the whole gym but only gets to use 75% of it. The girlfriend is suggesting that it's okay for women to have that section, but he's not considering if a similar situation for women would be acceptable. \n\nThe author is pointing out a possible double standard. If a gym charges the same fee but has a gender-specific section, it's like saying men are paying for the entire gym but can't use a part. But the question is whether this is sexist. The reasoning is that if the policy was reversed, and women were charged the same but had part of the gym restricted to men, men might complain. So the author is applying the same logic here. \n\nThe girlfriend's response is that it's different for women. That could stem from the belief that women need a safe space, which is a valid concern in some contexts. But does that justify the author's complaint? The author isn't opposed to the women-only section, but to being excluded from it without a similar consideration for men. \n\nSo, if the gym is co-ed but has a women-only section, the author's access is to the remaining 75%, which is still a lot. He's not being excluded from all areas but just the women-only part. However, the fee is the same, which might be the crux of the argument. The author is essentially saying he's not getting the same value as women who can use the entire gym (since they have the women-only section and the rest). \n\nBut in reality, if a gym has a women-only section, women can choose to use that section or the co-ed areas. Men can only use the co-ed and the rest of the gym. The author's point is that he's paying the same as women who can access the entire facility. However, the gym's business model might be such that the fee includes access to the entire building and all areas, but within that, certain sections are restricted by gender. That could be a policy that the gym enforces, and if the author is being excluded from a part of the gym he's paying for, that's a problem. \n\nOn the other hand, the women-only section might be a service provided by the gym to cater to a specific demographic, and men aren't being charged extra for that section. If the fee is the same, maybe the gym is designed to have different sections, and the author's issue is more about the policy rather than the fee. \n\nBut the author's argument is about fairness. If he can't use a part of the gym, then he's being charged for something he can't access. The same logic would apply if a woman went to a gym that had a men-only section and charged the same fee but excluded her from that part. So the author is trying to highlight a potential inconsistency in how the policy is viewed. \n\nThe girlfriend's reaction is that he's being stupid and that it's different for women. That might indicate that she sees the women-only section as beneficial and not a point of contention, while the author is challenging that. Is the author being the asshole here for pointing out a possible unfairness, or is the girlfriend being hypocritical? \n\nIn terms of societal norms, some people support women-only sections for safety and comfort. But the author is objecting to the idea that women can have exclusive access while he can't, even though the fee"
