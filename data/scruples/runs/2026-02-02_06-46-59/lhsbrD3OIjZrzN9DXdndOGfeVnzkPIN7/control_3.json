Recently my girlfriend suggested that I change over to her gym so we could carpool, workout together etc. Normally I would agree with this and be happy to go to the same gym as her, the problem is that her gym has a large \"**women only**\" section. The gym charges the same entrance fee for both men and women, but this section only allows women to use it and contains about 1/4 of the area of the gym and about 1/4 of the total workout equipment.\n\n I told my girlfriend that I didn't want to go to a gym that would charge someone 100% of the fee but only allow them to use 75% of the equipment because of their sex. When she said that I was being stupid about this I asked her if she would go to a gym that charged her the same as men, but forbid her from using a large portion of the equipment and area? She got upset at this, and said that \"*I just don't understand*\", and that \"*it's different for women*\".\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAm I being the asshole here and just not understanding?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out whether the author is being an asshole here. Let me read through the situation again.\n\nThe author and their girlfriend both work out, but at different gyms. The girlfriend wants to switch to the same gym to carpool and work out together. The problem is that the girlfriend's gym has a \"women only\" section. The author is upset because if they pay the same fee, why can't they use all the equipment? The girlfriend is upset when the author suggests that if the situation were reversed, she'd be upset too. She says it's different for women. The author is asking if they're the asshole for not understanding this.\n\nHmm. So the main issue is the gender-specific section in the gym. The author is objecting to the fact that men can't use the women-only section, even though they pay the same. The girlfriend is defending it, saying it's different for women. \n\nI need to consider whether the author is wrong to feel that way. The author's argument is about fairness: same price, same access. But the gym offers a women-only section, which is common in some places to make women feel safer or more comfortable. So maybe there's a cultural aspect here. The author is not being allowed to use that section, which is a choice the gym makes. \n\nIs the author being sexist by not wanting to go to a gym that has a women-only section? Or is the author being reasonable in expecting equal access? The girlfriend might be arguing that women have specific needs, like a safe space, which justifies the separate section. The author is challenging that by pointing out the inequity from a male perspective. \n\nBut maybe the problem is that the author is not recognizing that the purpose of the women-only section is different. It's not about restricting women but providing an option they might prefer. The author is treating it as an unfair restriction for men when, in reality, it's a choice made to benefit women. So the author's objection is based on a misunderstanding. \n\nOn the other hand, the author isn't being asked to use the women-only section; they just can't use it. So if they don't want to pay full price for less access, that's a valid concern. But maybe the gym isn't forcing men to go into the women's section, just not allowing them there. So the author is not being discriminated against because they can still use the rest of the gym. \n\nWait, but the author's argument is that by having the women-only section, the gym is effectively reducing the usable space for men. If the author is paying the same rate as women, but 25% of the equipment is off-limits, isn't that discriminatory? But in reality, the women-only section is optional. Men aren't being excluded from the entire gym; they can use the rest. So maybe the author's reasoning is flawed here. \n\nThe girlfriend's response that \"it's different for women\" might be explaining the necessity of the section. The author is trying to apply the same logic to both genders, but the context is different. Women-only spaces are often created to address issues women face in mixed-gender environments, like harassment or feeling unsafe. So the author's analogy might not hold because the situations aren't the same. \n\nIn that case, the author is not the asshole for not wanting to go to a gym with a women-only section. They aren't being asked to use it, and their objection is about the inequality in access. However, if the author is not considering the reasons behind the women-only section, maybe they are being a bit stubborn. But ultimately, the choice of gym is personal. If the author finds the policy unfair, they have the right to decline. So the answer would be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
