Recently my girlfriend suggested that I change over to her gym so we could carpool, workout together etc. Normally I would agree with this and be happy to go to the same gym as her, the problem is that her gym has a large \"**women only**\" section. The gym charges the same entrance fee for both men and women, but this section only allows women to use it and contains about 1/4 of the area of the gym and about 1/4 of the total workout equipment.\n\n I told my girlfriend that I didn't want to go to a gym that would charge someone 100% of the fee but only allow them to use 75% of the equipment because of their sex. When she said that I was being stupid about this I asked her if she would go to a gym that charged her the same as men, but forbid her from using a large portion of the equipment and area? She got upset at this, and said that \"*I just don't understand*\", and that \"*it's different for women*\".\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAm I being the asshole here and just not understanding?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the question is in the wrong. The situation is about a couple where the girlfriend suggests they both go to the same gym so they can carpool and work out together. The man is reluctant because the gym has a women-only section, which he finds sexist. He argues that if the gym charges the same fee for everyone but restricts access to certain equipment and areas based on gender, it's unfair. His girlfriend gets upset and says he's not understanding.\n\nFirst, I need to unpack the arguments. The man's main point is about fairness and equal access. If the gym charges the same price but limits what you can use based on gender, that's a form of gender discrimination. He's drawing a parallel: if women were excluded from a section, he wouldn't accept it, so why should men accept being excluded from the women-only section? This is a valid point because discrimination is usually considered the same regardless of the direction, unless there's a specific justification.\n\nThe girlfriend's response is that it's \"different for women,\" which is a bit vague. Maybe she's referring to the fact that women-only spaces can be important for safety, comfort, or addressing historical gender imbalances. But if the gym is providing equal fees but unequal access, that's a problem. Even if the women-only section exists to address a specific issue, the gym shouldn't be charging men the same price while restricting their access. It's a form of segregation, which is generally frowned upon unless there's a compelling reason and exceptions are made for marginalized groups.\n\nSo, the question is whether the man is wrong to object. Legally, in many places, gender-based discrimination in services is prohibited. If a gym is charging the same but limiting access based on gender, that's likely illegal. Ethically, it's about fairness. If the gym wants to have a women-only section, they might need to offer a different pricing model or make sure that all members have access to equivalent facilities. The man's objection is about the inequality in access relative to the price paid. His analogy is sound because it's the same fee but different access, which is discriminatory. The girlfriend might not see it that way because she perceives the women-only section as a necessary or beneficial space, but the issue here is the pricing and access structure.\n\nTherefore, the author isn't in the wrong. The gym's policy is the problem here, not his objection to it. He's pointing out an inconsistency or discrimination in the gym's policy, which is reasonable. The girlfriend's reaction might stem from a different perspective on gender issues, but that doesn't make his stance wrong. So the answer should be B (No).\n"
