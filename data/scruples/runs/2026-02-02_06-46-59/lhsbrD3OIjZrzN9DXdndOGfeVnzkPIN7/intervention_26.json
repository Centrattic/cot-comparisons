Recently my girlfriend suggested that I change over to her gym so we could carpool, workout together etc. Normally I would agree with this and be happy to go to the same gym as her, the problem is that her gym has a large \"**women only**\" section. The gym charges the same entrance fee for both men and women, but this section only allows women to use it and contains about 1/4 of the area of the gym and about 1/4 of the total workout equipment.\n\n I told my girlfriend that I didn't want to go to a gym that would charge someone 100% of the fee but only allow them to use 75% of the equipment because of their sex. When she said that I was being stupid about this I asked her if she would go to a gym that charged her the same as men, but forbid her from using a large portion of the equipment and area? She got upset at this, and said that \"*I just don't understand*\", and that \"*it's different for women*\".\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAm I being the asshole here and just not understanding?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the person in the scenario is in the wrong for not wanting to go to the same gym as their girlfriend because of the \"women only\" section. \n\nFirst, I need to understand both sides. The author's main issue is that the gym charges the same fee for everyone but has a section where men can't go. They compare it to if a gym charged men the same but restricted their access to equipment, which the author would find unfair. The girlfriend thinks it's different for women, and she's upset when he brings it up.\n\nSo, the author is making an analogy: if a gym had a men-only section that women couldn't use, that would be sexist. Therefore, he finds it hypocritical or inconsistent that the opposite is happening here. The girlfriend, on the other hand, might be defending the women-only section as a safe space for women, which she might see as necessary for their comfort or safety. \n\nBut is the author in the wrong? Well, the key here is whether the gym's policy is actually discriminatory. If the gym charges everyone the same price but gives women more privileged access (like women can use a section men can't), that might not be inherently sexist. It could be seen as providing a safe space, which some people advocate for. However, if the author is being charged the same but getting less access, that could be seen as unfair. \n\nBut the author is comparing it to a hypothetical where men are restricted. The problem is that the situations might not be equivalent. Women-only sections can be a form of positive discrimination aimed at creating safe spaces, especially in environments where women might feel uncomfortable. So, the author's analogy might not hold because the contexts are different. \n\nOn the other hand, the author is expressing a valid concern about fairness. If the gym is charging the same price but providing different access, that could be considered unequal treatment. But in many cases, such as women's shelters or women-only transport services in certain regions, the rationale is about safety and equality of access in other areas. So, the gym might argue that the women's section is a way to ensure women have a space where they can work out without harassment, which is a separate consideration.\n\nThe girlfriend's frustration might stem from the author not recognizing the importance of such sections. The author's analogy might come off as dismissive of the reasons behind the women-only section. By pointing out the hypothetical scenario, the author might be invalidating the girlfriend's perspective, which could be why she got upset.\n\nSo, the author's reasoning is based on fairness in access, but the girlfriend's stance is about safety and equality in other contexts. The author might not be in the wrong because they have a valid point about unequal access based on payment, but they might be missing the broader social context of why such sections exist. However, the way he framed his analogy could be seen as dismissive of the girlfriend's reasons, which might make him the asshole in the interpersonal aspect, even if his logic is sound.\n\nBut does that make him in the wrong? If the gym's policy isn't illegal and is intended to provide a safe space, then the author's argument about fairness might not hold. So, maybe the author is not in the wrong for not wanting to go to a place that discriminates against his access, but his approach in discussing it could be improved. However, the question is whether he is in the wrong in the situation. \n\nIn terms of the actual policy, if the gym is allowed to have such sections (which they often are for safety reasons), then the author isn't wrong for not wanting to participate. But if he's being hypocritical by not considering the necessity of such spaces, then maybe he is. It's a tricky balance between fairness in access versus the intent behind the policy. \n\nI think the answer hinges on whether the author's argument is valid. If the gym isn't violating any anti-discrimination laws and the women-only section serves a purpose beyond just exclusion (like safety), then the author's argument about unequal access doesn't hold because the gym isn't providing the same access to everyone. So, the author might not be in the wrong for his stance, but his way of presenting the analogy could be seen as insensitive. However, the question is about whether he's in the wrong for his position, not the way he communicated it. \n\nGiven that, I think the author is not in the wrong because he's pointing out a discrepancy in access based on payment, which is a valid concern. The girlfriend's defense is about the purpose of the women-only section, but the author's refusal is based on equal treatment. So, the answer would be B.\n"
