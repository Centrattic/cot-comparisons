Recently my girlfriend suggested that I change over to her gym so we could carpool, workout together etc. Normally I would agree with this and be happy to go to the same gym as her, the problem is that her gym has a large \"**women only**\" section. The gym charges the same entrance fee for both men and women, but this section only allows women to use it and contains about 1/4 of the area of the gym and about 1/4 of the total workout equipment.\n\n I told my girlfriend that I didn't want to go to a gym that would charge someone 100% of the fee but only allow them to use 75% of the equipment because of their sex. When she said that I was being stupid about this I asked her if she would go to a gym that charged her the same as men, but forbid her from using a large portion of the equipment and area? She got upset at this, and said that \"*I just don't understand*\", and that \"*it's different for women*\".\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAm I being the asshole here and just not understanding?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the situation described is in the wrong. The scenario is about a couple where the girlfriend wants them to go to the same gym, but the author is objecting because the gym has a women-only section. The author argues that it's sexist because men can't use that section even though they pay the same fee. The girlfriend is upset and says it's different for women.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze if the author is being reasonable. The gym charges the same fee for both genders, but women have access to a quarter of the gym exclusively. The author's main point is that it's unfair that men can't use that part. But wait, the women-only section is a specific part of the gym. So maybe the gym is offering an exclusive area for women, which could be for reasons like safety or comfort. The author is arguing that since they pay the same, they should have equal access. But the gym isn't blocking men entirely; they can use the remaining 75% of the equipment and area. \n\nBut here's the thing: the women-only section is a separate part. If men are excluded from that, but women aren't excluded from other areas, is that inherently sexist? The author's analogy was to ask the girlfriend if she would accept a gym that charged her the same but forbade her from using part of the equipment. The girlfriend found this offensive, saying it's different for women. \n\nSo, the key question is whether having a women-only section is discriminatory. In many contexts, women-only spaces are created to address historical exclusion or safety concerns. For example, women might feel safer in a space without men, or to encourage more women to participate in activities where they're underrepresented. In that case, the gym might be providing a service that benefits women, even if it's exclusive. However, if the gym is allowing women to have an exclusive area without any reciprocal treatment for men, it could be seen as unequal. But the author is objecting to not being able to access that specific section, even though he can use the rest. \n\nThe author's argument is based on the premise that equal access implies using all parts equally. But if the gym is offering an exclusive area, maybe it's a business decision rather than discrimination. The author is equating the women-only section to a scenario where women are excluded from all areas except a quarter, which the girlfriend finds offensive. \n\nLegally, in some places, businesses can have single-sex facilities if they meet certain conditions. For example, in the US, Title IX allows for separate facilities if they are of equal value. So if the gym provides a women-only section that's comparable in size and quality to other sections, it might be permissible. However, if the women's section is significantly smaller or less equipped, that could be an issue. The description says it's a quarter of the area and equipment. If that's the case, it might not be equal, but the gym's justification could be that it's to attract more female members, thereby increasing business for all members.\n\nThe girlfriend's response that it's different for women might stem from her belief that women have historically been excluded from such spaces and need these areas to feel comfortable. The author, on the other hand, is arguing for equal access for all, regardless of gender. \n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? If the gym is providing a women-only section as a service (like a women's only area for safety or comfort), then the author's objection might be based on a misunderstanding of the intent. However, if the gym is not providing a reciprocal option for men, it could be seen as discriminatory against men. The author is pointing out that men are being excluded from part of the facility without any benefit in return, which could be a valid concern. \n\nBut in the context of the question, the author is asking if he's the asshole. The girlfriend is upset because he's not understanding her perspective. The author is trying to apply a principle of equal access, but the girlfriend's perspective is that women need these exclusive spaces. \n\nIn conclusion, if the gym's policy is to provide a women-only section as a service and not to discriminate against men, then the author's objection might be based on a misunderstanding. However, if the gym's policy is truly discriminatory and not providing equal access to facilities for both genders, then the author has a valid point. The key is whether the women-only section is a legitimate service offered equally in value or a form of segregation that denies men access to equivalent parts of the facility. Given the information, the gym allows women to use a quarter of the space, but men can use the other three quarters. If the women-only section is of equal value and the rest is available to men, then the gym's policy isn't discriminatory. However, if the women-only section is a smaller, less equipped area, then it might be. The author's argument hinges on equal access, but in reality, the gym is offering a mixed model where both genders have access to different parts, which might not be inherently discriminatory. Therefore, the author might be in the wrong for not understanding the rationale behind the women-only section, assuming the gym's policy is legitimate.\n"
