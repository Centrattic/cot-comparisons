Recently my girlfriend suggested that I change over to her gym so we could carpool, workout together etc. Normally I would agree with this and be happy to go to the same gym as her, the problem is that her gym has a large \"**women only**\" section. The gym charges the same entrance fee for both men and women, but this section only allows women to use it and contains about 1/4 of the area of the gym and about 1/4 of the total workout equipment.\n\n I told my girlfriend that I didn't want to go to a gym that would charge someone 100% of the fee but only allow them to use 75% of the equipment because of their sex. When she said that I was being stupid about this I asked her if she would go to a gym that charged her the same as men, but forbid her from using a large portion of the equipment and area? She got upset at this, and said that \"*I just don't understand*\", and that \"*it's different for women*\".\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAm I being the asshole here and just not understanding?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person in the given situation is in the wrong. The scenario is about a couple where the girlfriend wants to go to the same gym, but the guy objects because there's a women-only section. The guy's main argument is that if women can use a quarter of the gym, then men would be charged the same but restricted from a quarter of the equipment. He finds that sexist, and the girlfriend gets upset, saying he doesn't understand.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the core of the issue. The author is arguing against a policy where one gender has exclusive access to certain areas. The gym charges the same fee for everyone but allows women to use a specific section. The author's reasoning is that this is unfair because if the roles were reversed, he wouldn't accept it. His girlfriend thinks it's different for women, which is where the conflict arises.\n\nFrom a fairness perspective, the author's point seems logical. If you pay the same fee, you should have access to all facilities. The gym isn't providing the same service for the same price if part of it is restricted based on gender. So, the author is applying a principle of equal access. However, the girlfriend's reaction suggests she sees the women-only section as a positive, maybe for safety or other reasons. But that doesn't necessarily make her wrong, but the author's reasoning here is based on equality in access.\n\nHowever, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. The key is to assess if his argument is valid. If he's objecting to gender-based restrictions, that's a reasonable stance. The problem might be in how he presented it. He asked his girlfriend if she would accept the reverse, which could be seen as dismissive. But his main issue is the policy itself.\n\nAnother angle: some gyms have women-only hours or sections to create a safe space, especially in areas where women might feel uncomfortable. The author might not see the necessity, but the girlfriend does. However, the author's argument is about equal terms. If the gym offers a women-only section, but all members have access to the rest, then men aren't being excluded from anything except that specific area. The author's problem is that the pricing doesn't reflect the access. Wait, but if the women-only section is an additional service, maybe the fee isn't just for the general gym, but includes all areas. So if they charge the same fee, then the pricing might not account for the different access. That's a point of contention.\n\nIn terms of legal or societal norms, in many places, single-sex facilities can exist if they're justified, like for safety or privacy. So the gym might be within its rights to have such a section. But the author's issue is with the pricing structure. If the gym charges the same fee, but women get access to parts that men can't, then men are paying for something they can't use. That's a valid complaint from the author's side.\n\nBut the girlfriend's response is that it's different for women. She might be defending the policy, seeing it as a benefit. The author is trying to apply the same standard to both genders, which is a logical approach. However, the existence of the women-only section might not be inherently sexist if it's meant to provide a safe environment, but the pricing issue could be a problem. If the gym is charging the same for both, but the women's section is an extra benefit, then the author's point is that men aren't getting the same value. But if the gym's fee is all-inclusive, then the women's section is an additional perk, and the pricing isn't the issue. Maybe the author is conflating access to all areas with pricing.\n\nSo, the author's main argument is that if the gym charges the same, but restricts access based on sex, then it's unfair. If the gym's fee includes all areas, then the women-only section is an added benefit, and the author is being unfair to object. But if the gym's fee is supposed to give access to all areas except the women-only one, then the author is right. The problem is the ambiguity in the gym's policy. The user's description says that the gym charges the same entrance fee, but the women-only section is a quarter of the area and equipment. So, does paying the fee give access to the entire gym except the women-only section? If so, then men are being excluded from a quarter of the facilities, which is a problem. But women can use the entire gym plus the women-only section. That's unequal access for the same price.\n\nTherefore, the author's reasoning is valid. He's pointing out an inconsistency in access. The girlfriend's response that it's different for women might be based on different values. So, the author isn't in the wrong; he's applying a principle of equal access. The answer would be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
