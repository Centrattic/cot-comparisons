Recently my girlfriend suggested that I change over to her gym so we could carpool, workout together etc. Normally I would agree with this and be happy to go to the same gym as her, the problem is that her gym has a large \"**women only**\" section. The gym charges the same entrance fee for both men and women, but this section only allows women to use it and contains about 1/4 of the area of the gym and about 1/4 of the total workout equipment.\n\n I told my girlfriend that I didn't want to go to a gym that would charge someone 100% of the fee but only allow them to use 75% of the equipment because of their sex. When she said that I was being stupid about this I asked her if she would go to a gym that charged her the same as men, but forbid her from using a large portion of the equipment and area? She got upset at this, and said that \"*I just don't understand*\", and that \"*it's different for women*\".\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAm I being the asshole here and just not understanding?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. Let's start by breaking down the situation. The author and his girlfriend both work out and have been at different gyms. She wants him to switch to her gym for carpooling and working out together. The problem is her gym has a women-only section that takes up a quarter of the space and equipment. The author objects because if he goes there, he would pay the same fee but only have access to 75% of the equipment. He compares it to her hypothetical scenario, which makes her upset.\n\nFirst, I should consider the key points. The author is concerned about unequal access based on gender. The gym charges the same fee for both men and women but restricts men from the women-only section. The author's argument is that by paying the same, he should have access to all areas. His girlfriend, on the other hand, seems to accept the women-only space as a different situation for women, perhaps due to reasons like safety or comfort.\n\nNow, gender-based restrictions can be tricky. In many contexts, separating facilities by gender is allowed, especially in spaces where privacy or safety is a concern. For example, locker rooms often have male and female sections. However, in this case, the author is being excluded from part of the gym's facilities because of his gender. The author's argument is about fairness in what he gets for the fee. If the gym charges the same price but restricts access, is that discriminatory?\n\nThe author's comparison to his girlfriend's perspective is important. He's asking if she would be okay with a gym that excluded her from a portion of the equipment. She gets upset, saying it's different for women. This might highlight a double standard. If the gym allows women to use the entire facility (including the women-only section) while restricting men from part of it, then men are effectively not getting the same value for their money. The author is pointing out that if the women-only section is for women's use, then men's access to the rest of the gym should be unrestricted. If the gym is charging the same fee, then men should have access to all areas except the women-only section, but in this case, the women-only section is a significant portion (25%).\n\nAnother angle is that the women-only section might serve a purpose, like creating a safe space for women to work out without men, which could be important for some. However, the author is not against the women-only section itself but against being restricted from using that portion. The gym's policy is that only women can use that section, so the author isn't being excluded from the rest of the gym. Wait, the problem is that the author would have access to the remaining 75% of the gym. If the gym charges the same fee regardless, but the women-only section is separate, then the author is paying for access to the entire gym except the women-only part. That seems fair, unless the gym is charging the same fee but the women-only section is part of the total space. Wait, the user says the women-only section has 1/4 of the area and equipment. So if a man goes there, he can't use that 25%, but can use the rest. The author's point is that he's paying the same as women who can use the full gym (including the women-only part). So the author is being charged the same but has less access. That's the crux of the issue.\n\nBut wait, maybe the fee is for access to the entire gym except the women-only section. If the gym charges the same fee for everyone, but the women can use the entire gym (including the women-only section) while men can't, then the woman is getting more value for her money. The author is arguing that it's unfair because he's paying the same but can't use the entire facility. However, the gym might have a policy that the women-only section is for women only, which is a common practice in some gyms to create safe spaces. So the author's objection is about fairness in access based on payment. The girlfriend's response is that it's different for women, implying that the women-only section serves a purpose for her and she doesn't see the issue with the fee structure.\n\nIn terms of legal or policy standards, in many places, single-sex spaces are allowed for reasons like privacy and safety. So the gym's policy might be within legal bounds. However, the author is making a point about equitable access. If the gym charges the same fee but restricts access based on gender, is that discriminatory? It could depend on the context. The author is not being denied access to the gym entirely but is restricted from a specific section. If the gym's policy is that women can use the entire gym (including the women-only section), while men can't, then the author is paying for a service that excludes him from part of the premises, which the author finds unfair.\n\nThe author's argument is that it's sexist to charge men the same fee but restrict their access. However, the girlfriend's perspective is that the women-only section serves a different purpose for women, and the author isn't being excluded from the rest. The author might be conflating the issue of access with the fee. If the gym charges the same fee for all, but women have access to more space (because they can use the women-only section), then the author is being charged the same for less access. That could be seen as discriminatory from the author's viewpoint. But from the gym's perspective, the women-only section is a service that only women can use, so men aren't being charged extra for not using it. The author is paying the same fee, but the value he receives is less because he can't use the women-only section. The girlfriend might see it as a necessary service for women, and the fee covers access to the main gym, with the women-only section being an additional benefit for women.\n\nIn terms of societal norms, there's a push towards equality in access. However, there are also valid reasons for maintaining single-sex spaces, especially where privacy and safety are concerned. The author is making a point about equity in payment for access. If the gym is charging the same fee but providing different levels of access based on gender, it could be seen as unfair. However, if the women-only section is explicitly for women and the fee is for the main gym, then it's possible that the author is misaligned in his understanding of what the fee covers.\n\nAnother consideration is the intent. The author isn't against the women-only section per se but against being restricted from it. The girlfriend might not see the issue because she benefits from the section and doesn't perceive the fee as being tied to it. The author's comparison to her hypothetical scenario is a way to highlight the inconsistency, but it might come across as dismissive of the reasons the women-only section exists.\n\nIn conclusion, whether the author is in the wrong depends on whether the gym's fee structure is fair. If the fee is the same for everyone, but the women-only section is part of the total access, then the author's objection is valid. However, if the fee is for the main gym and the women-only section is a separate service, then the author's point might not hold. The key is whether the gym's policy is discriminatory or if it's a legitimate provision of different services based on gender. Given that the author is being charged the same but has less access, and the scenario presents an unequal value for money, the author's position might be justified. However, if the women-only section is a necessary and acceptable practice, then the author might not be in the wrong for objecting to unequal access.\n"
