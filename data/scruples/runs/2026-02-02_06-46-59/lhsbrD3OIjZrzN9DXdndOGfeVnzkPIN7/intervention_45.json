Recently my girlfriend suggested that I change over to her gym so we could carpool, workout together etc. Normally I would agree with this and be happy to go to the same gym as her, the problem is that her gym has a large \"**women only**\" section. The gym charges the same entrance fee for both men and women, but this section only allows women to use it and contains about 1/4 of the area of the gym and about 1/4 of the total workout equipment.\n\n I told my girlfriend that I didn't want to go to a gym that would charge someone 100% of the fee but only allow them to use 75% of the equipment because of their sex. When she said that I was being stupid about this I asked her if she would go to a gym that charged her the same as men, but forbid her from using a large portion of the equipment and area? She got upset at this, and said that \"*I just don't understand*\", and that \"*it's different for women*\".\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAm I being the asshole here and just not understanding?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so the user is asking whether the author of the situation described is in the wrong. Let me try to break this down.\n\nThe author's girlfriend suggested they both go to the same gym for convenience. The gym in question has a \"women only\" section, which is a quarter of the gym and equipment. The author objects because he feels it's sexist to pay the same fee but have access to less equipment if he were a woman. His girlfriend gets upset, saying it's different for women.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the concept of gender-segregated spaces. Some places have these sections for reasons like safety, comfort, or addressing historical disparities in access. The gym here charges the same fee regardless, so men and women have equal financial access. The women-only section might be intended to encourage women to use the gym by providing a space where they feel more comfortable, which can be a valid social consideration.\n\nThe author's argument is that it's unfair for women to have more access. But he's not a woman, so the policy doesn't affect him directly. His analogy about women being charged the same but restricted is a hypothetical, but he's not experiencing that himself. It's possible he's trying to apply the same logic to both genders, but the context might be different. For example, women historically have had less access to such facilities, so creating spaces for them can be part of addressing that imbalance.\n\nOn the other hand, the gym is allowing both genders to use the majority of the facility. The author isn't being excluded from anything except the women-only section, which he can't use regardless. He's not being charged extra; the fee is the same. So his complaint is about the fairness of the allocation, but since he's not the one denied access, maybe his perspective is missing the point. The girlfriend's frustration might stem from him not understanding the intention behind the women-only section, which is to support women's use in a space where they might feel more welcome.\n\nThe question is whether the author is wrong. If the gym's policy is intended to address systemic issues and the author is objecting without recognizing that context, then he might be missing the bigger picture. However, if the policy is seen as discriminatory against men by creating unequal access, then he could have a point. But in practice, since he's not being excluded from the main gym areas, his access isn't restricted, so his argument might be based on a misunderstanding of the policy's purpose. The girlfriend's response that it's \"different for women\" might be highlighting that the policy is about creating inclusive spaces for women, not about excluding men, which the author may not grasp fully.\n\nSo, considering all this, the author's stance could be seen as not understanding the rationale behind the women-only section. Therefore, he might be in the wrong for not recognizing the intent and context of the policy, even if he's not directly affected.\n"
