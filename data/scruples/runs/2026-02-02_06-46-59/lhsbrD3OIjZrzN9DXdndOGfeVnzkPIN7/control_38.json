Recently my girlfriend suggested that I change over to her gym so we could carpool, workout together etc. Normally I would agree with this and be happy to go to the same gym as her, the problem is that her gym has a large \"**women only**\" section. The gym charges the same entrance fee for both men and women, but this section only allows women to use it and contains about 1/4 of the area of the gym and about 1/4 of the total workout equipment.\n\n I told my girlfriend that I didn't want to go to a gym that would charge someone 100% of the fee but only allow them to use 75% of the equipment because of their sex. When she said that I was being stupid about this I asked her if she would go to a gym that charged her the same as men, but forbid her from using a large portion of the equipment and area? She got upset at this, and said that \"*I just don't understand*\", and that \"*it's different for women*\".\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAm I being the asshole here and just not understanding?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of the situation is in the wrong by refusing to switch to his girlfriend's gym because of the women-only section. The key point here is the author's objection to the gym's policy of having a women-only section that effectively limits men's access to part of the facility, even though both pay the same fee.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal and ethical aspects. In many places, gender-segregated facilities can be legal if they're for privacy reasons, like locker rooms. However, a gym that charges equal fees but restricts access based on gender might be problematic. The author's argument is that it's sexist because men can't use the same portion of the gym as women, similar to how a women-only section in a restaurant wouldn't be acceptable unless there was a valid reason like privacy.\n\nThe girlfriend argues that it's different for women, possibly implying that women need safe spaces or that such sections are common and accepted. But the author's stance is about fairness and equal access. If the gym doesn't offer men the same option to have a section they can use exclusively, then it's discriminatory. The author is pointing out inconsistency in the pricing and access policies.\n\nThe girlfriend being upset and calling him stupid might be because she sees the women-only section as a positive feature, maybe for safety or comfort, which she might not see as discriminatory since it's aimed at women. However, the author's argument is about equal treatment. If the gym is charging the same fee but not providing equal access, then the author's objection is valid.\n\nAlso, the comparison the author makes\u2014asking if she'd accept a gym that barred men\u2014is a logical counterpoint. It highlights the inconsistency in the policy from a fairness perspective. The girlfriend's response that \"it's different for women\" could be a form of justifying gender-based discrimination, which the author is rightly challenging.\n\nSo, considering these points, the author isn't in the wrong. The gym's policy is the issue here, not his stance against it. Therefore, the answer should be B.\n"
