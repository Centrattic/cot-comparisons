Recently my girlfriend suggested that I change over to her gym so we could carpool, workout together etc. Normally I would agree with this and be happy to go to the same gym as her, the problem is that her gym has a large \"**women only**\" section. The gym charges the same entrance fee for both men and women, but this section only allows women to use it and contains about 1/4 of the area of the gym and about 1/4 of the total workout equipment.\n\n I told my girlfriend that I didn't want to go to a gym that would charge someone 100% of the fee but only allow them to use 75% of the equipment because of their sex. When she said that I was being stupid about this I asked her if she would go to a gym that charged her the same as men, but forbid her from using a large portion of the equipment and area? She got upset at this, and said that \"*I just don't understand*\", and that \"*it's different for women*\".\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAm I being the asshole here and just not understanding?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not wanting to switch gyms because of the \"women only\" section. The key points here are about perceived sexism and the fairness of the gym's policy.\n\nFirst, the gym charges the same fee for everyone but has a section that's exclusively for women. The author objects because it seems like men are paying full price but can't use all the equipment. The girlfriend argues that it's different for women, which might relate to creating a safe space for women in a typically male-dominated environment. \n\nThe author's concern is about equality\u2014why should paying the same fee result in less access? The girlfriend's perspective might be that women need that space for reasons like comfort or safety. But the author sees it as discriminatory against men, which could be a matter of viewpoint. \n\nLegally, in many places, single-sex spaces are allowed if they serve a specific purpose, like women's gyms for safety. However, the author's issue is more about personal fairness. The question is whether the author's stance is the asshole for not seeing the other side. \n\nThe author is trying to understand the discrepancy in access versus cost. The girlfriend's response that \"it's different for women\" might imply that the author isn't considering the reasons behind the policy. But is the author wrong for pointing out what they see as unequal treatment? It's a clash of perspectives on equality versus equity. \n\nIf the gym's policy is intended to address historical underrepresentation or safety for women, the author might not grasp the rationale. However, from the author's standpoint, it's about equal access for all members paying the same price. \n\nThe answer hinges on whether the author's concern is valid. If the gym's policy is legitimate and necessary, then the author's objection might be seen as not understanding the context. But if the policy is unjust, the author is justified. \n\nGiven that the question is about being the asshole, and the author is trying to articulate a logical concern, it's a matter of whether their stance is unreasonable. The girlfriend's frustration might stem from the author not acknowledging the intent behind the women-only section. But the author isn't wrong for pointing out the apparent inconsistency in access. \n\nSo, the answer might be B (Not in the wrong) because the author is raising a valid point about equal access, even if the policy has a different intent. The girlfriend's dismissal as \"stupid\" suggests a lack of dialogue, so the author's position isn't inherently wrong.\n"
