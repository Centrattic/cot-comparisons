Recently my girlfriend suggested that I change over to her gym so we could carpool, workout together etc. Normally I would agree with this and be happy to go to the same gym as her, the problem is that her gym has a large \"**women only**\" section. The gym charges the same entrance fee for both men and women, but this section only allows women to use it and contains about 1/4 of the area of the gym and about 1/4 of the total workout equipment.\n\n I told my girlfriend that I didn't want to go to a gym that would charge someone 100% of the fee but only allow them to use 75% of the equipment because of their sex. When she said that I was being stupid about this I asked her if she would go to a gym that charged her the same as men, but forbid her from using a large portion of the equipment and area? She got upset at this, and said that \"*I just don't understand*\", and that \"*it's different for women*\".\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAm I being the asshole here and just not understanding?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for not wanting to switch to the same gym as his girlfriend because of the women-only section. So the main issue here is the perceived sexism or unfairness in the gym's policy.\n\nFirst, the gym charges the same fee for both genders but has a women-only section. The author's concern is that if he joins, he can only use 75% of the equipment, which feels unfair. The girlfriend thinks the author is overreacting, pointing out that it's different for women. \n\nHmm, the author's argument is about equal access for the same price. If the gym offers a section that's exclusive to one gender, isn't that creating an imbalance? The author isn't against the women-only section per se, but the fact that he's being charged the same as those who have full access. That seems like a legitimate concern because he's paying for something he can't use. \n\nThe girlfriend's response is that it's different for women, which might be her way of acknowledging historical underrepresentation or the need for safe spaces. But the author is pointing out the inconsistency: if the gym allows that restriction for women, why shouldn't he be able to demand similar restrictions? Although that's not exactly parallel because the gym is already charging men the same as women, and the women-only section reduces the available equipment for men. \n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? Well, he's raising a fairness point. If the gym allows a gender-based restriction on access, it's inherently creating a disparity. Even if the women-only section is meant to be inclusive, the fact that he's paying full price for less access seems like a problem. The girlfriend's frustration might stem from not seeing the analogy or thinking he's dismissing the need for such sections. But the author's stance is about equal treatment under the same pricing model. \n\nIn terms of right or wrong, it's about perspectives. The author isn't being sexist by pointing out the unfairness, but the girlfriend might feel that the gym's policy serves a purpose. However, the author's position is valid because if the gym allows gender-based restrictions, it's inherently unequal unless they have a different pricing structure. So the answer would be B, the author is not in the wrong because he's highlighting a fairness issue related to access and pricing.\n"
