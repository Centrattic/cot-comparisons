Recently my girlfriend suggested that I change over to her gym so we could carpool, workout together etc. Normally I would agree with this and be happy to go to the same gym as her, the problem is that her gym has a large \"**women only**\" section. The gym charges the same entrance fee for both men and women, but this section only allows women to use it and contains about 1/4 of the area of the gym and about 1/4 of the total workout equipment.\n\n I told my girlfriend that I didn't want to go to a gym that would charge someone 100% of the fee but only allow them to use 75% of the equipment because of their sex. When she said that I was being stupid about this I asked her if she would go to a gym that charged her the same as men, but forbid her from using a large portion of the equipment and area? She got upset at this, and said that \"*I just don't understand*\", and that \"*it's different for women*\".\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAm I being the asshole here and just not understanding?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong. The situation is about the author not wanting to switch to their girlfriend's gym because it has a \"women only\" section. The author argues that it's sexist since men pay the same fee but can't use that portion, while the girlfriend thinks it's different for women.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the core issue here. The author is objecting to the gym's policy of a women-only section. They compare it to a hypothetical where women would be denied access to part of the gym, which they would find unacceptable. The girlfriend is upset, saying it's different for women. \n\nNow, the question is whether the author is wrong. Let's break it down. The author's main point is about fairness and equality. If the gym charges all members the same but restricts access based on gender, that could be seen as discriminatory. But the existence of a women-only section might be intended to create a safe space for women, which is a different justification. \n\nHowever, if the gym is charging men the same fee but not allowing them to use the entire facility, that's a form of gender-based discrimination. The gym is essentially saying that men can't access a portion of the services they're paying for. The author's argument is that this is unequal treatment. \n\nOn the other hand, the girlfriend's perspective is that women need that space for various reasons, like safety or comfort. But the argument here is that the gym is not providing equal access to all members for the same price. \n\nSo, is the author wrong? If the gym is indeed restricting access based on gender without a valid, non-discriminatory reason, then the author's stance is valid. However, if the women-only section is a service that the gym offers to women (like a women's fitness class or a specific area for women to work out safely), then it's a different matter. But the key point is that the author is being charged the same fee but can't use the same amount of equipment. \n\nIn terms of legal standards, in many places, gender-based discrimination in public accommodations is illegal. However, some exceptions might exist, like single-sex facilities for privacy reasons. But if the gym is charging men the same and not allowing them to use a portion, that's questionable. \n\nThe author is pointing out a potential inconsistency. If the gym had a men-only section and charged women the same, that would likely be seen as sexist. So the author's comparison might be valid. \n\nBut the girlfriend's reaction suggests she sees the women-only section as a positive thing for women's empowerment or safety. The author is challenging that by pointing out the gender-based restriction, which could be seen as a valid critique of the policy, even if it's uncomfortable. \n\nHowever, the author might be missing the nuance that the women-only section is meant to address specific needs. But if the gym is not allowing men to use that section, it's a form of segregation. The author's argument is about equal access for equal price, which is a fair point. \n\nIn conclusion, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong. They're highlighting a potential issue with the gym's policy. However, the girlfriend might see the women-only section as beneficial, which is why she's upset. The question is whether the author's stance is valid. Since the gym is charging the same fee but restricting access based on gender, the author's objection is reasonable. So the answer would be B (the author is not in the wrong).\n"
