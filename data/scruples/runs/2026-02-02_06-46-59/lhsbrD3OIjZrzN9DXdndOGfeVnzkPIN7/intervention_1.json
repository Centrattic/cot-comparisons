Recently my girlfriend suggested that I change over to her gym so we could carpool, workout together etc. Normally I would agree with this and be happy to go to the same gym as her, the problem is that her gym has a large \"**women only**\" section. The gym charges the same entrance fee for both men and women, but this section only allows women to use it and contains about 1/4 of the area of the gym and about 1/4 of the total workout equipment.\n\n I told my girlfriend that I didn't want to go to a gym that would charge someone 100% of the fee but only allow them to use 75% of the equipment because of their sex. When she said that I was being stupid about this I asked her if she would go to a gym that charged her the same as men, but forbid her from using a large portion of the equipment and area? She got upset at this, and said that \"*I just don't understand*\", and that \"*it's different for women*\".\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAm I being the asshole here and just not understanding?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the author of the Reddit-style post is in the wrong for not wanting to go to the same gym as his girlfriend because he finds the \"women only\" section sexist. \n\nFirst, I need to understand both sides. The author's main point is that the gym charges everyone the same fee, but the women's section restricts men from using 25% of the equipment and area. He argues that it's unfair because you pay the same but don't get access to all the facilities. His girlfriend thinks it's different for women and he's being stupid. \n\nSo, the key issue here is whether the women-only section is inherently sexist or not. The author is arguing from an equality standpoint: if the gym allows women-only areas, it's discriminatory if men can't access those spaces. But the girlfriend is countering that it's different for women, which might imply that women sometimes need such spaces for their own comfort and safety. \n\nI need to consider the context of women-only spaces in gyms. In many cases, these areas are created to provide a safe or judgment-free environment for women, which can be important for encouraging female participation in fitness. However, if the gym is charging the same fee for both genders but only allows women access to certain areas, that could be seen as a form of discrimination against men, as they aren't getting equal service for the same price. \n\nBut there's a nuance here. The gym might be offering an additional service (the women's section) that's available to members of a specific gender. If the gym is providing exclusive access to certain amenities to one gender, could that be considered discriminatory to the other? On the other hand, if the gym is offering a women's section as a special feature, perhaps it's intended to be a benefit for female members, which might not be the same as excluding others. \n\nThe author is drawing a parallel by asking his girlfriend if she'd accept a gym that prevented her from using a portion of the equipment. That's a valid comparison. If the reverse were true and the gym had a men-only section that women couldn't use, the girlfriend would likely find that problematic. So, from that perspective, the author's stance is about consistency and fairness. \n\nHowever, the girlfriend's response that \"it's different for women\" might be based on the idea that such spaces are necessary to address historical imbalances or provide safe spaces. But if the gym is charging the same fee regardless of access, that could be problematic. If the gym were charging men more because they have to share all the equipment, that would be different, but in this case, the fee is the same. \n\nAnother angle is the concept of \"reverse discrimination.\" The author might be feeling that by having a women-only section, the gym is being unfair to men because they don't get the same access. But is that a valid argument? Discrimination is often discussed in terms of the historically disadvantaged group, so the idea that women-only spaces are a form of affirmative action might be the girlfriend's reasoning. \n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? If the gym is providing a service that's available to women and not to men, but charging the same rate, that could be seen as discriminatory. However, the existence of women-only spaces is often justified as a way to promote inclusivity and safety for women. The author's argument is about equal access for equal price, which is a fair point, but the girlfriend might see the women's section as a necessary accommodation rather than a restriction. \n\nI think the key here is whether the gym's policy is discriminatory. If the gym is offering a women-only section as an added benefit for women, but charging the same as for men who don't get that section, then it's a question of whether that's fair. However, if the gym is providing a service that's inherently for women (like a women's section for privacy or safety), it's not necessarily about equality but about providing a specific need. \n\nIn terms of fairness, if the author is paying the same fee but not getting access to the same facilities, that's a problem. But if the women's section is an extra that women get for the same price, then it's more about the gym's offerings. The author's issue is the inconsistency in access, which is a valid concern. However, the girlfriend's stance that it's different for women might be based on the idea that these spaces are necessary and not a form of exclusion. \n\nSo, the author's reasoning isn't entirely wrong. He's pointing out a potential inconsistency in how the gym's pricing and access work. However, the girlfriend's perspective is also valid in that women-only spaces are sometimes necessary for empowerment and safety. The question is about whether the author is being the asshole by not accepting this. \n\nIn the context of the relationship, the author is trying to explain his stance, but the girlfriend is defensive. The author might be right in his logic but not considering the social and cultural reasons behind women-only spaces. However, his argument about equal access for equal price is also a valid point. \n\nGiven that the gym's policy is the same for both genders in terms of pricing but restricts access to certain areas based on sex, the author's concern is about fairness. Therefore, he's not in the wrong for pointing out this inconsistency. The girlfriend's reaction might stem from not seeing the parallel situation. \n\nSo, the answer would be B (the author is not in the wrong) because he's highlighting a potential equality issue in the gym's policy, which is a valid concern.\n"
