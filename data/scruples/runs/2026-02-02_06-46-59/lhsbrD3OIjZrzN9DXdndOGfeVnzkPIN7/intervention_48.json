Recently my girlfriend suggested that I change over to her gym so we could carpool, workout together etc. Normally I would agree with this and be happy to go to the same gym as her, the problem is that her gym has a large \"**women only**\" section. The gym charges the same entrance fee for both men and women, but this section only allows women to use it and contains about 1/4 of the area of the gym and about 1/4 of the total workout equipment.\n\n I told my girlfriend that I didn't want to go to a gym that would charge someone 100% of the fee but only allow them to use 75% of the equipment because of their sex. When she said that I was being stupid about this I asked her if she would go to a gym that charged her the same as men, but forbid her from using a large portion of the equipment and area? She got upset at this, and said that \"*I just don't understand*\", and that \"*it's different for women*\".\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAm I being the asshole here and just not understanding?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that the author's girlfriend is suggesting they go to the same gym together. The author is okay with that, but there's a problem with the gym having a \"women only\" section. The gym charges the same for both men and women, but the women's section takes up 25% of the space and equipment. The author is upset because they feel it's unfair that they'd pay full price but not be allowed to use part of the facility. The girlfriend gets upset when he compares it to her situation, saying it's different for women.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the concept of separate spaces. Maybe the women's section is intended to create a safe or comfortable environment for women, where they can work out without feeling self-conscious around men. That's a common argument for such sections. The author is arguing from a perspective of equal access, which makes sense, but there might be underlying reasons for the separate area.\n\nFrom the author's point of view, paying the same but not getting access to all areas seems like a fair concern. But the key here is whether the gym is operating in a way that's discriminatory. If the gym charges the same and provides equivalent facilities overall (even if a portion is women-only), maybe it's not about discrimination but about choice and comfort. The author is not being denied access to all equipment; he can use the other 75% as a male. The women-only section is their choice, so it's not that the author is excluded from the rest, but perhaps the reverse if he were a woman.\n\nThe girlfriend's reaction suggests that she sees the women-only section as a benefit, a space where women can feel more comfortable. The author is trying to understand by comparing it to his situation, but the difference is that the women's section is a choice they have, not a restriction. The author isn't being denied anything except the women's section, which is optional for women. So maybe the author is not wrong to point out the apparent disparity, but the girlfriend's perspective is about the importance of that space for women, which the author doesn't fully grasp.\n\nIs the author in the wrong? It depends on the underlying values. If the author is arguing that the gym should not have a women-only section because it's a form of segregation, but the gym is allowing that choice for women, then maybe the author is overstepping. The author is not being forced to use the women's section; the problem is that his access is limited compared to the women's. But if the gym is offering a section that only women can use, perhaps as a service to them, it's not inherently sexist. The author's issue is more about access parity, but the gym isn't saying men can't use 75%\u2014they can. The women can use the full gym if they choose, but the women's section is an additional option. \n\nSo maybe the author is not in the wrong for bringing up the issue, as he's pointing out a potential inconsistency. However, the girlfriend might see the women-only section as a necessary accommodation for women's comfort and safety, which the author doesn't fully understand. The author might be failing to recognize that the women's section is a positive choice for women, not a restriction. Therefore, the author's comparison might be flawed. \n\nBut the author's main point is that he's paying the same but can't use part of the gym. If the gym's policy is that men pay full price but can't use the women's section, that's a different issue. However, if the women's section is only for women and not for men, and men can use the rest, then the author is not being excluded from the majority of the gym. The problem is his perception that it's unfair. The girlfriend's perspective is that it's different for women, which the author doesn't get. \n\nIn terms of whether the author is in the wrong, it seems like the author is not the asshole here. He's pointing out a valid concern about access and pricing. The girlfriend's response is dismissive, which might indicate she's not open to discussion. The author is not wrong to question the fairness of the situation, even if the gym's policy is intended to benefit women. So the answer would be B (Not in the wrong).\n"
