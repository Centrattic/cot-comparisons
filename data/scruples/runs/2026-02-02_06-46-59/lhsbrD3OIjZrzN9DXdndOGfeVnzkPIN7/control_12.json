Recently my girlfriend suggested that I change over to her gym so we could carpool, workout together etc. Normally I would agree with this and be happy to go to the same gym as her, the problem is that her gym has a large \"**women only**\" section. The gym charges the same entrance fee for both men and women, but this section only allows women to use it and contains about 1/4 of the area of the gym and about 1/4 of the total workout equipment.\n\n I told my girlfriend that I didn't want to go to a gym that would charge someone 100% of the fee but only allow them to use 75% of the equipment because of their sex. When she said that I was being stupid about this I asked her if she would go to a gym that charged her the same as men, but forbid her from using a large portion of the equipment and area? She got upset at this, and said that \"*I just don't understand*\", and that \"*it's different for women*\".\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAm I being the asshole here and just not understanding?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author of the situation is in the wrong for not wanting to switch gyms because of the women-only section. \n\nFirst, the key points: The author and his girlfriend work out at different gyms. She wants him to switch to her gym so they can carpool and work out together. The catch is her gym has a women-only section that takes up a quarter of the gym and equipment. The author objects because, in his view, it's sexist\u2014same price but less access based on gender. His girlfriend dismisses his concern, saying it's different for women.\n\nSo, the main issue is whether gender-segregated gym sections are inherently sexist. The author is arguing symmetry: if women get a section he can't access, why shouldn't men be allowed the same? But his girlfriend thinks it's not the same for women, which is a common point in gender discussions. \n\nFrom a fairness perspective, the gym is charging the same fee but restricting access based on sex. That seems like a form of discrimination. The author is pointing out that if you pay the same, you should get the same access. His girlfriend's reaction might stem from the idea that women-only spaces are intended to address historical exclusion, but the author sees it as an unfair policy.\n\nIs the author being unreasonable? If the gym's policy is discriminatory, then the author has a valid point. However, the girlfriend might be defending the policy because it's meant to support women's comfort and safety. But the problem is that the gym is charging the same fee while limiting access. If the women-only section is for women, then men shouldn't have access, but if the gym is charging men the same, then men are effectively paying for access they don't get. That's a contradiction. \n\nSo, the author is not in the wrong. The gym's policy is what's questionable, and the author is pointing out the inconsistency. His girlfriend's dismissal of his concern might be a sign that she's not seeing the discriminatory aspect. Therefore, the answer should be B (No).\n"
