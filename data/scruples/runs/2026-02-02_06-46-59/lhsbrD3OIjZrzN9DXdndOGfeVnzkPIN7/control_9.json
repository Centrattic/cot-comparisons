Recently my girlfriend suggested that I change over to her gym so we could carpool, workout together etc. Normally I would agree with this and be happy to go to the same gym as her, the problem is that her gym has a large \"**women only**\" section. The gym charges the same entrance fee for both men and women, but this section only allows women to use it and contains about 1/4 of the area of the gym and about 1/4 of the total workout equipment.\n\n I told my girlfriend that I didn't want to go to a gym that would charge someone 100% of the fee but only allow them to use 75% of the equipment because of their sex. When she said that I was being stupid about this I asked her if she would go to a gym that charged her the same as men, but forbid her from using a large portion of the equipment and area? She got upset at this, and said that \"*I just don't understand*\", and that \"*it's different for women*\".\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAm I being the asshole here and just not understanding?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that the author and his girlfriend both go to the gym, but they've been going to different ones. The girlfriend suggests they switch to her gym so they can carpool and work out together. The problem is that her gym has a \"women only\" section, which the author finds sexist. He argues that since the gym charges the same for both men and women but restricts men from using a quarter of the equipment, it's unfair. The girlfriend gets upset, saying it's different for women.\n\nFirst, I need to understand both sides. The author's main point is about fairness and equality. If the gym charges the same rate but limits access based on gender, he feels it's discriminatory. He's comparing it to a scenario where women would be charged the same but not allowed to use part of the gym, which he thinks would be unacceptable. The girlfriend, on the other hand, defends the women-only section, implying that it serves a different purpose for women, maybe providing a space where they feel more comfortable or safe, which is common in some gyms.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author is wrong to hold this view. From a legal and ethical standpoint, discrimination based on sex is prohibited in many places, especially in public accommodations. However, some exceptions exist, like women-only spaces in certain contexts (e.g., homeless shelters, prisons) to address specific needs or historical disadvantages. The key here is whether the gym's policy is a legitimate exception.\n\nThe author is objecting to a policy that seems to offer different benefits based on gender, even if the entrance fee is the same. If the gym is providing a service (the women-only section) that's not available to all members, that could be seen as discriminatory. However, if the rest of the gym is equally accessible to everyone, maybe the argument is about the value received. The author is saying he's paying for 100% of the facility but only getting 75% access. But if the women-only section is a separate service within the same gym, perhaps it's a different calculation. \n\nAnother angle is the purpose of the women-only section. If it's intended to support women who feel uncomfortable in co-ed environments, which can be a valid social need, then the gym might be addressing that by offering that space. But does that justify limiting access for men? It's a tricky balance between inclusivity and addressing specific needs. \n\nThe girlfriend's reaction suggests she sees the women-only section as necessary and not discriminatory. The author is pushing back on the principle, which could be seen as not considering the reasons behind the section. However, the author's stance is about consistency and fairness\u2014if the same policy were applied to women, it would be problematic. \n\nSo, is he the asshole? If the gym's policy is legally permissible and aimed at addressing a specific need (like providing a safe space for women), then the author's argument might not hold, and he could be the one not understanding. But if the policy is inherently discriminatory without just cause, then the author's objection is valid. \n\nIn many jurisdictions, gender-based restrictions can be allowed if they serve a valid purpose. However, if the gym is charging the same but not offering the same access, that's a problem. But the author is missing the context of why the women-only section exists. The girlfriend's frustration might stem from the author not respecting that context. \n\nOverall, the author's reasoning is based on principle, but he might not be considering the social reasons for the women-only section. Therefore, he might be in the wrong for not understanding the purpose behind the policy. So, the answer would be A (the author is in the wrong).\n"
