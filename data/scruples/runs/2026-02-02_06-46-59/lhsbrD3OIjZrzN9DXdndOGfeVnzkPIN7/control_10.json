Recently my girlfriend suggested that I change over to her gym so we could carpool, workout together etc. Normally I would agree with this and be happy to go to the same gym as her, the problem is that her gym has a large \"**women only**\" section. The gym charges the same entrance fee for both men and women, but this section only allows women to use it and contains about 1/4 of the area of the gym and about 1/4 of the total workout equipment.\n\n I told my girlfriend that I didn't want to go to a gym that would charge someone 100% of the fee but only allow them to use 75% of the equipment because of their sex. When she said that I was being stupid about this I asked her if she would go to a gym that charged her the same as men, but forbid her from using a large portion of the equipment and area? She got upset at this, and said that \"*I just don't understand*\", and that \"*it's different for women*\".\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAm I being the asshole here and just not understanding?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for not wanting to go to the same gym as his girlfriend because of the women-only section. The key points here are about gender equality and access to facilities.\n\nFirst, the gym charges the same fee for everyone but has a section exclusively for women. The author is objecting because he feels it's unfair that men can't use that quarter of the gym. His girlfriend argues that it's different for women. \n\nI need to think about whether the author's reasoning is valid. The author is comparing it to a hypothetical where women are excluded from certain areas, which would be clearly discriminatory. If the gym is doing something that would be considered sexist against women, then it's fair to question why the same standard isn't applied to men. \n\nHowever, maybe there's a context I'm missing. Some gyms have women-only hours or sections to create a safer or more comfortable environment, especially in areas where women might feel uncomfortable working out around men. But the author is arguing that this setup is inherently sexist because it's gender-based. \n\nThe author isn't against the concept of women-only spaces in all contexts, but specifically against the unequal access when the fee is the same. The issue is that he's being asked to pay the same price for less access. If the gym allowed men to use the same equipment but not women, that would be clearly discriminatory. The author is pointing out the inconsistency in his girlfriend's stance. \n\nThe girlfriend's reaction of calling him stupid and not understanding might indicate that she's not seeing the parallel situation. The author's argument is about fairness and equal access, which is a valid point. So, he's not being the asshole here. The answer should be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
