Recently my girlfriend suggested that I change over to her gym so we could carpool, workout together etc. Normally I would agree with this and be happy to go to the same gym as her, the problem is that her gym has a large \"**women only**\" section. The gym charges the same entrance fee for both men and women, but this section only allows women to use it and contains about 1/4 of the area of the gym and about 1/4 of the total workout equipment.\n\n I told my girlfriend that I didn't want to go to a gym that would charge someone 100% of the fee but only allow them to use 75% of the equipment because of their sex. When she said that I was being stupid about this I asked her if she would go to a gym that charged her the same as men, but forbid her from using a large portion of the equipment and area? She got upset at this, and said that \"*I just don't understand*\", and that \"*it's different for women*\".\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAm I being the asshole here and just not understanding?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, so I need to figure out if the person who wrote this is in the wrong. Let me start by breaking down the situation.\n\nThe author and their girlfriend both like working out and have been going to different gyms before they started dating. Now, the girlfriend suggests they go to the same gym so they can carpool and work out together. The problem is that her gym has a \"women only\" section, which is about a quarter of the gym and equipment. The author is objecting because they think it's sexist that men would be charged the same but can't use that section. The girlfriend responded by saying the author is being stupid and that \"it's different for women.\"\n\nFirst, I should consider the core issue: the author is upset about a gym policy that separates areas based on gender, even though the entrance fee is the same. The author's argument is about fairness and equality. If the gym is charging the same fee but restricting access to certain areas based on gender, that seems like a potential issue of equality. But the \"women only\" section is likely intended to provide a safe space for women, which is a common practice in many gyms. \n\nNow, the author's analogy is, if the gym charged women the same as men but restricted them from 75% of the equipment, would the girlfriend accept that? The girlfriend got upset and said it's different for women. That makes me think she sees the women-only section as a positive or necessary feature, maybe for comfort or safety reasons. \n\nSo, the question is whether the author is being sexist by objecting to the women-only section. The author might be coming from a place of advocating for gender equality, which is positive, but perhaps not considering the reasons why such a section exists. On the other hand, the girlfriend might feel that the author is not respecting her choice or the community's needs. \n\nI need to check if the author is in the wrong here. The key is whether the objection is valid. If the gym is non-discriminatory in pricing and other services but allows a section specifically for women, that's not necessarily sexist. Women-only spaces in gyms can be about creating an environment where women feel more comfortable, free from intimidation. The author is essentially saying that men shouldn't have to pay for a space they can't use, but if the gym isn't restricting men's access beyond that section, maybe it's not the same. \n\nHowever, the author's point is about equal access. If the gym is charging the same fee but limiting access to equipment based on gender, that could be seen as discriminatory. But maybe the women-only section is a minor part, and the rest is co-ed. The author is arguing for equal treatment, which is a valid stance. But the girlfriend might see it as the author not understanding the importance of such sections for women's comfort. \n\nI think the author isn't in the wrong because they're pointing out a potential inequality. But maybe they're not considering the intent behind the women-only section. The girlfriend's reaction seems to be defensive, which might indicate she feels the author is dismissing her needs. However, the author's argument is about fairness in access relative to cost, which is a legitimate concern. So the answer might be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
