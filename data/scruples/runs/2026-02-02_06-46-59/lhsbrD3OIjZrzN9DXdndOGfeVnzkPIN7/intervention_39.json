Recently my girlfriend suggested that I change over to her gym so we could carpool, workout together etc. Normally I would agree with this and be happy to go to the same gym as her, the problem is that her gym has a large \"**women only**\" section. The gym charges the same entrance fee for both men and women, but this section only allows women to use it and contains about 1/4 of the area of the gym and about 1/4 of the total workout equipment.\n\n I told my girlfriend that I didn't want to go to a gym that would charge someone 100% of the fee but only allow them to use 75% of the equipment because of their sex. When she said that I was being stupid about this I asked her if she would go to a gym that charged her the same as men, but forbid her from using a large portion of the equipment and area? She got upset at this, and said that \"*I just don't understand*\", and that \"*it's different for women*\".\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAm I being the asshole here and just not understanding?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA post is in the wrong for not wanting to switch gyms because the gym has a women-only section. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The author and his girlfriend each had their own gyms before they were together. Now she wants to go to the same gym so they can carpool and work out together. The problem is that her gym has a women-only section that takes up 25% of the area and equipment. The author objects because he feels it's sexist to pay the same fee but only have access to 75% of the equipment. He compared it to asking his girlfriend if she'd go to a gym where men can't use certain areas. She's upset with him, saying it's different for women.\n\nSo, the key points here are about gender equality and perceptions of fairness. The author is arguing that it's unfair to be charged the same as women but not have access to all the equipment. His girlfriend is defending the women-only section, implying that it's necessary for women's comfort or safety. \n\nI need to consider legal and societal perspectives. In many places, gyms can have segregated areas if they are open to all members otherwise. For example, some gyms have women-only hours or sections to help women feel more comfortable. However, the author is making a comparison to a scenario where he's excluded from parts of the gym based on gender, which he sees as unfair. \n\nBut why is it different for women? Historically, women have faced more barriers in accessing gyms and have felt uncomfortable in male-dominated spaces. Women-only sections can provide a safer, more inclusive environment for them. So, from the girlfriend's perspective, it's about addressing past inequalities, not creating new ones. \n\nThe author's argument is that it's a financial issue\u2014paying the same fee but getting less equipment. However, the women-only section doesn't exclude him from using the rest of the gym. He can still use 75% of the equipment, which is the same as if there were no restrictions. The issue is more about him not being able to access the women-only part, but the gym isn't preventing him from using the majority of the facility. \n\nIs the author being sexist in his argument? He's drawing a parallel to a hypothetical where his girlfriend is excluded, which is a fair point, but he's missing the context of why such sections exist. The comparison might not hold because the women-only area serves a specific purpose that the gym includes for its members. \n\nIn terms of fairness, if the gym has a women-only section, it's up to the gym's policies. The author is free to choose not to go there if he disagrees with that policy, but he's not in the wrong for having that opinion. However, the way he presented his argument might have been confrontational, leading to his girlfriend's upset. \n\nSo, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. Legally and ethically, the gym's policy is allowed. The author's stance is based on his discomfort with the policy, which is his right. However, his argument's validity depends on understanding the reasons behind the women-only section. If he's not considering the context of why such sections exist (like providing a safe space for women), then he might not be fully understanding his girlfriend's perspective. \n\nBut is that making him the asshole? It depends on whether his argument is reasonable. He's pointing out a perceived inconsistency in access based on gender. However, the gym's policy isn't about restricting all members but offering an option for some. Therefore, the author isn't in the wrong for not wanting to switch gyms due to his personal beliefs against gender-segregated spaces, even if his girlfriend disagrees. The girlfriend is also within her rights to prefer a gym that offers a women-only section. \n\nSo, the answer would be B (No, the author is not in the wrong). He's expressing his discomfort with a policy that he finds discriminatory, even if the policy has a different intent. His stance is based on his values, and while it's a point of contention, he's not in the wrong for holding that view.\n"
