Recently my girlfriend suggested that I change over to her gym so we could carpool, workout together etc. Normally I would agree with this and be happy to go to the same gym as her, the problem is that her gym has a large \"**women only**\" section. The gym charges the same entrance fee for both men and women, but this section only allows women to use it and contains about 1/4 of the area of the gym and about 1/4 of the total workout equipment.\n\n I told my girlfriend that I didn't want to go to a gym that would charge someone 100% of the fee but only allow them to use 75% of the equipment because of their sex. When she said that I was being stupid about this I asked her if she would go to a gym that charged her the same as men, but forbid her from using a large portion of the equipment and area? She got upset at this, and said that \"*I just don't understand*\", and that \"*it's different for women*\".\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAm I being the asshole here and just not understanding?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is about a couple where the girlfriend wants them to both go to her gym. The issue is that her gym has a women-only section, which takes up a quarter of the gym's area and equipment. The author doesn't want to join because he thinks it's sexist to charge the same fee but limit access based on gender. The girlfriend gets upset when he compares it to her being charged the same but barred from certain areas.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the core of the conflict. The author is objecting to the gym's policy of segregating equipment and space by gender. He's arguing that if the gym charges the same amount, everyone should have equal access. But the girlfriend seems to think that the women-only section is different, perhaps because it's meant to create a safer or more comfortable space for women, which is a common argument for such sections. \n\nNow, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. Let's break it down. The author's main point is about fairness and equal access. If the gym allows certain areas for one gender only, isn't that a form of discrimination? The same fee means you're paying the same, but getting less access if you're the other gender. That seems like unequal treatment for equal pay. On the other hand, some might argue that the women-only section is a response to societal issues where women feel uncomfortable or unsafe in mixed environments, so providing such a space can be seen as inclusive rather than exclusionary. \n\nBut the problem here is that the gym is a single entity. If the gym charges the same fee to everyone but restricts access to part of their facility based on gender, isn't that inherently discriminatory? The author is pointing out that this setup effectively gives women access to more resources for the same price, which he finds unjust. However, the girlfriend's perspective is that this is a positive measure to support women's comfort and safety, which is a valid point. \n\nBut then again, the author isn't being denied access to the entire gym. He can still use the other 75% of the equipment and space. So maybe his argument is a bit extreme? Or is it? If you pay for a gym membership, you expect to have access to all the facilities it offers. If part of the gym is restricted by gender, then men can't use those areas, which might be a problem for them. However, the author isn't saying he can't use the rest; he's arguing about the principle of equal access for equal cost. \n\nAnother angle: the author is comparing his situation to the girlfriend's. If the roles were reversed, and the gym had a men-only section that women couldn't access, but charged the same, he would likely be upset. The girlfriend's reaction suggests she doesn't see the analogy, which could indicate a double standard in her view. \n\nBut why would she think it's different for women? Maybe because historically, women have faced more systemic discrimination and exclusion from spaces, so creating women-only areas is a way to counterbalance that. However, in a modern context, if the gym is charging the same fee, the argument is about equal access. The author's stance is that the gym isn't providing equal value for the same price, which is a legitimate concern. \n\nIs the author wrong for pointing this out? Or is the girlfriend wrong for not seeing the inconsistency? The author is trying to apply the principle of equal treatment, which is a fair point. However, the girlfriend's perspective is rooted in the idea that sometimes exclusive spaces are necessary for marginalized groups, which is also a valid social consideration. \n\nThe key here is whether the gym's policy is discriminatory. If the gym is providing a service where part of the facility is restricted by gender, and charging the same price regardless, that does seem like a form of gender-based discrimination. The author is not wrong in pointing out the inconsistency. The girlfriend's refusal to see the comparison might stem from a lack of understanding of the principle of equal treatment, or she might genuinely believe that the women-only section is justified. \n\nIn terms of the relationship conflict, the author is trying to make a principled argument, while the girlfriend feels that her needs (for a women-only space) are being dismissed. The author's frustration is about fairness, and the girlfriend's is about being misunderstood. \n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? If we look at the principle of equal access for equal payment, the author's position is justifiable. The gym's policy could be seen as discriminatory, so the author isn't wrong to object. The girlfriend might be in the wrong for not recognizing the inconsistency in her stance. However, if the women-only section is intended to provide a safe space and the gym isn't excluding men from other areas, then the author's argument might be missing the point. \n\nBut the author's argument is based on the gym's structure of charging the same but limiting access. If the gym had a separate fee for access to the entire facility, then the women-only section wouldn't be an issue. But since the fee is the same, the access difference is a problem. Therefore, the author isn't in the wrong for pointing this out. The girlfriend's reaction might be due to not seeing the issue from his perspective, but the author's stance is based on fairness.\n"
