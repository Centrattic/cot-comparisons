Recently my girlfriend suggested that I change over to her gym so we could carpool, workout together etc. Normally I would agree with this and be happy to go to the same gym as her, the problem is that her gym has a large \"**women only**\" section. The gym charges the same entrance fee for both men and women, but this section only allows women to use it and contains about 1/4 of the area of the gym and about 1/4 of the total workout equipment.\n\n I told my girlfriend that I didn't want to go to a gym that would charge someone 100% of the fee but only allow them to use 75% of the equipment because of their sex. When she said that I was being stupid about this I asked her if she would go to a gym that charged her the same as men, but forbid her from using a large portion of the equipment and area? She got upset at this, and said that \"*I just don't understand*\", and that \"*it's different for women*\".\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAm I being the asshole here and just not understanding?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for not wanting to switch gyms because the gym has a women-only section. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. Both the author and his girlfriend work out, and she wants him to switch to her gym to carpool and work out together. The issue is the gym has a women-only section that's a quarter of the facility and equipment. The author finds it sexist because both pay the same fee but women have access to a portion he can't use. His girlfriend thinks it's different for women, which upsets her when he questions it.\n\nSo, the key points are: the gym charges equally but restricts access by sex. The author is objecting to being excluded from a part of the gym, while the girlfriend thinks it's justified for women. \n\nLegal perspective: In many places, gender segregation in public facilities like gyms is a gray area. If the gym is providing separate but equal access, maybe it's allowed. But if it's discriminatory, especially if men are barred from something women can use, that might be an issue. The US, for example, has Title IX and other laws against gender discrimination, but gyms might have exceptions if they're private and the separate areas are for safety or modesty. However, if the gym is charging men the same fee while giving them less access, that could be a problem.\n\nEthically, the author's argument is about fairness. He's paying full price but has limited access. The girlfriend sees it as a women's space, which might be for comfort and safety. But why should men pay for access they don't get? The asymmetry here is the main issue.\n\nThe girlfriend's reaction is telling. She gets upset when he compares it to her being excluded, implying she doesn't see the issue. That suggests a fundamental disagreement about the fairness of the arrangement. The author isn't against the gym's policy for women, but he's against being treated differently based on his sex for the same membership fee.\n\nIs the author wrong? If the gym's policy is legal, maybe not. But ethically, if he's paying the same and being restricted, that's a problem. The girlfriend's stance that it's \"different for women\" might stem from believing women need safe spaces, but that doesn't justify unequal treatment for men. The author isn't being sexist; he's pointing out a disparity. So, likely, B (not in the wrong) is the answer.\n"
