Recently my girlfriend suggested that I change over to her gym so we could carpool, workout together etc. Normally I would agree with this and be happy to go to the same gym as her, the problem is that her gym has a large \"**women only**\" section. The gym charges the same entrance fee for both men and women, but this section only allows women to use it and contains about 1/4 of the area of the gym and about 1/4 of the total workout equipment.\n\n I told my girlfriend that I didn't want to go to a gym that would charge someone 100% of the fee but only allow them to use 75% of the equipment because of their sex. When she said that I was being stupid about this I asked her if she would go to a gym that charged her the same as men, but forbid her from using a large portion of the equipment and area? She got upset at this, and said that \"*I just don't understand*\", and that \"*it's different for women*\".\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAm I being the asshole here and just not understanding?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for not wanting to switch gyms because of the women-only section. \n\nSo, the situation is that the girlfriend wants them to go to her gym so they can carpool and work out together. The author's issue is that the gym has a women-only section that takes up a quarter of the space and equipment. Even though the entrance fee is the same for everyone, the author feels it's unfair because if he were a woman, he wouldn't be allowed in that section. He compares it to women being charged the same but not allowed in parts of the gym, which his girlfriend says is different.\n\nHmm. The key points here are about fairness and gender equality. The author is pointing out a discrepancy where men are excluded from a section that's part of the same facility they pay for. The girlfriend argues that it's different for women, which might imply that she sees the women-only section as a positive thing, perhaps for safety or comfort, but that doesn't address the author's point about equal access based on the fee.\n\nThe author's reasoning is that if the gym charges the same fee but restricts access based on gender, it's sexist. The girlfriend's response that he's \"being stupid\" and not understanding suggests she might not see it the same way. The author is applying the same logic that if the roles were reversed, he would find it unfair. That seems like a valid point about consistency in treatment.\n\nBut maybe there's a cultural or social context here. Women-only gyms or sections can exist for reasons like safety, body comfort, or confidence. However, the author's argument is about equal access to the paid services. If the gym is charging the same fee but offering less access to men, that could be seen as discriminatory, regardless of the intent behind the women-only section.\n\nThe question is whether the author is wrong for finding this sexist. From a fairness perspective, if a service charges the same price but provides less access to a group, that's unequal treatment. So the author's stance isn't necessarily wrong. However, the girlfriend might feel that the women-only section serves a purpose that's important to her, and the author not understanding that could be seen as a communication issue.\n\nBut the core issue is about the principle of equal access for equal fee. The gym's policy might be considered discriminatory, so the author isn't in the wrong for refusing to participate in a system that he perceives as unfair. The answer would be B: No, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
