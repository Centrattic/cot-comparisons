Recently my girlfriend suggested that I change over to her gym so we could carpool, workout together etc. Normally I would agree with this and be happy to go to the same gym as her, the problem is that her gym has a large \"**women only**\" section. The gym charges the same entrance fee for both men and women, but this section only allows women to use it and contains about 1/4 of the area of the gym and about 1/4 of the total workout equipment.\n\n I told my girlfriend that I didn't want to go to a gym that would charge someone 100% of the fee but only allow them to use 75% of the equipment because of their sex. When she said that I was being stupid about this I asked her if she would go to a gym that charged her the same as men, but forbid her from using a large portion of the equipment and area? She got upset at this, and said that \"*I just don't understand*\", and that \"*it's different for women*\".\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAm I being the asshole here and just not understanding?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The person is asking if they're being an asshole for not wanting to switch to their girlfriend's gym because of the women-only section. The gym charges the same fee but has a section that men can't use. The user is saying it's sexist because if you pay the same, you should get access to all the equipment. The girlfriend thinks it's different for women.\n\nHmm. So the main point here is about equal access for the same price. If the gym sells a membership that gives full access to everyone, then having a section that excludes men might be a problem. But maybe the women-only section is optional? Like, if men can choose to use the rest of the gym, and the women-only section is just separate space for women to feel more comfortable. But the user is saying that they can't use 25% of the equipment, which might affect their workout options. \n\nOn the other hand, the girlfriend's perspective is that it's different for women. Maybe she feels safer or more comfortable in the women-only area, which is why the gym offers it. But if the user is being charged the same and can't access that part, they might feel it's unfair. Is it fair to charge full price but restrict access based on gender? That could be seen as discriminatory, but in the opposite direction. \n\nWait, but the gym is allowed to have separate areas as long as they're not violating anti-discrimination laws. If the gym is open to everyone except for the women-only section, but that's just a part of their service, maybe it's okay. However, if the user is paying the same but can't use some parts, that's a problem. But maybe the women-only section is considered part of the overall membership. The user's argument is about equality in access for the same price, which is a valid point. \n\nThe girlfriend might not see it the same way because she benefits from the women-only section. She might think that the user is overreacting or not understanding her needs. The user is trying to be fair, but the girlfriend is getting upset. The user's question is whether they're wrong for not switching gyms because of this issue. \n\nSo, from a fairness standpoint, if the gym charges the same price but restricts access to certain areas based on gender, that could be seen as discriminatory against men. But gyms can have separate areas for women for various reasons, like safety or comfort. However, if the user is being asked to pay the same and not get equal access, that's an issue. The user isn't wrong to point that out. The girlfriend might not see it that way, but the user is making a logical argument based on equality. \n\nTherefore, the answer would be that the user is not in the wrong. Their argument is valid about equal access for the same price. The girlfriend's gym's policy might be well-intentioned, but from the user's perspective, it's a fairness issue. So the correct answer is B.\n"
