Recently my girlfriend suggested that I change over to her gym so we could carpool, workout together etc. Normally I would agree with this and be happy to go to the same gym as her, the problem is that her gym has a large \"**women only**\" section. The gym charges the same entrance fee for both men and women, but this section only allows women to use it and contains about 1/4 of the area of the gym and about 1/4 of the total workout equipment.\n\n I told my girlfriend that I didn't want to go to a gym that would charge someone 100% of the fee but only allow them to use 75% of the equipment because of their sex. When she said that I was being stupid about this I asked her if she would go to a gym that charged her the same as men, but forbid her from using a large portion of the equipment and area? She got upset at this, and said that \"*I just don't understand*\", and that \"*it's different for women*\".\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAm I being the asshole here and just not understanding?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is about a guy who doesn't want to switch gyms with his girlfriend because her gym has a women-only section. He argues that it's sexist because men pay the same fee but can't use that part of the gym, which has a quarter of the equipment. The girlfriend is upset and says it's different for women.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the core issue. The author is objecting to the gym's policy of having a women-only section. He's comparing it to a hypothetical where women are excluded from part of the gym, which he thinks is unfair. The girlfriend thinks it's different for women, maybe because of historical reasons or the intent behind the policy.\n\nSo, is the author right to think it's sexist? Well, in many cases, women-only spaces can be considered a form of affirmative action or support for women in male-dominated environments. For example, women's shelters or certain sports events have women-only categories to address historical inequalities. However, if the policy is not based on such considerations and instead just divides the gym into areas based on gender without a clear justification, it might be seen as discriminatory.\n\nThe key here is the purpose of the women-only section. If it's meant to create a safe space for women in a gym that's otherwise male-dominated, that's one thing. But if the gym is providing equal benefits to both genders overall, then the policy might not be discriminatory. The author's argument is that men are paying the same fee but can't access the same equipment, which he sees as unfair. However, the girlfriend's perspective is that women need that space for reasons that aren't immediately clear to the author.\n\nAnother angle is to consider if the gym's policy is actually discriminatory. If both genders can access the same amount of equipment in total (like 3/4 for men and 1/4 for women, but women can use all parts) versus men only using 3/4 while women can use all, maybe the total access isn't equal. But if the gym is offering the same total facilities to both, just partitioned differently, it's possible that the policy isn't inherently sexist. However, if men are excluded from a section that's part of their paid membership, that could be an issue of unequal access.\n\nI also need to think about societal norms. In some contexts, women-only spaces are accepted to promote inclusivity, especially in fields where women are underrepresented. However, the author might feel that this is a form of reverse discrimination, even if unintended. The problem is that the author is not recognizing the intent behind the women-only section, which his girlfriend sees as necessary for her.\n\nThe girlfriend's reaction that he's not understanding suggests that there's a cultural or social difference in their perspectives. The author is trying to apply a principle of equal access to all, but the girlfriend sees the policy as a necessary accommodation for women. This is a common point of contention in discussions about equality versus equity.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? If the gym's policy is intended to address a legitimate need for women and is part of broader efforts to create inclusive spaces, then the author's objection might be seen as not considering that need. On the other hand, if the policy is arbitrary and doesn't serve a legitimate purpose, then the author's objection is valid.\n\nBut the question is whether the author is in the wrong. The author is not wrong in thinking that equal access is important, but he might be missing the context of why the women-only section exists. If the policy is meant to support women and the gym's overall offerings are fair, then the author's stance might not consider the reasons behind the policy. However, if the author is being asked to accept a policy that inherently excludes him from part of the facility he pays for, that's a valid concern.\n\nIn conclusion, the author's perspective is based on a principle of equal treatment, while the girlfriend's is based on the need for inclusive spaces. Depending on the gym's intent and the overall fairness, the answer could hinge on that. However, since the question is about whether the author is in the wrong, and given that the gym's policy might have a legitimate purpose, the answer might lean towards the author not being in the wrong if he's objecting to unequal access. But if the policy is justified, then the author might not be in the wrong. Alternatively, the author could be seen as not understanding the purpose of the women-only section, making him the asshole in the situation.\n"
