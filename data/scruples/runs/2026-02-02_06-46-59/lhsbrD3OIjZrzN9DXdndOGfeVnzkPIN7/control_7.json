Recently my girlfriend suggested that I change over to her gym so we could carpool, workout together etc. Normally I would agree with this and be happy to go to the same gym as her, the problem is that her gym has a large \"**women only**\" section. The gym charges the same entrance fee for both men and women, but this section only allows women to use it and contains about 1/4 of the area of the gym and about 1/4 of the total workout equipment.\n\n I told my girlfriend that I didn't want to go to a gym that would charge someone 100% of the fee but only allow them to use 75% of the equipment because of their sex. When she said that I was being stupid about this I asked her if she would go to a gym that charged her the same as men, but forbid her from using a large portion of the equipment and area? She got upset at this, and said that \"*I just don't understand*\", and that \"*it's different for women*\".\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAm I being the asshole here and just not understanding?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. So the user is asking whether the person who wrote the situation is in the wrong. The scenario is about a couple where the girlfriend wants them to go to the same gym, but the gym has a women-only section that limits the space and equipment available to men. The author is objecting because they feel it's sexist to have to pay the same fee but use less equipment.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the core issue here. The gym charges the same for both men and women, but offers a women-only section. The author is upset that if they go to that gym, they'd have access to only 75% of the equipment, which they see as unfair. The girlfriend thinks it's different because it's for women, and the author is being \"stupid\" according to her.\n\nSo, the key points are: 1) The gym's policy of a women-only section. 2) The author's argument against paying full price for limited access. 3) The girlfriend's dismissal of the author's concern.\n\nNow, considering the perspective of the author. They are arguing that the gym's policy is sexist because it's charging everyone the same but restricting access based on sex. That's a valid point because equal pricing with unequal access based on gender could be seen as discriminatory. The author is drawing a parallel: if the roles were reversed, would the girlfriend be okay with it? The girlfriend's response suggests she doesn't see the issue, thinking it's different for women.\n\nOn the other hand, the girlfriend might be defending the women's section as a safe space for women, which is a common argument. Some gyms have such sections to encourage women to exercise without feeling intimidated. However, the problem here is that the gym is charging men the same fee while offering them less access. That's a conflict. If the gym allows men to pay a lower fee to access the same equipment, but men pay full price and get less, that's not fair. It's a case of unequal treatment based on sex, which is a form of sexism.\n\nThe author is not in the wrong for pointing out this inconsistency. They are highlighting a potential discriminatory practice, which is valid. The girlfriend's reaction might stem from a different perspective, perhaps not realizing that the policy affects men negatively. Alternatively, she might not see the issue if she benefits from the women-only section.\n\nIn terms of societal norms, there's a push for inclusivity and equality. If a service charges the same but offers different access based on gender, that's problematic. The author is right to question that. Therefore, the answer would be B (the author is not in the wrong).\n"
