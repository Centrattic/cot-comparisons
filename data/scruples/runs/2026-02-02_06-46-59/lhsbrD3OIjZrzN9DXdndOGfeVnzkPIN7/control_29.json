Recently my girlfriend suggested that I change over to her gym so we could carpool, workout together etc. Normally I would agree with this and be happy to go to the same gym as her, the problem is that her gym has a large \"**women only**\" section. The gym charges the same entrance fee for both men and women, but this section only allows women to use it and contains about 1/4 of the area of the gym and about 1/4 of the total workout equipment.\n\n I told my girlfriend that I didn't want to go to a gym that would charge someone 100% of the fee but only allow them to use 75% of the equipment because of their sex. When she said that I was being stupid about this I asked her if she would go to a gym that charged her the same as men, but forbid her from using a large portion of the equipment and area? She got upset at this, and said that \"*I just don't understand*\", and that \"*it's different for women*\".\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAm I being the asshole here and just not understanding?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong for not wanting to switch to their girlfriend's gym because of the \"women only\" section.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The girlfriend suggested they go to the same gym for convenience. The gym has a women-only section that takes up a quarter of the space and equipment. The author is uncomfortable with paying full price but only having access to 75% of the gym if they were women. \n\nThe author argues that it's unfair to pay the same fee but have restricted access based on gender. The girlfriend dismisses his argument, saying it's different for women. The key here is the concept of gender equality and access. \n\nFrom a fairness perspective, if the gym charges the same rate but offers less access to one gender, that seems discriminatory. The author is pointing out a potential inconsistency in how the gym treats men and women. If the women's section is exclusive, then men aren't getting the full value of their membership, which could be seen as a legitimate concern. \n\nHowever, the girlfriend might be pointing out that the women's section exists to provide a safe space for women, which is a common argument for such areas. But the author isn't against the women's section per se; he's against the idea of paying full price without access to all areas. The gym's policy seems to favor women by giving them a dedicated space without charging them extra for the full facility, which might be a form of compensation for societal disadvantages. \n\nBut if the gym's pricing is the same for everyone, then why should men have full access while women are limited? That could be seen as unequal treatment. The author's argument is that if both genders pay the same, they should have equal access. The girlfriend's response suggests she sees it as a necessary accommodation for women, perhaps to address historical inequities or safety concerns. \n\nThe question is whether the author is wrong for objecting to this. If the gym's policy is discriminatory in practice, even if the intention is to help women, the author's stance could be justified. On the other hand, if the women's section is a reasonable accommodation, then the author's refusal might be seen as not understanding that context. \n\nBut the key point is the fairness of the fee structure. If the gym allows women to use the full facility when they pay the same as men, but men don't get the same benefit, that's a problem. The author is highlighting that inconsistency. The girlfriend's dismissal of his argument as \"stupid\" and her own confusion might indicate a lack of empathy or understanding of his perspective. \n\nIn terms of the AITA question, the author is not in the wrong if the gym's policy is indeed discriminatory in its application. He's pointing out a logical inconsistency in the gym's pricing and access policies. The girlfriend's response seems dismissive, which might indicate she's not fully considering his valid point. Therefore, the answer would be B (No), the author is not in the wrong.\n"
