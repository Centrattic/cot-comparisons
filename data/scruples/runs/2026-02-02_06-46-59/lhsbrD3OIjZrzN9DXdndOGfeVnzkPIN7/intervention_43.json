Recently my girlfriend suggested that I change over to her gym so we could carpool, workout together etc. Normally I would agree with this and be happy to go to the same gym as her, the problem is that her gym has a large \"**women only**\" section. The gym charges the same entrance fee for both men and women, but this section only allows women to use it and contains about 1/4 of the area of the gym and about 1/4 of the total workout equipment.\n\n I told my girlfriend that I didn't want to go to a gym that would charge someone 100% of the fee but only allow them to use 75% of the equipment because of their sex. When she said that I was being stupid about this I asked her if she would go to a gym that charged her the same as men, but forbid her from using a large portion of the equipment and area? She got upset at this, and said that \"*I just don't understand*\", and that \"*it's different for women*\".\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAm I being the asshole here and just not understanding?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for not wanting to switch gyms because of the \"women only\" section. The girlfriend suggested carpooling and working out together, but the author is upset that the gym has a section that's only for women. The author argues that if men paid the same fee but couldn't use part of the equipment, it would be sexist. The girlfriend thinks it's different for women.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The gym has a women-only section, but it's 1/4 of the area and equipment. The author is objecting because it's unequal access based on sex. The key point is whether the gym's policy is discriminatory in a way that's comparable to if it were the other way around.\n\nIn many places, gender-segregated spaces are legal, especially if they're voluntary and not mandatory. For example, women's only gyms or sections might exist to provide a safe space for women, which is a recognized social issue. However, if the gym is charging the same fee but restricting access based on sex, that could be a problem. But in this case, the women-only section is a choice for women to use, not a restriction. So women are given the option to have their own space, which might be seen as positive for them. The author is upset because if he were a woman, he argues, the gym would be limiting his access. But that's not the case here. As a man, he isn't restricted from using all the equipment; he can use the entire gym. The women-only section doesn't affect his access. \n\nThe author's argument is based on the idea that equality means identical treatment in all aspects. However, equality can sometimes mean treating people differently to achieve fairness. For example, affirmative action or providing safe spaces. So the gym's policy might be intended to address historical inequalities by giving women more opportunities to use the facilities without the presence of men, which some women might find intimidating or uncomfortable. The author is framing it as a restriction on men, but in reality, men aren't being restricted. The women-only section is an additional option for women, not a subtraction from men's access. \n\nThe girlfriend's response that \"it's different for women\" might be pointing out that societal contexts differ. Women may have different experiences and needs, hence the need for separate spaces. The author's analogy (if women had to pay the same but couldn't use part of the gym) is a thought experiment, but in reality, men aren't being excluded. The author is trying to apply equality principles, but might be missing the social context behind the women-only section. \n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? The argument hinges on whether the gym's policy is inherently sexist. If the policy is about providing equal access with special provisions for one gender, it's not necessarily sexist. The author's refusal to use the gym for that reason might be seen as not understanding the rationale behind the women-only section. Therefore, the author might be missing the point, which could mean he's in the wrong by not acknowledging the different needs and contexts that led to the creation of the women-only section.\n"
