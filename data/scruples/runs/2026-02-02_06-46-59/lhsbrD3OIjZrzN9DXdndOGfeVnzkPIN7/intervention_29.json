Recently my girlfriend suggested that I change over to her gym so we could carpool, workout together etc. Normally I would agree with this and be happy to go to the same gym as her, the problem is that her gym has a large \"**women only**\" section. The gym charges the same entrance fee for both men and women, but this section only allows women to use it and contains about 1/4 of the area of the gym and about 1/4 of the total workout equipment.\n\n I told my girlfriend that I didn't want to go to a gym that would charge someone 100% of the fee but only allow them to use 75% of the equipment because of their sex. When she said that I was being stupid about this I asked her if she would go to a gym that charged her the same as men, but forbid her from using a large portion of the equipment and area? She got upset at this, and said that \"*I just don't understand*\", and that \"*it's different for women*\".\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAm I being the asshole here and just not understanding?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the situation is in the wrong. The scenario is about a couple where the girlfriend wants them to go to the same gym, but the gym has a women-only section. The author is uncomfortable with paying the same fee but having access to only 75% of the equipment. He compares it to if the girlfriend were forbidden from using part of the gym, which she says is different.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze the key points. The author's concern is about fairness and equal access. He's not objecting to the women-only section itself but the fact that men can't access 25% of the gym's space and equipment, yet pay the same. His logic is that if the roles were reversed, he would find it sexist. The girlfriend, however, argues that it's different for women, implying that the women-only section serves a purpose for women that's not applicable to men.\n\nNow, considering whether the author is in the wrong. The main issue is whether his reasoning is valid. On one hand, the gym does charge the same fee for both genders, but men can't access the women-only section. The author's argument is about equal access for equal price. If a gym had a men-only section that women couldn't access, but charged the same, that would be a problem. So by that logic, the author is applying the same principle here. But the girlfriend's perspective is that the women-only section exists to accommodate women's needs, perhaps for comfort, safety, or other reasons. \n\nHowever, the core issue is that the gym is structuring its pricing and access in a way that effectively gives less value to men. If the fee is the same but access is restricted based on gender, that could be seen as discriminatory. The author is pointing out a potential inconsistency in how gender-based access is treated. The girlfriend's dismissal of his concern as being \"stupid\" might indicate a lack of empathy for his perspective, even if she has her own reasons for valuing the women-only section.\n\nOn the other hand, some might argue that the women-only section is a service provided to women, which the gym offers to attract a broader customer base. Therefore, the value proposition isn't necessarily the same for both genders, but the fee is uniform. However, if the fee is the same, then the value (access to equipment) should be proportionally considered. If men can't use a quarter of the equipment, they're effectively paying for something they can't use. That seems like a valid point from the author's side.\n\nThe girlfriend's reaction of being upset and saying \"it's different for women\" could be a dismissal of his valid concern. The author is trying to apply the same standard to both genders, which is a fair approach. The key is whether the gym's policy is inherently sexist. If the gym is charging the same fee but providing unequal access based on gender, that's a problem. The fact that the women-only section exists might be for reasons like safety or comfort, but if the fee is the same, the gym's structure could be seen as unfair to men in this case.\n\nSo, considering all this, the author is not in the wrong. His concern is about equal treatment and value for money. The girlfriend's dismissal might be the issue here. Therefore, the answer should be B (the author is not in the wrong).\n"
