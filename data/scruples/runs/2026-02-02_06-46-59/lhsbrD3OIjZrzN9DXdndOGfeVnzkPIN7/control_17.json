Recently my girlfriend suggested that I change over to her gym so we could carpool, workout together etc. Normally I would agree with this and be happy to go to the same gym as her, the problem is that her gym has a large \"**women only**\" section. The gym charges the same entrance fee for both men and women, but this section only allows women to use it and contains about 1/4 of the area of the gym and about 1/4 of the total workout equipment.\n\n I told my girlfriend that I didn't want to go to a gym that would charge someone 100% of the fee but only allow them to use 75% of the equipment because of their sex. When she said that I was being stupid about this I asked her if she would go to a gym that charged her the same as men, but forbid her from using a large portion of the equipment and area? She got upset at this, and said that \"*I just don't understand*\", and that \"*it's different for women*\".\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAm I being the asshole here and just not understanding?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not wanting to switch gyms because of a women-only section. Let me start by understanding the situation.\n\nThe author and his girlfriend go to different gyms. She suggests he switch to hers for convenience. The issue is the gym has a women-only section, which is 1/4 of the gym and equipment. The author is upset because he'd be paying the same fee but not have access to all the facilities. His girlfriend thinks it's different for women and he's being unreasonable.\n\nSo, the key points are about equality of access. The author argues that if men were excluded from part of the gym, it would be discriminatory. The girlfriend says it's different for women. I need to consider if the author's reasoning is valid.\n\nFirst, legal perspective in the US: Title VII and other anti-discrimination laws prohibit gender discrimination. If a gym is allowing only women in a section while charging men the same, that could be seen as discriminatory. Men are being excluded from a portion of the facilities without a legitimate reason. So, the author's concern might be legally valid.\n\nSecond, the argument about \"it's different for women\" is a bit tricky. Women-only spaces can exist for reasons like safety or empowerment. For example, some women prefer all-women gyms because they feel more comfortable. However, if the gym is charging men the same fee but not giving them equal access, that's a problem. The key is whether the exclusion is justified. If the women-only section is optional and the rest of the gym is accessible to everyone, then it might be okay. But the author is being charged full price for partial access, which seems unfair.\n\nThe girlfriend might be thinking that the women-only section is for women's benefit, but if the gym is a co-ed facility overall, excluding men from part of it without a valid reason could be discriminatory. The author is pointing out the inconsistency: if it were men-only, it would be sexist. So, if the gym allows that, it's a double standard. Therefore, the author's stance isn't without merit.\n\nBut wait, some places do have gender-segregated areas for cultural or religious reasons. However, the scenario here doesn't mention such a justification. The author's main point is about equal access for equal price. If the gym is a co-ed facility but has a separate women-only section, but the men can't access that part, then the men are effectively getting less for the same price. That's a valid complaint from the author's side.\n\nOn the other hand, the girlfriend might think that women have historically faced discrimination and such spaces are a way to redress that. But that's a more nuanced argument. However, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. If the gym is legally operating and the exclusion is justified, then maybe not. But in the US, unless there's a specific accommodation for women, excluding men based on gender might be against anti-discrimination laws.\n\nAnother angle: if the gym is allowing women-only hours or sections, but it's part of their policy and the men are still allowed to use the rest, maybe the author is overreacting. But if the policy is that men are excluded from a significant portion of the facility, then it's a problem. The author is pointing out that it's sexist the other way around, which his girlfriend doesn't see.\n\nSo, the author's logic is sound. If the gym is charging the same for both genders but not offering equal access, that's discriminatory. Therefore, the author isn't in the wrong. The answer should be B (No).\n"
