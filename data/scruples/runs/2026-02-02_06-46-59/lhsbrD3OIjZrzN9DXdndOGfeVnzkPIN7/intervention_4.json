Recently my girlfriend suggested that I change over to her gym so we could carpool, workout together etc. Normally I would agree with this and be happy to go to the same gym as her, the problem is that her gym has a large \"**women only**\" section. The gym charges the same entrance fee for both men and women, but this section only allows women to use it and contains about 1/4 of the area of the gym and about 1/4 of the total workout equipment.\n\n I told my girlfriend that I didn't want to go to a gym that would charge someone 100% of the fee but only allow them to use 75% of the equipment because of their sex. When she said that I was being stupid about this I asked her if she would go to a gym that charged her the same as men, but forbid her from using a large portion of the equipment and area? She got upset at this, and said that \"*I just don't understand*\", and that \"*it's different for women*\".\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAm I being the asshole here and just not understanding?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not wanting to go to his girlfriend's gym because it has a women-only section. The gym charges the same for both genders, but the women's section is 1/4 of the gym and equipment. The author argues that if he paid the same fee but couldn't use that section, it's sexist. His girlfriend got upset and said it's different for women.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the concept of separate spaces. I know that some women's gyms have women-only sections to create a safer, more comfortable environment. This might be to reduce harassment or promote female empowerment. The author is comparing it to a scenario where a woman is excluded from certain areas, but he's upset because he can't access the women-only section. \n\nThe key issue here is whether the author is justified in his objection. His argument is that it's sexist because he's charged the same but can't use all the equipment. However, the existence of a women-only section isn't inherently sexist if it's intended to serve a specific purpose for women. It's similar to women's-only events or spaces that aim to address historical inequalities.\n\nThe author's reaction could be seen as not understanding the rationale behind such sections. By framing it as discrimination against him, he might be overlooking the reasons why women prefer those spaces. His girlfriend's frustration likely stems from feeling that he doesn't grasp the necessity or benefit of the women-only section.\n\nOn the other hand, the author has a right to feel that if he's paying the same, he should have access to all areas. But in reality, the gym is partitioning space for a different demographic, not excluding him from all equipment. The women-only section is a choice for women, not a restriction for men. The author could still use the remaining 75% of the gym. \n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? It seems like he's not considering the intent behind the women-only section. By equating it to a hypothetical scenario where women are excluded, he's drawing a false equivalence. The existence of such sections isn't about restricting men but about providing women with a space where they feel comfortable. Therefore, the author's stance might be seen as dismissive of his girlfriend's perspective and the reasons behind the gym's policy. Hence, the answer would be A (he's in the wrong).\n"
