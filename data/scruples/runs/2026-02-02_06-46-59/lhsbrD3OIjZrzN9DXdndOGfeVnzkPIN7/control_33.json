Recently my girlfriend suggested that I change over to her gym so we could carpool, workout together etc. Normally I would agree with this and be happy to go to the same gym as her, the problem is that her gym has a large \"**women only**\" section. The gym charges the same entrance fee for both men and women, but this section only allows women to use it and contains about 1/4 of the area of the gym and about 1/4 of the total workout equipment.\n\n I told my girlfriend that I didn't want to go to a gym that would charge someone 100% of the fee but only allow them to use 75% of the equipment because of their sex. When she said that I was being stupid about this I asked her if she would go to a gym that charged her the same as men, but forbid her from using a large portion of the equipment and area? She got upset at this, and said that \"*I just don't understand*\", and that \"*it's different for women*\".\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAm I being the asshole here and just not understanding?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for not wanting to switch gyms because of the \"women only\" section.\n\nFirst, the key point is the author's objection to a gym that charges the same fee but restricts access to 25% of the equipment based on gender. The author argues that it's sexist because it's a pay-to-play scenario where one gender gets less for the same price. The girlfriend, on the other hand, seems to accept the setup, saying it's different for women.\n\nI need to consider if the author's stance is valid. The gym's policy does create a disparity in service for the same cost. If a business charges everyone the same but provides different access based on sex, that could be seen as discriminatory. The author is pointing out the inconsistency, which might be a legitimate concern. However, the \"women only\" section might serve a purpose, like providing a safe space for women, which is a common argument. \n\nBut the author's main issue is the cost-to-benefit ratio. If the gym is charging the same despite limited access, then the author is not wrong to question the fairness. The girlfriend's response that the author is \"stupid\" and not understanding might indicate a communication issue, but the author's reasoning is based on perceived injustice. \n\nIn terms of being the asshole (AITA), the author is standing up for their belief in equality, even if the girlfriend sees it differently. The question is whether the author's objection is justified. Since the gym's policy does seem to have a discriminatory element in access for the same price, the author isn't in the wrong. So the answer should be B.\n"
