Recently my girlfriend suggested that I change over to her gym so we could carpool, workout together etc. Normally I would agree with this and be happy to go to the same gym as her, the problem is that her gym has a large \"**women only**\" section. The gym charges the same entrance fee for both men and women, but this section only allows women to use it and contains about 1/4 of the area of the gym and about 1/4 of the total workout equipment.\n\n I told my girlfriend that I didn't want to go to a gym that would charge someone 100% of the fee but only allow them to use 75% of the equipment because of their sex. When she said that I was being stupid about this I asked her if she would go to a gym that charged her the same as men, but forbid her from using a large portion of the equipment and area? She got upset at this, and said that \"*I just don't understand*\", and that \"*it's different for women*\".\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAm I being the asshole here and just not understanding?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author (ITA) is in the wrong for not wanting to switch gyms because of the \"women only\" section.\n\nFirst, the situation: Both the author and his girlfriend work out, and she suggested they both go to her gym. The gym has a section exclusively for women. The author objects because he feels it's unfair that he'd pay the same fee but only have access to 75% of the equipment. His girlfriend dismisses his concern as being \"stupid\" and says it's different for women.\n\nSo, the core issue here is about perceived gender-based discrimination. The author is comparing his situation to how a woman would feel if the tables were turned. He's pointing out the inconsistency in the gym's policy, which charges everyone the same but restricts access based on gender. \n\nThe girlfriend's response is that it's different for women, which might stem from her perspective that women-only spaces are beneficial or necessary for various reasons (like comfort, safety, etc.). However, the author argues that from his point of view, it's a form of sexism because it's limiting access based on gender without a corresponding benefit.\n\nNow, considering fairness and equality. If the gym charges the same fee regardless of gender but restricts equipment access based on gender, that's a form of discrimination. The author is highlighting that same issue. The girlfriend might be defending the policy because she sees it as empowering women, but from the author's perspective, it's unfair to him. \n\nIs the author in the wrong? Well, his argument is based on the principle of equal access for equal payment. If the gym isn't allowing him to use all the equipment because he's male, that's a problem. His girlfriend's dismissal of his concern as being \"stupid\" suggests she doesn't see it as discrimination against men. But the author is trying to draw a parallel to how women might feel if they were excluded from certain areas. \n\nIn terms of ethics, if the gym is indeed charging the same fee but restricting access based on gender, then the author has a valid point. However, if the \"women only\" section is a temporary or time-based arrangement (like certain hours), it might be different. The problem here is the gym's policy as described. The author is standing by his belief in equal access, which is reasonable. \n\nThe girlfriend's reaction seems dismissive, which might indicate she's not considering his perspective. But the question is whether the author is in the wrong. Since he's pointing out a potential inconsistency in the gym's policy regarding gender, and given that the policy affects his access, he's not in the wrong for expressing that concern. \n\nTherefore, the answer is B\u2014the author is not in the wrong.\n"
