Recently my girlfriend suggested that I change over to her gym so we could carpool, workout together etc. Normally I would agree with this and be happy to go to the same gym as her, the problem is that her gym has a large \"**women only**\" section. The gym charges the same entrance fee for both men and women, but this section only allows women to use it and contains about 1/4 of the area of the gym and about 1/4 of the total workout equipment.\n\n I told my girlfriend that I didn't want to go to a gym that would charge someone 100% of the fee but only allow them to use 75% of the equipment because of their sex. When she said that I was being stupid about this I asked her if she would go to a gym that charged her the same as men, but forbid her from using a large portion of the equipment and area? She got upset at this, and said that \"*I just don't understand*\", and that \"*it's different for women*\".\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAm I being the asshole here and just not understanding?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about a couple who both go to the gym, but the girlfriend's gym has a women-only section. The author is uncomfortable with going there because he thinks it's sexist. The girlfriend suggests they carpool and work out together, but the author objects because he feels it's unfair that men can't access the women-only section, even though they pay the same fee. The girlfriend gets upset when he questions her stance on the matter.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the concept of single-gender spaces. In many contexts, like locker rooms or prisons, there are separate facilities for men and women for privacy and safety reasons. However, in a commercial setting like a gym, does the same logic apply? The user argues that it's discriminatory because men pay the same but can't use part of the equipment. The girlfriend counters that it's different for women. \n\nThe key here is whether the women-only section is considered a separate service or an enhancement for women. If the gym is charging the same fee but restricting access based on gender, that could be seen as discriminatory against men. However, if the women's section is an exclusive area that women can use without male presence, some might argue it's a benefit for women, especially in a culture where women might feel uncomfortable in mixed-gender gyms. \n\nBut from a legal standpoint, in the US, Title VII of the Civil Rights Act prohibits gender discrimination in employment, but it's less clear about public accommodations. The Supreme Court case Heart of Atlanta Motel v. U.S. says that businesses can make reasonable exceptions for single-sex services, like restrooms. However, a gym's women-only section might be considered a special service that women can opt into, not a restriction on men's access. So the gym isn't necessarily violating anti-discrimination laws here.\n\nThe author's argument is that if women can't use the men's section (hypothetically), then men shouldn't be able to use the women's section. But the problem is that the author is not being asked to exclude any area; he's being excluded from the women's section. The fairness might be different because the women's section isn't open to men, but men have their own areas. The author is complaining about not being able to access a specific part, but not that his access to other areas is restricted.\n\nMoreover, the girlfriend's frustration might stem from her perception that the author isn't understanding the reasons why women might value the women-only space. It could be for safety, harassment prevention, or a more comfortable environment. If the author dismisses her perspective as \"being stupid,\" that could be where the conflict arises. However, the author is also trying to point out a perceived inconsistency in the gym's policy.\n\nSo, is the author wrong? If he's raising a valid point about unequal access based on gender, but the gym's policy is within legal bounds, then maybe he's not in the wrong. However, if his argument comes across as not respecting his girlfriend's needs or the reasons behind the women-only section, that could make him the asshole. But the question is whether he's in the wrong for not wanting to go to the gym because of the policy, not how he communicated it. \n\nIn terms of the policy itself, if the gym is providing a service (women-only section) that's optional, then it's not inherently sexist. However, if the policy leads to discrimination against men by charging the same fee for less access, it's a point of contention. The author's stance is that it's unfair, but the gym's policy is legal. Therefore, the author isn't necessarily wrong, but the girlfriend might have valid reasons for her position. \n\nSo the answer would be B (No, the author is not in the wrong) because his objection is based on a legitimate concern about equal access, and the gym's policy isn't illegal. The conflict arises more from differing perspectives on gender equity rather than the author being in the wrong.\n"
