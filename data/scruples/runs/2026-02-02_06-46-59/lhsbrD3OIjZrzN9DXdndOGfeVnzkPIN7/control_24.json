Recently my girlfriend suggested that I change over to her gym so we could carpool, workout together etc. Normally I would agree with this and be happy to go to the same gym as her, the problem is that her gym has a large \"**women only**\" section. The gym charges the same entrance fee for both men and women, but this section only allows women to use it and contains about 1/4 of the area of the gym and about 1/4 of the total workout equipment.\n\n I told my girlfriend that I didn't want to go to a gym that would charge someone 100% of the fee but only allow them to use 75% of the equipment because of their sex. When she said that I was being stupid about this I asked her if she would go to a gym that charged her the same as men, but forbid her from using a large portion of the equipment and area? She got upset at this, and said that \"*I just don't understand*\", and that \"*it's different for women*\".\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAm I being the asshole here and just not understanding?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is that the author's girlfriend suggested they both go to her gym to carpool and work out together. The problem is that her gym has a \"women only\" section, which makes the author feel it's sexist. He argues that paying the same fee but having less access because of gender is unfair. The girlfriend thinks he's being unreasonable and says it's different for women.\n\nHmm. So the key points here are about equality and perspective. The author is objecting to a policy that seems discriminatory because it's giving men less access. The girlfriend is defending it, possibly understanding it as providing a safe space for women. But is the author wrong for not wanting to accept a policy that treats him unequally based on his gender?\n\nI need to consider the concept of equal treatment. If a business charges the same price but offers different access based on gender, that's generally considered discriminatory. The author is pointing out the inconsistency. On the other hand, the women-only section is meant to provide a safer environment for women, which is a common practice in some gyms. However, the author is being charged the same rate but gets less access. That's the crux of the issue.\n\nThe girlfriend's response that it's \"different for women\" might imply that she believes women have a right to that space, but the author is being penalized for it. The question is whether the author is in the wrong by not accepting this arrangement. From a fairness standpoint, if the gym treats different genders differently in terms of access without a justifiable reason, that could be problematic. However, the women-only section might have a valid purpose, but the fact that it's costing the author more in terms of access without a price difference is the issue.\n\nSo, is the author's objection valid? He's pointing out a disparity in access based on gender, which is a legitimate concern. The girlfriend might not see it that way because she benefits from the women-only section. But from the author's perspective, it's unfair. Therefore, the author isn't in the wrong for objecting to a policy that's discriminatory towards him.\n"
