Recently my girlfriend suggested that I change over to her gym so we could carpool, workout together etc. Normally I would agree with this and be happy to go to the same gym as her, the problem is that her gym has a large \"**women only**\" section. The gym charges the same entrance fee for both men and women, but this section only allows women to use it and contains about 1/4 of the area of the gym and about 1/4 of the total workout equipment.\n\n I told my girlfriend that I didn't want to go to a gym that would charge someone 100% of the fee but only allow them to use 75% of the equipment because of their sex. When she said that I was being stupid about this I asked her if she would go to a gym that charged her the same as men, but forbid her from using a large portion of the equipment and area? She got upset at this, and said that \"*I just don't understand*\", and that \"*it's different for women*\".\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAm I being the asshole here and just not understanding?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is that the girlfriend wants them to go to her gym, which has a women-only section. The author is uncomfortable with the idea because of the gender-based separation and the fact that men can't access a portion of the gym even though they pay the same fee.\n\nFirst, the author's main argument is about fairness. They're saying that if a gym charges the same fee but restricts access to equipment based on gender, that's discriminatory. That makes sense because, in general, equal access is a key part of non-discrimination. If a gym is separating members by gender and limiting what they can use, that seems like a form of sexism, especially if the justification isn't clear or valid.\n\nThe girlfriend's perspective is that it's different for women, which is confusing. Maybe she believes that women-only spaces are necessary for some reason, like comfort or safety. Some gyms offer women-only areas to provide a more welcoming environment where women feel safe without male presence. But then, if the gym is charging men the same but they can't use those areas, that could be seen as unequal treatment. The author is pointing out the inconsistency: if a man were barred from using a large portion of the gym, that would be considered discriminatory. So why isn't the reverse also true?\n\nThe girlfriend's reaction of getting upset and saying the author doesn't understand might indicate that she sees the women-only section as a positive feature, perhaps due to her own experiences or needs. However, the author's stance is about equity\u2014equal treatment for all genders. The key question here is whether the gym's policy is fair and non-discriminatory. If the gym is providing a women-only section as a choice while allowing men to use the rest, that's different from forcing men to pay for access they can't have. But if the gym is charging men the same fee yet restricting their access, that could be problematic.\n\nLegally, in many places, public accommodations must be accessible to all without discrimination. However, some exceptions might exist for women-only spaces if they're considered a form of affirmative action or support for women. But if the gym is using the same pricing and the women-only section is a significant portion (like 25% of the equipment), it might create an inequity for men paying the same fee but not having access to all areas. The author is highlighting this potential inequity, which could be seen as a valid concern.\n\nThe girlfriend's response that it's \"different for women\" without a clear explanation might be a sign of her not recognizing the potential sexism in the policy. The author is pointing out the inconsistency in how equality is applied, which isn't being received well. The author isn't necessarily being an asshole for standing by their principles; they're addressing a real issue of equity. The girlfriend might be in the wrong for not acknowledging the author's valid concern and dismissing it as being \"stupid.\"\n\nSo considering all that, the author isn't in the wrong. Their argument is based on principles of equality and fairness. The girlfriend's gym policy could be problematic if it leads to unequal access despite equal fees. The author's refusal to go to that gym because of it is a reasonable stance, not an asshole move.\n"
