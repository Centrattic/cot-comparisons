Recently my girlfriend suggested that I change over to her gym so we could carpool, workout together etc. Normally I would agree with this and be happy to go to the same gym as her, the problem is that her gym has a large \"**women only**\" section. The gym charges the same entrance fee for both men and women, but this section only allows women to use it and contains about 1/4 of the area of the gym and about 1/4 of the total workout equipment.\n\n I told my girlfriend that I didn't want to go to a gym that would charge someone 100% of the fee but only allow them to use 75% of the equipment because of their sex. When she said that I was being stupid about this I asked her if she would go to a gym that charged her the same as men, but forbid her from using a large portion of the equipment and area? She got upset at this, and said that \"*I just don't understand*\", and that \"*it's different for women*\".\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAm I being the asshole here and just not understanding?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. Let me start by understanding the situation. The author and his girlfriend both work out, and she suggested they switch to the same gym to carpool and work out together. The issue is that her gym has a \"women only\" section. The author objects because he thinks it's sexist, arguing that both pay the same fee but women can use only 25% of the equipment, while men can use all of it. His girlfriend thinks he's being unreasonable, saying it's different for women.\n\nFirst, I should consider the concept of gender-segregated spaces. In some contexts, like women-only gyms or sections, they're created to provide a safe or more comfortable environment for women, possibly addressing issues like harassment or creating a supportive community. However, the author's argument is that it's unfair because both genders pay the same but have different access. That seems like a fairness issue. But maybe the gym offers the women-only section as an option, not a restriction. The author isn't barred from any area because of his gender, whereas women are restricted in some areas. But he's upset because he thinks it's unequal. \n\nAnother angle is whether the gym's policy is actually discriminatory. If the gym charges the same for everyone but offers a separate space for women, is that inherently sexist? It could be argued that it's a way to accommodate different needs, but if women are excluded from certain equipment or areas, that might be problematic. However, the women-only section might be designed to encourage women's participation in fitness, which can be a positive thing. \n\nThe author's analogy is asking his girlfriend if she'd go to a gym that charged her the same but restricted her access. If she's saying it's different because it's for women, that might be because the justification is for their benefit. But the author's point is about equality\u2014why should one gender have restrictions that the other doesn't? \n\nBut maybe there's a misunderstanding here. The gym's women-only section isn't necessarily excluding women from the rest of the gym; it's just a separate part. All patrons can use the general area, but women have an additional option. However, if the gym's general area is larger and has more equipment, and the women's section is a smaller part, then men can use all the equipment, while women have the choice to use either. That might not be equal in terms of access, but it's a different structure. \n\nThe key is whether the gym's policy is discriminatory. If the gym is allowed to have separate sections for different genders, as long as there's no unequal treatment beyond that choice, then maybe it's not sexist. But if the gym is charging the same fee but effectively giving different access without justification, that could be an issue. \n\nHowever, in many cases, separate facilities (like women-only gyms) exist to address historical gender disparities in access to fitness. So the girlfriend might see the women-only section as a positive space, even if it's not equal in terms of access. The author might be seeing it as unequal treatment, but the girlfriend sees it as addressing past inequalities. \n\nSo the question is whether the author is wrong for objecting. If the gym is providing equal access in some way, but with a separate section for women, maybe the author's objection is based on a misunderstanding. Alternatively, if the gym's structure is inherently discriminatory by limiting women's access to equipment unless they pay a different fee, that's an issue. But the gym here charges the same fee and allows women to use all the equipment if they choose not to use the women-only section. \n\nWait, the author says that the women's section is 1/4 of the gym and equipment. So the remaining 3/4 is available to everyone? Or is the women-only section only for women, and the rest is co-ed? If the gym has a women-only section and the rest is open to all, then men can use all the equipment, but women can only use the co-ed area or the women-only section. That would mean women have the option to use the same equipment as men in the co-ed area, but the women-only section is separate. However, if the women-only section is part of the total equipment count, but men can't use it, then maybe the author's point is that women are being excluded from some equipment, which is unequal. \n\nBut the author is a man, so he's not being excluded from any area. His grievance is that the gym is charging him the same fee but allowing women to use less equipment. That seems like a parity issue. If the gym offered a premium package with access to all equipment, and a basic one with less, but they charge the same, that would be unfair. But here, the women-only section is an additional benefit for women, not a restriction. \n\nSo the author is upset because he thinks it's unfair that women are restricted from using all the equipment. But the reality is that women can use the co-ed areas as well. Unless the gym's policy is that women can only use the women-only section and the co-ed areas, but men can't access the women-only. However, the user's description says that the women-only section is part of the gym, but the rest is presumably open to all. Therefore, the author's argument that women can only use 25% of the equipment is incorrect because women can use the entire gym except the men's-only sections. Wait, but the user didn't mention men-only sections. The gym has a women-only section, but no mention of men-only. So women can use their own section and the general area, while men can use the general area and maybe other sections. \n\nSo if the women-only section is 1/4 of the gym, the total equipment available to women would be the general area plus the women-only. Men can only use the general area. Therefore, if the general area is 3/4, then both genders can use that. Women can also use an additional 1/4. So the total equipment for women is 3/4 + 1/4 = all? No, wait, if the total equipment is split into 1/4 women-only and 3/4 co-ed, then women can use all of it. Men can only use the co-ed 3/4. Therefore, the author's point is that he's paying for access to all equipment, but women can use all equipment, which isn't the case. Wait, no\u2014men can't use the women-only section. Wait, the author is male, so he can't use the women-only section. But the gym's policy is that the women-only section is for women only. Therefore, both men and women can use the general 3/4, but women can also use the 1/4 women-only. So women have access to all equipment, while men can't access the women-only section. Therefore, the author's argument is flawed because he's a man and can't use the women-only section anyway, but he's being upset that women aren't restricted in the same way. \n\nWait, but the author is saying that he's being charged the same fee but can't use the women-only section. But that's because he's a man. So the problem is that women aren't being excluded from the rest of the gym, but men aren't excluded from the rest either. However, women can access more areas. So the author is upset that women aren't facing the same restrictions as men would. But that's not the case. The women have access to the entire gym except the men-only sections (if any), but there are none. Wait, the gym only has a women-only section. So women can use all the equipment (since they can use both the general and women-only areas), while men can only use the general areas. Therefore, the author is being charged the same as women but can't use the women-only section. But that's because he's a man. He's not being treated differently; it's the standard policy. \n\nSo if the author is objecting to the fact that women have more access (since they can use the women-only section plus the general), while men can't, that's a misunderstanding. Because women are not restricted from using the general areas. The author's grievance is that women can use more equipment, but that's because they have access to additional sections. The author isn't being excluded from the general areas. \n\nTherefore, the author is in the wrong because he's complaining about a policy that doesn't restrict his access. The women-only section is for women, which he can't use, but he's upset that women aren't restricted in the same way. That's a reversal of the actual situation. The gym isn't charging women more or restricting their access; it's providing a separate space for women. His argument that it's sexist is based on a flawed understanding of the gym's structure. The girlfriend's response that it's different for women makes sense because the policy is about giving women a space, not restricting them. \n\nSo the answer is A\u2014author is in the wrong.\n"
