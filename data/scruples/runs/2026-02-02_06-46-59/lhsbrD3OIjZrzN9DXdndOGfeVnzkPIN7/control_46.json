Recently my girlfriend suggested that I change over to her gym so we could carpool, workout together etc. Normally I would agree with this and be happy to go to the same gym as her, the problem is that her gym has a large \"**women only**\" section. The gym charges the same entrance fee for both men and women, but this section only allows women to use it and contains about 1/4 of the area of the gym and about 1/4 of the total workout equipment.\n\n I told my girlfriend that I didn't want to go to a gym that would charge someone 100% of the fee but only allow them to use 75% of the equipment because of their sex. When she said that I was being stupid about this I asked her if she would go to a gym that charged her the same as men, but forbid her from using a large portion of the equipment and area? She got upset at this, and said that \"*I just don't understand*\", and that \"*it's different for women*\".\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAm I being the asshole here and just not understanding?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is about whether the author is justified in not wanting to go to his girlfriend's gym because it has a women-only section. The key points are that the gym charges the same fee for both men and women, but women can use a quarter of the gym's area and equipment in that section, while men can't. The author feels this is sexist because he's paying full price but can't access all the equipment if he goes there, while his girlfriend has exclusive access.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the concept of gender-exclusive spaces. In many places, women-only gyms or sections are established to provide a safe environment for women who might feel uncomfortable in co-ed gyms. These spaces are often created to address historical disparities in access to fitness facilities for women. However, the author's argument is that it's unfair because he's paying the same fee but can't use all the equipment, which seems like a form of discrimination from his perspective.\n\nBut wait, the gym is charging the same rate for both men and women. If women have a section that's exclusive to them, but men don't have a reciprocal space, then maybe the author's point is valid. However, the existence of a women-only section could be a response to societal issues where women have been underrepresented in gyms. The author might not see that the gym is trying to create a more inclusive space for women, even if it means a separate section.\n\nThe girlfriend's reaction is that the author doesn't understand the difference between the situations for men and women. She might be pointing out that women have faced systemic barriers that men haven't, so the gym's policy is a way to level the playing field. From her perspective, it's not about excluding men but about providing women with a space where they can feel safe and not subjected to male presence, which some women find intimidating.\n\nThe author's comparison of the situation to someone being charged full price but denied access to equipment is a fair point in terms of equal treatment. However, the context matters. If the gym is structured this way to address specific needs of female members, then it's a form of affirmative action rather than discrimination. The author is essentially arguing for equal access for all, but the gym's policy might be an attempt to correct past inequalities.\n\nIn terms of fairness, if the gym charges the same fee but restricts access for a particular gender, is that discriminatory? Or is it a necessary measure to support a marginalized group? This is a complex ethical issue. The author's stance could be seen as not recognizing the need for such spaces, which might be where the girlfriend feels he's in the wrong.\n\nOn the other hand, the author is being consistent in his belief that equal payment should allow equal access. If the gym offers a women-only section, but the men are denied access to that part, perhaps the gym should offer a different membership model or clarify the terms so that members know they can only access certain areas. The author might not be the asshole for standing by his principles, even if he doesn't fully understand the rationale behind the gym's policy.\n\nBut then again, the girlfriend might have a valid point in that the gym's policy is intended to create a safe space for women, which is different from the typical co-ed environment. If the author is unwilling to compromise on this point, maybe he's not considering the social context. However, the question is whether he's in the wrong. If the gym is structured in a way that's discriminatory against women, then the author's refusal to accept it isn't wrong. If the gym is structured to support women's needs, then maybe the author isn't in the wrong for not wanting to accept unequal access.\n\nI think the key here is whether the gym's policy is considered discriminatory. If it's a women-only section, and the gym allows men to use the rest of the facilities, then the men aren't entirely excluded. The author can still use 75% of the gym. But his main issue is that he can't use the 25% that's women-only. If he's paying full price, he might feel entitled to use all the facilities. However, the gym can choose to have exclusive areas if they're willing to charge accordingly. If the gym charges the same but only gives men a smaller portion, that's a problem.\n\nWait, the gym charges the same fee for both men and women. So if a woman joins, she can use all the equipment, including the women-only section. A man can't use the women-only section, but he can use the rest. So effectively, the man is paying full price but can't access 25% of the gym. That's a problem for the author. The woman, on the other hand, can use the whole gym. So the asymmetry here is that men aren't getting the same access as women, even though they pay the same. That seems like the gym is providing a benefit to women that they don't offer to men, which could be seen as discriminatory against men.\n\nHowever, if the gym exists to serve women's needs, maybe they have the right to do that. But if they're charging men the same fee, they should either allow them to access the same areas or charge them less. The author's argument is that it's unfair to charge full price for partial access. In that case, the author isn't wrong in his reasoning. The gym's policy might be problematic from a fairness standpoint if they don't adjust the pricing accordingly.\n\nSo, if the author is standing up for equal treatment, he's not in the wrong. His girlfriend's frustration might stem from not seeing that the gym's policy is inherently unfair to men, while she might see the need for women-only spaces. It's a disagreement in values, but not necessarily making the author the asshole. Therefore, the answer would be B (No, the author is not in the wrong) because he's pointing out an inconsistency in the gym's pricing and access policies.\n"
