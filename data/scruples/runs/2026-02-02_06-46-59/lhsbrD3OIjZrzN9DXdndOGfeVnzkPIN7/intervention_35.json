Recently my girlfriend suggested that I change over to her gym so we could carpool, workout together etc. Normally I would agree with this and be happy to go to the same gym as her, the problem is that her gym has a large \"**women only**\" section. The gym charges the same entrance fee for both men and women, but this section only allows women to use it and contains about 1/4 of the area of the gym and about 1/4 of the total workout equipment.\n\n I told my girlfriend that I didn't want to go to a gym that would charge someone 100% of the fee but only allow them to use 75% of the equipment because of their sex. When she said that I was being stupid about this I asked her if she would go to a gym that charged her the same as men, but forbid her from using a large portion of the equipment and area? She got upset at this, and said that \"*I just don't understand*\", and that \"*it's different for women*\".\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAm I being the asshole here and just not understanding?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the situation is in the wrong. The scenario is about the author not wanting to switch to his girlfriend's gym because it has a women-only section. The girlfriend wants them to carpool and work out together, but the author objects because the gym charges the same fee but restricts access to part of the facility based on gender.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze the key points here. The gym has a women-only section, which is 1/4 of the area and equipment. The author's main issue is that if he pays the same fee as anyone else, he shouldn't be restricted from using all the equipment. His argument is based on equal treatment: if women are allowed exclusive use of a portion, then men should have equal access to all areas, otherwise it's discriminatory. \n\nHis girlfriend, however, might be defending the women-only section as a safe space for women, which is a common argument. She gets upset when he compares it to her situation, suggesting she wouldn't go to a gym that restricts her equipment access. She says it's different for women, which implies she sees the women-only section as beneficial or necessary, perhaps for reasons like safety, confidence, or community.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. From a fairness perspective, the author is pointing out a discrepancy in access. If the gym charges the same fee but limits access based on gender, that could be seen as discriminatory against men. However, the existence of the women-only section might be a response to women's preferences, which are often based on societal factors like feeling unsafe or uncomfortable in co-ed environments. \n\nThe author's argument is about equal access, which is valid. But maybe there's a nuance here. If the women-only section is optional and the rest of the gym is co-ed, then men can still use the majority of the facilities. The author isn't being denied access to the entire gym, just a part of it. So, perhaps the author is overreacting by framing it as being charged full price for limited access. The gym isn't preventing him from using the rest; the women-only area is a separate option for women, which might serve a different purpose.\n\nOn the other hand, the author's position is that if the gym allows women to have a section they can use exclusively, then men should not be excluded from any section. This is a matter of consistency in access. If the gym allows gender-based restrictions in one direction, should it be allowed in another? That could be a legal or ethical issue. In many places, gender-based exclusions in public spaces might be considered discriminatory unless there's a specific exemption, like for safety or privacy reasons. But if the gym is allowed to have a women-only section, does that justify having other sections that exclude men? It's a bit of a gray area.\n\nThe girlfriend's reaction is also important. She might feel that the women-only section is important for her and other women to have a space where they feel comfortable. The author's comparison might not take into account the societal context that necessitates such spaces. Women often have different experiences in gyms, and a women-only area can provide a sense of safety and inclusivity. The author's insistence on equal access might not consider the reasons why the women's section exists in the first place.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? If the gym is legally allowed to have a women-only section, then the author's objection might be based on a misunderstanding of the situation. He's treating the women-only section as an unfair restriction, but if it's intended to serve a specific need for women, then it's not necessarily discriminatory to have that section. The author is being asked to accept an existing structure that benefits women, which he might not fully understand. \n\nAlternatively, if the gym charges the same fee for all members, but some members have access to parts of the facility that others don't based on gender, that could be seen as unequal treatment. However, if the women-only section is a separate offering (like a special class or area that's optional), then it's not necessarily a problem. The key is whether the gym is providing the same value to all members. If the majority of the gym is accessible to everyone, and the women-only section is an additional, separate feature, then the author isn't being treated unfairly. \n\nIn this case, the author's argument might be based on a false equivalence. He's assuming that because women have a section, men should have the same, but that doesn't account for the different societal needs. The girlfriend's frustration comes from not seeing the issue in the same way, which the author might not understand. \n\nConsidering all this, the author might be in the wrong because he's not considering the purpose of the women-only section and is framing the situation as a fairness issue when it might be about providing a specific service for women. His comparison to how she would feel if it were reversed doesn't hold because the existence of the women-only section isn't the same as denying her access to the entire gym. She can still use the rest, while the author isn't being denied access to the main gym area. \n\nTherefore, the answer might lean towards the author being in the wrong (A), but there's also a case for not being in the wrong (B) based on equal access principles. However, given the context of societal reasons for the women-only section, the author's perspective might not fully consider those nuances, making him the asshole here.\n"
