Recently my girlfriend suggested that I change over to her gym so we could carpool, workout together etc. Normally I would agree with this and be happy to go to the same gym as her, the problem is that her gym has a large \"**women only**\" section. The gym charges the same entrance fee for both men and women, but this section only allows women to use it and contains about 1/4 of the area of the gym and about 1/4 of the total workout equipment.\n\n I told my girlfriend that I didn't want to go to a gym that would charge someone 100% of the fee but only allow them to use 75% of the equipment because of their sex. When she said that I was being stupid about this I asked her if she would go to a gym that charged her the same as men, but forbid her from using a large portion of the equipment and area? She got upset at this, and said that \"*I just don't understand*\", and that \"*it's different for women*\".\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAm I being the asshole here and just not understanding?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. So the question is whether the author is in the wrong for not wanting to switch to his girlfriend's gym because of the women-only section.\n\nFirst, let me understand the situation. The author and his girlfriend both work out, but at different gyms. She wants him to switch to hers so they can carpool and work out together. The issue is that her gym has a women-only section that takes up a quarter of the gym and equipment. The author is upset because he'd be paying the same fee but not using the women-only part. He compares it to if she had to pay full fee but couldn't use a portion, which she counters by saying it's different for women.\n\nSo, the author's argument is about fairness. He thinks it's sexist because men can't access that section, so he's paying full price for less. The girlfriend thinks it's different for women, maybe because women-only spaces are intended to provide a safe or inclusive environment, which is different from excluding men. \n\nI need to consider both sides. On one hand, the author is making a logical point about equal payment for equal access. If women-only sections exist, then men aren't getting the same access, which could be seen as discriminatory. But maybe the gym's policy is to create a space for women, which is a different form of segregation aimed at inclusion. However, in that case, the gym isn't charging women more, but men are effectively paying for a space they can't use. \n\nWait, the author is paying the same fee but not using part of the facility. If the gym charges everyone the same, but some part is restricted based on gender, that could be seen as discriminatory against men. But maybe the women-only section is there to address historical underrepresentation, giving women a space to feel comfortable. The question is whether that's a valid reason for the author to object.\n\nThe author is comparing his situation to his girlfriend's hypothetical situation. If she were excluded from a section but paid the same, he'd see it as unfair. But she argues it's different for women. Maybe she's saying that women-only spaces are necessary and not the same as excluding men. But the author's point is about equal access for all, regardless of gender. \n\nIs the author wrong for not accepting the gender-based segregation? If the gym is providing a service that's inclusive for women but excludes men, is that sexist? Or is it a form of positive discrimination that's acceptable? The author might be right in thinking that it's unequal treatment, but maybe the context matters. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the author is overreacting. If the women-only section is a small part of the gym, maybe the rest of the facilities are available to him. He's not being denied access to the entire gym, just a part. So maybe the issue is more about principle than practicality. The girlfriend might think that the women-only space is important for women's comfort and inclusivity, and that the author isn't respecting that. \n\nBut the author's argument is about paying for the gym but not using a portion. If the gym allows this, then it's a policy that the author finds discriminatory. However, if the gym is allowed to have such a policy, then the author's objection is valid. But maybe the author is expecting his girlfriend to change her gym's policy, which isn't necessarily feasible. \n\nSo, the author's position is that it's sexist because it's unequal access. The girlfriend thinks it's necessary for women. The author is in a position where he can't accept this policy, leading to conflict. The question is whether the author is wrong for not complying. \n\nIn terms of fairness, if the gym is charging the same for everyone but restricting access based on gender, that could be seen as discriminatory against the excluded group. So the author's stance is that it's unfair. However, the girlfriend is defending the policy as being necessary for women, which might be a valid perspective. \n\nBut the author's main issue is about the payment structure. If he's paying for a gym that he can't fully use, that's a problem. The gym's policy might be intended to be inclusive but ends up being exclusionary for men, which the author is pointing out. However, maybe the author is not seeing the intent behind the women-only space, which is to create a safe environment for women. \n\nSo, is the author in the wrong for refusing to go to a gym with a women-only section? It depends on whether the gym's policy is considered discriminatory. If it's a legitimate policy aimed at inclusivity for women, then the author might be wrong to object. But if the policy is itself discriminatory, then he's right. \n\nBut the key point is that the author is not being allowed to use a part of the gym, which he's paying for. That's a problem from his perspective. His girlfriend thinks it's different for women, but maybe she's not considering the reverse scenario. The author is trying to highlight the inconsistency. \n\nIn conclusion, the author's stance is about equal access and not being okay with a policy that he sees as unequal. Whether he's in the wrong depends on the societal perspective on such policies. In many places, having segregated spaces can be legally permitted if they're aimed at inclusion. However, the author's objection is based on principle. If the author is not being flexible and is causing conflict over a policy that his girlfriend supports, he might be the asshole. But if the policy is inherently discriminatory, he's justified. This is a nuanced issue where both sides have valid points, but the author's refusal to switch gyms based on principle might not make him the asshole. However, the way he framed the argument (comparing it to his girlfriend's hypothetical situation) might come off as dismissive of her perspective. So maybe the answer is that he's not in the wrong because he's standing up for equality, but perhaps his approach could be more considerate.\n"
