Recently my girlfriend suggested that I change over to her gym so we could carpool, workout together etc. Normally I would agree with this and be happy to go to the same gym as her, the problem is that her gym has a large \"**women only**\" section. The gym charges the same entrance fee for both men and women, but this section only allows women to use it and contains about 1/4 of the area of the gym and about 1/4 of the total workout equipment.\n\n I told my girlfriend that I didn't want to go to a gym that would charge someone 100% of the fee but only allow them to use 75% of the equipment because of their sex. When she said that I was being stupid about this I asked her if she would go to a gym that charged her the same as men, but forbid her from using a large portion of the equipment and area? She got upset at this, and said that \"*I just don't understand*\", and that \"*it's different for women*\".\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAm I being the asshole here and just not understanding?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to work through this. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for not wanting to switch to their girlfriend's gym because it has a women-only section. The situation involves a gym with a \"women only\" area that takes up a quarter of the space and equipment. The author is upset because they're paying the same fee but can't use that section, while the girlfriend thinks it's different for women.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the core issue. The author is rejecting the gym because they believe it's unfair to pay the same fee but have restricted access. The girlfriend argues that it's different for women, possibly because she sees the women-only section as a positive space for women, maybe for safety or empowerment. \n\nSo, the question is about whether the author is wrong to object to unequal access based on sex. The gym charges the same price but limits access for men. If the author objects to that, is that a valid stance?\n\nFrom a fairness perspective, if the gym is charging the same fee but offering less access to one gender, that could be seen as discriminatory. The author is pointing out that inconsistency. However, some might argue that the women-only section is a necessary accommodation to address historical inequalities or provide a safe space, so the gym's policy isn't inherently sexist. \n\nBut if the gym is charging everyone the same regardless of access, then the policy might be seen as creating an unfair situation for men. The author's argument is about equal access for equal price. However, the girlfriend might see the women-only section as a benefit for women, hence the charge. The key here is whether the gym's policy is justifiable. If the gym is providing a separate but equal experience (which they aren't, since men have less access), then the author's objection is valid. \n\nAnother angle: if the women's section exists to create a safe or more comfortable environment for women, maybe the gym is addressing a different need. But from the author's perspective, paying the same fee for less access is unfair. The girlfriend's response that \"it's different for women\" might stem from a belief that women have historically faced more barriers, so such sections are justified. \n\nThe problem is that the gym is creating a disparity in access based on sex without adjusting the fee. If the author is objecting to that, they're not necessarily the asshole because they're pointing out a logical inconsistency. The girlfriend might not consider that the policy affects men differently. \n\nSo, the answer would hinge on whether equal pricing with unequal access is discriminatory. If yes, then the author is right. If the women-only section is a necessary accommodation, then the author is wrong. But the way the question is framed, the author is highlighting a discrepancy, which is a valid point. Therefore, the answer might be B (author is not in the wrong).\n"
