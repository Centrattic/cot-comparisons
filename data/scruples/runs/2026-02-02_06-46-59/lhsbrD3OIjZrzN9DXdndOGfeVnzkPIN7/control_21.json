Recently my girlfriend suggested that I change over to her gym so we could carpool, workout together etc. Normally I would agree with this and be happy to go to the same gym as her, the problem is that her gym has a large \"**women only**\" section. The gym charges the same entrance fee for both men and women, but this section only allows women to use it and contains about 1/4 of the area of the gym and about 1/4 of the total workout equipment.\n\n I told my girlfriend that I didn't want to go to a gym that would charge someone 100% of the fee but only allow them to use 75% of the equipment because of their sex. When she said that I was being stupid about this I asked her if she would go to a gym that charged her the same as men, but forbid her from using a large portion of the equipment and area? She got upset at this, and said that \"*I just don't understand*\", and that \"*it's different for women*\".\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAm I being the asshole here and just not understanding?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the post is in the wrong. The situation involves a disagreement with their girlfriend about going to the same gym. The main issue is the gym having a women-only section that the author finds sexist because it restricts men from using part of the equipment and space, even though they pay the same fee.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the author's perspective. They argue that if a gym charges equal fees but allows one gender to use a portion of the facility while excluding the other, it's discriminatory. That seems like a valid point. The author is pointing out an inconsistency in how the gym treats different genders, which could be seen as unfair. They're not okay with being excluded from part of the gym, so they refuse to join. \n\nOn the other hand, the girlfriend is upset when the author compares the situation to women being excluded. She says it's different for women, which might imply that she sees the women's section as a positive thing\u2014maybe for safety, comfort, or empowerment. Some gyms have women-only areas to create a space where women can work out without feeling self-conscious or harassed. The author's comparison could be seen as dismissing the real issues women face in such environments, hence why the girlfriend is upset.\n\nNow, is the author in the wrong? The key here is to assess whether their reasoning is fair. The author is highlighting a potential double standard. If the gym allows women to have exclusive access to part of the facility, but doesn't offer men the same, that could be seen as sexist. However, the context of why women's sections exist matters. They're often created to address historical and ongoing issues of women feeling unwelcome or unsafe in gyms. So, the author's argument might not fully account for the reasons behind the women-only section.\n\nBut then again, the author isn't opposing the women's section per se; they're just not okay with being excluded from part of the gym. If the gym charges the same for all members but restricts access based on gender, that does seem like a form of discrimination. However, the author's comparison to women's exclusion might be insensitive, as they're equating the two sides without understanding the different motivations. \n\nThe girlfriend's reaction suggests that she feels the author isn't empathizing with her reasons for needing the women-only area. The author's stance could be seen as not considering her perspective, which is rooted in different experiences. So, while the author's point about fairness is valid, their approach might have dismissed her valid concerns. \n\nIn terms of whether the author is the asshole, it's a bit of a nuanced situation. The author is right to point out the inequity in the gym's policy, but their way of bringing it up to the girlfriend was perhaps insensitive. The girlfriend's use of the women-only section might be important to her for reasons the author hasn't considered. Therefore, the author isn't entirely wrong, but they might not be fully in the right either. However, based on the question's options, the answer is either A or B. Given that the author is making a point about equality but might not be considering the context of the women's section, the answer is not straightforward. But since the author's main argument is about fairness and the gym's policy, which does seem discriminatory, the answer leans towards B (the author is not in the wrong).\n"
