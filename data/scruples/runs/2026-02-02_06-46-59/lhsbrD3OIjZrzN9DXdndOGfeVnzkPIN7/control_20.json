Recently my girlfriend suggested that I change over to her gym so we could carpool, workout together etc. Normally I would agree with this and be happy to go to the same gym as her, the problem is that her gym has a large \"**women only**\" section. The gym charges the same entrance fee for both men and women, but this section only allows women to use it and contains about 1/4 of the area of the gym and about 1/4 of the total workout equipment.\n\n I told my girlfriend that I didn't want to go to a gym that would charge someone 100% of the fee but only allow them to use 75% of the equipment because of their sex. When she said that I was being stupid about this I asked her if she would go to a gym that charged her the same as men, but forbid her from using a large portion of the equipment and area? She got upset at this, and said that \"*I just don't understand*\", and that \"*it's different for women*\".\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAm I being the asshole here and just not understanding?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for not wanting to switch gyms because of the women-only section. The author's main point is that the gym charges the same fee but restricts access to 25% of the equipment based on gender. They argue it's sexist because they wouldn't accept the reverse situation. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the concept of gender-segregated spaces. In some contexts, like women-only gyms, the rationale might be about safety, comfort, or addressing specific needs. However, from a fairness perspective, if the gym charges the same fee regardless of access to certain areas, it could be seen as discriminatory if it's not reciprocal. \n\nThe girlfriend's response that \"it's different for women\" suggests she might see the women-only section as empowering or necessary. But the author is pointing out a potential inconsistency in the treatment based on gender. If both were male-only and female-only sections, but the fees and access were different, that would be one thing. Here, the issue is that the same fee is being charged despite unequal access for men.\n\nI should also think about legal aspects. In many places, discrimination based on gender is illegal, and providing different access without a valid reason could be an issue. However, some exceptions exist for women-only spaces, like shelters or services targeting specific needs. Gyms might offer such sections to cater to women's preferences or to create a comfortable environment, but if they don't do the same for men, it might be seen as discriminatory.\n\nThe author isn't objecting to the gym having a women-only section per se, but to the fact that they are charged the same fee without access to that part. If a man were charged the same as a woman but couldn't use the women-only section, and vice versa, it would be a two-way issue. The author's hypothetical question about whether his girlfriend would accept the reverse is a valid point, as it highlights the inconsistency.\n\nHowever, the girlfriend might feel that the women-only section is important for her and other women, perhaps to avoid harassment or to have a space where they feel more comfortable. The author's refusal to switch gyms could be seen as not supporting her choice, even if the author finds the policy unfair.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? It depends on whether the gym's policy is justified. If the gym provides the same overall facilities and the women-only section is an optional, additional benefit, then the author's objection might be valid. But if the sections are separate and the fee is the same, but the men can't use the women's part, that could be a form of gender discrimination. However, if the gym offers both men and women access to all facilities except for the women-only section, which is optional, then the author's complaint could be justified.\n\nIn conclusion, the author is pointing out a possible inconsistency in how gender affects access and pricing, which is a valid concern. The girlfriend's reaction might be from a different perspective, but the author's stance isn't necessarily wrong. So the answer is B (No).\n"
