Recently my girlfriend suggested that I change over to her gym so we could carpool, workout together etc. Normally I would agree with this and be happy to go to the same gym as her, the problem is that her gym has a large \"**women only**\" section. The gym charges the same entrance fee for both men and women, but this section only allows women to use it and contains about 1/4 of the area of the gym and about 1/4 of the total workout equipment.\n\n I told my girlfriend that I didn't want to go to a gym that would charge someone 100% of the fee but only allow them to use 75% of the equipment because of their sex. When she said that I was being stupid about this I asked her if she would go to a gym that charged her the same as men, but forbid her from using a large portion of the equipment and area? She got upset at this, and said that \"*I just don't understand*\", and that \"*it's different for women*\".\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAm I being the asshole here and just not understanding?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong. The situation is about a couple where the girlfriend wants both to go to her gym, but the guy is refusing because the gym has a women-only section. The guy argues that it's sexist because men would pay the same but only have access to 75% of the gym. The girlfriend is upset and says it's different for women.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze the core issue. The guy's objection is based on the idea that the gym is excluding men from part of the facility, which he sees as unfair. His argument is about equal access for all members. The girlfriend's stance is that the women-only section is different for women, possibly implying that it's necessary for their safety or comfort. \n\nNow, I need to consider the concept of separate spaces. Many gyms have women-only sections to address issues like harassment or to create a more comfortable environment. This might be a valid reason for the gym to have such a section. However, the guy's argument is that this setup is discriminatory against him because he can't use all the equipment, even though he pays the same. \n\nThe key here is whether the gym's policy is inherently sexist. If the gym is charging everyone the same but providing a section that's exclusively for one gender, is that fair? From the guy's perspective, it's a financial and access issue. But from the girlfriend's perspective, the women-only area serves a purpose that's important for women's needs. \n\nI should also think about equality and reverse discrimination. The guy might feel that he's being excluded without a valid reason, whereas the women's section is justified for protecting women. However, the question is whether the guy's refusal to join the gym is reasonable. Is it fair for him to expect equal access when the gym has a specific reason for the women-only section?\n\nAnother angle is the couple's communication. The guy asked a hypothetical question about how she would feel in a similar situation, which might have been a valid way to explore her perspective. But she got upset, suggesting that there's a deeper issue in their understanding of each other's viewpoints.\n\nIn terms of societal norms, having women-only spaces is a recognized practice to address historical inequalities and safety concerns. However, the guy's stance is about equal treatment. This creates a conflict between two values: equality of access versus addressing specific needs.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? If the gym's policy is to provide a safe space for women, then the guy's refusal might be seen as not respecting that need. On the other hand, if the gym isn't providing equivalent access to all members, that could be a fairness issue. But considering that the women-only section is a common practice to address real issues, the guy's objection might be based on a misunderstanding of why such sections exist. Therefore, he might be the asshole because he's dismissing a valid reason for the gym's policy and not considering the importance of that space for women.\n"
