Recently my girlfriend suggested that I change over to her gym so we could carpool, workout together etc. Normally I would agree with this and be happy to go to the same gym as her, the problem is that her gym has a large \"**women only**\" section. The gym charges the same entrance fee for both men and women, but this section only allows women to use it and contains about 1/4 of the area of the gym and about 1/4 of the total workout equipment.\n\n I told my girlfriend that I didn't want to go to a gym that would charge someone 100% of the fee but only allow them to use 75% of the equipment because of their sex. When she said that I was being stupid about this I asked her if she would go to a gym that charged her the same as men, but forbid her from using a large portion of the equipment and area? She got upset at this, and said that \"*I just don't understand*\", and that \"*it's different for women*\".\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAm I being the asshole here and just not understanding?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about whether it's sexist to have a \"women only\" section in a gym where both genders pay the same fee. The author's girlfriend wants them to switch to her gym, but the author objects because the gym has a section that's only for women, which he sees as unfair. The girlfriend thinks he's being too literal or not understanding the difference between how men and women experience the gym.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the core issue. The gym has a women-only area, which makes up a quarter of the space and equipment. The author argues that since men can't use that section, they're paying the same price but getting less access, which he finds sexist. The girlfriend counters that it's different for women, implying that the women-only section serves a purpose, maybe for creating a safe space or addressing different needs.\n\nSo, the author's main argument is about fairness: paying same price for less access. The girlfriend's perspective is about the necessity of the women-only section. But is the author's argument valid?\n\nFrom a fairness standpoint, if the gym charges everyone the same but restricts access based on gender, that could be seen as discriminatory against men. However, the presence of a women-only section might be intended to support women who might feel uncomfortable in mixed-gender environments, which is a common argument for such spaces. But if the restriction is only one-way (men can't use the women's section, but women can use the men's), then it's not equal. That could be considered sexist because it's limiting men's access based on their gender, which is similar to how segregation in other contexts has been discriminatory.\n\nHowever, there's also the aspect of intent. The gym might have the women-only section to empower women, but the effect is that it creates unequal access for men. The author is pointing out this inconsistency. The girlfriend's dismissal that \"it's different for women\" might be a way of not acknowledging that the same policy would be seen as unfair if applied to men.\n\nSo, the key question is whether gender-based restrictions that create unequal access are inherently sexist. If the gym's policy is to provide equal access to all, but they have a segregated area that only one gender can use, that's a contradiction. The author is highlighting that contradiction. Therefore, the author might be correct in his assessment that it's sexist, and the girlfriend's reaction is dismissive of his valid concern.\n\nBut some might argue that the women-only section is about inclusion and safety for women, which is a different issue. However, if the gym is charging men the same fee but not giving them equal access, that's a separate issue of fairness. The author's concern is about equal access for equal price, which is a legitimate point.\n\nSo, considering both sides, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong. He's pointing out a potential inconsistency in the gym's policy. The girlfriend's response that he's being stupid or not understanding might be the asshole part here, as she's dismissing his valid point without considering the fairness aspect. Therefore, the answer would be B (the author is not in the wrong).\n"
