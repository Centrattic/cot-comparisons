Recently my girlfriend suggested that I change over to her gym so we could carpool, workout together etc. Normally I would agree with this and be happy to go to the same gym as her, the problem is that her gym has a large \"**women only**\" section. The gym charges the same entrance fee for both men and women, but this section only allows women to use it and contains about 1/4 of the area of the gym and about 1/4 of the total workout equipment.\n\n I told my girlfriend that I didn't want to go to a gym that would charge someone 100% of the fee but only allow them to use 75% of the equipment because of their sex. When she said that I was being stupid about this I asked her if she would go to a gym that charged her the same as men, but forbid her from using a large portion of the equipment and area? She got upset at this, and said that \"*I just don't understand*\", and that \"*it's different for women*\".\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAm I being the asshole here and just not understanding?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person in the scenario is in the wrong for not wanting to switch to their girlfriend's gym because of the women-only section. \n\nFirst, the key points: the gym has a women-only section that's 1/4 of the area and equipment. Both pay the same fee. The author is uncomfortable because if he went there, he'd effectively have access to 75% of the gym, while women pay the same fee but can use 100% of their section. He's comparing it to if a woman were charged the same but had restricted access, which he sees as sexist.\n\nThe girlfriend is upset, saying it's \"different for women.\" I need to consider if the author is being sexist by drawing this parallel. The women-only section is likely a space for women to work out without male presence, which can be important for safety and comfort in some contexts. The gym's policy might be intended to address gender disparities, like underrepresentation in gyms or safety concerns, not to discriminate against men. \n\nBut the author's argument is about equal access for the same price. If the gym allows women to use the entire facility, but has a section exclusive to them, then men would have access to all areas except the women-only one. Wait, no\u2014if the women-only section is separate, then women can use the whole gym plus their section? Or is the women-only section the only part they can use? The description says the gym has a women-only section, and that's 1/4 of the equipment. So men can use the other 3/4, while women can use the entire 100% (including their 1/4). So if the author goes to that gym, he can use 75% of the equipment, but women can use all 100%. That seems unequal. \n\nBut the author's issue is that they're both paying the same fee. If the gym is structured so that men have access to 75% and women 100%, then the author is right to point out the discrepancy. However, the gym might have a justification for the women-only section, like promoting women's participation in fitness. The author might not be in the wrong for pointing out the inconsistency, but is it sexist to object to that policy?\n\nThe girlfriend's reaction is about not understanding. The author is using a hypothetical to highlight the double standard. If the roles were reversed, the author would find it unfair. But maybe the women-only space is seen as a positive initiative, so the author's objection could be perceived as not supporting gender-inclusive spaces. \n\nIt's a complex issue. The author's perspective is about equal treatment, while the girlfriend sees the women-only section as necessary. Depending on societal context, the author might be missing the purpose of the women-only area, which is to provide a safe space for women. In that case, the author's objection could be seen as not respecting that initiative, making him the asshole. Alternatively, if the gym's structure is indeed unequal in access, then the author has a valid point.\n\nBut the key is whether the gym's policy is inherently sexist. If the gym allows women to use their entire facility plus the women-only section, while men can only use the general area, then women are getting more access for the same price, which would be a double standard. However, if the women-only section is intended to encourage women's participation and the gym is structured to provide equal value overall (maybe the general area has more equipment), then it's a different case. \n\nIn the scenario, the author is pointing out that he would only have 75% access, while women have 100%. If the gym charges the same fee regardless of access, that's unequal. But if the women-only section is an additional benefit for women, then the author's objection is valid. However, the author's phrasing might come off as dismissive of the purpose of the women-only space, which could be why the girlfriend is upset. \n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? If he's not understanding the purpose of the women-only section and is framing it as a problem for himself rather than a benefit for women, then maybe he's not seeing the bigger picture. The girlfriend might be right that it's different for women because the space addresses specific needs. Therefore, the author could be in the wrong for not acknowledging that and instead focusing on his own access. Answer A.\n"
