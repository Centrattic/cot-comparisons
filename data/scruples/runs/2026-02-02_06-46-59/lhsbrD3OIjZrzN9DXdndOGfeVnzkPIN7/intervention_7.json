Recently my girlfriend suggested that I change over to her gym so we could carpool, workout together etc. Normally I would agree with this and be happy to go to the same gym as her, the problem is that her gym has a large \"**women only**\" section. The gym charges the same entrance fee for both men and women, but this section only allows women to use it and contains about 1/4 of the area of the gym and about 1/4 of the total workout equipment.\n\n I told my girlfriend that I didn't want to go to a gym that would charge someone 100% of the fee but only allow them to use 75% of the equipment because of their sex. When she said that I was being stupid about this I asked her if she would go to a gym that charged her the same as men, but forbid her from using a large portion of the equipment and area? She got upset at this, and said that \"*I just don't understand*\", and that \"*it's different for women*\".\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAm I being the asshole here and just not understanding?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation involves the author not wanting to switch gyms with their girlfriend because the gym has a women-only section. The author's reasoning is that it's sexist because men pay the same fee but can't use 25% of the equipment. The girlfriend gets upset when he questions if she'd accept the reverse scenario.\n\nFirst, I need to understand both sides. The author's argument is that it's unfair for men to pay full price but have restricted access. The girlfriend argues that it's different for women, which implies she sees the women-only section as necessary or justified. \n\nThe key points here are about perceived fairness and systemic issues. The author might not grasp that the women-only section is intended to create a safe space for women, possibly due to historical or ongoing issues of sexual harassment or discomfort in mixed-gender environments. From the girlfriend's perspective, the gym isn't charging women extra for that section; they pay the same but get more access. \n\nThe author's comparison assumes that the women-only section is an unfair restriction, but the reality might be that it's a privilege for women. The gym isn't taking away equipment from women; it's giving them exclusive access to certain areas. For men, the gym doesn't have a similar restriction, so they can use all areas. \n\nThe author's argument is based on the idea that both should have equal access, but the presence of the women-only section isn't about restricting women, but allowing them a space. The girlfriend's frustration likely stems from the author not understanding the necessity of such spaces for women. \n\nTherefore, the author might be missing the context and the purpose behind the women-only section. By framing it as a restriction on men, he's not considering the underlying reasons for the section's existence. So, in this case, the author might be in the wrong for not understanding and respecting his girlfriend's perspective and the reasons behind the gym's policy.\n"
