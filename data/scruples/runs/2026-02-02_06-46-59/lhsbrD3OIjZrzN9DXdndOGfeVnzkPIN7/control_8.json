Recently my girlfriend suggested that I change over to her gym so we could carpool, workout together etc. Normally I would agree with this and be happy to go to the same gym as her, the problem is that her gym has a large \"**women only**\" section. The gym charges the same entrance fee for both men and women, but this section only allows women to use it and contains about 1/4 of the area of the gym and about 1/4 of the total workout equipment.\n\n I told my girlfriend that I didn't want to go to a gym that would charge someone 100% of the fee but only allow them to use 75% of the equipment because of their sex. When she said that I was being stupid about this I asked her if she would go to a gym that charged her the same as men, but forbid her from using a large portion of the equipment and area? She got upset at this, and said that \"*I just don't understand*\", and that \"*it's different for women*\".\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAm I being the asshole here and just not understanding?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for not wanting to switch to the girlfriend's gym because of the women-only section. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The author and his girlfriend both work out, but at different gyms. The girlfriend wants to switch to her gym to carpool and workout together. However, the author is against it because the gym has a women-only section that takes up a quarter of the space and equipment. He argues that paying the same fee but having access to less equipment is discriminatory. The girlfriend is upset and says it's different for women.\n\nSo, the main issue is whether the author is being unreasonable by objecting to the women-only section. The key here is the concept of equal access. The gym charges the same price for both genders, but restricts access for men to part of the facility. The author sees this as unfair because he would pay full price but only get access to 75% of the equipment. \n\nThe girlfriend's perspective is that it's different for women, implying that the women-only section serves a specific purpose, maybe for women who prefer a separate space or to avoid harassment. However, from the author's standpoint, he's being asked to accept a situation where his access is limited based on his gender, which he perceives as sexist.\n\nNow, considering equality principles, if a facility offers gender-segregated areas but charges the same for all members, it could be seen as discriminatory against the gender that isn't allowed into the exclusive section. The author's argument is that he shouldn't have to pay full price for less access. The girlfriend's argument that it's different for women might be based on historical or social reasons where such spaces are intended to provide a safe environment for women, but from a fairness standpoint, the author's position has merit.\n\nHowever, there's also the aspect of mutual understanding. The author is trying to communicate his feelings about the situation, but the girlfriend is frustrated and thinks he's not understanding her perspective. The question is whether the author is in the wrong for holding his stance.\n\nIn terms of legal or policy aspects, some places may have laws against gender discrimination in public facilities, but gyms might have exceptions for women-only sections, especially if they serve a purpose like safety or inclusivity. However, if the gym is charging the same price regardless of access, that could be problematic. \n\nSo, from a fairness and equality perspective, the author isn't wrong to feel that the gym's policy is discriminatory against men. He's pointing out a double standard. The girlfriend's frustration comes from the belief that women need such spaces, which might be valid, but that doesn't negate the author's valid complaint about unequal access. \n\nTherefore, the author isn't in the wrong. He's highlighting a potential issue of unequal treatment. The girlfriend's reaction might stem from not seeing the situation from his perspective, but that doesn't mean he's the asshole here. He's trying to stand up for his rights and beliefs, which is reasonable.\n"
