Recently my girlfriend suggested that I change over to her gym so we could carpool, workout together etc. Normally I would agree with this and be happy to go to the same gym as her, the problem is that her gym has a large \"**women only**\" section. The gym charges the same entrance fee for both men and women, but this section only allows women to use it and contains about 1/4 of the area of the gym and about 1/4 of the total workout equipment.\n\n I told my girlfriend that I didn't want to go to a gym that would charge someone 100% of the fee but only allow them to use 75% of the equipment because of their sex. When she said that I was being stupid about this I asked her if she would go to a gym that charged her the same as men, but forbid her from using a large portion of the equipment and area? She got upset at this, and said that \"*I just don't understand*\", and that \"*it's different for women*\".\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAm I being the asshole here and just not understanding?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote this is in the wrong. The situation is about a girlfriend suggesting they both go to the same gym, but the gym has a \"women only\" section. The author objects because if a man had to pay the same fee but only use 75% of the equipment, he wouldn't accept it, seeing it as sexist.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the core issue. The gym allows women to use a specific section exclusively, but men aren't allowed there. The author is upset that he's paying the same but not allowed in that area. His girlfriend says it's different for women, which he finds confusing. He's asking if he's the asshole here.\n\nSo, the key points here are about gender-specific spaces and whether the author's objection is valid. The \"women only\" section is common in some gyms to address safety concerns or provide a more comfortable environment for women. The author's argument is that it's unfair because he's paying the same but can't use all the equipment. His girlfriend's response is that it's different for women, implying she values the existence of that section.\n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong. From a fairness perspective, if the gym charges the same entrance fee but restricts access to part of the facility based on gender, that could be seen as discriminatory against men. However, the reasoning behind the \"women only\" section is to protect women's rights to a safe space, which is a valid social consideration. But the author is pointing out the inconsistency in how the gym treats men versus women, which is a legitimate concern.\n\nOn the other hand, the girlfriend might feel that the \"women only\" section is important for her and that the author isn't respecting her needs. However, the author's issue is with the unequal access rather than not wanting to see her. The problem arises from the gym's policy, not necessarily from the author's stance. The author isn't forcing the gym to change; he's declining to use a gym with such a policy. His argument is about fairness and equality, so that's not inherently wrong.\n\nNow, considering the AITA (Am I the Asshole) context, the community often looks at intent and whether the person is being unreasonable. The author is not the one creating the policy; he's responding to it. If the gym is set up that way, but the author feels it's sexist, his objection is based on gender equality. The girlfriend's reaction might be more about the inconvenience or her own needs rather than the validity of his argument. However, her being upset could be due to feeling that her experience is being invalidated. \n\nBut the core issue is the gym's policy. If the gym is charging the same fee but not allowing men to use a section that's 25% of the space and equipment, that could be seen as discriminatory. The author's stance is that it's unfair, which is a valid point. The girlfriend's insistence that it's different for women might be dismissing his concern. \n\nIn terms of being in the wrong, the author is not. He's raising a point about unequal access. The girlfriend's reaction might stem from her own priorities, but that doesn't make his objection wrong. So the answer would be B (No), the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
