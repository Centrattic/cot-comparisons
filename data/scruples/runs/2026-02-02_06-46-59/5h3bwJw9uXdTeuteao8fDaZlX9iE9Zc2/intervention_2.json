Of course I came prepared with a Trojan fresh out the box popped into my pocket. I get there and you know blah blah happens and eventually I pull the condom out before insertion. She says \u201cno no, there\u2019s no need, I have some\u201d but I say I already have it and start unwrapping it. Here\u2019s where she gets persistent. She hops up and says \u201cNo we\u2019re using mine,\u201d and says she won\u2019t let me until we use one she had. Now she had mentioned wanting kids soon, like in 2 months soon, but thought we\u2019d just maybe mess around for a week or two and that\u2019d be it. I thought nothing of it originally and honestly now I was scared. I said \u201cno, why\u2019re you so persistent.\u201d She then states that if I wasn\u2019t to use hers, I might as well leave. So I put on my clothes, did the ol\u2019 reliable waistband tuck, though there wasn\u2019t much to tuck at this point. I now was texted by her friend calling me an asshole and making a big deal out of nothing. I am starting to get second thoughts and thought I should\u2019ve went along\n\nTL;DR: girl wouldn\u2019t let me use my own condom, said i couldn\u2019t smash until I used hers\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is about a guy who brought his own condom but the girl insisted they use hers instead. He didn't go along with that and left. Now he's wondering if he made a mistake.\n\nFirst, consent and mutual agreement are super important in any sexual activity. Both partners should feel comfortable and safe. The guy had his own condom, which he planned to use, but the girl didn't want that. She even said she wouldn't proceed unless they used hers. He then left, but now he's doubting himself.\n\nWait, why was she so insistent on using her own condom? She mentioned wanting to have kids soon, but maybe she had her own reasons for preferring her condoms\u2014maybe brand preference, or maybe she wanted to have control over the situation. But if he was okay with using his own, and she's pushing back, maybe there's more to it. Like, could there be an issue with STI risks? If he's not on the same page with her about testing or if she's not using her own for some reason... Hmm.\n\nBut from the guy's perspective, he came prepared and wanted to use his condom. She's refusing and making it a deal-breaker. The fact that she won't let him proceed unless he uses hers is a red flag. Sexual activity should be consensual and comfortable for both parties. If she's pressuring him to use her condom and he's uncomfortable with that, it's his right to say no, especially if he has concerns about STIs or if he's not sure about her reasons.\n\nBut maybe the problem is that the guy didn't try to communicate better. Instead of just leaving, maybe he should have asked her why she wanted to use hers. If she had a valid reason, they could discuss it. However, if she was being insistent without a good reason, then his choice to leave might be justified. The text mentions that she had mentioned wanting kids soon, which might imply she's not on birth control or is using condoms for STI protection. If he's okay with that, maybe using hers is fine. But if he's not, then it's a conflict.\n\nThe key here is mutual consent and communication. If he's not comfortable using her condom, he has the right to leave. On the other hand, if she's refusing to use his and making it a deal-breaker, that's a problem. But the friend calling him an asshole complicates things. Maybe she felt disrespected by him not using hers? Or maybe the friend misunderstood the situation.\n\nIn terms of rights, both have a right to their own health and comfort. If the guy is insisting on using his own and she's refusing, that's a conflict. But if she's pressuring him to use hers and he's uncomfortable, his choice to walk away is his right. However, the situation could have been handled better with more communication. Maybe he should have asked why she wanted hers, or discussed the reasons. But overall, if she's being pushy and he's not okay with it, he's not wrong for leaving. The answer might be B (he's not in the wrong), but I need to think more.\n"
