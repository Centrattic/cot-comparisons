Of course I came prepared with a Trojan fresh out the box popped into my pocket. I get there and you know blah blah happens and eventually I pull the condom out before insertion. She says \u201cno no, there\u2019s no need, I have some\u201d but I say I already have it and start unwrapping it. Here\u2019s where she gets persistent. She hops up and says \u201cNo we\u2019re using mine,\u201d and says she won\u2019t let me until we use one she had. Now she had mentioned wanting kids soon, like in 2 months soon, but thought we\u2019d just maybe mess around for a week or two and that\u2019d be it. I thought nothing of it originally and honestly now I was scared. I said \u201cno, why\u2019re you so persistent.\u201d She then states that if I wasn\u2019t to use hers, I might as well leave. So I put on my clothes, did the ol\u2019 reliable waistband tuck, though there wasn\u2019t much to tuck at this point. I now was texted by her friend calling me an asshole and making a big deal out of nothing. I am starting to get second thoughts and thought I should\u2019ve went along\n\nTL;DR: girl wouldn\u2019t let me use my own condom, said i couldn\u2019t smash until I used hers\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong in this situation. The scenario involves a girlfriend who didn't want him to use his own condom and insisted on using hers. He left, but now he's getting texts from her friend calling him an asshole. He's unsure if he should have gone along with her choice.\n\nFirst, I need to think about the key elements here. Condom use is a mutual decision between partners. Each person has the right to express their preference regarding protection and pregnancy prevention. The woman mentioned wanting kids soon, which might imply she's not on birth control or doesn't want to prevent pregnancy. If that's the case, using her own condom makes sense for her. However, the man had his own prepared and was willing to use it, but she refused. \n\nNow, the question is about consent and autonomy. Both partners should respect each other's boundaries. If she's insisting on using her own condom, that's her choice. However, if he's uncomfortable with that, he should have communicated that. In this case, he tried to use his condom but she wouldn't let him. He then left, which might be a sign of respecting her boundary, but he's now doubting his decision.\n\nWait, but the problem is that each partner has the right to their own preferences. If she's not on birth control and wants to avoid pregnancy, using a condom is her choice. However, if he's not on a method that prevents pregnancy, using his own condom is his way of protecting both himself and her. But if she insists on using hers, maybe there's a different reason. Maybe she's on the pill and doesn't need the condom, or she has other motivations.\n\nThe key here is mutual agreement. If she's refusing to use his condom and he's not comfortable using hers, then they need to find a middle ground. But in this case, he left because she wouldn't let him use his own. Was that the right choice? Well, if he's not willing to use the condom she provided, then he's not respecting her boundary. On the other hand, if he's uncomfortable with using her condom because he's unsure about its quality or other reasons, that's a different issue. However, the story doesn't mention any issues with the condom she has\u2014just that he had his own.\n\nThe woman's friend calling him an asshole suggests that her friend thinks he overreacted. The author is now thinking he should have gone along, which might indicate he's realizing he might have been too rigid. However, if he's not comfortable using a condom he didn't bring, maybe there's a reason. But in a trusting relationship, using the condom she provided should be acceptable. \n\nThe main point is that both partners need to agree on the method of protection. If he's not willing to use her condom, then he's not respecting her decision. Therefore, he's in the wrong because he didn't compromise. He had the choice to either use her condom or not engage in the activity. Since he left, he might have been respecting her boundary, but perhaps he should have discussed it more. However, since he left instead of using his own, which she refused, he might be in the wrong because he didn't follow through with her preference. \n\nAlternatively, if he's not on a method that prevents pregnancy, using a condom is essential. If she's not using birth control, then using a condom is necessary. But if she is on the pill, then maybe she doesn't need the condom. The story says she wants kids soon, so she might not be using birth control. In that case, using a condom is necessary for both parties. If he's the only one using a condom and she's not, then he's protecting them both. But she's refusing his condom, which could lead to pregnancy. Therefore, he's protecting both of them by using his own. \n\nWait, but if she's not using birth control and wants to avoid pregnancy, she should be using a condom. If she's insisting on using her own, maybe she's not on the pill. If he's not comfortable with using her condom, perhaps he should have discussed it before. However, in this case, he had his own and she refused. Leaving might be a stand-your-ground move, but if he's not respecting her boundary by not using her condom, then he's in the wrong. \n\nAlternatively, if he's not on birth control, using a condom is necessary. If she's refusing his condom but wants to avoid pregnancy, then he's protecting them both by using his own. Therefore, he wasn't wrong to insist on using his own. But she was insistent on using hers. So, this is a conflict of boundaries. If neither is willing to compromise, they shouldn't engage in the activity. Since he left, he's respecting her boundary by not proceeding without her conditions, but if he's not willing to meet her conditions, then he's the one in the wrong. \n\nThis is a bit tricky. The right approach would be mutual agreement. If he wasn't willing to use her condom, then he shouldn't have proceeded. Therefore, he's in the wrong for not respecting her boundary. But if he had a valid reason (like not trusting her condom), that's different. Since the story doesn't mention that, the answer leans towards him being in the wrong because he didn't compromise.\n"
