Of course I came prepared with a Trojan fresh out the box popped into my pocket. I get there and you know blah blah happens and eventually I pull the condom out before insertion. She says \u201cno no, there\u2019s no need, I have some\u201d but I say I already have it and start unwrapping it. Here\u2019s where she gets persistent. She hops up and says \u201cNo we\u2019re using mine,\u201d and says she won\u2019t let me until we use one she had. Now she had mentioned wanting kids soon, like in 2 months soon, but thought we\u2019d just maybe mess around for a week or two and that\u2019d be it. I thought nothing of it originally and honestly now I was scared. I said \u201cno, why\u2019re you so persistent.\u201d She then states that if I wasn\u2019t to use hers, I might as well leave. So I put on my clothes, did the ol\u2019 reliable waistband tuck, though there wasn\u2019t much to tuck at this point. I now was texted by her friend calling me an asshole and making a big deal out of nothing. I am starting to get second thoughts and thought I should\u2019ve went along\n\nTL;DR: girl wouldn\u2019t let me use my own condom, said i couldn\u2019t smash until I used hers\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is that he went over to his girlfriend (they've been dating 3-4 weeks) and he brought a condom. She says no, wants to use hers instead. He insists on using his own, and she gets upset, says if he doesn't use hers, he should leave. He leaves and then feels bad, thinking maybe he should have gone along.\n\nFirst, I need to consider consent and boundaries. In a relationship, both partners should feel comfortable and safe. Condoms are about protection and health. Using a condom is a mutual decision. But here, the girl is insistent that he not use his own. Why would she do that? If she's not comfortable using his condom, maybe she has a reason. But he's bringing his own, which is standard. However, the fact that she's mentioned wanting kids soon is a red flag. If she's trying to conceive, using a condom would prevent pregnancy. So maybe she's not being honest about her intentions. \n\nThe user is male and he's concerned about using his own condom. But the key point is that she's refusing to let him use his own and is pressuring him to use hers. In that case, if she's not allowing him to use his own, maybe she has a reason. But why? If she's not on birth control, maybe she wants to get pregnant. Alternatively, maybe she's trying to get him to have unprotected sex, which would be a problem if her intentions are not aligned with his. \n\nHe says he thought she wanted to \"mess around for a week or two\" and that she mentioned wanting kids soon. That's conflicting. If she wants kids soon, using a condom would be counterproductive. So maybe she's trying to get pregnant, and he's not on board with that. \n\nIn terms of consent, he didn't want to use her condom because he might not trust her (maybe she's given conflicting signals) and he's concerned about pregnancy or STIs. But in the situation, he's the one who's not backing down and leaves. However, she's pressuring him to use her condom, which could be a sign of manipulation. \n\nIs it his fault for not using his own? Well, in a relationship, both should agree on the method of protection. If she's refusing to let him use his own, that's a problem. But he's the one who prepared his own, so maybe he's not wrong for wanting to use it. However, if she's pressuring him to use hers, and he's uncomfortable, maybe he's right to leave. But the friend calling him an asshole might be because they think he's being controlling or not trusting her. \n\nBut the bigger issue is that if she's using her own condom, maybe she wants to have unprotected sex. If she's not using a condom, she's trying to get pregnant. So maybe he's right to leave because he doesn't want to risk pregnancy. However, the way he's handling it is by not using a condom, which is conflicting. Wait, no\u2014he's the one who brought a condom and she wanted to use hers. But he refused to use hers, so he didn't use a condom at all? Wait, the original post says he had a condom, she said to use hers, he insisted on his, she said no, then he left. So he didn't use a condom at all? Wait, the user says \"I say I already have it and start unwrapping it. Here\u2019s where she gets persistent. She hops up and says \u201cNo we\u2019re using mine,\u201d and says she won\u2019t let me until we use one she had.\" So he was going to use his own, but she refused and wanted to use hers. Then he couldn't use any condom? Or did he end up not using a condom? The story isn't clear. The user text says he \"put on my clothes, did the ol\u2019 reliable waistband tuck, though there wasn\u2019t much to tuck at this point.\" So he left without using a condom. So he didn't use any. But he had his own. \n\nSo the problem is that he didn't use a condom because he refused to use hers. If he's not using a condom, that's a risk for STIs. If she's using her own, maybe she's trying to get pregnant. He might not be in the wrong if he's not comfortable with her using her own, but he also didn't use any protection. That's risky. If he's not on birth control or doesn't want to risk pregnancy, not using a condom is the wrong choice. But he's in the wrong because he's not using protection, but the situation is complicated because she's pressuring him to use hers. \n\nSo maybe the author is at fault for not using a condom at all, but the girl is also at fault for pressuring him to use hers instead of his. However, in terms of responsibility for STI protection, both should be using their own. But if she's using hers, maybe that's okay. The problem is that he was prepared with his own and she wanted to use hers. If he's not comfortable with that, leaving might be the right choice. But if he's not using any condom, that's a problem. Wait, he left because she refused to let him use his own. So he left without having sex. So he didn't have sex without a condom. So maybe he's not in the wrong because he chose not to have unprotected sex. \n\nBut the question is whether he's in the wrong for not using his own condom. If he left, he didn't use any. If he had stayed and used hers, he would have. But he left because she wouldn't let him use his own. So he's in the wrong if he's not using a condom, but in this case, he didn't have sex. Alternatively, maybe he's not in the wrong because he's standing up for himself and not allowing someone to pressure him into using their condom. \n\nThis is a tough one. The key points are: he had his own, she wanted to use hers. He left. The girl and her friend are upset. The user is wondering if he should have gone along. If the girl wants to use her own, maybe she's trying to get pregnant. If he doesn't want to risk that, he's right to leave. But if he's not using a condom at all, that's risky. However, in this case, he didn't have sex. So maybe he's not in the wrong. \n\nAlternatively, if he had his own condom and she wanted to use hers, perhaps he should have used hers as well. But the problem is that he was bringing his own. If he's not comfortable with her using hers, but she's pressuring him, then maybe he's right to leave. \n\nSo the answer is B (No, the author is not in the wrong) because he chose not to have unprotected sex, which is responsible, and the pressure from her to use her condom is concerning. He's standing up for his boundaries.\n"
