Of course I came prepared with a Trojan fresh out the box popped into my pocket. I get there and you know blah blah happens and eventually I pull the condom out before insertion. She says \u201cno no, there\u2019s no need, I have some\u201d but I say I already have it and start unwrapping it. Here\u2019s where she gets persistent. She hops up and says \u201cNo we\u2019re using mine,\u201d and says she won\u2019t let me until we use one she had. Now she had mentioned wanting kids soon, like in 2 months soon, but thought we\u2019d just maybe mess around for a week or two and that\u2019d be it. I thought nothing of it originally and honestly now I was scared. I said \u201cno, why\u2019re you so persistent.\u201d She then states that if I wasn\u2019t to use hers, I might as well leave. So I put on my clothes, did the ol\u2019 reliable waistband tuck, though there wasn\u2019t much to tuck at this point. I now was texted by her friend calling me an asshole and making a big deal out of nothing. I am starting to get second thoughts and thought I should\u2019ve went along\n\nTL;DR: girl wouldn\u2019t let me use my own condom, said i couldn\u2019t smash until I used hers\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to figure this out. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The situation is about a guy who brought his own condom to his girlfriend, but she insisted on using hers. He tried to use his, she refused, and now her friend is upset with him.\n\nFirst, I need to consider consent and autonomy. Both partners have the right to make decisions about their bodies and sexual health. The guy had his own condom ready, which shows he was responsible. But the girl was firm about using hers. Maybe she had a reason, like preferring her brand, or maybe she wanted to be in control of the situation. \n\nThe guy thought she mentioned wanting kids soon, but they were only dating for a few weeks. That part is a bit confusing. If she wanted to avoid pregnancy, using a condom makes sense. However, if she really wanted to have unprotected sex, maybe she had a different plan, but he might not have known that clearly.\n\nThe key point here is mutual consent. The guy was trying to use his condom, which he had prepared, but the girl refused. However, she also said she wouldn't let him proceed unless he used hers. That sounds like a form of consent to use a condom, just not his. But the guy didn't use hers either, so he ended up not using any. Wait, no, he says he tried to use his own, she refused, and then he left. Wait, no, in the story, he says he tried to use his, she insisted on using hers, but then he didn't use hers. Wait, the story says: he pulled out his condom, she said \"no, use mine,\" and he tried to use his own. She got persistent and said he had to use hers. He refused, she said to leave. Then he left. So he didn't end up using a condom. But later, her friend is upset. \n\nWait, maybe the confusion is about whether using her condom was necessary. If the girl wanted to have unprotected sex, but the guy didn't want to, then not using a condom could be risky. But the girl was insistent on using hers, which might mean she wanted to use a condom, but not his. The guy didn't comply, so he didn't use any. But why would her friend call him an asshole? Maybe because he didn't use a condom, leading to potential pregnancy or STI risk. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the girl had a medical reason or preference for her own condoms. But the guy didn't respect her decision. However, the guy was trying to use his own, and she refused. The guy then left. But if he left, then they didn't have sex. But the story says he \"put on my clothes, did the waistband tuck,\" implying he left before having sex. So he didn't have sex because she refused to use his condom and he refused to use hers. \n\nIn that case, the guy didn't force her to use his, and she refused to proceed without using hers. So maybe he's not in the wrong because he was respecting her boundary by not using his, but she wouldn't let him proceed without using hers. However, the issue is that he didn't use any condom, so if she wanted to use a condom (hers), then he didn't comply, leading to potential risk. \n\nBut wait, if she wanted to have unprotected sex, then using a condom would be against her wishes. But the guy was trying to use a condom, which is responsible. However, if she was insistent on not using any, then he should respect that. But she was insistent on using hers, not on not using any. So there's a misunderstanding here. The guy thought she wanted to use her own, but he didn't want to, so he left. But if she wanted to use a condom (hers), then he should have used hers. By not using hers, he didn't protect her, which could be a problem. \n\nThis is a bit of a gray area. The guy had the right to prepare with his own condom, but the girl had the right to prefer hers. If they couldn't agree, maybe they shouldn't have proceeded. The guy left, so no harm was done. But the friend is upset with him, maybe because he didn't use a condom. If the girl was trying to encourage him to use hers, then not using any is problematic. However, the guy didn't have to use hers if he didn't want to, but she was insistent. \n\nIn terms of responsibility, both should communicate better. The guy could have asked why she wanted to use hers, or they could have found a compromise. Since he left, he didn't proceed with the act, so he's not in the wrong for not using his own. However, the friend's judgment might be misplaced. The answer might be B (he's not in the wrong) because he left and didn't proceed, but maybe A if the friend's issue is about not using a condom. But the main issue is about mutual consent. If she refused to proceed without hers, and he left, then he's not in the wrong. However, if the problem is that he didn't use any, then maybe he is. But since he left, he didn't have sex, so no harm. Maybe the answer is B.\n"
