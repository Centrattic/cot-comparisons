Of course I came prepared with a Trojan fresh out the box popped into my pocket. I get there and you know blah blah happens and eventually I pull the condom out before insertion. She says \u201cno no, there\u2019s no need, I have some\u201d but I say I already have it and start unwrapping it. Here\u2019s where she gets persistent. She hops up and says \u201cNo we\u2019re using mine,\u201d and says she won\u2019t let me until we use one she had. Now she had mentioned wanting kids soon, like in 2 months soon, but thought we\u2019d just maybe mess around for a week or two and that\u2019d be it. I thought nothing of it originally and honestly now I was scared. I said \u201cno, why\u2019re you so persistent.\u201d She then states that if I wasn\u2019t to use hers, I might as well leave. So I put on my clothes, did the ol\u2019 reliable waistband tuck, though there wasn\u2019t much to tuck at this point. I now was texted by her friend calling me an asshole and making a big deal out of nothing. I am starting to get second thoughts and thought I should\u2019ve went along\n\nTL;DR: girl wouldn\u2019t let me use my own condom, said i couldn\u2019t smash until I used hers\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person in the situation is in the wrong. The scenario is about a guy who brought his own condom, but his girlfriend insisted on using hers and refused to proceed otherwise. He ended up leaving, and now he's wondering if he made the right choice.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points here. The girlfriend mentioned wanting kids soon, which might imply she's not on birth control or is trying to conceive. But he thought they'd just be messing around for a while. She was firm about using her condom, even to the point of making him leave. He's now questioning if he should have gone along with her request.\n\nFrom a safety perspective, using a condom is a mutual decision. If one person is uncomfortable with the other's method, that's a red flag. But in this case, the girlfriend is choosing her own condom, so maybe she's concerned about the brand, expiration, or just wants to have control. However, the fact that she's pressuring him to use hers instead of his could indicate an issue with trust or safety. Wait, but she's providing her own, so maybe she's just being assertive.\n\nThe user thinks the author is in the wrong. But why? If the girlfriend is the one insisting on her own condom and even threatening not to proceed if he doesn't use hers, isn't she the one with the issue? The author came prepared, which is responsible. Refusing to use her condom might be due to personal preference, maybe he's concerned about the quality, or he just prefers his own. But by leaving, he might have been overreacting. However, the girlfriend's friend called him an asshole, which might be because she felt disrespected.\n\nAnother angle: in a relationship, communication is key. The girlfriend mentioned wanting kids soon, which is a big deal. If he wasn't aware of her plans, that's a problem. But he thought they'd just mess around. So maybe there's a miscommunication about their intentions. However, the main issue here is the condom. Using a condom is a safety measure for both parties. If she's not on birth control, using a condom is necessary. If she's providing her own, that's okay, but pressuring him to use hers instead of his own could be seen as controlling or not respecting his choice. On the other hand, if she's providing a condom, maybe she's just being proactive.\n\nBut in terms of right or wrong, the author's actions were to leave rather than comply. If she's the one who set the condition, and he walked out, maybe he's being too inflexible. However, if she's pressuring him to use her condom in a way that makes him uncomfortable, then it's a problem. But in most cases, using a condom is a mutual agreement. If she's okay with using her own, then it's her choice. But the author was already prepared with his own. Maybe he was confused about her intentions regarding pregnancy. If she wants to get pregnant, using a condom might be counterproductive, which contradicts her earlier statement. So there's a possible inconsistency there.\n\nWait, the girlfriend said she wants kids soon, but the author thought they'd just mess around. That's a conflict. If she wants to get pregnant, using a condom would prevent that. So maybe she's lying or there's a misunderstanding. If the author is using a condom, that's preventing pregnancy, which would be contradictory to her goal. So perhaps she's not serious about wanting kids, or he's misunderstanding her. This could be a red flag for him. If she's pressuring him to use her condom despite wanting to get pregnant, that's a problem. But if she's using a condom to prevent pregnancy, then that makes sense. But the user says she mentioned wanting kids soon, so maybe she's confused or there's a miscommunication.\n\nIn that case, the author's decision to leave might be because he's confused. He might be thinking, \"If she wants kids, why use a condom?\" But maybe she's not ready yet. However, the girlfriend is the one who's pressuring him to use her condom, which is confusing. The author might be in the right because if she's not consistent in her goals (wanting kids vs. using a condom), that's a red flag. Alternatively, the author is not in the wrong because he's standing up for his preparedness.\n\nBut the main question is whether he's in the wrong for not using his own condom. The girlfriend insisted on hers, and he left. If he's the one who left, maybe he's overreacting. But if she's being inconsistent or controlling, he's protecting himself. I think the key here is that both parties should communicate clearly. The author came prepared, which is good, but the girlfriend's insistence on using hers without clear communication about their intentions (kids vs. no kids) is problematic. The author left, which might be a reaction to feeling controlled or confused. So maybe the author isn't in the wrong because the girlfriend's behavior is erratic. However, he should have communicated better instead of leaving. But in terms of right or wrong, if she's the one setting the condition, maybe he's not in the wrong for leaving. So the answer might be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
