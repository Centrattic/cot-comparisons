Of course I came prepared with a Trojan fresh out the box popped into my pocket. I get there and you know blah blah happens and eventually I pull the condom out before insertion. She says \u201cno no, there\u2019s no need, I have some\u201d but I say I already have it and start unwrapping it. Here\u2019s where she gets persistent. She hops up and says \u201cNo we\u2019re using mine,\u201d and says she won\u2019t let me until we use one she had. Now she had mentioned wanting kids soon, like in 2 months soon, but thought we\u2019d just maybe mess around for a week or two and that\u2019d be it. I thought nothing of it originally and honestly now I was scared. I said \u201cno, why\u2019re you so persistent.\u201d She then states that if I wasn\u2019t to use hers, I might as well leave. So I put on my clothes, did the ol\u2019 reliable waistband tuck, though there wasn\u2019t much to tuck at this point. I now was texted by her friend calling me an asshole and making a big deal out of nothing. I am starting to get second thoughts and thought I should\u2019ve went along\n\nTL;DR: girl wouldn\u2019t let me use my own condom, said i couldn\u2019t smash until I used hers\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The situation involves a girlfriend not wanting to use the author's condom and insisting on using hers. The author then decides not to proceed and leaves, but the girlfriend's friend is upset about it.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The author had a condom ready, which is responsible behavior. However, the girlfriend is insistent on using hers, even going as far as to say he can't have sex unless he uses hers. The author is confused because she mentioned wanting kids soon, which might imply she's on birth control. But he feels scared, maybe because he's not sure about her health status or other reasons. He refuses and leaves, but her friend is upset, leading him to question his decision.\n\nNow, the question is about right or wrong. Consent and safety are critical here. The author was prepared with his own condom, which is a sign he's considering safe sex. The girlfriend is pushing back, perhaps for personal reasons like preferring her method, being on birth control, or maybe not trusting his. By not using his own condom and instead using hers, he's following her preference, but if he's uncomfortable or unsure about her reasons, that's a red flag. However, in the story, he says he's scared but doesn't explain why. If he's worried about STIs, using her condom might not resolve that unless he's certain it's clean and safe. Alternatively, maybe he's uncomfortable with her taking control of the situation. \n\nBut the main issue is consent and mutual agreement. If she's on birth control and wants to get pregnant, maybe she's not at risk of unintended pregnancy, but STI risks still exist. The author's choice to leave because she refused his condom could be seen as standing by his decision to use protection, which is responsible. However, if he's not in a committed monogamous relationship, that's different. Wait, the user says \"girlfriend,\" so maybe they are in a monogamous relationship. If that's the case, and he trusts her and she's on birth control, then using her condom might be okay. But the author didn't specify if they are monogamous or if he trusts her with STIs. \n\nThe friend's reaction of calling him an asshole might indicate that the girlfriend's insistence was unreasonable or that the author was right to leave. But the author is now second-guessing. The key is whether using the girlfriend's condom was necessary. If he's in a monogamous relationship where both are tested and on birth control, then maybe the condom isn't needed, and his own choice to use it is reasonable. But if she's not on birth control, using her condom might be necessary for pregnancy prevention. However, the author is uncomfortable and leaves. \n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? Well, he was prepared with his own, but she wanted to use hers. If he's not comfortable using hers (maybe he's not sure about her reasons, her health, or if it's a safe choice), then he's right to refuse. Consent is mutual, so pushing someone to use a specific method without agreement can be a problem. However, if she's in a position where she's comfortable with using her own and he's not in a monogamous relationship, then maybe he should have used hers. But the story doesn't clarify that. \n\nIn terms of right or wrong, using a condom for protection is a responsible action. If the girlfriend is pressuring him to not use his own, maybe she's downplaying the risks. The author's choice to leave might be in line with his values and safety, so he's not in the wrong. However, if the relationship is monogamous and he trusts her, then maybe he is overstepping by not using her method. But without that context, the author's decision to leave due to discomfort could be justified. \n\nTherefore, the answer might be B (No), because asserting one's own boundaries regarding sexual health is important, and the girlfriend's friend shouldn't have judged him for that. However, if the girlfriend was on birth control and the author didn't need a condom for pregnancy but for STIs, then maybe the author is in the wrong if he's not in a monogamous relationship. But the story doesn't state that. The author mentions \"smash,\" which might be a typo for \"sex,\" and the girlfriend's insistence could be about other reasons. Since the author was prepared but chose to follow her preference regardless of his comfort, that's a bit confusing. Wait, the author didn't use his own condom because she insisted on using hers. So he didn't use a condom at all? Wait, no. Wait, the user says \"the person who wrote this in the wrong in the following situation?\" The situation is the author didn't use his own condom. The girlfriend said not to use his, and he left. Wait, the original post says \"the girl wouldn\u2019t let me use my own condom, said I couldn\u2019t smash until I used hers.\" So the author had a condom, tried to use it, but she refused, so he didn't use any. Then he left. So he didn't use a condom. But the girlfriend's friend is upset. \n\nWait, the user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not using his own condom. If he had a condom and she refused, and he chose not to proceed, then he's not in the wrong for not using it. But if he proceeded without any condom, that's a problem. However, the story says he left. So he didn't have sex. Therefore, the issue is about the refusal to use his own condom, leading to no sex. The friend is upset that he didn't use hers. \n\nSo in this case, the author is in the right if he was respecting his own boundaries. However, if the girlfriend is on birth control and the author is not concerned about STIs, then using her method is acceptable. But if he's not in a monogamous relationship, then using her condom might not be safe. The key is whether using her condom was a safe and mutually agreed option. Since the author is unsure and leaves, he's prioritizing his safety. Therefore, the answer is B (No), the author is not in the wrong for not using his own condom if he chose not to proceed at all. But wait, the author says he \"wouldn't let me until we use one she had.\" So he was going to use her condom but then decided not to. Wait, the original post says \"I thought nothing of it originally and honestly now I was scared. I said no, why\u2019re you so persistent.\" Then she says to leave. He leaves. So he didn't use a condom at all. The girlfriend's friend is upset because he didn't use hers. \n\nSo the question is whether the author is in the wrong for not using his own condom, but in this case, he didn't use any. So he left the situation. That's a responsible action. However, if the girlfriend's insistence was about using hers, and he refused without understanding her reasons, maybe he's in the wrong. But without knowing her reasons (like she's on birth control, or other factors), it's hard to say. The author's decision to leave could be seen as standing up for his own safety. Therefore, the answer is B (No), he's not in the wrong.\n"
