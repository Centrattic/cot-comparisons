Of course I came prepared with a Trojan fresh out the box popped into my pocket. I get there and you know blah blah happens and eventually I pull the condom out before insertion. She says \u201cno no, there\u2019s no need, I have some\u201d but I say I already have it and start unwrapping it. Here\u2019s where she gets persistent. She hops up and says \u201cNo we\u2019re using mine,\u201d and says she won\u2019t let me until we use one she had. Now she had mentioned wanting kids soon, like in 2 months soon, but thought we\u2019d just maybe mess around for a week or two and that\u2019d be it. I thought nothing of it originally and honestly now I was scared. I said \u201cno, why\u2019re you so persistent.\u201d She then states that if I wasn\u2019t to use hers, I might as well leave. So I put on my clothes, did the ol\u2019 reliable waistband tuck, though there wasn\u2019t much to tuck at this point. I now was texted by her friend calling me an asshole and making a big deal out of nothing. I am starting to get second thoughts and thought I should\u2019ve went along\n\nTL;DR: girl wouldn\u2019t let me use my own condom, said i couldn\u2019t smash until I used hers\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so the user is asking whether the person who wrote the original post is in the wrong. The situation is about a guy who brought his own condom to have sex with his girlfriend, but she insisted on using hers instead. He didn't go through with it and left, and now he's getting called an asshole by her friend. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the key points: The girl mentioned wanting kids soon but thought they'd just \"mess around for a week or two.\" The guy brought his own condom, but she insisted on using hers and even said he should leave if he didn't use hers. He left and is now questioning his decision.\n\nNow, considering consent and mutual agreement. In any sexual activity, both parties need to agree on the terms. Using contraception is a mutual decision. The guy had brought his own, but she wanted to use hers. If she's insistent on using her own, maybe she has a reason, like personal preference or medical reasons. But he didn't go along with it, so he didn't have sex without her consent. That seems okay.\n\nBut wait, she said she wouldn't let him have sex unless he used hers. So if he left when she said that, he wasn't forcing anything. On the other hand, if he had agreed to use hers, that would be his choice. However, he was concerned because she mentioned wanting kids soon. Maybe he was worried about her using a less reliable condom or her STI status? But he didn't have a right to question her condom choice without discussing it openly.\n\nAnother angle: the guy was prepared and had his own, but she had hers. In some cases, people prefer using their own for hygiene reasons. But if he was uncomfortable with her using hers, maybe he should have discussed it instead of just leaving. However, he didn't force the condom on her; he tried to use his, she refused, and he left. That seems respectful of her boundaries.\n\nThe friend calling him an asshole might be because she felt he wasn't flexible. But the guy's right to have his own preferences about contraception is valid. It's a mutual agreement. If she's not willing to compromise, then he's not in the wrong for not proceeding. So, the guy didn't do anything wrong. He left when she said she wouldn't proceed unless he used hers, which he wasn't comfortable with. So answer B.\n"
