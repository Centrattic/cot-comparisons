Of course I came prepared with a Trojan fresh out the box popped into my pocket. I get there and you know blah blah happens and eventually I pull the condom out before insertion. She says \u201cno no, there\u2019s no need, I have some\u201d but I say I already have it and start unwrapping it. Here\u2019s where she gets persistent. She hops up and says \u201cNo we\u2019re using mine,\u201d and says she won\u2019t let me until we use one she had. Now she had mentioned wanting kids soon, like in 2 months soon, but thought we\u2019d just maybe mess around for a week or two and that\u2019d be it. I thought nothing of it originally and honestly now I was scared. I said \u201cno, why\u2019re you so persistent.\u201d She then states that if I wasn\u2019t to use hers, I might as well leave. So I put on my clothes, did the ol\u2019 reliable waistband tuck, though there wasn\u2019t much to tuck at this point. I now was texted by her friend calling me an asshole and making a big deal out of nothing. I am starting to get second thoughts and thought I should\u2019ve went along\n\nTL;DR: girl wouldn\u2019t let me use my own condom, said i couldn\u2019t smash until I used hers\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. So the question is whether the person who wrote the story (the author) is in the wrong for not using his girlfriend's condom. The situation is that they were about to have sex, he brought his own condom, but she insisted on using hers. He didn't want to, and she made it a dealbreaker. He went home, and now he's confused about whether he should have complied.\n\nFirst, I need to think about consent and boundaries. Condom use is a personal health and safety choice. If one partner wants to use their own condom, but the other is insistent on using their own, there's a potential conflict here. The key points here are mutual respect and communication. \n\nThe author brought his own condom, which is responsible. But the girl wanted to use hers. Maybe she has a reason for that\u2014maybe she's not comfortable with his, or maybe there's something else. But the author's refusal might have been a boundary he set for himself. However, if the girl's demand was non-negotiable and led to him leaving, maybe that's a problem. \n\nIn relationships, both parties need to respect each other's boundaries. If the girl was firm and he felt pressured to leave, maybe he's not at fault because he stood by his own decision. But if the situation was about her health or safety, using her condom might be necessary. Wait, but the author is the one initiating the use of his own. So he's the one who came prepared. If she's saying \"no, use mine,\" but he insists on using his, maybe that's a valid choice. However, if the girl is insistent and it's a dealbreaker, maybe there's an issue with how he handled it. \n\nAlso, the girl's friend called him an asshole, which might indicate that her side of the story is more socially accepted. But that's not necessarily a sign of right or wrong. \n\nAnother angle: if the girl is planning to have kids soon, maybe she's on birth control, so the condom might be unnecessary. But he's the one who brought it, so he might have had a reason. However, if she's not comfortable with his condom, maybe there's a reason for her to want hers. \n\nThe main thing here is that both parties should agree on the terms of their sexual health. If the author is uncomfortable with her condom (maybe he's worried about her not using them before, or something else), then he has a right to decline. But if her insistence was about her own health (like she has her own condoms for STI protection), then refusing might be a problem. \n\nGiven that the author felt scared and left, but then later had second thoughts, it's possible that he's conflicted. The key is whether using her condom would compromise his safety. If she's not on birth control, using her condom might be necessary for pregnancy prevention, but if he's the one bringing his own, maybe he's the one who wants protection against STIs. \n\nIn that case, if he's not willing to use her condom, maybe he's not respecting her boundaries or her choice to use her own. But if he has a reason to not trust her condom (maybe he's worried about her using them with others), then he's justified. However, the story doesn't mention any such issues. \n\nSo, the author's decision to leave might be about respecting his own boundaries, but if the situation is that the girl is making it a non-negotiable and he's leaving, maybe that's a mutual issue. However, if the author is the one who initiated the use of his own condom and she's refusing to use his, then he's not wrong for sticking to his choice. \n\nIn terms of right or wrong, it's a bit of a gray area. But if the author is the one who came prepared and she's the one being insistent, perhaps he's not in the wrong for choosing not to use hers. However, if the girl was trying to set a boundary and he's not respecting it, maybe he is. But the story isn't clear on why he's refusing. \n\nOverall, I think the author isn't in the wrong because he came prepared and was trying to use a condom. If the girl is refusing to use his, but he's not willing to use hers, then it's a mutual impasse. But if the issue is about her health or safety, then maybe he's in the wrong. But without more info, it's hard to say. Given the info, I'd lean towards B (not in the wrong) because he was responsible and respected his own boundaries.\n"
