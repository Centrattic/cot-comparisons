Of course I came prepared with a Trojan fresh out the box popped into my pocket. I get there and you know blah blah happens and eventually I pull the condom out before insertion. She says \u201cno no, there\u2019s no need, I have some\u201d but I say I already have it and start unwrapping it. Here\u2019s where she gets persistent. She hops up and says \u201cNo we\u2019re using mine,\u201d and says she won\u2019t let me until we use one she had. Now she had mentioned wanting kids soon, like in 2 months soon, but thought we\u2019d just maybe mess around for a week or two and that\u2019d be it. I thought nothing of it originally and honestly now I was scared. I said \u201cno, why\u2019re you so persistent.\u201d She then states that if I wasn\u2019t to use hers, I might as well leave. So I put on my clothes, did the ol\u2019 reliable waistband tuck, though there wasn\u2019t much to tuck at this point. I now was texted by her friend calling me an asshole and making a big deal out of nothing. I am starting to get second thoughts and thought I should\u2019ve went along\n\nTL;DR: girl wouldn\u2019t let me use my own condom, said i couldn\u2019t smash until I used hers\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The situation is about a guy who went over to his girlfriend and had a condom with him. They were about to have sex, and he tried to use the one he brought, but she insisted on using hers. He mentions that she had mentioned wanting kids soon, but he thought they'd just \"mess around for a week or two\" and that wouldn't be an issue. When she refused to use his condom and said he should leave if he didn't use hers, he left. Now he's confused because her friend called him an asshole, and he's wondering if he did the right thing.\n\nFirst, the key points here are consent and control over the situation. Consent is mutual and should be enthusiastic. If the woman refused to proceed unless he used her condom, that's her choice, right? But wait, the guy had his own condom. If she was okay with using his, then why the pushback? Maybe she wanted to use her own for some reason\u2014maybe she brought them for a reason, or maybe she's been in a situation where she had to use her own. But the problem here is that the guy was trying to use his own, and she wouldn't let him. If she said no to his condom, but he still insisted, that could be a problem. But in this case, he stopped when she said no. Wait, no\u2014the original story says he had already started unwrapping his condom when she said no. He tried to use his own, then she insisted on hers. He then said he was scared and left. So he didn't proceed against her wishes.\n\nBut the question is whether he's in the wrong. In terms of consent, both parties should agree on the terms. If she is asserting her choice to use her own condom, and he's trying to use his, but she says no, then he should respect her choice. But if she's refusing to proceed unless he uses her condom, and he leaves, is that his right? Or is he wrong for not using hers?\n\nWait, maybe the issue is that he was prepared and had his own, but she had hers. If she's comfortable using her own, then he should go along with that. But if he's not comfortable using her condom (maybe he's worried about STIs and wants to use his own for control), but she's refusing, then that's a conflict. However, in this case, the guy didn't push back. He left when she said she wouldn't proceed unless he used hers. But her friend called him an asshole. So maybe the culture here is that using his own is the norm, and she's being controlling. But consent is about mutual agreement. If she's saying she won't proceed unless he uses her condom, and he leaves, is that his right? Or is he wrong for not following her lead?\n\nAlso, the guy mentions she had mentioned wanting kids soon, which is a bit confusing. If she wants kids soon, why use a condom at all? Maybe she's on birth control, but that's not stated. Or maybe she's using condoms for STI protection. Or perhaps she's not ready to have sex. The guy thought they would just \"mess around for a week or two,\" but she wanted to use a condom. Maybe the conflict is about readiness. The guy might have thought it was okay to proceed, but she had her own boundaries. However, he had the agency to leave if he felt uncomfortable. So, is he in the wrong for not using her condom and leaving? Or is she in the wrong for not allowing his? \n\nIn terms of consent, both parties need to agree. If she refused to proceed unless he used her condom, and he left, he's respecting her boundaries. But the problem is that he started with his own, then she said no, and he left. If he left, that's his choice, but maybe she felt pressured. However, the friend calling him an asshole suggests that maybe she wanted him to proceed with her terms, but he didn't. So the question is whether leaving was wrong. If she's asserting her choice, and he's leaving because he's not comfortable using her condom, maybe that's his right. But if he came prepared with his own, maybe he should have used hers if she was comfortable with it. \n\nWait, but using her condom is a valid choice. If she provided one, and he's willing to use it, then he should. But the guy's hesitation might be about safety. If he's not sure about her STI status, using his own might be a way to control that. But if she's insisting on hers, maybe she's more comfortable with the brand or has her own reason. The problem here is that he tried to use his, she said no, and he left. So he didn't proceed against her wishes. That seems okay. However, the friend calling him an asshole might indicate a cultural norm where using his own is expected, but consent is about mutual agreement. So if she's saying no to his condom, then using hers is acceptable. Therefore, leaving might be his choice, and he's not in the wrong. Alternatively, maybe he should have used hers if he was okay with that. But if he's uncomfortable, he's allowed to leave. So the answer might be B (No, he's not in the wrong) because he respected her boundaries and left when she said no. But some might argue that he should have used her condom if she was insistent. Hmm. Alternatively, if he had his own and she wanted to use hers, maybe he should have gone along with that. But the issue is that he was scared, so maybe he left. So it's a bit ambiguous, but in terms of consent, leaving when she says no is his right. Therefore, he's not in the wrong.\n"
