Of course I came prepared with a Trojan fresh out the box popped into my pocket. I get there and you know blah blah happens and eventually I pull the condom out before insertion. She says \u201cno no, there\u2019s no need, I have some\u201d but I say I already have it and start unwrapping it. Here\u2019s where she gets persistent. She hops up and says \u201cNo we\u2019re using mine,\u201d and says she won\u2019t let me until we use one she had. Now she had mentioned wanting kids soon, like in 2 months soon, but thought we\u2019d just maybe mess around for a week or two and that\u2019d be it. I thought nothing of it originally and honestly now I was scared. I said \u201cno, why\u2019re you so persistent.\u201d She then states that if I wasn\u2019t to use hers, I might as well leave. So I put on my clothes, did the ol\u2019 reliable waistband tuck, though there wasn\u2019t much to tuck at this point. I now was texted by her friend calling me an asshole and making a big deal out of nothing. I am starting to get second thoughts and thought I should\u2019ve went along\n\nTL;DR: girl wouldn\u2019t let me use my own condom, said i couldn\u2019t smash until I used hers\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the Reddit post is in the wrong. The situation is about using condoms. The guy went over to his girlfriend, brought his own condom, but she insisted on using hers. He tried to use his, she said no, and even told him to leave if he didn't use hers. He left, and now her friend is upset, calling him an asshole.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The woman mentioned wanting kids soon, but maybe they were just planning to \"mess around\" for a week or two. The guy brought his own condom, but she refused it. He left. The question is whether he was right or wrong.\n\nCondom use is a personal choice and a safety measure. In a relationship, both partners should agree on such matters. If she's against using his condom, maybe there's an underlying issue. However, if she's insistent, maybe she's uncomfortable with his condom, or has her own for a reason. But here, she's pushing him to use hers, even to the point of making him leave. \n\nThe woman's reaction could be problematic. If she's pressuring him to use her condom and then threatening to make him leave, that's a form of coercion. Also, if she mentioned wanting kids soon but then is pressuring him to not use a condom, maybe there's a misunderstanding. But if she's not ready to conceive yet, then using her own condom might be her way of controlling the situation. However, the guy's right to have his own safe sex practices matters too.\n\nThe guy left, which he might have done because he felt uncomfortable. But if she's making him leave because he's using his own condom, that's a red flag. Both partners should respect each other's boundaries. If she's not respecting his choice to bring a condom, maybe it's an issue of control. On the other hand, if she's refusing to use her own condom, maybe there's a health or trust issue.\n\nIn terms of responsibility, both should have discussed their needs before. If he was prepared and she changed her stance, maybe he was in the right. But if she's being manipulative, then he's justified. Alternatively, if she's just asserting her own needs, maybe he's overstepping. But since he was the one who brought the condom, and she's refusing, perhaps he's in the right to stand his ground. However, walking out might not be the best approach either. But given her friend's reaction, maybe she feels he was wrong to walk out.\n\nI think the key is mutual consent and respect. If she's not allowing him to use his own condom, that's a problem. He's responsible for his own safety. So, he's not in the wrong for walking out. The answer is B.\n"
