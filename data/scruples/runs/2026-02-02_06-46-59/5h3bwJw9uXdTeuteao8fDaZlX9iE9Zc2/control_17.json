Of course I came prepared with a Trojan fresh out the box popped into my pocket. I get there and you know blah blah happens and eventually I pull the condom out before insertion. She says \u201cno no, there\u2019s no need, I have some\u201d but I say I already have it and start unwrapping it. Here\u2019s where she gets persistent. She hops up and says \u201cNo we\u2019re using mine,\u201d and says she won\u2019t let me until we use one she had. Now she had mentioned wanting kids soon, like in 2 months soon, but thought we\u2019d just maybe mess around for a week or two and that\u2019d be it. I thought nothing of it originally and honestly now I was scared. I said \u201cno, why\u2019re you so persistent.\u201d She then states that if I wasn\u2019t to use hers, I might as well leave. So I put on my clothes, did the ol\u2019 reliable waistband tuck, though there wasn\u2019t much to tuck at this point. I now was texted by her friend calling me an asshole and making a big deal out of nothing. I am starting to get second thoughts and thought I should\u2019ve went along\n\nTL;DR: girl wouldn\u2019t let me use my own condom, said i couldn\u2019t smash until I used hers\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for not using his girlfriend's condom. The situation is that he brought his own, but she insisted on using hers and wouldn't proceed unless he used hers. He left because he refused, and now he's getting messages from her friend calling him an asshole. He's second-guessing himself.\n\nFirst, I need to recall the basics of consent and sexual health. Condom use is a personal health and safety issue. Both parties have the right to decide which condoms they use, but there might be some nuances here. If the woman is on birth control or using another method, maybe she's not as concerned about pregnancy. However, STI protection is another angle. Using a condom is a common way to prevent STIs, so not using one could be a risk.\n\nBut in this case, the man brought his own, and she wanted to use hers. There's no indication that she's pressuring him to not use a condom at all. Maybe she prefers her brand, or maybe she wants to use her own for some reason. However, the man's decision to use his own is his right. The woman's refusal to proceed unless he uses hers could be seen as a form of pressure. If she's making it a condition, that could be a problem because it's not his choice anymore. \n\nBut then again, if she's not forcing him to have sex without a condom, which she isn't, and she's just choosing her own, maybe that's within her rights. Wait, but he was prepared with his own, and she's insisting on hers. There's a question of whether using a different condom is acceptable. If she's not against using a condom, just the brand or ownership, maybe it's a minor issue. But if he's uncomfortable using hers, he can't be forced. However, in this case, he left instead of using hers. Is that right?\n\nAlso, the woman mentioned wanting kids soon, but maybe she's not ready for that yet. If he's not ready to have kids, using a condom is his way of preventing that. If she's not on birth control, maybe she's relying on the condom. But he's the one bringing the condom. So maybe he's taking responsibility for protection. \n\nThe key point here is consent to the method of contraception. If she's not willing to let him use his condom, and he's not willing to use hers, then proceeding is not possible. The man left, which is his choice. But if she's making it a non-negotiable condition, that's a problem. However, if he's not willing to comply, he's within his right to leave. \n\nIn terms of being in the wrong, the man isn't wrong for not using his own condom. He had the right to bring his own, and if she's not allowing that, and he's not comfortable using hers, then his choice to leave is valid. However, if there's a risk of STIs and he's using a condom to protect himself, and she's not allowing it, that's a different angle. But in the scenario, it's unclear if they're both on the same page regarding STI protection. \n\nThe woman's friend calling him an asshole might be a red herring. The main issue is mutual agreement. If they can't agree on a method, then neither should proceed. So the author isn't in the wrong for standing by his own choice. Therefore, the answer is B.\n"
