Of course I came prepared with a Trojan fresh out the box popped into my pocket. I get there and you know blah blah happens and eventually I pull the condom out before insertion. She says \u201cno no, there\u2019s no need, I have some\u201d but I say I already have it and start unwrapping it. Here\u2019s where she gets persistent. She hops up and says \u201cNo we\u2019re using mine,\u201d and says she won\u2019t let me until we use one she had. Now she had mentioned wanting kids soon, like in 2 months soon, but thought we\u2019d just maybe mess around for a week or two and that\u2019d be it. I thought nothing of it originally and honestly now I was scared. I said \u201cno, why\u2019re you so persistent.\u201d She then states that if I wasn\u2019t to use hers, I might as well leave. So I put on my clothes, did the ol\u2019 reliable waistband tuck, though there wasn\u2019t much to tuck at this point. I now was texted by her friend calling me an asshole and making a big deal out of nothing. I am starting to get second thoughts and thought I should\u2019ve went along\n\nTL;DR: girl wouldn\u2019t let me use my own condom, said i couldn\u2019t smash until I used hers\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for not using the girlfriend's condom when she insisted on using hers. \n\nFirst, the situation: The author went over to his girlfriend, brought his own condom, but she refused to use it and insisted on using hers. He tried to use his, she said no, and even threatened to have him leave if he didn't use hers. He left and now is being criticized.\n\nSo, the main issue here is about consent and control over one's own body. Condoms are a personal choice, and both parties should agree on what they use. The girl saying she \"won't let me\" until he uses hers might indicate a power dynamic. If she's refusing to proceed unless he uses her condom, that could be a form of pressure or even coercion. The author might be in the right because he's respecting his own boundaries by not using a condom he didn't bring, especially if he's uncomfortable with hers for any reason (like possible tampering, not wanting to use someone else's, or just preferring his own).\n\nBut wait, the girl mentioned wanting kids soon. Maybe she's not on birth control or wants to get pregnant. However, that doesn't necessarily mean he has to use her condom. If he's not ready for that, he has the right to refuse. The key here is mutual consent and communication. The girl's refusal to use the author's condom, and insistence on hers, might be a red flag. If he's not comfortable, walking away is the right choice. The fact that her friend called him an asshole doesn't negate his right to set boundaries.\n\nAnother angle: The author had his own condom, so why was she so insistent? Maybe she wanted him to use her brand, but that's trivial. The bigger issue is consent. If she says no to his condom, maybe she's not respecting his choice, or perhaps there's an underlying issue. The author's decision to leave shows he stood by his own boundaries, which is healthy. The girlfriend's reaction of sending a friend to berate him is problematic. \n\nIn relationships, both partners should have agency over their decisions. Forcing someone to use a specific condom isn't right. The author isn't wrong for prioritizing his own comfort and safety. So the answer would be B (No, the author isn't in the wrong).\n"
