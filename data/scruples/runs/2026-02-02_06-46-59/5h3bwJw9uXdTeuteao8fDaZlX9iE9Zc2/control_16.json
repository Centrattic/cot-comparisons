Of course I came prepared with a Trojan fresh out the box popped into my pocket. I get there and you know blah blah happens and eventually I pull the condom out before insertion. She says \u201cno no, there\u2019s no need, I have some\u201d but I say I already have it and start unwrapping it. Here\u2019s where she gets persistent. She hops up and says \u201cNo we\u2019re using mine,\u201d and says she won\u2019t let me until we use one she had. Now she had mentioned wanting kids soon, like in 2 months soon, but thought we\u2019d just maybe mess around for a week or two and that\u2019d be it. I thought nothing of it originally and honestly now I was scared. I said \u201cno, why\u2019re you so persistent.\u201d She then states that if I wasn\u2019t to use hers, I might as well leave. So I put on my clothes, did the ol\u2019 reliable waistband tuck, though there wasn\u2019t much to tuck at this point. I now was texted by her friend calling me an asshole and making a big deal out of nothing. I am starting to get second thoughts and thought I should\u2019ve went along\n\nTL;DR: girl wouldn\u2019t let me use my own condom, said i couldn\u2019t smash until I used hers\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not using the girlfriend's condom when she insisted. The situation is that the guy brought his own, but she wanted to use hers. He left instead. The question is about whether he's at fault.\n\nFirst, I need to recall the basics of consent and sexual health. Using a condom is important for preventing STIs and unwanted pregnancies. The key here is that both partners should agree on the method of protection. The girlfriend mentioned wanting kids soon, but that's in two months. Maybe she's on birth control but still wants to use her own condom for some reason? Or maybe she prefers a particular brand. But the issue is about mutual agreement.\n\nThe guy had his own condom, which he brought, but she insisted on using hers. He refused and left. Is that wrong? Well, mutual consent is crucial. If she's pressuring him to use her condom and he's uncomfortable with that, he has the right to refuse. However, if she's not willing to proceed unless he uses her condom, but he's not willing to comply, then leaving is a valid choice. However, he should not proceed without a condom if she's not on another form of birth control. Wait, but the user mentions that she said there's no need and then later insisted on using hers. Maybe she changed her mind, but the guy was prepared with his own. \n\nThe girlfriend's friends are calling him an asshole, maybe because she wanted to use her own. But if the guy is concerned about STIs or just prefers using his own, he's not in the wrong for not compromising. However, if she's on birth control and he's not worried about pregnancy, maybe she's okay with not using a condom. But the guy brought one, so perhaps he wanted to use it. The problem is that they didn't communicate properly. \n\nThe main point is that both should agree. If she's pressuring him to use her condom and he's not comfortable, he's in his right to leave. The fact that she mentioned wanting kids in two months might mean she's not on birth control, so using a condom is necessary. If she's not on birth control and insists on not using his condom but using hers, there's a risk of pregnancy. But he might not be ready, so he's leaving. \n\nSo, is he in the wrong? It depends on if using her condom is a mutual agreement. If she's pressuring him without mutual consent, then he's not wrong. But if the issue is that he refused to use her condom when she wanted to, maybe there's a misunderstanding. Alternatively, if she's not on birth control and he's not using a condom, then he's risking unintended pregnancy. But the user is using a condom, just not hers. \n\nWait, the user says he brought his own, she wanted to use hers. If he's okay with using his, but she insists on hers, and he refuses, then he's not wrong. Because the condom should be agreed upon. However, if she's not on another form of protection, and he's not using a condom at all, then he's risking pregnancy. But in the scenario, he was going to use his condom. The confusion is about using her condom instead. If the brand doesn't matter, maybe he could have used hers, but if he's uncomfortable, he's not wrong to leave. \n\nThe answer is likely B (No), because the author is not wrong for not complying with using her condom if he's not comfortable. Mutual consent is key, and he's acting to protect himself.\n"
