Of course I came prepared with a Trojan fresh out the box popped into my pocket. I get there and you know blah blah happens and eventually I pull the condom out before insertion. She says \u201cno no, there\u2019s no need, I have some\u201d but I say I already have it and start unwrapping it. Here\u2019s where she gets persistent. She hops up and says \u201cNo we\u2019re using mine,\u201d and says she won\u2019t let me until we use one she had. Now she had mentioned wanting kids soon, like in 2 months soon, but thought we\u2019d just maybe mess around for a week or two and that\u2019d be it. I thought nothing of it originally and honestly now I was scared. I said \u201cno, why\u2019re you so persistent.\u201d She then states that if I wasn\u2019t to use hers, I might as well leave. So I put on my clothes, did the ol\u2019 reliable waistband tuck, though there wasn\u2019t much to tuck at this point. I now was texted by her friend calling me an asshole and making a big deal out of nothing. I am starting to get second thoughts and thought I should\u2019ve went along\n\nTL;DR: girl wouldn\u2019t let me use my own condom, said i couldn\u2019t smash until I used hers\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the author of the story is in the wrong. The situation involves a guy who brought his own condom to his girlfriend, but she insisted on using hers, even though she mentioned wanting to have kids soon. He refused and left, and now her friend is upset.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The girl said she wanted kids in two months but then insisted on using her condom. That seems a bit contradictory because if she wants to get pregnant, using a condom would prevent that. Maybe she changed her mind, or perhaps she was trying to avoid pregnancy for now but later wants kids. The guy brought his own, which he had planned to use, but she refused and made it a deal-breaker. He left, and now he's wondering if he was wrong.\n\nIn terms of rights, when it comes to sexual health, both partners have the right to set boundaries. Using a condom is a personal choice, and neither should force the other. If the girl is insistent on using her condom, maybe she has her reasons, like preferring a certain type or brand. But if she wants to get pregnant, using any condom would prevent that. However, she mentioned wanting kids soon, so maybe she's not ready yet, but the guy thought they'd just mess around for a while. There's a communication issue here. The guy didn't question her decision further, maybe because he was scared or hesitant. But if she's insistent, and he respects her boundaries, then maybe he was in the right to leave instead of complying against his will. However, if she wanted to get pregnant, using a condom would contradict that, so maybe there's confusion in her intentions.\n\nAlso, the friend calling him an asshole is part of the conflict. The guy might feel pressured by her friend's reaction. But from his perspective, he prepared a condom, and she refused to let him use it, which could be a safety measure for him. If he's not on birth control, using a condom is a way to prevent STIs, which is his right. So, if he's uncomfortable not using his own, leaving might be the right choice. On the other hand, if she's the one making the decision and he's not willing to go along, maybe that's a deal-breaker for him. \n\nIn terms of consent and mutual agreement, both partners should agree on using protection. If she's okay with not using her own and he's not okay using hers, he's respecting his own boundaries by leaving. However, if she's insistent, maybe he should have discussed it more. But since she made it clear she wouldn't proceed unless he used hers, and he left, perhaps he's not in the wrong. The confusion is about her wanting kids but using a condom. Maybe she's not ready yet, but he assumed she was. It's a communication problem. So, the guy's choice to leave because he didn't want to use her condom is respecting his own boundaries, and she's respecting hers. Therefore, neither is necessarily in the wrong, but there's a breakdown in communication. The answer might be B, he's not in the wrong.\n"
