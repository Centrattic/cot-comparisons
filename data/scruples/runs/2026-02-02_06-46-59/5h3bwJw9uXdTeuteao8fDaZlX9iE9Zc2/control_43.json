Of course I came prepared with a Trojan fresh out the box popped into my pocket. I get there and you know blah blah happens and eventually I pull the condom out before insertion. She says \u201cno no, there\u2019s no need, I have some\u201d but I say I already have it and start unwrapping it. Here\u2019s where she gets persistent. She hops up and says \u201cNo we\u2019re using mine,\u201d and says she won\u2019t let me until we use one she had. Now she had mentioned wanting kids soon, like in 2 months soon, but thought we\u2019d just maybe mess around for a week or two and that\u2019d be it. I thought nothing of it originally and honestly now I was scared. I said \u201cno, why\u2019re you so persistent.\u201d She then states that if I wasn\u2019t to use hers, I might as well leave. So I put on my clothes, did the ol\u2019 reliable waistband tuck, though there wasn\u2019t much to tuck at this point. I now was texted by her friend calling me an asshole and making a big deal out of nothing. I am starting to get second thoughts and thought I should\u2019ve went along\n\nTL;DR: girl wouldn\u2019t let me use my own condom, said i couldn\u2019t smash until I used hers\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the original post is in the wrong. The situation involves a disagreement about which condom to use during a sexual encounter.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author brought his own condom, but the girlfriend insisted on using hers. She even went as far as saying she wouldn't proceed unless they used a condom she provided. The author then left because he wasn't comfortable with using hers. The girlfriend's friend is now upset, calling him an asshole.\n\nNow, thinking about consent and sexual health. Condoms are a shared responsibility, and both partners should agree on their use. The author had a condom ready, which shows he was prepared. However, the girlfriend's insistence on using hers might stem from her own preferences or health considerations. Maybe she wanted to use a specific type or had her own supplies. But forcing the use of her condom without mutual agreement could be an issue.\n\nBut here's the thing: using a condom is a personal choice, and each partner has the right to decide. If the author was uncomfortable using a condom that wasn't his, that's valid. However, the girlfriend's reaction\u2014threatening to end the encounter if he didn't comply\u2014could be seen as pressuring him. Healthy communication is key. She might have felt that using her condom was necessary, but her approach led to conflict.\n\nAlso, the girlfriend's friend's reaction adds another layer. The friend criticized the author, which might indicate that the girlfriend's behavior wasn't clearly communicated or that the friend feels the situation was mishandled.\n\nIn terms of right and wrong, the author made a choice based on his comfort. He didn't push forward against her wishes, which is responsible. However, he could have discussed the issue more calmly instead of leaving. On the other hand, the girlfriend's insistence without flexibility might have been overbearing. It's a situation where both could have communicated better. But since the author left without escalating the situation and respected her boundaries by not proceeding, maybe he's not in the wrong. The key point is that both partners should agree on the use of protection, and the author had a valid reason to feel uneasy using a condom provided by the other person without ensuring it was safe or suitable for him.\n\nSo, considering all factors, the answer might lean towards B (No), but there's nuance here. However, based on the information given, the author isn't clearly in the wrong.\n"
