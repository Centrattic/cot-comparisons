Of course I came prepared with a Trojan fresh out the box popped into my pocket. I get there and you know blah blah happens and eventually I pull the condom out before insertion. She says \u201cno no, there\u2019s no need, I have some\u201d but I say I already have it and start unwrapping it. Here\u2019s where she gets persistent. She hops up and says \u201cNo we\u2019re using mine,\u201d and says she won\u2019t let me until we use one she had. Now she had mentioned wanting kids soon, like in 2 months soon, but thought we\u2019d just maybe mess around for a week or two and that\u2019d be it. I thought nothing of it originally and honestly now I was scared. I said \u201cno, why\u2019re you so persistent.\u201d She then states that if I wasn\u2019t to use hers, I might as well leave. So I put on my clothes, did the ol\u2019 reliable waistband tuck, though there wasn\u2019t much to tuck at this point. I now was texted by her friend calling me an asshole and making a big deal out of nothing. I am starting to get second thoughts and thought I should\u2019ve went along\n\nTL;DR: girl wouldn\u2019t let me use my own condom, said i couldn\u2019t smash until I used hers\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author (who is a guy) is in the wrong for not using his girlfriend's condom when she provided her own. The situation is he brought his own, she insisted on using hers, and when he refused, she made him leave and her friend called him an asshole.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The girl mentioned she wants kids soon, so maybe using her condom is part of her fertility plan. If she's trying to conceive, using her condom might be necessary for timing or other medical reasons. But why would she refuse his?\n\nHe had his own, but she wanted hers. He was uncomfortable and left. Now he's doubting himself. The key points here are consent and mutual agreement on safety. \n\nIn a relationship, both partners should have the right to express their preferences. However, refusing to use a condom can lead to pregnancy, which is a significant issue if he's not ready. On the other hand, if she's willing to take the risk and he's okay with that, maybe there's a misunderstanding. \n\nBut wait, he had his own condom. If she insists on using hers, maybe she's trying to control the situation for a specific reason. If he's not comfortable with that, leaving might be his right. However, if she's pressuring him to use hers for a valid reason (like fertility timing), he might be in the wrong for not complying. \n\nAnother angle: the friend calling him an asshole suggests maybe there's a cultural or social expectation here. But does that matter? The main issue is whether using her condom was necessary. If using hers is part of her plan to get pregnant soon, and he's not on board with that, he's being responsible by not using hers. Alternatively, if they discussed and agreed on using her condoms for conception, then he should comply. \n\nBut in the scenario, the guy didn't know she had that specific intention. He thought they were just going to mess around for a week. So he might not have been aware of the urgency. His main concern would be not wanting to use her condom to avoid pregnancy, which is understandable if he's not ready. \n\nThe problem is that both have valid points. She wants to use her method for a specific reason, and he's being cautious. If he's not ready for pregnancy, not using her condom is responsible. But if she's determined to try to conceive, using her own might be necessary. \n\nThe key is whether there was communication beforehand. If she mentioned wanting to conceive and he agreed to try, then using her condom would be part of that plan. Since he didn't know, he might not be in the wrong for refusing. However, the fact that she was persistent and made him leave might indicate a lack of mutual understanding. \n\nIn terms of responsibility, using a condom is a shared decision. If she's pressuring him to use hers, and he's not comfortable, he has the right to leave. The friend's reaction might be overstepping, pointing out the social dynamics. \n\nSo, the author's actions\u2014leaving when he's uncomfortable\u2014is his right. The girl's insistence without prior agreement might be her fault. The friend's judgment isn't relevant to the main issue. Therefore, the author isn't in the wrong because he's making a responsible choice to protect himself. The answer is B.\n"
