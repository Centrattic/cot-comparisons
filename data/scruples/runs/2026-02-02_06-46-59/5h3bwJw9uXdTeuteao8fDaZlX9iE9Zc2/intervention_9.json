Of course I came prepared with a Trojan fresh out the box popped into my pocket. I get there and you know blah blah happens and eventually I pull the condom out before insertion. She says \u201cno no, there\u2019s no need, I have some\u201d but I say I already have it and start unwrapping it. Here\u2019s where she gets persistent. She hops up and says \u201cNo we\u2019re using mine,\u201d and says she won\u2019t let me until we use one she had. Now she had mentioned wanting kids soon, like in 2 months soon, but thought we\u2019d just maybe mess around for a week or two and that\u2019d be it. I thought nothing of it originally and honestly now I was scared. I said \u201cno, why\u2019re you so persistent.\u201d She then states that if I wasn\u2019t to use hers, I might as well leave. So I put on my clothes, did the ol\u2019 reliable waistband tuck, though there wasn\u2019t much to tuck at this point. I now was texted by her friend calling me an asshole and making a big deal out of nothing. I am starting to get second thoughts and thought I should\u2019ve went along\n\nTL;DR: girl wouldn\u2019t let me use my own condom, said i couldn\u2019t smash until I used hers\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is about a guy who brought his own condom to his girlfriend, but she insisted they use hers instead. He was okay with not using a condom initially because she said she had some, but then she got insistent and even made him leave when he tried to use his own. Now he's questioning if he should have just used hers.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics of consent and mutual agreement. When it comes to sexual health, both partners should have a say, and it's important to respect each other's boundaries. The guy brought a condom, which shows he's thinking about protection. But the girl wanted to use hers and even threatened to end the encounter if he didn't. That seems like she was setting a boundary. However, the guy also has a right to his own preferences, like using the condom he had. \n\nBut here's the thing: maybe the girl was concerned about STI protection and wanted her own condom to ensure it's safe. If the guy is using his own, maybe she's worried about his hygiene or if the condom is expired. But the situation escalated because he was insistent on using his, and she wouldn't budge. So in that case, he had to leave, and now her friend is calling him an asshole.\n\nThe key points here are mutual consent and communication. If the girl is set on using her own, maybe the guy should have respected that. But if he's uncomfortable with that, then maybe he shouldn't have proceeded. The problem is that he was prepared with his own, but she had a boundary. So if he's willing to compromise, then he should have used hers. If not, then he shouldn't have pushed for his own. \n\nAnother angle is that the guy might have been inconsiderate by not checking with her first about using his condom. But he did mention she said \"no need\" and he started unwrapping. Maybe he didn't realize she was serious. However, when she got persistent, he should have stopped and respected her wishes instead of trying to proceed. So maybe he's at fault for not backing down when she clearly said no. \n\nOn the other hand, if she was coercing him into using her condom against his will, that's also not okay. But the scenario says she wouldn't let him proceed unless he used hers. That sounds like pressure from her side. However, if the guy is okay with not using a condom and just wants to have sex, but she wants protection, then he's not respecting her need. \n\nWait, but the girl mentioned wanting kids soon. If they're trying to conceive, maybe they don't need a condom. But the guy thought they'd just mess around and not have intercourse. Maybe there's a misunderstanding here. However, the main issue is the condom use. \n\nIn terms of right or wrong, it's about respecting each other's boundaries. If the guy was okay with using her condom, then he should have. If not, then he shouldn't have pushed. Since he was prepared with his own, but she was insistent on hers, he might be at fault for not backing down and causing a conflict. So the answer might be A (he's in the wrong) because he didn't respect her boundary when she clearly stated it. But some might argue that he's not in the wrong if he felt uncomfortable using her condom. It's a bit of a tricky situation. But generally, if a partner is setting a boundary, you should respect it even if you don't agree. So probably A.\n"
