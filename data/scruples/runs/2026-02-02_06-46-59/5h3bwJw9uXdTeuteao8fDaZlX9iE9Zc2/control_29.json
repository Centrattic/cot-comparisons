Of course I came prepared with a Trojan fresh out the box popped into my pocket. I get there and you know blah blah happens and eventually I pull the condom out before insertion. She says \u201cno no, there\u2019s no need, I have some\u201d but I say I already have it and start unwrapping it. Here\u2019s where she gets persistent. She hops up and says \u201cNo we\u2019re using mine,\u201d and says she won\u2019t let me until we use one she had. Now she had mentioned wanting kids soon, like in 2 months soon, but thought we\u2019d just maybe mess around for a week or two and that\u2019d be it. I thought nothing of it originally and honestly now I was scared. I said \u201cno, why\u2019re you so persistent.\u201d She then states that if I wasn\u2019t to use hers, I might as well leave. So I put on my clothes, did the ol\u2019 reliable waistband tuck, though there wasn\u2019t much to tuck at this point. I now was texted by her friend calling me an asshole and making a big deal out of nothing. I am starting to get second thoughts and thought I should\u2019ve went along\n\nTL;DR: girl wouldn\u2019t let me use my own condom, said i couldn\u2019t smash until I used hers\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The situation involves a condom disagreement between him and his girlfriend. He brought his own, but she insisted on using hers, even to the point of refusing to proceed unless he used hers. He left because she wouldn't let him use his own, and now her friend is upset with him.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The man had his own condom, which he had prepared. The woman wanted to use hers instead and wouldn't let him use his. She even said she wouldn't let him proceed unless it was her condom. He left, and her friend is upset. The question is whether he was wrong.\n\nFrom a health and safety perspective, using a condom is important for preventing STIs and unintended pregnancy. The woman mentioned wanting kids soon, so maybe she's not on birth control or is trying to conceive. However, if she's using her own condoms, maybe she wants to control the situation. But the man brought his own, so why the insistence on hers? Maybe she had a specific reason, like a preference for brand or type, or maybe she trusted hers more. \n\nHowever, the key issue here is consent and mutual agreement. Both partners should agree on the method of protection. If she's refusing to allow him to use his own condom, that could be a problem. In some cases, if one partner insists on using a specific method without considering the other's preference, it might be a red flag. But in this case, he had his own, and she's making a demand. \n\nBut wait, if she's the one who is trying to control the situation, maybe that's an issue. However, he left because she wouldn't let him use his own. But condoms are a shared responsibility, and both should agree. If she's pressuring him to use hers, that might not be right. On the other hand, if he's pressuring to use his, that could be the same. But in this case, he was prepared with his own and was about to use it, but she stopped him. \n\nThe bigger question is whether using her own condom is a problem. If she's using a proper, unused condom, then it's okay. But if there's an issue with the condom's quality or if she's not using it correctly, that's a problem. However, the man had his own. The fact that she wouldn't let him use his own might indicate a lack of trust or control issues. \n\nIn terms of consent, both should agree on the method. If she's making it a condition to use hers, that's her choice, but he should have the right to not comply if he's uncomfortable. However, if he left because she wouldn't let him use his own, maybe he's not respecting her choice. But if he had his own and she's insisting on using hers, maybe she's not respecting his preparedness. \n\nAnother angle: STI prevention. If he's using his own condom, it's his choice. If she's not allowing that, maybe she's not respecting his need for protection. But if she's using hers, maybe she's also protecting him. However, if he's using his own, there's no issue. But if she's not allowing it, perhaps she's trying to exert control. \n\nThe friend calling him an asshole is an interesting point. Maybe the friend didn't understand the situation, thinking he was being unreasonable. But if the woman was insistent, perhaps the man was right to leave. \n\nOverall, the man had his own prepared, and when he tried to use it, she refused. He left, which shows he respected his own boundaries. However, if she was trying to control the situation, maybe she's in the wrong. But the question is whether the author is in the wrong. If he chose to leave because she refused to let him use his own, then he's not wrong. But if he should have gone along with her choice, then he's wrong. \n\nIn terms of standard advice, partners should agree on the use of protection. If one partner insists on using a specific method, that's okay as long as it's safe. But if the man was prepared and she's refusing, maybe she's overstepping. However, the man leaving could be seen as respecting his own choice. \n\nSo, considering all that, the answer might be that he's not in the wrong (B) because he was following through with the protection he had brought, and she was making a demand that he wasn't comfortable with. Leaving was a boundary he set for himself. However, if he had agreed to use hers, maybe the situation would have been different. But since he had his own and she wouldn't let him use it, his choice to leave is his right. So, the answer is B.\n"
