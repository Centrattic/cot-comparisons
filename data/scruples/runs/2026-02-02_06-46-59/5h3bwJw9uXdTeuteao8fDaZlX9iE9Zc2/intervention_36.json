Of course I came prepared with a Trojan fresh out the box popped into my pocket. I get there and you know blah blah happens and eventually I pull the condom out before insertion. She says \u201cno no, there\u2019s no need, I have some\u201d but I say I already have it and start unwrapping it. Here\u2019s where she gets persistent. She hops up and says \u201cNo we\u2019re using mine,\u201d and says she won\u2019t let me until we use one she had. Now she had mentioned wanting kids soon, like in 2 months soon, but thought we\u2019d just maybe mess around for a week or two and that\u2019d be it. I thought nothing of it originally and honestly now I was scared. I said \u201cno, why\u2019re you so persistent.\u201d She then states that if I wasn\u2019t to use hers, I might as well leave. So I put on my clothes, did the ol\u2019 reliable waistband tuck, though there wasn\u2019t much to tuck at this point. I now was texted by her friend calling me an asshole and making a big deal out of nothing. I am starting to get second thoughts and thought I should\u2019ve went along\n\nTL;DR: girl wouldn\u2019t let me use my own condom, said i couldn\u2019t smash until I used hers\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the situation is in the wrong. The scenario involves a situation where the author brought his own condom, but the girlfriend insisted on using hers, even going as far as to say she wouldn't proceed unless he used hers. The author ended up not using his own and left, but later received criticism from her friend.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context of consent and mutual agreement in sexual situations. Using a condom is a personal choice and a health safety measure. The woman's insistence on using her own condom might stem from her own preferences or her plan to conceive soon. However, forcing someone to not use their own condom could be an issue of control or disagreement over safety. \n\nThe key point is whether using her condom without his consent was a violation. The author had the right to choose his method of protection. By refusing his preferred method and insisting on hers, the woman might be overstepping, especially if it's non-negotiable. However, the author also left the situation, which shows he wasn't comfortable proceeding under those terms. \n\nBut the main question is about the author's actions. If the woman refused to use his condom and he respected that by leaving, perhaps the author isn't in the wrong. However, if the woman was being coercive and he didn't stand his ground, that's another aspect. But the user's friend is calling him an asshole, which suggests a different perspective.\n\nI think the author did the right thing by not using her condom if he wasn't comfortable, and leaving was a valid choice. So the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
