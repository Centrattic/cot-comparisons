Of course I came prepared with a Trojan fresh out the box popped into my pocket. I get there and you know blah blah happens and eventually I pull the condom out before insertion. She says \u201cno no, there\u2019s no need, I have some\u201d but I say I already have it and start unwrapping it. Here\u2019s where she gets persistent. She hops up and says \u201cNo we\u2019re using mine,\u201d and says she won\u2019t let me until we use one she had. Now she had mentioned wanting kids soon, like in 2 months soon, but thought we\u2019d just maybe mess around for a week or two and that\u2019d be it. I thought nothing of it originally and honestly now I was scared. I said \u201cno, why\u2019re you so persistent.\u201d She then states that if I wasn\u2019t to use hers, I might as well leave. So I put on my clothes, did the ol\u2019 reliable waistband tuck, though there wasn\u2019t much to tuck at this point. I now was texted by her friend calling me an asshole and making a big deal out of nothing. I am starting to get second thoughts and thought I should\u2019ve went along\n\nTL;DR: girl wouldn\u2019t let me use my own condom, said i couldn\u2019t smash until I used hers\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the person who wrote this story is in the wrong. Let me read through it again carefully.\n\nThe situation is that the author went over to his girlfriend after talking for a few weeks. They were planning to have sex, and he brought his own condom. When they got to the point of using it, the girlfriend refused to use his condom and insisted on using hers. The author mentions that she had previously mentioned wanting kids soon, but he didn't think much of it. Now he's worried and left because she wouldn't let him use his condom. Her friend texted him calling him an asshole. He's wondering if he was wrong to not use her condom.\n\nFirst, the key point here is consent and mutual agreement on contraceptive use. Condom use is a personal choice and a health/safety issue. If one partner is insistent on using a condom and the other refuses, it's a problem. But in this case, the author brought his own, but the girlfriend wanted to use hers. However, the author didn't seem to know that she wanted to use hers. Wait, no\u2014the girlfriend is the one who was persistent in using hers. She said she had some and wouldn't let him proceed unless he used hers. The author ended up leaving because she wouldn't let him use his own. \n\nWait, but condoms are for the person using them to protect both partners. If the author brought his own, maybe he had specific reasons\u2014maybe he's used hers before and had issues, or maybe he's more comfortable with his own. But the girlfriend is the one who is now insisting on hers. But why would she not want him to use his own? Maybe she has specific preferences or maybe there's another reason.\n\nBut the main issue is that the author is the one who was prepared, but the girlfriend is the one who is making the decision about which condom to use. However, when it comes to using a condom, it's a shared responsibility. If one person is uncomfortable with the other's choice, that's a problem. But here, the author didn't seem to know she wanted to use hers. Wait, actually, the girlfriend was insistent, even to the point of saying he should leave if he didn't use hers. The author left because she wouldn't let him use his own. But is it wrong to leave?\n\nIn terms of responsibility, using a condom is a mutual decision. If the author is okay with using her condom, then that's fine. But if he's not comfortable with that, maybe he should have discussed it beforehand. However, in this case, the author was ready to use a condom but the girlfriend was insistent on using hers. But maybe the author is overstepping if he's not considering her preference. Wait, but why would she have a preference? Maybe she wanted to use hers because of brand, or maybe she had her own reasons. But if the author is okay with using hers, then that's okay. But he wasn't okay with it and left. \n\nBut the problem is, when it comes to consent and health, using a condom is necessary. If the author was okay with using a condom, but the girlfriend wanted to use hers, then using hers should be okay. Unless there's a reason not to. The author is the one who had his own, but the girlfriend is the one who is insisting on hers. The author then refuses and leaves. But why is that a problem? If the author is not comfortable with using her condom, then he's not respecting her boundaries if she's insisting. Wait, no, the girlfriend is the one who is setting a boundary by saying they can't proceed unless he uses hers. If the author is not comfortable with that, then he shouldn't proceed. But if he's okay with using her condom, then he should. \n\nBut the author left because she wouldn't let him use his own. The girlfriend's friend called him an asshole. Maybe the girlfriend is being controlling, but the author's action was walking away. Is that wrong? Or is the author right to not use her condom if he's uncomfortable?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the author is wrong because he didn't communicate his concerns. If he was worried about using her condom, he should have discussed it before. For example, maybe he's concerned about the condom's effectiveness, or maybe he prefers his own. If he's not willing to use her condom, then he shouldn't be having sex. But in this case, he brought his own, but she refused to use it. So he left. \n\nBut why is that a problem? If the girlfriend is the one setting the boundary and the author is not respecting it, then he is in the wrong. However, if the author is not comfortable with using her condom, then he's not in the wrong. The key issue is mutual consent and respecting each other's boundaries. If the author is not willing to use her condom, he shouldn't proceed. So in this case, the author's decision to leave might be right because he's not willing to compromise. But if the girlfriend is the one who is insistent, and he's not willing to comply, then maybe it's a conflict in boundaries.\n\nWait, but the author's main point is that he's now second-guessing if he was wrong to leave. The girlfriend wants to use her condom, but he had his own. The problem is that maybe the author should have discussed it before. If he was okay with using her condom, then he should have. If he was not okay, then he should have not proceeded. The fact that he left might be acceptable because he wasn't willing to use hers. But the girlfriend's friend called him an asshole, implying that he was wrong. But maybe the girlfriend was being controlling. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the author is wrong because he should have been more flexible. If the girlfriend is willing to use her own condom, then using hers is fine. The author's action of leaving might be overreacting. But if there's a reason he's not comfortable using her condom\u2014like if he's worried about it being expired or not his preferred brand\u2014then it's a valid concern. However, the story doesn't mention that. \n\nIn general, using a condom is a shared responsibility. The author was prepared, but the girlfriend wanted to use hers. If the author is okay with that, then proceed. If not, then don't. Since he left, maybe he's not in the wrong. But if the girlfriend is insistent and he's not willing to comply, then it's a mutual issue. The friend's reaction might be misplaced if the author was just not willing to use her condom. \n\nSo, considering all that, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong. He made the decision to not proceed because he wasn't comfortable using her condom. However, if using her condom was acceptable, then he could have agreed. Since he left, maybe he's not in the wrong. Therefore, the answer might be B (No, the author is not in the wrong). But I need to be careful here. Another perspective is that the author should have respected her choice to use her own condom. But if he's not comfortable with that, then he's not respecting his own boundaries. It's a bit of a gray area. \n\nIn terms of consent, both parties need to agree. If the author is not comfortable with using her condom, then he shouldn't proceed. Therefore, he's not in the wrong for walking away. The girlfriend's friend might be incorrect in calling him an asshole. However, if the author had brought up his concerns before and the girlfriend insisted, then maybe it's different. But in the story, the author didn't mention discussing it beforehand. He just assumed she wanted to use his. The girlfriend was persistent, and he left. So, the author isn't in the wrong because he's not willing to compromise on something that's important to him. Therefore, the answer is B.\n"
