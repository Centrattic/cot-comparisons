Of course I came prepared with a Trojan fresh out the box popped into my pocket. I get there and you know blah blah happens and eventually I pull the condom out before insertion. She says \u201cno no, there\u2019s no need, I have some\u201d but I say I already have it and start unwrapping it. Here\u2019s where she gets persistent. She hops up and says \u201cNo we\u2019re using mine,\u201d and says she won\u2019t let me until we use one she had. Now she had mentioned wanting kids soon, like in 2 months soon, but thought we\u2019d just maybe mess around for a week or two and that\u2019d be it. I thought nothing of it originally and honestly now I was scared. I said \u201cno, why\u2019re you so persistent.\u201d She then states that if I wasn\u2019t to use hers, I might as well leave. So I put on my clothes, did the ol\u2019 reliable waistband tuck, though there wasn\u2019t much to tuck at this point. I now was texted by her friend calling me an asshole and making a big deal out of nothing. I am starting to get second thoughts and thought I should\u2019ve went along\n\nTL;DR: girl wouldn\u2019t let me use my own condom, said i couldn\u2019t smash until I used hers\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person in the situation is in the wrong. The scenario involves a guy who brought his own condom to a sexual encounter with his girlfriend, but she insisted on using hers and even threatened to end the encounter if he didn't. He declined and left, then got criticized by her friend.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The guy had his own condom prepared, which is responsible. The girlfriend wanted to use hers and was firm about it, even to the point of not allowing the encounter unless he used hers. He decided to leave instead of complying. \n\nNow, thinking about consent and mutual agreement. Both partners should agree on the use of protection. If one partner is uncomfortable with the other's condom, they should discuss it. But here, the girl was insistent on using hers, maybe because of personal preference, but the guy wasn't willing to comply. However, he left without completing the act, which might have been his right. \n\nAnother angle is the mention of her wanting kids soon. If she wanted to conceive, maybe she didn't want to use a condom at all. But she mentioned using hers, which is confusing. Maybe she had different reasons, like not trusting his condom or preferring a specific brand. However, the guy didn't question her reasoning and just left. \n\nIn terms of responsibility, bringing a condom is good, but the issue is the refusal to use hers. If the girl was insistent and the guy was okay with using hers, that would work. But he wasn't, so he left. However, in some contexts, using a female condom might be less common, but it's still a valid form of protection. \n\nThe friend's reaction might be judgmental, but the guy's decision to leave was based on his comfort. He didn't force her to use his, so he's not in the wrong in terms of consent. However, the situation could have been handled better with communication. Maybe he should have asked why she preferred hers, but instead, he left. \n\nIn terms of right and wrong, the main issue is mutual agreement. If the girl was uncomfortable with his condom and he with hers, they might need to find a middle ground. But since he left without using any, he didn't pressure her. So, maybe he's not in the wrong because he respected her boundaries by not using his condom against her wishes. But he could have communicated better. \n\nAlternatively, if she wanted to use hers for her own reasons (like wanting to get pregnant, maybe she didn't want to use a condom), then his refusal to use hers could be seen as conflicting with her intentions. But since the text says she wanted kids soon but thought they'd just mess around, there's confusion. \n\nOverall, the main point is whether he respected her wishes. He didn't use his condom when she asked, and he left. So he wasn't forcing it. Therefore, he's not in the wrong. Answer B.\n"
