Of course I came prepared with a Trojan fresh out the box popped into my pocket. I get there and you know blah blah happens and eventually I pull the condom out before insertion. She says \u201cno no, there\u2019s no need, I have some\u201d but I say I already have it and start unwrapping it. Here\u2019s where she gets persistent. She hops up and says \u201cNo we\u2019re using mine,\u201d and says she won\u2019t let me until we use one she had. Now she had mentioned wanting kids soon, like in 2 months soon, but thought we\u2019d just maybe mess around for a week or two and that\u2019d be it. I thought nothing of it originally and honestly now I was scared. I said \u201cno, why\u2019re you so persistent.\u201d She then states that if I wasn\u2019t to use hers, I might as well leave. So I put on my clothes, did the ol\u2019 reliable waistband tuck, though there wasn\u2019t much to tuck at this point. I now was texted by her friend calling me an asshole and making a big deal out of nothing. I am starting to get second thoughts and thought I should\u2019ve went along\n\nTL;DR: girl wouldn\u2019t let me use my own condom, said i couldn\u2019t smash until I used hers\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to work through this. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is about a guy who brought his own condom, but the girlfriend insisted on using hers. He ended up not using a condom at all and now feels conflicted. The question is whether he's at fault.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The guy had his own condom ready, but the girlfriend refused it and wanted to use hers. He mentions she wanted kids soon but thought they'd just mess around for a couple weeks. Then he left, but her friend called him an asshole. Now he's second-guessing.\n\nSo, from a sexual health and safety perspective, using a condom is important to prevent STIs and unintended pregnancy. The fact that she mentioned wanting kids soon might mean she's not using birth control, but if they're not ready for pregnancy, that's a problem. The guy chose not to use a condom, which could lead to unintended consequences. \n\nBut wait, she insisted on using her own, and he didn't go through with it. Maybe there's a communication issue here. The guy might have thought using a condom was necessary, but she didn't want to. Did he consider that she might not be on birth control or has her own reasons for not using a condom? However, even if she's on birth control, STI protection is still a concern.\n\nAlso, the fact that she said not to use his and he left might indicate a power dynamic issue. If she pressured him to use hers and he refused, maybe that's a boundary. But if he's okay with using hers, but she's not on birth control, then he's risking pregnancy. \n\nAnother angle: if the guy is uncomfortable with using her condom, maybe he should have communicated that better. But the post says he was scared and left. Maybe he didn't want to risk pregnancy or STIs. However, leaving might have been a better choice than not using any protection. \n\nIn terms of consent and mutual agreement, both parties should be on the same page. If she insists on not using a condom and he's not comfortable, he has the right to leave. But by not using any condom at all, he's not protecting himself or her. \n\nSo, the guy is in a tough spot. If he's not using a condom because of her refusal, he's putting them both at risk. But if he's not using hers because he's worried about pregnancy, maybe he's right to be cautious. However, not using any protection is the wrong choice regardless. \n\nThe answer might hinge on whether he's responsible for not using any protection. Even if she pressured him, he should have stood his ground or used a condom. Alternatively, if he left, maybe he's not at fault. But he did leave without using protection, leading to the friend's reaction. \n\nI think the main issue here is that he didn't use a condom at all. If he felt strongly about using one, he should have either insisted on using his or found another way. By not using any, he's in the wrong because he didn't prioritize protection. So Answer A (Yes, he's in the wrong) might be the case. But I'm a bit torn because she was pressuring him. However, the responsibility for protection is shared, and he didn't use any. So Answer A.\n"
