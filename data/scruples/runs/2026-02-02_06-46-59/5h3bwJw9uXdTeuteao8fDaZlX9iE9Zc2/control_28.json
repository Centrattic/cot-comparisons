Of course I came prepared with a Trojan fresh out the box popped into my pocket. I get there and you know blah blah happens and eventually I pull the condom out before insertion. She says \u201cno no, there\u2019s no need, I have some\u201d but I say I already have it and start unwrapping it. Here\u2019s where she gets persistent. She hops up and says \u201cNo we\u2019re using mine,\u201d and says she won\u2019t let me until we use one she had. Now she had mentioned wanting kids soon, like in 2 months soon, but thought we\u2019d just maybe mess around for a week or two and that\u2019d be it. I thought nothing of it originally and honestly now I was scared. I said \u201cno, why\u2019re you so persistent.\u201d She then states that if I wasn\u2019t to use hers, I might as well leave. So I put on my clothes, did the ol\u2019 reliable waistband tuck, though there wasn\u2019t much to tuck at this point. I now was texted by her friend calling me an asshole and making a big deal out of nothing. I am starting to get second thoughts and thought I should\u2019ve went along\n\nTL;DR: girl wouldn\u2019t let me use my own condom, said i couldn\u2019t smash until I used hers\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is that the guy went over to his girlfriend, they were about to have sex, and he brought his own condom. She told him not to use his and insisted on using hers. He tried to use his, she got persistent, and eventually told him to leave if he didn't use hers. He left, and now he's getting texts from her friend calling him an asshole.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The girl mentioned wanting kids soon, which might mean she doesn't want to use a condom. But the guy is using a condom, which suggests he might not want to risk pregnancy. However, she's the one who wants kids, so maybe she's on birth control? Wait, the guy brings up that she said she has her own condoms, but he thought maybe she was on the pill or something else. But he didn't confirm that. He just assumed? Maybe he should have asked why she didn't want to use his condom. \n\nBut then there's the issue of consent and mutual agreement on protection. If she wants to have unprotected sex, but he doesn't want to, then he's within his rights to not proceed, right? Because both parties should agree on the level of risk. If she's not on birth control or other pregnancy prevention methods, then using a condom is necessary if they don't want pregnancy. But the guy is okay with using his own, but she insists on hers. Maybe he didn't realize she was on birth control, and she thought she didn't need a condom because of that. But if that's the case, then she should have communicated that clearly. If he's unsure, it's his right to use a condom regardless. \n\nThe girl's reaction of making him leave and her friend's reaction might indicate that she was upset he didn't go along with her wishes. But if she's pressuring him to not use his own condom without ensuring that there's another form of protection, maybe she's the one being unreasonable. Also, the guy was willing to use a condom, which is a responsible action. She's the one trying to remove that protection. \n\nIn terms of consent, both parties should agree on the terms. If she's pressuring him to not use a condom he's comfortable with, that might be a red flag. He's not in the wrong for standing by his decision to use protection. The problem might be that she didn't communicate her birth control status clearly. If she was on the pill or another method, he might have been okay with not using a condom, but since he didn't know, he had the right to use his own. \n\nSo, considering all this, the author is not in the wrong. He's protecting himself and adhering to his own comfort level regarding protection. The girl's insistence without clear communication about her own methods is where the issue lies. Therefore, the answer should be B.\n"
