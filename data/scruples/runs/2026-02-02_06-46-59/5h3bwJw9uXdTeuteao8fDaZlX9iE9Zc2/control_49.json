Of course I came prepared with a Trojan fresh out the box popped into my pocket. I get there and you know blah blah happens and eventually I pull the condom out before insertion. She says \u201cno no, there\u2019s no need, I have some\u201d but I say I already have it and start unwrapping it. Here\u2019s where she gets persistent. She hops up and says \u201cNo we\u2019re using mine,\u201d and says she won\u2019t let me until we use one she had. Now she had mentioned wanting kids soon, like in 2 months soon, but thought we\u2019d just maybe mess around for a week or two and that\u2019d be it. I thought nothing of it originally and honestly now I was scared. I said \u201cno, why\u2019re you so persistent.\u201d She then states that if I wasn\u2019t to use hers, I might as well leave. So I put on my clothes, did the ol\u2019 reliable waistband tuck, though there wasn\u2019t much to tuck at this point. I now was texted by her friend calling me an asshole and making a big deal out of nothing. I am starting to get second thoughts and thought I should\u2019ve went along\n\nTL;DR: girl wouldn\u2019t let me use my own condom, said i couldn\u2019t smash until I used hers\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that he went over to his girlfriend, they were about to have sex, and he brought his own condom. But she insisted on using hers instead. He tried to use his, but she wouldn't let him and even said to leave if he didn't use hers. Then he left, and her friend messaged him calling him an asshole.\n\nFirst, I need to remember the general rules about consent and sexual health. Condoms are about protection against STIs and unintended pregnancies. When someone insists on using their own condom, it might be for a reason. Maybe she's concerned about STIs, or maybe she has her own reasons for preferring her own. But in this case, the user mentions that she said she wants to get pregnant soon. Wait, if she wants to get pregnant, why is she insisting on using a condom? That seems contradictory. Maybe she's not on birth control and wants to protect against STIs, but still wants to have unprotected sex eventually. But if she wants to get pregnant soon, using a condom would prevent that. So maybe there's a misunderstanding here.\n\nThe user thought she might be on the pill or something else, but she wasn't. But he didn't realize that. So when she said she has condoms, maybe she's trying to use protection but still wants to get pregnant in the future. However, if she's not on birth control, having unprotected sex would be risky for her. Wait, but if she wants to get pregnant, then using a condom isn't about pregnancy prevention. Maybe she's concerned about STIs. If she's not on birth control and they're using a condom to prevent STIs, that makes sense. So the user's condom was for STI protection, but if she's not on birth control, using his condom would also prevent pregnancy, which is not her goal. So she wants to get pregnant soon, which suggests she wants unprotected sex. But she's using the condom to prevent STIs, which is smart if they're not in a monogamous relationship where both are tested.\n\nBut here's the conflict: he brought his own condom, she insists on using hers. So maybe she wants to use her own for some reason. Maybe she tested her own, or she's more comfortable with hers. But when he tried to use his, she refused. Now, the question is, is he in the wrong for not going along with her condom and leaving?\n\nIn terms of consent, both parties should agree on the terms of sexual activity. If she's refusing to proceed unless he uses her condom, but he's not in a position to negotiate that, is that a problem? Or is it his right to use his own condom? From a health perspective, using a condom is a personal choice for protection. If he's concerned about STIs, he has the right to insist on using a condom unless she's tested and he's comfortable. But in this case, she's not allowing him to use his own, which could be a power dynamic. If she's pressuring him to use her condom, maybe she's not respecting his need for protection. Alternatively, if she's in a relationship where she's okay with unprotected sex (because she wants to get pregnant), he might be overstepping by not using her condom. \n\nWait, but if he's not on protection, then he's risking STIs for her. If she wants to get pregnant soon, maybe she's assuming he's STI-negative, but if he's not, that's a risk for her. So maybe her insistence on using her own condom is to have control over the situation, while he's bringing his own might be seen as him wanting to control it. The fact that she's pressuring him to use hers could be a sign of her wanting to have unprotected sex, but he's not comfortable without a condom. \n\nIn terms of consent, if he's uncomfortable with not using a condom, he has the right to leave. The problem is that she's pressuring him to not use his own, which could be a form of coercion if he's not willing. However, if she's not pressuring him to have sex without a condom but is instead using her own, maybe that's acceptable. But the user is leaving because he doesn't want to use her condom. The issue is whether he's being reasonable. \n\nFrom a health standpoint, using any condom is better than none. If she's providing a condom, he could use that. However, maybe he's concerned about the condom being expired or not up to his standards. But the post doesn't mention that. So he just didn't want to use hers. \n\nIn terms of the timeline: they've been talking for 3-4 weeks. Is that enough time to know each other's STI status? Probably not. So using a condom is prudent. If he's using a condom, he's protecting himself and her. If she insists on using hers, maybe he should check if it's safe, but if he's not comfortable, he can't be forced to not use his own. However, walking away might be his choice. \n\nThe question is, is he in the wrong for not using his own condom. If he walked away because he didn't want to use hers, but she's pressuring him to use hers, maybe he's being reasonable by not compromising his own safety. But since he left, maybe he's in the right. However, if she's not forcing him to have sex without a condom, but just wants to use her own, then he could use hers. \n\nBut in the scenario, when he tried to use his own, she said no, and he left. So he didn't proceed without a condom. He left instead of using hers. So he's not being unsafe. The problem is that she's pressuring him to use hers, but he's not willing. So where's the fault here? \n\nIn many relationships, both partners should have a discussion about sexual health and agree on the terms. If she's not on birth control and wants to get pregnant, using a condom would prevent pregnancy. But she might not want that. However, using a condom is still good for STI prevention. If he's not on protection, he's taking a risk for her. So maybe she's wrong for not allowing him to use his own condom. \n\nAlternatively, if she's using her own condom for STI protection, he could use that. But if he's uncomfortable with that, leaving is his choice. The friend calling him an asshole might be on her side, implying that he's being unreasonable. But is he?\n\nSo, the answer hinges on whether he's in the wrong for not using her condom. If he's not in a position to insist on using his own, then yes, but if he's protecting himself, then no. In this case, since they are in a new relationship and he's using a condom, he's acting responsibly. If she's pressuring him to not use his own, maybe she's not respecting his boundaries. So he's in the right for leaving. Therefore, the answer is B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
