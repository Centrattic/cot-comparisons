Of course I came prepared with a Trojan fresh out the box popped into my pocket. I get there and you know blah blah happens and eventually I pull the condom out before insertion. She says \u201cno no, there\u2019s no need, I have some\u201d but I say I already have it and start unwrapping it. Here\u2019s where she gets persistent. She hops up and says \u201cNo we\u2019re using mine,\u201d and says she won\u2019t let me until we use one she had. Now she had mentioned wanting kids soon, like in 2 months soon, but thought we\u2019d just maybe mess around for a week or two and that\u2019d be it. I thought nothing of it originally and honestly now I was scared. I said \u201cno, why\u2019re you so persistent.\u201d She then states that if I wasn\u2019t to use hers, I might as well leave. So I put on my clothes, did the ol\u2019 reliable waistband tuck, though there wasn\u2019t much to tuck at this point. I now was texted by her friend calling me an asshole and making a big deal out of nothing. I am starting to get second thoughts and thought I should\u2019ve went along\n\nTL;DR: girl wouldn\u2019t let me use my own condom, said i couldn\u2019t smash until I used hers\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that the person went over to their girlfriend, had their own condom ready, but the girlfriend insisted on using hers instead. The author tried to use their own, but she wouldn't let them unless they used hers. He ended up leaving, and her friend was upset, so he's wondering if he made a mistake.\n\nFirst, I need to consider consent and mutual agreement in sexual activities. Using a condom is a mutual decision, right? Both partners should agree on what they're comfortable with. The author had their own condom, which is responsible, but the girlfriend didn't want that and wanted to use hers. Now, why would she be so insistent? Maybe she has a reason, like maybe she's on birth control and doesn't need a condom, or perhaps she trusts her own product more. But the fact that she said she wants to have kids soon might complicate things. If she's trying to conceive, maybe she doesn't want to use a condom at all. \n\nBut then, the author is confused because he thought they were just going to \"mess around for a week or two\" before that. Wait, does that mean he thought they were just having casual sex without the intention of getting her pregnant? If she's planning to get pregnant soon, maybe she's not on birth control and doesn't want to use a condom to avoid pregnancy prevention. So if the author is using a condom, that might be against her wishes if she's trying to conceive. \n\nBut then why did she bring up wanting kids in two months? Maybe she mentioned it earlier, but thought they weren't going to have sex yet. Now, she's pushing to use her condom, which might mean she wants to have unprotected sex, but the author is trying to use a condom. Wait, no\u2014if she wants to get pregnant, using any condom (hers or his) would prevent that. So maybe there's confusion here. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps she wanted to use her own condom for reasons like trust, maybe she's concerned about STIs. If she's using her own, maybe she's checking that he's using a condom, but perhaps she's not comfortable with him using his because of something else. Or maybe she's in a situation where using her own is a way to control the situation, ensuring that she's the one providing the protection. \n\nBut the key issue is that both partners should have a mutual agreement. If she insisted on using her own and he tried to use his, leading to a disagreement where she wouldn't proceed unless they used hers, then maybe the author should have respected her decision. However, the author might be in the right if he felt uncomfortable using her condom for reasons like STI prevention or not trusting her. But the user says he didn't think of that and just left. \n\nWait, the author says he was scared and left. Maybe he didn't communicate his concerns properly. If he was worried about STIs and didn't know her status, then using his own condom is the responsible choice. But she's asking him to use hers instead, which could be a red flag if she's not okay with him using his own. \n\nIn some cases, people might feel pressured into not using a condom if the other person insists. But the author had his own, so he was prepared. If she's not on birth control and wants to get pregnant, maybe she's not okay with him using a condom at all. But then why insist on using hers? That doesn't make sense. Unless she's using a specific type of condom, but that's probably not the case. \n\nAlternatively, maybe she wanted to use a female condom or a different method. But the author's point is that he had his own, but she wanted to use hers. If they didn't reach an agreement, then the author's leaving might be justified if he's not comfortable. However, if she was firm and he didn't want to push the issue, maybe it's a matter of respect. \n\nIn terms of responsibility, bringing a condom is good, but if the partner is uncomfortable with it, the author should listen. However, if there's a disagreement, communication is key. The author might have been in the right to leave if he felt uncomfortable, but maybe he should have discussed it more first. \n\nThe friend's reaction is also a point. Her friend called him an asshole, implying that she didn't know about the situation, or maybe the friend didn't understand the context. That could indicate that the girlfriend might have overreacted, but without more info, it's hard to say. \n\nSo, considering all this, the author might be in the right if he was trying to be safe and she was insistent on something that made him uncomfortable. However, if he left without trying to communicate better, maybe he could have handled it differently. But the question is whether he's in the wrong. If the girlfriend was pressuring him not to use a condom despite his intention to do so, then maybe she's in the wrong. But the author had his own, so using his own is his right. If she's not okay with that, perhaps she shouldn't have agreed to the encounter. \n\nAlternatively, if she wanted to have sex without a condom (to get pregnant), but he didn't want to, then he's in the right. But the problem here is that she's insisting on using her own condom, which is confusing. Maybe she wanted to use a condom for STI protection but didn't want to use his. If that's the case, then using her own is okay, but he had his own. Maybe she's being controlling or has trust issues. \n\nIn the end, mutual consent and communication are key. If they couldn't agree, then not proceeding is the right choice. So the author leaving might have been the correct decision. Therefore, he's not in the wrong.\n"
