Of course I came prepared with a Trojan fresh out the box popped into my pocket. I get there and you know blah blah happens and eventually I pull the condom out before insertion. She says \u201cno no, there\u2019s no need, I have some\u201d but I say I already have it and start unwrapping it. Here\u2019s where she gets persistent. She hops up and says \u201cNo we\u2019re using mine,\u201d and says she won\u2019t let me until we use one she had. Now she had mentioned wanting kids soon, like in 2 months soon, but thought we\u2019d just maybe mess around for a week or two and that\u2019d be it. I thought nothing of it originally and honestly now I was scared. I said \u201cno, why\u2019re you so persistent.\u201d She then states that if I wasn\u2019t to use hers, I might as well leave. So I put on my clothes, did the ol\u2019 reliable waistband tuck, though there wasn\u2019t much to tuck at this point. I now was texted by her friend calling me an asshole and making a big deal out of nothing. I am starting to get second thoughts and thought I should\u2019ve went along\n\nTL;DR: girl wouldn\u2019t let me use my own condom, said i couldn\u2019t smash until I used hers\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author of the \"Am I the Asshole\" post is in the wrong. The situation involves a dispute over which condom to use during a sexual encounter. The man brought his own condom, but the woman insisted on using hers, even going as far as to refuse the encounter unless he used hers. The man left, and now he's conflicted about whether he made the right choice.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The woman mentioned wanting to have kids soon, which might relate to her not wanting to use a condom. However, the man had his own condom prepared, which he intended to use for protection. The woman's insistence on using her own could be about control, preference, or possibly her own STI status. The man felt scared and left the situation, which is understandable if he felt pressured.\n\nIn terms of right and wrong, consent and mutual agreement are crucial in any sexual activity. The woman is refusing to proceed unless her preferred method is used, which the man isn't comfortable with. The man's decision to leave could be seen as asserting his boundaries. However, the question is whether he's in the wrong for not using her condom. \n\nIf the issue is about condom use, using any condom is better than none, but the type or brand might matter for personal reasons. However, the main ethical consideration is mutual consent. If the man was uncomfortable using her condom for any reason (like not trusting it, or if he has his own reasons for using his own), then he has the right to refuse. The woman's ultimatum (\"use mine or leave\") could be seen as pressuring him, which is not healthy. \n\nOn the other hand, if the man is insistent on using his own, and the woman is equally insistent, neither party is technically in the wrong if they're both standing by their boundaries. However, in a healthy relationship, communication and compromise are key. The fact that the woman's friend called him an asshole might indicate a power imbalance or lack of respect. \n\nThe man's second thoughts suggest he's considering whether he acted appropriately. The main issue is whether he should have respected her condition. If using her condom was a non-negotiable for her, then the man's decision to leave might be the correct choice to avoid pressuring her or violating her boundaries. Alternatively, if the man's decision to leave was based on his own discomfort without clear communication, he might be taking a stand for his own boundaries. \n\nIn terms of responsibility for STIs or pregnancy, if the woman wants to have kids soon, maybe she's not using a condom for that reason. But the man might still want protection. The key here is mutual consent and respect for each other's boundaries. Since the man left instead of proceeding without mutual agreement, he's not necessarily in the wrong. However, the situation could have been handled better with more open communication. \n\nSo, considering all factors, the man's decision to leave when the woman was insistent might be a way of maintaining his own boundaries. The woman's pressure could be in the wrong, but the man's choice to leave is his right. Therefore, the answer would be B (No, the author is not in the wrong) because he respected his own boundaries and left when he felt pressured, which is a valid choice.\n"
