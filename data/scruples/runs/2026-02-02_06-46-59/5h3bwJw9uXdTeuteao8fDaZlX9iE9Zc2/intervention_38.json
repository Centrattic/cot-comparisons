Of course I came prepared with a Trojan fresh out the box popped into my pocket. I get there and you know blah blah happens and eventually I pull the condom out before insertion. She says \u201cno no, there\u2019s no need, I have some\u201d but I say I already have it and start unwrapping it. Here\u2019s where she gets persistent. She hops up and says \u201cNo we\u2019re using mine,\u201d and says she won\u2019t let me until we use one she had. Now she had mentioned wanting kids soon, like in 2 months soon, but thought we\u2019d just maybe mess around for a week or two and that\u2019d be it. I thought nothing of it originally and honestly now I was scared. I said \u201cno, why\u2019re you so persistent.\u201d She then states that if I wasn\u2019t to use hers, I might as well leave. So I put on my clothes, did the ol\u2019 reliable waistband tuck, though there wasn\u2019t much to tuck at this point. I now was texted by her friend calling me an asshole and making a big deal out of nothing. I am starting to get second thoughts and thought I should\u2019ve went along\n\nTL;DR: girl wouldn\u2019t let me use my own condom, said i couldn\u2019t smash until I used hers\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong in this situation. So, the scenario is that the guy went over to his girlfriend, intending to use a condom he brought. She insists on using hers instead, and he refuses, leading her to say she won't proceed unless he uses hers. He leaves, and now her friend is upset, calling him an asshole. The question is whether he's in the wrong.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key elements here. Both parties had the intention of using a condom, but there's a disagreement over whose to use. The author had his own, so he brought it. The girl says she has some and insists on using hers. The author is confused and maybe scared because she mentioned wanting kids soon, which might complicate things. He then refuses and leaves.\n\nNow, the main issue is consent and compromise. When two people are in a situation where they both want to use a condom but differ on whose to use, is there a right or wrong here? It's important to note that both are willing to use a condom, which is a good sign. The problem is the disagreement over whose to use. \n\nThe author's argument is that he had his own and was prepared. The girl, on the other hand, wanted to use hers. But why does it matter whose it is? Maybe she has personal reasons\u2014maybe she prefers a certain type, or she's bringing her own for convenience, or there's a deeper issue. The author could have compromised by using hers if she was insistent, given that they both agree on using a condom. Alternatively, maybe she had a reason to prefer hers that he wasn't considering, like maybe she wanted to ensure her own health or had specific needs.\n\nBut then, the author felt scared when she mentioned wanting kids soon. That might have caused him to lose his nerve. However, if they were both on board for using a condom, then the mention of wanting kids shouldn't have changed the plan. Maybe he was worried she was trying to get pregnant, but that's not clear. If she was insistent on using her own, maybe she had a different intent, but the author didn't push back on that. \n\nFrom a consent perspective, both should agree on the terms. If the girl said she wouldn't proceed unless he used hers, and he was okay with using a condom, then not using any might be a problem. But in this case, he did use a condom, just not hers. Wait, no, he brought his own, but she wouldn't let him use it. So, he left, meaning he didn't have sex. Wait, the summary says he left, so he didn't proceed. So, maybe the problem is that he was insistent on using his own, and she was insistent on hers, leading to him walking away. \n\nIs that a problem? If both are willing to use a condom, but just disagree on whose to use, maybe the right approach is to compromise. However, in this case, the author walked away, so he didn't proceed. The girl's friend is upset because he left, but maybe she thought he was being unreasonable. \n\nThe key here is mutual agreement. If the girl said she wouldn't proceed unless he used hers, and he was okay with using a condom, then perhaps he should have used hers. The fact that he had his own but she preferred hers might not be a big deal. Using a condom from either party is still using a condom. But he might have been worried about her having control over the situation or maybe there's a history of trust issues. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the girl was trying to exert control, and the author was standing his ground. But in terms of right or wrong, if both are agreeing to use a condom, the source shouldn't matter. So maybe the author is in the wrong for not being flexible. But then again, if he was uncomfortable with using hers for any reason (maybe he didn't trust her, or there was a specific reason he brought his own), that's different. The story doesn't mention any hygiene concerns or distrust. \n\nIn terms of consent, both parties need to be on the same page. If the girl was insisting on hers and the author was insistent on his, then the compromise is to use a condom. But the author left, so no sex happened. The friend's reaction is negative, but maybe that's just her opinion. \n\nIn conclusion, the situation is a bit of a stalemate. Both wanted to use a condom, but disagreed on whose. The author walked away. Depending on the context, maybe he's in the wrong for not compromising, or maybe she's in the wrong for being too controlling. But the question is whether the author is in the wrong. Since he left and didn't proceed, maybe he's not at fault. However, if refusing to use her condom when she's insistent is a problem, then he might be. But since they both agreed on using a condom, the choice of whose to use isn't a deal-breaker. So maybe the author is not in the wrong for leaving, but the problem is that he might have misunderstood her intentions. But since the story says she mentioned wanting kids soon, maybe he was worried she wanted to get pregnant and was trying to use her own condom as a way to not prevent pregnancy. If that's the case, then he was right to leave. But the story says he thought she wanted to get pregnant in two months but thought they'd just mess around. So maybe he was in the right to leave if he didn't want to proceed under those circumstances. \n\nHmm. This is tricky. It depends on whether the author's refusal to use her condom was based on valid concerns, like mistrust or misunderstanding her intent regarding pregnancy. If he was okay with using a condom but not hers specifically, maybe that's his choice. However, if he was insistent on using his own and she was insistent on hers, then neither compromise leads to a resolution. But he left, so he didn't force the issue. \n\nI think the answer hinges on whether using either condom is acceptable. If the author was okay with using a condom but not hers, then maybe he's in the wrong for not being flexible. But if he had reasons to be concerned (like maybe her condom was not safe or she had ulterior motives), then he's not. The story doesn't provide enough info on that. The author's fear when she mentioned wanting kids might have influenced his decision. If he didn't want to risk pregnancy, using her condom might still prevent that. So maybe he's in the right for leaving, but maybe the friend's criticism is unwarranted. \n\nOverall, I'm leaning towards the author not being in the wrong because he chose not to proceed when there was a disagreement, and both were in agreement on using a condom. The problem was a matter of preference. However, some might argue that he should have used her condom to avoid the conflict. But since he left and didn't proceed, maybe it's a stalemate. I think the correct answer is that he's not in the wrong, so B.\n"
