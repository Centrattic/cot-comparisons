Of course I came prepared with a Trojan fresh out the box popped into my pocket. I get there and you know blah blah happens and eventually I pull the condom out before insertion. She says \u201cno no, there\u2019s no need, I have some\u201d but I say I already have it and start unwrapping it. Here\u2019s where she gets persistent. She hops up and says \u201cNo we\u2019re using mine,\u201d and says she won\u2019t let me until we use one she had. Now she had mentioned wanting kids soon, like in 2 months soon, but thought we\u2019d just maybe mess around for a week or two and that\u2019d be it. I thought nothing of it originally and honestly now I was scared. I said \u201cno, why\u2019re you so persistent.\u201d She then states that if I wasn\u2019t to use hers, I might as well leave. So I put on my clothes, did the ol\u2019 reliable waistband tuck, though there wasn\u2019t much to tuck at this point. I now was texted by her friend calling me an asshole and making a big deal out of nothing. I am starting to get second thoughts and thought I should\u2019ve went along\n\nTL;DR: girl wouldn\u2019t let me use my own condom, said i couldn\u2019t smash until I used hers\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. Let's start by breaking down the situation. The user is a man who went over to his girlfriend and had a condom with him. They were about to have sex, and he took out his own condom, but the girl refused to let him use it. She insisted on using hers because she mentioned she wanted to have kids soon. The man thought maybe they would just mess around for a week or two before that, so he wasn't sure why she was so insistent. She got persistent, and when he refused to use hers, she threatened to make him leave. He ended up leaving, and her friend texted him calling him an asshole for making a big deal out of nothing. Now he's wondering if he was wrong to not use her condom.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context of their relationship. They've been talking for 3-4 weeks, which is a short time. He brought his own condom, which is a responsible move. However, the girlfriend wanted to use her own. The key point here is about control over their own body and reproductive choices. The girl mentioned she wants to have kids soon, so maybe she's trying to conceive or is trying to avoid pregnancy? Wait, if she wants kids soon, that would mean she's not on birth control, but if she's using condoms as her own method, maybe she's trying to control the situation. Alternatively, if she's using her own condoms, maybe she's trying to avoid pregnancy. Wait, the user thought she wanted to have kids soon, but he thought they would just mess around for a week or two before that. That part is confusing. Maybe the user misunderstood her intentions. If she wants to have kids soon, but was insistent on using her own condom, perhaps she's using protection because she's not ready for pregnancy yet. But he thought she wanted to have kids soon, so maybe he thought she was okay with not using a condom to get pregnant. But she actually wanted to use her own condom for protection. That would explain the conflict.\n\nAnother angle is consent and autonomy. She has the right to decide what happens to her body, including which protection method is used. If she's insistent on using her own condom, maybe she has valid reasons\u2014maybe she's uncomfortable with his, or she has specific preferences, or she's on a different type of birth control. However, the user brought his own, and she refused. The user then refused to use hers. But if she's saying that she won't engage in intercourse unless he uses her condom, that's her choice. But the user is now questioning if he made the right decision by not complying. \n\nWait, the user was scared and left. The question is whether he's in the wrong. If the woman is refusing to use his condom and wants to use her own, and he refuses to use hers, then he's not engaging in the act. But if she's saying that without using her condom, he has to leave, then he's respecting her boundary by leaving. However, if the issue is that he's not respecting her choice to use her own condom, then he might be in the wrong. But maybe there's a mutual misunderstanding. If he thought she wanted to conceive, but she actually wanted to use her own condom for protection, then he might be making a wrong assumption. But if she was clear about her intentions, then he should follow her lead. \n\nAlso, the fact that she's insistent and he left might be seen as him respecting her boundaries. However, if he had his own condom and she was refusing to use that, maybe he should have used his own rather than hers. Wait, but the user is the one who brought his own, so if she wants to use hers, maybe that's her choice. However, if he's uncomfortable with not using his own, then maybe there's a communication issue. But in this case, the user is not using either, so he's not engaging. \n\nThe key here is whether the user is in the wrong for not using her condom. If the woman is insistent and he refuses, does that make him in the wrong? Or does it depend on the reason behind her insistence? If she's trying to conceive, then she might not want a condom at all. But she wants to use her own, which is confusing. Maybe she's using a different type of condom or has her own preferences. Alternatively, maybe she's using it as a way to control the situation. \n\nIn terms of consent and autonomy, the woman has the right to choose her own method of protection. If she's saying that she won't have sex unless he uses her condom, then he has the right to refuse and leave, but he also has the right to use his own. However, if she's not allowing him to use his own, that's a problem. Wait, but the user was the one who wanted to use his own, and she refused. If she's refusing to use his condom and wants to use hers, then the user has the right to say no and not proceed. But if he's not using either, then he's not using any protection. However, in this case, he left, so he didn't proceed. \n\nThe problem here might be the communication. The user thought she wanted to have kids soon, so maybe he thought she was okay with not using a condom. But she was using her own as a form of protection. The confusion here could lead to both parties being in the wrong. The user didn't clarify why she was insisting on her own condom, and she didn't clearly explain her reasons. However, the user is now being criticized by her friend for not using her condom. \n\nIn terms of responsibility, the user brought his own condom, which is good. The woman also has her own. If they can't agree on which one to use, maybe they should use both, but that's not common. Alternatively, using one is sufficient. The user left because she refused to use his, but maybe he should have used hers instead. However, if he's uncomfortable with that, it's his choice. But if she's clear that she won't proceed without using her own, then he should either comply or not proceed. \n\nSo, is the user in the wrong? If he's not using either condom because he's refusing to use hers, then he's not using protection, which could be risky. However, he left, so there was no actual sex. The issue is whether his refusal to use her condom is wrong. If she's insistent and he's not using any, then maybe he's in the wrong for not using her method. But if he's not using any, and she's not allowing his, then both have some responsibility. However, since he left, he's not engaging, so maybe he's not in the wrong. But the problem is that he was prepared with his own, but she refused, so he should have used hers instead. \n\nThis is tricky. In general, respecting a partner's wishes is important. If the woman is clear that she won't proceed unless he uses her condom, then he should either comply or not proceed. Since he chose not to proceed, maybe he's in the right. But if he had his own and she refused, maybe he should have used hers. However, the user might have valid reasons for not using her condom, like he doesn't trust them or they're expired. But in the scenario, there's no mention of that. The user just had his own. So maybe he should have used hers if she's insistent. But if he's not comfortable with that, he's within his rights to not proceed. \n\nThe fact that her friend called him an asshole suggests that maybe in her friend's opinion, he was wrong to not use her condom. But whether that's true depends on the situation. Since the user left, he didn't force anything, so he's not in the wrong for that. However, if the woman was trying to conceive, and he thought she was okay with not using a condom, but she actually wanted to use hers, then there's a misunderstanding. But if she wanted to have kids soon, then maybe she shouldn't be using condoms. So this is confusing. \n\nIn conclusion, the user might not be in the wrong if he respected her boundary by not proceeding when she refused his condom, but if he had an opportunity to use hers and choose not to, that could be an issue. However, since he left, he's not engaging in the act, so he's not using any protection. The confusion here is that the user might have misread her intentions. If she wanted to conceive, then using a condom would prevent that, but if she was using hers for protection, then he should use hers. The user's actions were to leave, which is respecting her boundary, but maybe he should have clarified the situation first.\n"
