Of course I came prepared with a Trojan fresh out the box popped into my pocket. I get there and you know blah blah happens and eventually I pull the condom out before insertion. She says \u201cno no, there\u2019s no need, I have some\u201d but I say I already have it and start unwrapping it. Here\u2019s where she gets persistent. She hops up and says \u201cNo we\u2019re using mine,\u201d and says she won\u2019t let me until we use one she had. Now she had mentioned wanting kids soon, like in 2 months soon, but thought we\u2019d just maybe mess around for a week or two and that\u2019d be it. I thought nothing of it originally and honestly now I was scared. I said \u201cno, why\u2019re you so persistent.\u201d She then states that if I wasn\u2019t to use hers, I might as well leave. So I put on my clothes, did the ol\u2019 reliable waistband tuck, though there wasn\u2019t much to tuck at this point. I now was texted by her friend calling me an asshole and making a big deal out of nothing. I am starting to get second thoughts and thought I should\u2019ve went along\n\nTL;DR: girl wouldn\u2019t let me use my own condom, said i couldn\u2019t smash until I used hers\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author did something wrong by not using his girlfriend's condom. The situation is that they were about to have sex, he brought his own condom, but she insisted on using hers and even made him leave if he didn't. He went home but later received a friend's message calling him an asshole.\n\nFirst, I need to consider consent and safety. Using a condom is a mutual decision, and both parties should agree on which one to use. The author had his own, but she refused and was adamant. However, the key point is that she didn't force him to use hers against his will. He chose not to proceed and left instead of complying with her request. \n\nNow, from a health perspective, using any condom is better than none. But if there's a disagreement, communication is crucial. The author might have felt uncomfortable using hers, maybe due to concerns about her STI status or other reasons. However, bringing up her wanting kids soon adds another layer. If she's planning to get pregnant, maybe she's on birth control, but if he's not on a method, using a condom is still important for STI protection.\n\nThe problem here might be that he didn't communicate his concerns. Instead of trying to use his own, maybe he should have discussed why he preferred his. But she was insistent and even made him leave. He chose to leave, which is his right, but the friend's reaction suggests maybe there was a cultural expectation or misunderstanding. \n\nIn terms of right or wrong, if both condoms are safe and effective, the choice should be mutual. If she was okay with using hers, but he had reservations, he should have expressed them. However, since he left without escalating the situation, maybe he's not entirely at fault. But the fact that he didn't use any condom at all might be the issue. Wait, he didn't use hers, so he didn't use any. But she wanted to use hers, and he refused. So he didn't use a condom, which could be risky. However, he left the situation instead of proceeding without a condom. So maybe he's not in the wrong because he prioritized his own boundaries. But if using a condom is a mutual agreement, and he left instead of using hers, maybe she's in the wrong for being too controlling. \n\nBut the user thinks the author is in the wrong. The question is whether the author is in the wrong for not using his girlfriend's condom. If the girlfriend is okay with her own, and he's okay using hers, then it's fine. But if he had reservations, like not trusting her or not having his own, then he's not wrong to leave. However, in the scenario, he had his own but she refused. So he chose not to use hers, which could be seen as not respecting her choice. But since they were about to have sex and he had his own, maybe the issue is about mutual agreement. If she said no to his and he refused to use hers, then he's not respecting her. But he left, so maybe he's not in the wrong because he didn't proceed without a condom. \n\nHmm, this is tricky. The key points are mutual consent on which condom to use. Since he had his own but she wanted hers, and he left instead of using hers, he's not using any. But maybe the problem is that he didn't use hers. However, if he's uncomfortable using hers, it's his right to leave. But if the issue is that he had his own but she didn't let him use it, maybe the fault is on her for being controlling. But the user's question is about the author. If the author didn't use a condom at all (since he left), then he's not protecting himself or her. But he left, so maybe he's not in the wrong. Alternatively, if using a condom is a mutual agreement, and he left instead of using hers, maybe he's not in the wrong because he respected his own boundaries. But the girlfriend's friend called him an asshole, which might indicate cultural expectations. \n\nOverall, the answer might depend on cultural norms and mutual consent. Since he left and didn't proceed, and the disagreement was about which condom to use, maybe he's not in the wrong. But if using a condom was agreed upon, and he didn't use any, he might be. However, the situation is that he had a condom but she refused it, leading to no use. Since he left, he didn't proceed, so no harm done. So perhaps he's not in the wrong. Answer B.\n"
