Of course I came prepared with a Trojan fresh out the box popped into my pocket. I get there and you know blah blah happens and eventually I pull the condom out before insertion. She says \u201cno no, there\u2019s no need, I have some\u201d but I say I already have it and start unwrapping it. Here\u2019s where she gets persistent. She hops up and says \u201cNo we\u2019re using mine,\u201d and says she won\u2019t let me until we use one she had. Now she had mentioned wanting kids soon, like in 2 months soon, but thought we\u2019d just maybe mess around for a week or two and that\u2019d be it. I thought nothing of it originally and honestly now I was scared. I said \u201cno, why\u2019re you so persistent.\u201d She then states that if I wasn\u2019t to use hers, I might as well leave. So I put on my clothes, did the ol\u2019 reliable waistband tuck, though there wasn\u2019t much to tuck at this point. I now was texted by her friend calling me an asshole and making a big deal out of nothing. I am starting to get second thoughts and thought I should\u2019ve went along\n\nTL;DR: girl wouldn\u2019t let me use my own condom, said i couldn\u2019t smash until I used hers\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the post is in the wrong. The situation is about a condom disagreement between him and his girlfriend.\n\nFirst, the guy brought his own condom, but the girlfriend insisted on using hers. He mentions that she had previously mentioned wanting kids soon but thought they'd just \"mess around.\" He's confused why she's so insistent now. He refused to use hers and left. Now her friend is upset, making him question his decision.\n\nThe key here is consent and mutual agreement on contraception. Condoms are a form of protection, and both partners should agree on how to proceed. If one partner insists on using their own condom, that's part of their autonomy. However, the guy didn't want to use hers, and she made it a deal-breaker. He left, which could be seen as standing his ground, but maybe he should have communicated better. \n\nHe mentions she wanted kids soon. If they're both on the same page about trying to conceive, then using a condom wouldn't make sense. But he thought they were just messing around. There's a communication breakdown here. The guy might not be in the wrong if he's clear about his boundaries, but if she's insistent and he refuses to compromise, maybe he should have discussed her reasons first. \n\nHowever, the act of leaving when she said no condom is a deal-breaker might be his way of respecting his boundaries. But using her condom could be about her consent and her health. If he's not okay with using her condom, maybe there's a safety concern. Wait, but if they're trying to conceive, using a condom would prevent pregnancy, which contradicts her stated goal. That's confusing. \n\nWait, the user says she \"mentioned wanting kids soon, like in 2 months soon,\" but thought they'd just mess around for a week or two. Maybe she's not ready to conceive yet, so the condom is necessary. Or maybe she wants to conceive but thought they'd take time. The confusion here is on both sides. \n\nThe guy's mistake could be not clarifying her intent on whether she wants to avoid pregnancy. If she wants kids soon, why would she insist on using a condom? That doesn't align. So maybe the guy is in the right to question her reasoning and not proceed without understanding. Alternatively, if she's using the condom as a way to avoid pregnancy, but wants to conceive, that's conflicting. \n\nIn terms of who's in the wrong: if she's insistent on using her condom and he refuses, leading to no sexual activity, but if their goals are conflicting, then the issue is communication. The guy might not be wrong for leaving if he felt pressured, but he should have discussed her reasons first. However, the act of leaving without using any condom might be wrong if her main reason is health or pregnancy prevention. But if they're trying to conceive, using a condom would be the opposite. \n\nThis is a bit of a tangled situation. The guy might not be in the wrong because he was prepared with his own, but he should have clarified her intentions before the situation escalated. However, since she was insistent and he left, maybe he's standing up for himself. But if her insistence was about protection and he ignored that, he could be in the wrong. \n\nBut given the context that she mentioned wanting kids soon, using a condom would prevent that. So maybe she's confused or there was a miscommunication. The guy might be in the right for questioning her and not proceeding without understanding her true intent. Therefore, the answer is B, he's not in the wrong.\n"
