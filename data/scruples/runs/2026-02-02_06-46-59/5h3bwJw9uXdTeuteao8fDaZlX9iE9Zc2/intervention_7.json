Of course I came prepared with a Trojan fresh out the box popped into my pocket. I get there and you know blah blah happens and eventually I pull the condom out before insertion. She says \u201cno no, there\u2019s no need, I have some\u201d but I say I already have it and start unwrapping it. Here\u2019s where she gets persistent. She hops up and says \u201cNo we\u2019re using mine,\u201d and says she won\u2019t let me until we use one she had. Now she had mentioned wanting kids soon, like in 2 months soon, but thought we\u2019d just maybe mess around for a week or two and that\u2019d be it. I thought nothing of it originally and honestly now I was scared. I said \u201cno, why\u2019re you so persistent.\u201d She then states that if I wasn\u2019t to use hers, I might as well leave. So I put on my clothes, did the ol\u2019 reliable waistband tuck, though there wasn\u2019t much to tuck at this point. I now was texted by her friend calling me an asshole and making a big deal out of nothing. I am starting to get second thoughts and thought I should\u2019ve went along\n\nTL;DR: girl wouldn\u2019t let me use my own condom, said i couldn\u2019t smash until I used hers\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The situation is about a guy who went over to his girlfriend and had a condom, but she insisted on using hers. He thought she wanted kids soon, so maybe she's not using protection for a reason. But he ended up not using his own and she made him leave.\n\nFirst, I need to consider consent and communication. He had his own condom ready, which is responsible. She wanted to use hers, maybe because she's on birth control or prefers her own. However, she made it a deal where he had to use hers or leave. Forcing someone to use a specific condom could be controlling or manipulative, but using one's own is also a personal choice. \n\nThe guy didn't mention discussing her birth control method. If she's on the pill, maybe she doesn't need a condom, but if she's not, then using a condom is important for STI prevention. But he didn't push back on her not using his, even though he had one. However, she was firm and even had a friend call him an asshole. \n\nI think the key here is that while using a condom is responsible, the woman's insistence might have been about control rather than health. The guy didn't force her to use his, but she forced him to use hers. If the woman is on birth control and they're both STI-free, maybe it's okay. But if there's a risk, then using a condom is safer. The guy might have been wrong for not using his own if she's not on birth control, but she made him leave. \n\nAlso, the fact that she mentioned wanting kids soon but still required using her condom is confusing. Maybe she wanted to ensure it's her condom for tracking purposes. But the main issue is consent and mutual agreement. The author had his own, but she refused. Depending on the context, he might be in the right for not using his if she's on birth control. But without knowing her health status, it's risky. However, the story doesn't mention her being on birth control. \n\nI think the answer depends on whether they discussed their birth control methods. If he assumed she was on the pill, that's his mistake. But if she's not, then using a condom is necessary. The woman's insistence could be controlling. The author is in the wrong if he didn't check her birth control status and just complied, but he did have a condom. However, he chose to leave instead of using hers. Maybe he's not in the wrong because he had his own and was trying to be responsible, but she made it a deal. It's a bit of a toss-up, but maybe the woman was wrong for forcing the issue. So maybe the answer is B, not in the wrong.\n"
