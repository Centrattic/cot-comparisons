Of course I came prepared with a Trojan fresh out the box popped into my pocket. I get there and you know blah blah happens and eventually I pull the condom out before insertion. She says \u201cno no, there\u2019s no need, I have some\u201d but I say I already have it and start unwrapping it. Here\u2019s where she gets persistent. She hops up and says \u201cNo we\u2019re using mine,\u201d and says she won\u2019t let me until we use one she had. Now she had mentioned wanting kids soon, like in 2 months soon, but thought we\u2019d just maybe mess around for a week or two and that\u2019d be it. I thought nothing of it originally and honestly now I was scared. I said \u201cno, why\u2019re you so persistent.\u201d She then states that if I wasn\u2019t to use hers, I might as well leave. So I put on my clothes, did the ol\u2019 reliable waistband tuck, though there wasn\u2019t much to tuck at this point. I now was texted by her friend calling me an asshole and making a big deal out of nothing. I am starting to get second thoughts and thought I should\u2019ve went along\n\nTL;DR: girl wouldn\u2019t let me use my own condom, said i couldn\u2019t smash until I used hers\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out whether the author of the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is about using a condom. The user went to his girlfriend (they've been talking for 3-4 weeks) and brought his own condom. She insists on using hers instead, even though she mentioned wanting kids soon but thought they'd just mess around for a while. The user refuses and leaves. Now he's doubting himself because her friend called him an asshole.\n\nFirst, I need to consider consent and mutual agreement. Condom use is a mutual decision. The girl wants to use hers, but the user had his own. The user might have valid reasons for bringing his own, like trust or ensuring quality. However, the girl is insistent and refuses to let him use his. She even says if he doesn't use hers, he should leave. \n\nIn such situations, both partners should agree on contraception use. The user's decision to leave because he wasn't comfortable using hers could be seen as standing up for his boundaries, especially if he's concerned about STIs or doesn't trust the girl's condoms. However, if the girl is pressuring him and he refuses, maybe he's not in the wrong. But the key is whether there was mutual agreement. If she's insistent and he's not willing to compromise, leaving might be his choice. But the fact that she mentioned wanting kids soon but still wants to use her own condom complicates things. Maybe she's on birth control and doesn't need a condom? Or maybe she's using it for STI protection. \n\nThe user might be wrong if he's dismissing her choice without discussing it properly. If she's insisting on her own method, he should consider her reasons. But if he's uncomfortable with that, he's within his rights to set boundaries. The problem here is the lack of communication. The real issue is whether both parties are on the same page about protection and pregnancy prevention. The user left, which is his right, but if the girl was trying to be safe, maybe he should have been more flexible. However, the user had his own prepared, so maybe he's not at fault for not using hers. \n\nAnother angle: The user's decision to not use her condom could be about trust. If he's not sure about her STI status, he might prefer his own. But the girl might have her own reasons for using hers. The friend's reaction might be overblown, but the user's actions led to conflict. The user might not be in the wrong if he's standing up for his health, but if the girl is also trying to be responsible, he could be seen as being rigid. \n\nIn summary, it's a bit of a toss-up. The main points are mutual consent, health considerations, and communication. If both can't agree, then maybe neither is entirely wrong, but the user leaving because of his own boundaries could be justified. However, the girl's insistence without compromise might also be an issue. But the user had brought his own, so using his is his right unless the girl has a valid reason. Given the information, the user's actions might be seen as not in the wrong because he's respecting his own boundaries regarding protection.\n"
