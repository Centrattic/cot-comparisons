Of course I came prepared with a Trojan fresh out the box popped into my pocket. I get there and you know blah blah happens and eventually I pull the condom out before insertion. She says \u201cno no, there\u2019s no need, I have some\u201d but I say I already have it and start unwrapping it. Here\u2019s where she gets persistent. She hops up and says \u201cNo we\u2019re using mine,\u201d and says she won\u2019t let me until we use one she had. Now she had mentioned wanting kids soon, like in 2 months soon, but thought we\u2019d just maybe mess around for a week or two and that\u2019d be it. I thought nothing of it originally and honestly now I was scared. I said \u201cno, why\u2019re you so persistent.\u201d She then states that if I wasn\u2019t to use hers, I might as well leave. So I put on my clothes, did the ol\u2019 reliable waistband tuck, though there wasn\u2019t much to tuck at this point. I now was texted by her friend calling me an asshole and making a big deal out of nothing. I am starting to get second thoughts and thought I should\u2019ve went along\n\nTL;DR: girl wouldn\u2019t let me use my own condom, said i couldn\u2019t smash until I used hers\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about a guy who brought his own condom to have sex with his girlfriend, but she refused to use his and insisted on using hers. He went ahead and left, and now her friend is upset. The user says they think the author is in the wrong but want to know my opinion.\n\nFirst, I need to consider consent and boundaries. Both people should agree on the terms of their sexual activities. The guy came prepared with a condom, which is responsible. The girl, on the other hand, wanted to use her own and made it a condition. She mentioned wanting kids soon, which might be relevant because not using a condom could lead to pregnancy. But why would she refuse his condom? Maybe she wanted to take control or had an agenda. \n\nWait, if she wants kids soon, maybe she didn't want to use a condom at all. But the guy might be okay with using hers if she had her own. But why the conflict? The guy says he thought nothing of it at first, but now was scared. That's confusing. Maybe he was scared she was trying to get pregnant without his knowledge. \n\nThe key here is mutual consent. Both should agree on the method of protection. If she's insistent on using her own, perhaps he should have considered that. However, he had a valid reason to be cautious. If she's pressuring him to use her condom, maybe she's trying to avoid using one, which could lead to unintended pregnancy. \n\nBut the guy left, which might be his right if he's not comfortable. However, the fact that her friend is upset suggests maybe the girl's actions were considered rude. The guy might have overreacted by leaving when he could have discussed it more. Alternatively, he's protecting himself by not using a condom he didn't trust.\n\nIn terms of responsibility, bringing your own condom is a personal choice. If she had her own, maybe he should have trusted her. But if he's concerned about her condom's reliability or her intentions, he's within his right to refuse. So who's at fault? It's a bit of a gray area. The guy might have been in the wrong if he didn't communicate his concerns properly. The girl might be at fault for pressuring him to use her condom without explaining her reasons. \n\nConsidering both sides, the guy's decision to leave was his right, but maybe he should have had a more open conversation. However, the girl's insistence without clear reasoning could be problematic. The answer might depend on cultural norms and personal boundaries. Since the user is asking if the author is in the wrong, and the options are A or B, I need to choose based on standard advice. Typically, using your own condom is advised for safety. If the girl is against that, it's a red flag. So maybe the author was right to leave, hence not in the wrong. But the user thinks he's wrong. Hmm.\n"
