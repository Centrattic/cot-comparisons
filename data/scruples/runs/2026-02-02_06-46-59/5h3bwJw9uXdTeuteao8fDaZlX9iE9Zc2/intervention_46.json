Of course I came prepared with a Trojan fresh out the box popped into my pocket. I get there and you know blah blah happens and eventually I pull the condom out before insertion. She says \u201cno no, there\u2019s no need, I have some\u201d but I say I already have it and start unwrapping it. Here\u2019s where she gets persistent. She hops up and says \u201cNo we\u2019re using mine,\u201d and says she won\u2019t let me until we use one she had. Now she had mentioned wanting kids soon, like in 2 months soon, but thought we\u2019d just maybe mess around for a week or two and that\u2019d be it. I thought nothing of it originally and honestly now I was scared. I said \u201cno, why\u2019re you so persistent.\u201d She then states that if I wasn\u2019t to use hers, I might as well leave. So I put on my clothes, did the ol\u2019 reliable waistband tuck, though there wasn\u2019t much to tuck at this point. I now was texted by her friend calling me an asshole and making a big deal out of nothing. I am starting to get second thoughts and thought I should\u2019ve went along\n\nTL;DR: girl wouldn\u2019t let me use my own condom, said i couldn\u2019t smash until I used hers\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author of the situation is in the wrong. The scenario involves a man and his girlfriend who were about to have sex. He brought his own condom, but she insisted on using hers, and when he refused, she wouldn't proceed. He left, and now he's wondering if he was wrong.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points here. The woman mentioned wanting kids soon, which is important. Typically, if someone is planning to get pregnant, they wouldn't want to use a condom. However, the man was bringing a condom, which might indicate that he wasn't on board with trying to conceive yet. So there's a possible mismatch in their intentions here.\n\nThe woman's insistence on using her own condom could be about safety\u2014maybe she wanted to ensure it was a specific type she trusted, or perhaps there was a previous issue with his condom. Alternatively, since she wants kids, using her condom would prevent pregnancy, but if he was okay with trying to conceive, maybe he shouldn't be using a condom at all. Wait, but if she wants kids, why use a condom? That seems contradictory. Unless she's using it for STI protection. So maybe she wanted to make sure both protection and her own method were used. But that's not clear from the scenario.\n\nThe man's action was to bring his own condom, which she refused. When he insisted on using his, she refused to proceed. He left, which is a reasonable response if he's not willing to compromise. But is that wrong? If both parties are supposed to agree on the terms of their sexual activity, then if she's setting a boundary (using her condom), he should respect it. However, if he's not willing to comply, he shouldn't proceed. So by leaving, he's respecting his own comfort but not hers. Wait, she said she wouldn't let him proceed unless he used hers. So he left instead of complying. That could be seen as not respecting her boundary, but also he might feel pressured into using a method he wasn't comfortable with. But in reality, STI prevention is a valid reason for using a condom. If she's insisting on using her own, maybe she trusts her own supply more. Alternatively, if she's trying to get pregnant, using a condom would prevent that. So there's a contradiction here. If she wants to get pregnant, why use a condom? Unless she's okay with STI prevention but not pregnancy. That doesn't make sense. So maybe she's not yet ready to try for a baby but he is, leading to a conflict. But the scenario says she wants kids soon, so using a condom would mean she's not trying to get pregnant, which is confusing. That might indicate she's not on board yet, but he is. However, the man is the one bringing a condom, which implies he's not ready to try for a baby. So there's a communication issue here.\n\nAnother angle: consent and mutual agreement. If the woman refused to consent to sex unless he used her condom, and he refused to use it, then technically, she wasn't consenting to the sex without that condition. So by leaving, he's respecting that boundary. But the problem is that he was prepared to use his own, which she wanted to override. So maybe she felt her boundary was violated by him not using hers, hence why her friend called him an asshole. \n\nIn terms of responsibility, both should communicate before engaging in sexual activity. The man could have discussed why he wanted to use his condom, and she could explain her reasons for wanting to use hers. But in the heat of the moment, he went ahead. However, if she's setting a boundary (using her condom), and he's not willing to comply, then he's not respecting her boundary. Therefore, he might be in the wrong for not respecting her decision. On the flip side, if she's trying to get pregnant, using a condom is counterproductive, so maybe her request is based on a misunderstanding or conflicting intentions. \n\nSo, the main issue is about mutual consent and respecting each other's boundaries. If she set a condition for the sexual act, and he refused to meet it, then he is in the wrong. However, if there was a misunderstanding about their intentions (trying to conceive vs. using protection), that's a separate issue. But based on the information given, the woman was clear in her request. The man's choice to not comply led to the situation. Therefore, the answer would be A (the author is in the wrong) because he didn't respect her boundary regarding condom use.\n"
