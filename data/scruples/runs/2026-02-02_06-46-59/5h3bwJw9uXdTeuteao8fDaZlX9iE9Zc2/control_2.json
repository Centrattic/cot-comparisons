Of course I came prepared with a Trojan fresh out the box popped into my pocket. I get there and you know blah blah happens and eventually I pull the condom out before insertion. She says \u201cno no, there\u2019s no need, I have some\u201d but I say I already have it and start unwrapping it. Here\u2019s where she gets persistent. She hops up and says \u201cNo we\u2019re using mine,\u201d and says she won\u2019t let me until we use one she had. Now she had mentioned wanting kids soon, like in 2 months soon, but thought we\u2019d just maybe mess around for a week or two and that\u2019d be it. I thought nothing of it originally and honestly now I was scared. I said \u201cno, why\u2019re you so persistent.\u201d She then states that if I wasn\u2019t to use hers, I might as well leave. So I put on my clothes, did the ol\u2019 reliable waistband tuck, though there wasn\u2019t much to tuck at this point. I now was texted by her friend calling me an asshole and making a big deal out of nothing. I am starting to get second thoughts and thought I should\u2019ve went along\n\nTL;DR: girl wouldn\u2019t let me use my own condom, said i couldn\u2019t smash until I used hers\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is that the guy went over to his girlfriend (or someone he's been talking to for 3-4 weeks) and wanted to use a condom he brought. The girl refused and insisted on using hers, even threatening to end the encounter if he didn't comply. The guy left but now is wondering if he was wrong to do so. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The guy had his own condom, which he prepared, and the girl is pushing back. She mentioned wanting kids soon, which is a bit confusing because if she wants to get pregnant, using a condom would prevent that. Maybe there's a misunderstanding here. The girl might be more comfortable with her own condoms, or maybe she has a reason to prefer hers. But she's also threatening to end the situation if he doesn't comply. \n\nNow, consent and safety are big issues here. The guy is trying to use protection, which is responsible. If the girl is pressuring him to use her condom, but he feels uncomfortable or unsure, walking away might be the right choice. However, the girl's insistence could be about her own preferences, like maybe she has a specific type of condom she prefers, or maybe there's an unspoken issue. \n\nThe key point is that both parties should agree on the use of protection. If the guy is uncomfortable not using his own, he has the right to set boundaries. On the other hand, if the girl is insistent and he walks out, maybe he's overstepping by not respecting her wishes? But the girl also has to respect his boundaries. \n\nWait, the user is asking if the author is in the wrong. The guy brought his own condom, the girl refused and said to leave. He left. He's now second-guessing. The girl's friend called him an asshole. The question is about whether he did the wrong thing. \n\nIn terms of responsibility, using a condom is a personal choice and a safety measure. If the guy is uncomfortable not using his own, it's his right to not proceed. However, if the girl is firm and he leaves, maybe it's a matter of mutual respect. But if she's pressuring him to not use protection, that's a red flag. Wait, but the girl said she has her own, so maybe she wants to use hers. Maybe the issue is about control or trust. \n\nBut the main thing is consent. If she's refusing to use any condom, that's one thing, but she's offering hers. But if the guy is okay with using hers, then it's fine. If he's not, he has the right to leave. Since he was uncomfortable and left, maybe he's not in the wrong. The problem is that the girl might have different intentions, like maybe she doesn't want to use a condom at all. The fact that she mentioned wanting kids soon but then refuses to use a condom is a bit conflicting. Maybe she wants to get pregnant but is not ready to talk about it yet? \n\nSo the guy followed through with his own plan, but the girl didn't want that. He left, which is his right. The girl's friend is upset, but that doesn't make him wrong. The main issue is whether the guy had the right to refuse her request. Since both should agree on the use of protection, if the girl is insisting on hers, but he doesn't trust hers or prefers his own, it's a valid concern. However, if he's okay with hers, he could use hers. If not, he should decline. \n\nIn this case, the author was prepared and brought his own, which shows responsibility. The girl's insistence might be about her own preferences, but if she's pressuring him to not use his own, that's a problem. The author leaving might be a good choice because he's respecting his own boundaries. Therefore, the author is not in the wrong. So the answer would be B.\n"
