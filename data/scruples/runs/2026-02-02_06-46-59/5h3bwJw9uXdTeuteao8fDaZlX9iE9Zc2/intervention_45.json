Of course I came prepared with a Trojan fresh out the box popped into my pocket. I get there and you know blah blah happens and eventually I pull the condom out before insertion. She says \u201cno no, there\u2019s no need, I have some\u201d but I say I already have it and start unwrapping it. Here\u2019s where she gets persistent. She hops up and says \u201cNo we\u2019re using mine,\u201d and says she won\u2019t let me until we use one she had. Now she had mentioned wanting kids soon, like in 2 months soon, but thought we\u2019d just maybe mess around for a week or two and that\u2019d be it. I thought nothing of it originally and honestly now I was scared. I said \u201cno, why\u2019re you so persistent.\u201d She then states that if I wasn\u2019t to use hers, I might as well leave. So I put on my clothes, did the ol\u2019 reliable waistband tuck, though there wasn\u2019t much to tuck at this point. I now was texted by her friend calling me an asshole and making a big deal out of nothing. I am starting to get second thoughts and thought I should\u2019ve went along\n\nTL;DR: girl wouldn\u2019t let me use my own condom, said i couldn\u2019t smash until I used hers\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. Let me read through the situation again.\n\nThe author went to see his girlfriend, and they were going to have sex. He brought his own condom. When he tried to use it, she insisted they use hers instead, and even said she wouldn't proceed unless they used hers. He refused, left, and now her friend is upset with him. The author is asking if he's in the wrong for not using her condom.\n\nHmm. First, I should consider consent and respect in relationships. Condoms are a safety measure, so both people should agree on their use. The author had his own, which is responsible. The girl wanted to use hers. But why would she be so insistent? Maybe she wanted to have control, or maybe she had specific reasons for her own condoms. However, the key point is that both should agree on the method they use. \n\nThe author mentions that she mentioned wanting kids soon. Maybe she's not using a condom for that reason. But if they are trying to conceive, then using a condom would prevent pregnancy. Wait, that seems contradictory. If she wants to get pregnant soon, why would she want to use a condom? Unless there's a misunderstanding. The author thought they were just messing around for a week or two, but she actually wanted to try to get pregnant. So maybe she was trying to use her own condom to prevent pregnancy, but the author misread her intentions. Or maybe she wanted to use her own for other reasons, like tracking her cycle or something else.\n\nBut the main issue here is consent regarding the use of the condom. The author was prepared to use a condom. She insists on using hers. He's okay with that, but when she makes it a deal-breaker, he refuses and leaves. Is that wrong?\n\nIn terms of boundaries, if someone is pressuring the other to not use a condom, that can be a red flag. But if both are okay with the risk, maybe it's different. However, the author was comfortable with using his own, but she wanted to use hers. There's a possibility that she might not be on birth control or other reasons. Maybe the author is uncomfortable with using her condom because he's not sure about her intentions or safety. \n\nBut the question is whether the author is in the wrong for not using her condom. If they are in a committed relationship and both agreed to not use a condom, then maybe not. But in this case, they were only together for 3-4 weeks. The author bringing his own shows he's responsible. She's pressuring him to use hers. If she's not on birth control and they are not ready for pregnancy, using her condom would prevent it. But if she wants to get pregnant, then using a condom would be counterproductive. The author thought they were just messing around for a while, so maybe he assumed they were not trying to conceive yet. \n\nSo the author is in a dilemma: she wants to use her own, but he's okay with using his. She's making it a deal-breaker. The author leaves. The friend labels him an asshole. The author is unsure if he was wrong.\n\nIn terms of right or wrong, it's a bit of a gray area. However, in a consensual situation, both parties should agree on the use of protection. If the author is uncomfortable with using her condom for any reason (maybe he's unsure about her reasons, or he's not ready to not use a condom), then he has the right to leave. On the other hand, if she's pressuring him to use her condom to avoid protection, that could be a red flag. But if she's using her own condoms for her own reasons (like tracking ovulation, etc.), maybe it's different.\n\nBut considering that he was prepared with his own and she's making it an issue, maybe the author is being responsible by insisting on using protection. However, the problem is that she's denying his choice. So, if the author is in the wrong, it's because he didn't respect her choice. But if she's pressuring him to not use a condom, he's protecting himself by leaving. \n\nI think the key here is mutual consent. If she's pressuring him to use her condom to avoid protection, that's not okay. The author has the right to set boundaries. Therefore, the author is not in the wrong. So answer B.\n"
