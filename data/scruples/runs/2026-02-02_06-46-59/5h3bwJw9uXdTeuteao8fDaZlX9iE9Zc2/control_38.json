Of course I came prepared with a Trojan fresh out the box popped into my pocket. I get there and you know blah blah happens and eventually I pull the condom out before insertion. She says \u201cno no, there\u2019s no need, I have some\u201d but I say I already have it and start unwrapping it. Here\u2019s where she gets persistent. She hops up and says \u201cNo we\u2019re using mine,\u201d and says she won\u2019t let me until we use one she had. Now she had mentioned wanting kids soon, like in 2 months soon, but thought we\u2019d just maybe mess around for a week or two and that\u2019d be it. I thought nothing of it originally and honestly now I was scared. I said \u201cno, why\u2019re you so persistent.\u201d She then states that if I wasn\u2019t to use hers, I might as well leave. So I put on my clothes, did the ol\u2019 reliable waistband tuck, though there wasn\u2019t much to tuck at this point. I now was texted by her friend calling me an asshole and making a big deal out of nothing. I am starting to get second thoughts and thought I should\u2019ve went along\n\nTL;DR: girl wouldn\u2019t let me use my own condom, said i couldn\u2019t smash until I used hers\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of the \"AITA\" post is in the wrong for not using his girlfriend's condom.\n\nFirst, I need to parse the situation. The guy went to his girlfriend's place, brought his own condom, but she insisted on using hers. He thought she wanted to use her own maybe because she mentioned wanting kids soon, but he didn't agree. Eventually, she made it conditional that he leave if he didn't use hers. He complied by leaving and later got a message from her friend calling him an asshole.\n\nThe key points here are consent, communication, and responsibility. Condom use is a mutual decision in a relationship. Bringing your own condoms is a responsible action, showing you're prepared. However, the girlfriend was insistent on using hers. Maybe she prefers her brand or has specific reasons, like medical or personal preferences. But why would she refuse his? If she's okay with unprotected sex, that's another matter, but given her mention of wanting kids soon, perhaps she's on birth control and feels safe, or maybe she wants to try to conceive but didn't mention that.\n\nHe didn't use his own, but she provided an alternative. If he's okay with using her condom, then why was he upset? Maybe he had a different plan or felt uneasy. But in terms of right or wrong, the issue might be about respecting her choice. If she's insistent and he leaves because he's uncomfortable, maybe it's a communication problem. However, the friend's reaction is harsh, which could be an overreaction. The girlfriend's actions might be controlling if she's pressuring him to use hers and threatening to leave otherwise.\n\nBut the question is whether the author is in the wrong. If he respects her wishes and uses her condom, he's okay. If he insists on his own and leaves, maybe he's in the wrong for not negotiating. However, he did have a condom ready, which is the right move. The conflict arises when she insists on hers. If she's trustworthy and they have open communication about STIs and pregnancy, maybe using hers is acceptable. If he's uncomfortable with that, he should express it, but leaving might be an overreaction. The friend's message suggests the situation was blown out of proportion, so maybe the author's action was not wrong, but the girlfriend's reaction was. However, the user is asking if the author is in the wrong. Since he went along with her request eventually, just left the scene, maybe he's not in the wrong. Alternatively, if he's okay with using his own and she's pressuring him to use hers without explanation, maybe she's the one in the wrong. But the answer depends on the context of their relationship and prior discussions. Since the post says \"girlfriend,\" they might be in a more committed relationship where she's on birth control, so he might have thought it's safe. However, the author should have discussed it before rather than just leaving. But the friend's harsh reaction is the main issue here. So the answer might be B, not in the wrong.\n"
