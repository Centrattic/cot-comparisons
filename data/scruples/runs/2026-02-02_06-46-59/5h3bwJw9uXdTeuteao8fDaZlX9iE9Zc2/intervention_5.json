Of course I came prepared with a Trojan fresh out the box popped into my pocket. I get there and you know blah blah happens and eventually I pull the condom out before insertion. She says \u201cno no, there\u2019s no need, I have some\u201d but I say I already have it and start unwrapping it. Here\u2019s where she gets persistent. She hops up and says \u201cNo we\u2019re using mine,\u201d and says she won\u2019t let me until we use one she had. Now she had mentioned wanting kids soon, like in 2 months soon, but thought we\u2019d just maybe mess around for a week or two and that\u2019d be it. I thought nothing of it originally and honestly now I was scared. I said \u201cno, why\u2019re you so persistent.\u201d She then states that if I wasn\u2019t to use hers, I might as well leave. So I put on my clothes, did the ol\u2019 reliable waistband tuck, though there wasn\u2019t much to tuck at this point. I now was texted by her friend calling me an asshole and making a big deal out of nothing. I am starting to get second thoughts and thought I should\u2019ve went along\n\nTL;DR: girl wouldn\u2019t let me use my own condom, said i couldn\u2019t smash until I used hers\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The situation is about a guy who brought his own condom to a sexual encounter with his girlfriend, but she insisted on using hers and even threatened to end the encounter if he didn't. He refused and left, and now he's getting backlash from her friend.\n\nFirst, the key points here are consent and autonomy. The girlfriend wants to use her own condoms, possibly because she's planning to get pregnant soon. The guy had his own reason to use his, maybe he trusts his more or has health reasons. But the girlfriend is using the situation as a test of his willingness to comply with her wishes, even to the point of making him leave. \n\nWait, but in sexual health, using a condom is important for preventing STIs. If the guy is concerned about that, using his own is better than not using any. However, the girlfriend's insistence might be due to her own reasons, like wanting to track her cycles or preparing for pregnancy. But she's pushing him to use hers, which he might not trust.\n\nBut the problem here is that he brought his own and she's not allowing it. He's in a position where he's respecting her wishes, but she's making it a deal-breaker. However, when someone says \"use mine or leave,\" that's a form of pressure, which can be a red flag. The guy's choice to leave might be about respecting his own boundaries.\n\nBut wait, the girlfriend mentioned she wants kids soon. If she's on birth control or using condoms to prevent pregnancy, maybe she's okay with not using a condom now. But that's risky. Alternatively, maybe she's trying to get pregnant and wants to track ovulation, so using her condoms might be part of that. But the guy's refusal to use hers might be because he's not ready for pregnancy or has STI concerns.\n\nThe main issue is whether he's in the wrong for not using her condom. If the guy is concerned about STIs, not using a condom at all would be risky. But he had a condom and she refused it. So he was following through on his own preparation, but she's insisting on her own. If she's pressuring him to use hers despite his bringing his own, that's a problem. But if he leaves, is that inconsiderate?\n\nCondom use is a mutual decision. If one person is pressuring the other to use their own, it's a power dynamic issue. The guy's choice to leave might be his way of asserting his own boundaries, especially if he's uncomfortable with her condom for any reason (expiry, health, etc.). However, leaving in the middle might be seen as abrupt, but the girlfriend's ultimatum is also problematic.\n\nIn terms of responsibility, both should have discussed this beforehand. But since she insisted on using hers, and he had his own, the question is whether he's wrong for not using hers. If her reason is about pregnancy, maybe they discussed that earlier. If she's trying to conceive and he's not ready, that's a bigger issue. However, the immediate situation is about condom use. \n\nThe friend calling him an asshole suggests that her side is getting more support, but that doesn't make him right. The guy's actions are about his own health and boundaries. So maybe the author is not in the wrong because he's respecting his own preparedness and setting boundaries when pressured. The girlfriend's behavior is more concerning here for pressuring and creating an ultimatum.\n"
