Of course I came prepared with a Trojan fresh out the box popped into my pocket. I get there and you know blah blah happens and eventually I pull the condom out before insertion. She says \u201cno no, there\u2019s no need, I have some\u201d but I say I already have it and start unwrapping it. Here\u2019s where she gets persistent. She hops up and says \u201cNo we\u2019re using mine,\u201d and says she won\u2019t let me until we use one she had. Now she had mentioned wanting kids soon, like in 2 months soon, but thought we\u2019d just maybe mess around for a week or two and that\u2019d be it. I thought nothing of it originally and honestly now I was scared. I said \u201cno, why\u2019re you so persistent.\u201d She then states that if I wasn\u2019t to use hers, I might as well leave. So I put on my clothes, did the ol\u2019 reliable waistband tuck, though there wasn\u2019t much to tuck at this point. I now was texted by her friend calling me an asshole and making a big deal out of nothing. I am starting to get second thoughts and thought I should\u2019ve went along\n\nTL;DR: girl wouldn\u2019t let me use my own condom, said i couldn\u2019t smash until I used hers\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author did something wrong by not using his girlfriend's condom. The situation is that they were about to have sex, he brought his own condom, but the girl insisted on using hers. He refused and left.\n\nFirst, I need to consider consent and autonomy. Both partners should have the right to agree on the terms of their sexual activity. The author was prepared with his own condom, which he was comfortable using. The girl insisted on using hers, which he didn't agree to, and she wouldn't proceed unless he used hers. That's a demand, not a negotiation. \n\nIn a healthy relationship, both partners should communicate their boundaries. The author's refusal to use her condom is about his own comfort and safety. Condoms are personal items, and using someone else's might not be safe if they're not in a monogamous or fully trusting relationship. Also, the girl mentioned wanting kids soon, which might imply she's not on birth control, so using a condom is important for her. However, the author's right to use his own condom is also valid. \n\nBut the key point is that the girl made it a deal-breaker. She said if he didn't use hers, he should leave. That's a form of pressure. The author chose to leave, which shows he respected her boundaries. But he's now doubting if he should have compromised. \n\nSo, who is wrong here? The author didn't do anything wrong by not using her condom. He had the right to use his own. The girl, on the other hand, was being controlling by making it a non-negotiable issue. However, the author could have communicated better. Maybe he could have asked why she needed to use hers or discussed their concerns. But he didn't force her to use his, he just left. \n\nThe text from her friend calling him an asshole is probably her friend's opinion, not the author's fault. The author's decision to leave was standing by his own boundary. Therefore, the author isn't in the wrong. Answer B.\n"
