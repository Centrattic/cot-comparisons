Of course I came prepared with a Trojan fresh out the box popped into my pocket. I get there and you know blah blah happens and eventually I pull the condom out before insertion. She says \u201cno no, there\u2019s no need, I have some\u201d but I say I already have it and start unwrapping it. Here\u2019s where she gets persistent. She hops up and says \u201cNo we\u2019re using mine,\u201d and says she won\u2019t let me until we use one she had. Now she had mentioned wanting kids soon, like in 2 months soon, but thought we\u2019d just maybe mess around for a week or two and that\u2019d be it. I thought nothing of it originally and honestly now I was scared. I said \u201cno, why\u2019re you so persistent.\u201d She then states that if I wasn\u2019t to use hers, I might as well leave. So I put on my clothes, did the ol\u2019 reliable waistband tuck, though there wasn\u2019t much to tuck at this point. I now was texted by her friend calling me an asshole and making a big deal out of nothing. I am starting to get second thoughts and thought I should\u2019ve went along\n\nTL;DR: girl wouldn\u2019t let me use my own condom, said i couldn\u2019t smash until I used hers\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the post is in the wrong. The situation is about a guy who went to his girlfriend's place intending to use his own condom, but she insisted on using hers. He ended up not using a condom and left because she refused to go along with his. Now he's worried he was wrong.\n\nFirst, I need to recall the basics of consent and safety in relationships. Condoms are a personal choice, and safety is important. But here, the key point is about whose condom is used. Generally, using a condom is a shared decision. If someone is pressuring the other to not use their own condom, that could be an issue. But the guy had his own, and the girl wanted to use hers. Maybe she has specific reasons, like trusting her own or maybe some health concerns.\n\nWait, the user mentioned that she mentioned wanting kids soon. That's a bit confusing. If she wants kids, maybe she doesn't want to use a condom, but she still wants him to use hers? Wait, no\u2014if she wants to get pregnant, using a condom would prevent that. So maybe she's being inconsistent. But maybe she's on birth control and still wants to use a condom for STI protection? Or maybe she's not on birth control and wants to use her own for some reason.\n\nBut the main issue here is consent and autonomy. The guy brought his own, but she refused to let him use it. He didn't use a condom at all because she wouldn't let him. That's a problem because he's not using protection, which could risk STIs if she's not testing. Also, if she wants to get pregnant, maybe she's okay with that, but if he's not on birth control, there's a risk of pregnancy.\n\nWait, the guy had his own, and she wanted to use hers. But he didn't use a condom at all. So he's not using protection. If she's okay with not using a condom because she wants to get pregnant, but he's not, then it's a mutual decision. But he was prepared with a condom, so he might be expecting her to use it for safety. If she refuses to let him use his own, but she's not using hers either, then he's not protected. That's risky for him. \n\nBut maybe she had her own reasons. Maybe she's on birth control and doesn't need a condom. If she's not on birth control, then using a condom is necessary. The guy might be in a right to want to use a condom, but she's pressuring him not to. However, the guy left because she wouldn't let him use his own. So he didn't use a condom at all. If he's not on PrEP or something, that's risky for him. So in that case, he might be in the right to protect himself. But he went in with his own, and she wanted hers. Maybe he should have used his own regardless, but she refused. But if she's pressuring him not to use any, then he's in a tough spot. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the guy is wrong because he didn't use any protection. If he was expecting to use his own but she refused, he should have respected her choice and maybe not proceeded. But he did proceed without using a condom. That's a risk for him. So maybe he's in the wrong for not using any protection. Or maybe she's in the wrong for pressuring him not to use his own. It's a bit tricky. \n\nIn terms of consent, both parties should agree on the method. If she's pressuring him to not use his own, but they're not using hers either, then he's not protected. So he's taking a risk. If he's not comfortable with that, then he should have refused. But in this case, he went along without protection. So maybe he's in the wrong for not standing his ground and using his own. Or maybe she's in the wrong for pressuring him. It's a bit of a gray area. \n\nI think the key point is whether he used protection. Since he didn't, and he was prepared but she refused, he's in the wrong for not using any. Because if he's expecting to use a condom, and she refuses but he still doesn't use one, he's putting himself at risk. So he should have either used his own despite her objection or not proceeded. But he proceeded without a condom, which is risky. Therefore, he's in the wrong.\n"
