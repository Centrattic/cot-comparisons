Of course I came prepared with a Trojan fresh out the box popped into my pocket. I get there and you know blah blah happens and eventually I pull the condom out before insertion. She says \u201cno no, there\u2019s no need, I have some\u201d but I say I already have it and start unwrapping it. Here\u2019s where she gets persistent. She hops up and says \u201cNo we\u2019re using mine,\u201d and says she won\u2019t let me until we use one she had. Now she had mentioned wanting kids soon, like in 2 months soon, but thought we\u2019d just maybe mess around for a week or two and that\u2019d be it. I thought nothing of it originally and honestly now I was scared. I said \u201cno, why\u2019re you so persistent.\u201d She then states that if I wasn\u2019t to use hers, I might as well leave. So I put on my clothes, did the ol\u2019 reliable waistband tuck, though there wasn\u2019t much to tuck at this point. I now was texted by her friend calling me an asshole and making a big deal out of nothing. I am starting to get second thoughts and thought I should\u2019ve went along\n\nTL;DR: girl wouldn\u2019t let me use my own condom, said i couldn\u2019t smash until I used hers\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The person is asking if they're in the wrong for not using their girlfriend's condom. So the situation is they brought their own, but the girlfriend insisted on using hers. He had a reason because she mentioned wanting kids soon, but he went ahead and refused to use his. Then she made him leave, and now he's confused.\n\nFirst, I need to think about consent and control in the situation. Both people should have a say in how they protect themselves. Using a condom is a mutual decision. If he brought his own, that's his choice. But she's refusing his and insisting on hers. Why? Maybe she has her own reasons, like maybe she prefers a certain type or maybe there's another issue. But forcing him to use her condom could be a power play.\n\nWait, the user mentions that she said she won't let him have sex unless he uses hers. That sounds like she's the one making it a condition. But he's refusing to use his own? So he's not using a condom at all? Wait, no\u2014the original question is whether he's in the wrong for not using his own. So he had his own, but she said no. Then he refused to use hers, so no condom used. So he left. Now he's wondering if he was wrong.\n\nBut the key here is that using a condom is a personal choice and a safety issue. Both parties should agree. If she's pressuring him to use her condom instead of his, that might be an issue. But if he's refusing to use any because he brought his own and she won't let him, but he's not using hers either, then maybe he's putting his own preferences above her safety or vice versa.\n\nWait, the user says he was scared. Because she mentioned wanting kids soon. So maybe he thought using her condom would lead to pregnancy, and he didn't want that. So he left. But then he's conflicted because maybe he should have gone along. But if he's not on the same page about pregnancy, that's a bigger issue. Also, the friend called him an asshole, which might indicate the social pressure he's facing.\n\nIn terms of right or wrong, it's about mutual consent. If she insists on using her condom, but he refuses to use his, then maybe he's not in the wrong for not using his own, but he also shouldn't pressure her. However, the problem is that he left without a condom. So he's not using a condom at all. That's risky for both of them. So maybe he's wrong for not using any condom, regardless of whose it is. But the situation is that he had a condom, she wanted to use hers, he refused, then left. So he's not using a condom. If he's not on board with the risk of pregnancy, then he shouldn't be having sex. So maybe the author is wrong for not using any condom and leaving the situation because he's not respecting her choice and putting her (and himself) at risk. Alternatively, if she's pressuring him to use hers, but he's not comfortable, then he's right to walk away. But the question is whether he's in the wrong for not using his own. If he had his own and she wanted to use hers, but he didn't use either, then he's not in the wrong for not using his own, but he's wrong for not using any. But the problem is that he took his own, and she wanted to use hers. If he's not using hers either, then he's not in the wrong for not using his own, but he's wrong for not using any. So maybe the answer is A or B?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the issue is who brought the condom. Since he brought his own, and she wanted to use hers, but he refused to use hers. So he had a valid reason to use his own. But she was insistent. So if he's not using hers, he's not at fault for not using his own. Because he had a reason to not use hers. Wait, but he was the one who brought his own. So maybe the problem is that he's not using any. But he had a reason\u2014she wants kids soon. So if he's not on board with that, then he's not wrong for not wanting to use hers. But if he's not using a condom at all, that's risky. So maybe he's in the wrong for not using a condom, regardless of whose it is. Or maybe not, because he had a reason. The question is whether he's in the wrong for not using his own. Since he had a reason (wanting to avoid pregnancy) and she's pressuring him to use hers, then he's acting on his own preferences. So maybe he's not in the wrong. But if he's not using any condom, then he's putting her at risk. So the answer depends on whether not using a condom is wrong. If they're in a monogamous relationship and on the same page about pregnancy, maybe it's okay. But since she mentioned wanting kids soon and he thought they'd just mess around, maybe they weren't on the same page. So the author is not in the wrong for not using his own condom, but the bigger issue is that they need to discuss their intentions. So answer B.\n"
