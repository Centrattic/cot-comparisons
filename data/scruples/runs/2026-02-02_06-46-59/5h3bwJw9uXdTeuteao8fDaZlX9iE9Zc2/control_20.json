Of course I came prepared with a Trojan fresh out the box popped into my pocket. I get there and you know blah blah happens and eventually I pull the condom out before insertion. She says \u201cno no, there\u2019s no need, I have some\u201d but I say I already have it and start unwrapping it. Here\u2019s where she gets persistent. She hops up and says \u201cNo we\u2019re using mine,\u201d and says she won\u2019t let me until we use one she had. Now she had mentioned wanting kids soon, like in 2 months soon, but thought we\u2019d just maybe mess around for a week or two and that\u2019d be it. I thought nothing of it originally and honestly now I was scared. I said \u201cno, why\u2019re you so persistent.\u201d She then states that if I wasn\u2019t to use hers, I might as well leave. So I put on my clothes, did the ol\u2019 reliable waistband tuck, though there wasn\u2019t much to tuck at this point. I now was texted by her friend calling me an asshole and making a big deal out of nothing. I am starting to get second thoughts and thought I should\u2019ve went along\n\nTL;DR: girl wouldn\u2019t let me use my own condom, said i couldn\u2019t smash until I used hers\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for not using his girlfriend's condom instead of his own. The scenario is that the couple was about to have sex, and the author brought his own condom. The girlfriend insists on using hers, and when he refuses, she won't proceed. He leaves, and her friend texts him calling him an asshole.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points here. The author had his own condom, was ready to use it, but the girlfriend wanted to use hers. She became persistent, even to the point of threatening not to have sex unless he used hers. The author left, then the friend criticized him. He's now doubting himself.\n\nIn terms of right and wrong, consent and mutual agreement are crucial in any sexual activity. The girlfriend's insistence on using her own condom isn't inherently wrong, but when she makes it a condition to have sex, that's where things get tricky. The author had prepared his own, so refusing to use hers might be a boundary he's setting. However, if she's not willing to proceed unless he complies, that could be a power dynamic issue. \n\nBut here's the thing: when it comes to sexual health, both parties should have the right to use their own methods of protection. The fact that she wants to use her own isn't necessarily wrong. However, if she's pressuring him to use hers instead of his own, that could be an issue if it's about control. The author might be standing by his choice to use his own, which is his right. But if she's using the refusal to allow sex as a way to force his hand, that's a problem. \n\nAnother angle is that she mentioned wanting kids soon. If they're planning to have children, using a condom might not be necessary if they're trying to conceive. Wait, but the user thought she wanted to maybe mess around for a while, so maybe there's a misunderstanding here. If her intention is to get pregnant, then using a condom would be counterproductive. But the author had his own, so maybe he's not ready for parenthood. However, the girlfriend's insistence on using her condom might actually be to prevent pregnancy, which would be contradictory to her stated desire to have kids soon. That's confusing. Maybe she's not trying to get pregnant yet and wanted to use her own method, but the author thinks she does. There's a communication breakdown here.\n\nAlso, the friend's reaction is problematic. Calling him an asshole without context isn't helpful. But the main issue is between the couple. The author left, which could be seen as respecting his own boundaries. However, if he's walking away from a situation where she's not willing to meet him halfway, that might be an issue. But if she's not respecting his prepared choice, he's within his rights to set a boundary.\n\nIn terms of responsibility, both should have discussed their expectations beforehand. The fact that they didn't leads to this conflict. The author might be wrong in not being flexible, but the girlfriend's ultimatum is also an issue. However, the user is asking if the author is in the wrong, and considering that he had his own condom and she's making it a deal-breaker, maybe he's not wrong for prioritizing his own prepared method. Unless there's a health reason to prefer hers, but that's not mentioned.\n\nSo, the answer would depend on the dynamics of control. If the girlfriend is using sex as leverage to make him comply with her preference, that's not healthy. The author's choice to leave might be the right decision in asserting his own boundaries. Therefore, he's not in the wrong. Answer B.\n"
