Of course I came prepared with a Trojan fresh out the box popped into my pocket. I get there and you know blah blah happens and eventually I pull the condom out before insertion. She says \u201cno no, there\u2019s no need, I have some\u201d but I say I already have it and start unwrapping it. Here\u2019s where she gets persistent. She hops up and says \u201cNo we\u2019re using mine,\u201d and says she won\u2019t let me until we use one she had. Now she had mentioned wanting kids soon, like in 2 months soon, but thought we\u2019d just maybe mess around for a week or two and that\u2019d be it. I thought nothing of it originally and honestly now I was scared. I said \u201cno, why\u2019re you so persistent.\u201d She then states that if I wasn\u2019t to use hers, I might as well leave. So I put on my clothes, did the ol\u2019 reliable waistband tuck, though there wasn\u2019t much to tuck at this point. I now was texted by her friend calling me an asshole and making a big deal out of nothing. I am starting to get second thoughts and thought I should\u2019ve went along\n\nTL;DR: girl wouldn\u2019t let me use my own condom, said i couldn\u2019t smash until I used hers\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The situation involves a disagreement over which condom to use. The author had brought his own, but the girlfriend insisted on using hers, even to the point of threatening to end the encounter. The author left, and now he's unsure if he was right.\n\nFirst, I need to consider consent and communication in relationships. Condom use is a personal choice and a health safety issue. The girlfriend wanted to use her own, maybe for reasons like brand preference, her own preparedness, or maybe even a way to control the situation. But when she said she wouldn't proceed unless he used hers, that's a form of pressure. The author had his own, which is responsible, but the girlfriend's insistence might be about her preferences. \n\nBut wait, the author was prepared. If she had mentioned earlier that she wanted to use her own, maybe there could have been a discussion. However, she didn't mention it until the moment. The author might have felt uncomfortable using hers without knowing why. Also, using a condom is a mutual decision. If she's pressuring him to use hers instead of his own, that could be a power dynamic issue. But on the flip side, if he was already ready to use his, why did she need to insist on hers? Maybe she wanted to ensure that the condom was hers, perhaps due to personal preference or maybe she had a reason to not trust his supply, but that's speculative.\n\nAnother angle: the girlfriend's friend called the author an asshole. That might indicate that the girlfriend's side is seen as more reasonable. But that's not necessarily an indicator. The author left because he wasn't willing to comply with her demand. Was that the right decision? If the girlfriend is pressuring him to use her condom, maybe she's trying to assert control, which isn't healthy. Alternatively, maybe the author should have respected her preference since she was clear. \n\nHealth and safety: Using a condom is important regardless. The fact that both had condoms shows both are responsible. The issue is about who supplies it. There's no right or wrong in who brings it, but in a situation where there's a mutual agreement. If the author was uncomfortable using her condom, maybe he should have discussed why. But in the moment, he left. \n\nThe key point here is coercion. If the girlfriend made him use hers against his will, that's a problem. But if she was just stating her preference and he had a valid reason to stick with his own, then maybe not. The author might be in the wrong if he refused without a good reason, but if the girlfriend was being controlling, then maybe she is. However, the author had his own condom, so he was prepared. The girlfriend's insistence might be overstepping. \n\nAlternatively, the author's choice to use his own condom is valid, and the girlfriend's refusal to proceed without using hers was an ultimatum, which isn't healthy. So the author left, which could be the right decision. Therefore, the author isn't in the wrong because he had his own condom and the girlfriend's pressure was inappropriate. So answer B.\n"
