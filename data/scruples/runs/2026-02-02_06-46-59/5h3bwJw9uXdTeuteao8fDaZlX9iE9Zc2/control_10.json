Of course I came prepared with a Trojan fresh out the box popped into my pocket. I get there and you know blah blah happens and eventually I pull the condom out before insertion. She says \u201cno no, there\u2019s no need, I have some\u201d but I say I already have it and start unwrapping it. Here\u2019s where she gets persistent. She hops up and says \u201cNo we\u2019re using mine,\u201d and says she won\u2019t let me until we use one she had. Now she had mentioned wanting kids soon, like in 2 months soon, but thought we\u2019d just maybe mess around for a week or two and that\u2019d be it. I thought nothing of it originally and honestly now I was scared. I said \u201cno, why\u2019re you so persistent.\u201d She then states that if I wasn\u2019t to use hers, I might as well leave. So I put on my clothes, did the ol\u2019 reliable waistband tuck, though there wasn\u2019t much to tuck at this point. I now was texted by her friend calling me an asshole and making a big deal out of nothing. I am starting to get second thoughts and thought I should\u2019ve went along\n\nTL;DR: girl wouldn\u2019t let me use my own condom, said i couldn\u2019t smash until I used hers\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the person who wrote this is in the wrong. Let's break down the situation.\n\nFirst, the guy went over to his girlfriend and brought his own condom. They were planning to have sex, and he was ready with his Trojan. But when he tried to use it, the girl refused and insisted they use hers. She even said she wouldn't let him proceed unless they used hers. He mentions she had mentioned wanting kids soon, but he thought they were just messing around for a while. He got scared and left. Then her friend texted him calling him an asshole for making a big deal out of nothing. Now he's second-guessing if he was wrong.\n\nSo the question is, is he in the wrong for not using her condom? Let's think about consent and communication. Both parties should agree on the terms of any sexual activity. Using a condom is a mutual decision. If the guy was okay with using his own, and the girl refused and insisted on hers, maybe there's an issue here. But why would she be so insistent? Maybe she had her own reasons, like maybe she had already used her condom or was checking for STIs, but he didn't know. However, if she insisted on using hers and he was uncomfortable with that, maybe he had a right to refuse. But then again, if the situation was about her wanting to use her own for pregnancy purposes, maybe he should have respected that. Wait, the user said she wanted kids soon, so maybe she wasn't using a condom for that reason. If he was concerned about pregnancy, maybe they should not have been using any condom. But he was bringing a condom, so maybe he didn't want to get her pregnant. That's a conflict. \n\nSo, the key points here are: mutual agreement on contraception, communication about intentions (pregnancy vs. STI prevention), and respecting each other's boundaries. If the girl was pushing for her own condom because she was trying to get pregnant, and he was using his because he didn't want to, there's a mismatch in their goals. If he was okay with using his own and she wanted to use hers, maybe she had a right to be insistent if that was her condition. However, if he was uncomfortable with not using his own, he had the right to leave. But forcing someone to use a specific condom could be a violation of consent. Wait, but consent is about mutual agreement. If she refused to proceed unless he used hers, and he didn't agree, then he wasn't obligated to comply. So maybe he wasn't in the wrong for leaving. However, if she was trying to have sex with the intention of not using a condom because she wanted to get pregnant, and he was using one to prevent pregnancy, then their intentions were conflicting. \n\nIn that case, it's a communication issue. They didn't discuss their expectations beforehand. The guy might have been wrong for not initiating that conversation earlier. But if she was insistent and he felt pressured, he had the right to say no. The friend calling him an asshole might be because she thought he was overreacting to using her condom. But if he was concerned about STIs and she wasn't using her own for that reason, maybe he was justified. \n\nSo, considering all this, the guy might not be in the wrong because he had a right to his own boundaries regarding contraception. However, if the situation was about her wanting to conceive and he was using a condom to prevent that, then there's a conflict in intentions that wasn't resolved beforehand. But since the question is about whether he's in the wrong, the answer depends on mutual consent. If he didn't agree to use hers and left, he's not in the wrong. But if she was trying to have unprotected sex and he was using a condom, maybe he was right to use it. But since he had his own, maybe the issue is about who's condom to use. In most cases, both parties should agree on the method. If she was insistent, but he didn't agree, he had the right to leave. So the answer might be B (No), he's not in the wrong. However, there's a part where if they were going to have sex with the intention of not using a condom (for pregnancy), then he was wrong for using his. But if they hadn't discussed it, then it's a communication problem on both sides. The guy might have been wrong for not discussing his reasons for bringing a condom. But given the scenario, since he left and she was insistent, maybe he's not wrong. So I think the answer is B.\n"
