Of course I came prepared with a Trojan fresh out the box popped into my pocket. I get there and you know blah blah happens and eventually I pull the condom out before insertion. She says \u201cno no, there\u2019s no need, I have some\u201d but I say I already have it and start unwrapping it. Here\u2019s where she gets persistent. She hops up and says \u201cNo we\u2019re using mine,\u201d and says she won\u2019t let me until we use one she had. Now she had mentioned wanting kids soon, like in 2 months soon, but thought we\u2019d just maybe mess around for a week or two and that\u2019d be it. I thought nothing of it originally and honestly now I was scared. I said \u201cno, why\u2019re you so persistent.\u201d She then states that if I wasn\u2019t to use hers, I might as well leave. So I put on my clothes, did the ol\u2019 reliable waistband tuck, though there wasn\u2019t much to tuck at this point. I now was texted by her friend calling me an asshole and making a big deal out of nothing. I am starting to get second thoughts and thought I should\u2019ve went along\n\nTL;DR: girl wouldn\u2019t let me use my own condom, said i couldn\u2019t smash until I used hers\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who posted the situation is in the wrong. The scenario involves a girlfriend insisting on using her own condom instead of the one he brought. He mentions that she had previously mentioned wanting kids soon, which might be a red flag. He was prepared with a condom, but she refused his and insisted on hers. He ended up leaving, and now he's feeling conflicted.\n\nFirst, I need to consider consent and safety. Using a condom is a mutual decision, and both partners should have a say. If she's pressuring him to use her condom, maybe she's not okay with him using protection. But wait, she's the one who brought up wanting kids, which complicates things. If she wants to conceive, maybe she's against using any condoms. However, if they aren't ready for children, not using protection could be risky. \n\nNow, the key issue here is whether the author is wrong for not using his own condom. He had a condom, but she refused it. If she's not comfortable with him using his own, maybe there's an underlying issue. For example, she might be using this as a way to control the situation or to push him into unprotected sex against his will. But then again, if she's insistent on her own method, maybe she has valid reasons, like preferring a specific type of condom or having her own supplies ready. \n\nHowever, the fact that she made him leave if he didn't use hers raises concerns. Consent should be mutual and not forced. If she's pressuring him to the point of ultimatums, that could be a form of coercion. The author might feel that he was right to leave because he didn't want to compromise his safety. On the other hand, if the relationship is built on trust, maybe he should have trusted her to provide a safe and effective condom. \n\nAnother angle is the health aspect. Condoms are meant to prevent STIs. If either partner has an STI, not using a condom is risky. The author might be protecting himself by bringing his own, but if the girlfriend is pressuring him to use hers, maybe she's not being honest about her health status. That could be a problem.\n\nAlso, the friend calling him an asshole suggests that maybe there's a social pressure or misunderstanding. The author might be overthinking, thinking he should have gone along, but his instinct to leave was a protective measure. \n\nSo, putting it all together, the author's main concern is about safety and consent. If the girlfriend is insistent on not using his condom and instead hers, perhaps because she wants to avoid pregnancy, but the author is okay with that, maybe they need to discuss their goals. However, if the author is uncomfortable with using her condom without knowing where it's from or if it's safe, he's in the right to prioritize his own health. \n\nBut if the girlfriend is pressuring him into a situation he's not comfortable with, that's a form of coercion, making her wrong. However, if the author is the one who's being inflexible and not open to compromise, then he might be in the wrong. The key here is whether he respected her wishes and vice versa. Since he left because she wouldn't let him use his own, maybe he's not in the wrong because he's asserting his need for protection. \n\nIn conclusion, the answer likely depends on the context. If the author is prioritizing his health and safety by bringing his own condom, and the girlfriend is pressuring him to use hers without valid reasons, he might be in the right. However, if they had prior agreements or if the girlfriend's insistence is based on trust and they both agree, then maybe the author is being too rigid. The situation is a bit ambiguous, but generally, using protection is advised, so the author's choice to leave might be justified. Therefore, the answer might be B (Not in the wrong).\n"
