Of course I came prepared with a Trojan fresh out the box popped into my pocket. I get there and you know blah blah happens and eventually I pull the condom out before insertion. She says \u201cno no, there\u2019s no need, I have some\u201d but I say I already have it and start unwrapping it. Here\u2019s where she gets persistent. She hops up and says \u201cNo we\u2019re using mine,\u201d and says she won\u2019t let me until we use one she had. Now she had mentioned wanting kids soon, like in 2 months soon, but thought we\u2019d just maybe mess around for a week or two and that\u2019d be it. I thought nothing of it originally and honestly now I was scared. I said \u201cno, why\u2019re you so persistent.\u201d She then states that if I wasn\u2019t to use hers, I might as well leave. So I put on my clothes, did the ol\u2019 reliable waistband tuck, though there wasn\u2019t much to tuck at this point. I now was texted by her friend calling me an asshole and making a big deal out of nothing. I am starting to get second thoughts and thought I should\u2019ve went along\n\nTL;DR: girl wouldn\u2019t let me use my own condom, said i couldn\u2019t smash until I used hers\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is about whether to use a specific person's condom or not. The user went over to his girlfriend, brought his own Trojan condoms, and when it came time to use one, she insisted on using hers. He tried to use his own, but she refused and said he had to use hers, or else leave. He left, but later felt unsure and is now asking if he was wrong.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the facts. The user had his own condoms, which he brought specifically for the occasion. The girlfriend mentioned wanting to have kids soon, which might relate to her not wanting to use a condom. But she then insisted on using hers, which the user didn't have. The user felt scared and left. Now, the question is whether he was wrong for not using her condom.\n\nPossible angles to consider: consent and safety. Using a condom is a mutual decision. If one party is uncomfortable with the other's condom, there's an issue. But the user had his own, and the girlfriend was insistent on using hers. However, the user's action here was to use his own, but she wouldn't allow it. Wait, no\u2014actually, he tried to use his own, but she refused and said no, they must use hers. So he was trying to use his own, but she wouldn't let him. So he left. But he's now second-guessing if he should have gone along with her condom instead.\n\nIn terms of responsibility for STI prevention and pregnancy, both partners should be on the same page. If the girlfriend wants to have a baby soon, maybe she's not using her condom correctly, or maybe she's not using any. But the user is concerned about protection. If she's insistent on using her own, but the user is uncomfortable with that, then he has the right to not proceed. Because consent is about mutual agreement. If he's using his own condom, and she's refusing to let him use it, that might be a red flag. Wait, no\u2014actually, the user had his own, but she wanted to use hers. So he was trying to use his own, but she wouldn't let him. So he left. But why would he leave? Because he was scared? Maybe because she was pressuring him to use her condom instead of his own. \n\nThe key point here is about autonomy and consent. The user has the right to choose what he uses for protection. If the partner is pressuring him to not use his own method of protection, that could be a problem. Because if he's okay with using a condom, but she's insisting on using hers, and he's okay with that, then it's fine. But if she's forcing him to use her method instead of his own, that might be an issue. Wait, but in this case, he had his own, but she refused. So he was trying to use his own, but she refused. So he left because she wouldn't let him use his own. But why would she want to use her own? Maybe she's not on birth control, or maybe she has an STI and doesn't want him to know. That's a possibility. So if the user is concerned about STIs, and she's pressuring him to use her condom, that could be a safety issue. \n\nIn terms of responsibility, the user had his own, which is good. If he's not comfortable using her condom, because he doesn't know her STI status or other factors, then he's not in the wrong for prioritizing his own safety. However, if the situation is that they both trust each other and she's on birth control, then maybe he's overstepping by not using hers. But the problem is, the user doesn't mention her being on birth control. She mentioned wanting kids soon, which might imply she's not using birth control, but that's an assumption. \n\nAnother angle: in a relationship, communication is key. The user should have discussed this beforehand. But in the scenario, he tried to use his own, and she refused. So he left. The friend calling him an asshole might be because she felt disrespected for not using her own. But if the user is using his own and she's not allowing that, it's about mutual respect. If she's insistent on using her own, maybe she's not being honest about STIs. \n\nIn conclusion, the user is in the right if he's not comfortable with using her condom without knowing her STI status or if there's a lack of trust. However, if they are in a monogamous, trusting relationship and she's using birth control, then maybe he's being overly cautious. But without that context, prioritizing safety by using his own is reasonable. So the answer would be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
