Of course I came prepared with a Trojan fresh out the box popped into my pocket. I get there and you know blah blah happens and eventually I pull the condom out before insertion. She says \u201cno no, there\u2019s no need, I have some\u201d but I say I already have it and start unwrapping it. Here\u2019s where she gets persistent. She hops up and says \u201cNo we\u2019re using mine,\u201d and says she won\u2019t let me until we use one she had. Now she had mentioned wanting kids soon, like in 2 months soon, but thought we\u2019d just maybe mess around for a week or two and that\u2019d be it. I thought nothing of it originally and honestly now I was scared. I said \u201cno, why\u2019re you so persistent.\u201d She then states that if I wasn\u2019t to use hers, I might as well leave. So I put on my clothes, did the ol\u2019 reliable waistband tuck, though there wasn\u2019t much to tuck at this point. I now was texted by her friend calling me an asshole and making a big deal out of nothing. I am starting to get second thoughts and thought I should\u2019ve went along\n\nTL;DR: girl wouldn\u2019t let me use my own condom, said i couldn\u2019t smash until I used hers\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the author of the story is in the wrong. The situation is about a guy who brought a condom, but his girlfriend wanted to use hers instead. He refused, she made him leave, and now her friend is upset.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points here. The author had his own condom, but the girlfriend insisted on using hers. He mentions that she had mentioned wanting kids soon but thought they'd just mess around for a week or two. He thought maybe she wanted to wait, but she was very firm. He ended up leaving, and now he's unsure if he was right.\n\nSo, the main question is whether he did something wrong by not using her condom. From a safety perspective, using any condom is better than none. But why did she want to use hers? Maybe she had her own reasons, like preferring a certain brand or type, or maybe she wanted to be in control. But if she's planning to have kids soon, maybe she's not on birth control and wants to avoid pregnancy. However, using a condom is a mutual decision. If she's pushing for her own, maybe there's an issue with trust or control here.\n\nThe author's argument is that he brought his own, was prepared, and she was being persistent. But the fact that she wouldn't let him proceed unless he used hers suggests she might have wanted to have sex without a condom but was trying to get him to use hers. Or maybe she had her own reasons for preferring her condoms. However, in relationships, it's important to discuss such matters beforehand. If the author was okay with using her condom, but she insisted on using hers, maybe there's a misunderstanding. But if he was uncomfortable with her condom for any reason (like not knowing if they were safe or expired), that's another issue.\n\nWait, the author didn't specify any issues with her condoms. He just mentions she insisted. So, maybe he's being too rigid. In some cases, insisting on using one's own condom can be a red flag, especially if it's a power play. But in other cases, people prefer to use their own for comfort or health reasons. However, the girlfriend's friend called him an asshole, which might indicate that the girlfriend's stance was more about her own control. \n\nAlso, considering that he had already brought his own, maybe he should have been more flexible. If she wants to use hers, it's better to comply unless there's a valid reason not to. But in this case, he didn't give in, and she made him leave. So, he might have overreacted by not using her condom, but if he was uncomfortable, he had the right to leave. However, if he was okay with using hers, he might have been in the wrong for not compromising.\n\nThe key factors here are communication and mutual consent. If they didn't discuss birth control or STI prevention beforehand, that's a problem. The author might have been wrong not to talk about it before the situation arose. By bringing his own condom, he showed he was responsible, but not using hers when she insisted could be seen as not respecting her boundaries. On the other hand, if he felt pressured into using her condom without proper discussion, he had the right to say no. \n\nIn terms of STI prevention, using any condom is good, but if he's not sure about her health status, using a condom is necessary. If they both trust each other, maybe they don't need it, but he might have his own reasons for using a condom. However, the girlfriend's insistence might have been about wanting to avoid pregnancy but not using a condom herself, which would be a different issue. \n\nSo, considering all this, the author might be in the wrong if he was being rigid without understanding her reasons. But if he had valid concerns about her condom, maybe not. Since the story doesn't mention any issues with her condoms (like expiration or safety), it's more about mutual respect. If he was okay with using a condom, using hers should have been fine. Therefore, the answer might be A (he's in the wrong) because he didn't respect her preference, but maybe B if he had good reasons. But given the lack of context about her health or his concerns, it's more about not compromising, so A.\n"
