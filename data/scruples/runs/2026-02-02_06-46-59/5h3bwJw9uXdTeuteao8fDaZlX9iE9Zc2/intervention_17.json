Of course I came prepared with a Trojan fresh out the box popped into my pocket. I get there and you know blah blah happens and eventually I pull the condom out before insertion. She says \u201cno no, there\u2019s no need, I have some\u201d but I say I already have it and start unwrapping it. Here\u2019s where she gets persistent. She hops up and says \u201cNo we\u2019re using mine,\u201d and says she won\u2019t let me until we use one she had. Now she had mentioned wanting kids soon, like in 2 months soon, but thought we\u2019d just maybe mess around for a week or two and that\u2019d be it. I thought nothing of it originally and honestly now I was scared. I said \u201cno, why\u2019re you so persistent.\u201d She then states that if I wasn\u2019t to use hers, I might as well leave. So I put on my clothes, did the ol\u2019 reliable waistband tuck, though there wasn\u2019t much to tuck at this point. I now was texted by her friend calling me an asshole and making a big deal out of nothing. I am starting to get second thoughts and thought I should\u2019ve went along\n\nTL;DR: girl wouldn\u2019t let me use my own condom, said i couldn\u2019t smash until I used hers\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The situation is about a guy who brought his own condom to a sexual encounter, but his girlfriend insisted on using hers. He thought she wanted to use her condom maybe for a different reason, like she might be planning to get pregnant soon, but he wasn't ready for that. He ended up leaving because she wouldn't let him use his own, and now he's questioning if he was wrong.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the basics of consent and sexual health. Using a condom is a personal choice and a safety measure. The key point here is that both partners should agree on the use of protection. If one partner is insistent on using their own condom, but the other is okay with that, then it's up to mutual agreement. However, there's also the aspect of control and possible manipulation. \n\nIn the story, the woman is being very forceful, saying she won't proceed unless he uses her condom. She even tells him to leave if he doesn't comply. This seems like a form of coercion because she's making the use of her condom a non-negotiable condition. The guy, on the other hand, had his own prepared and was willing to use it but was overruled. \n\nAnother angle is the mention of her wanting kids soon. If she's planning to get pregnant, using a condom would prevent that. So maybe she's trying to conceive earlier than he's comfortable with. However, the woman's insistence on using her own condom might be a way to control the situation. If she's not using her own, then the condom he brought would prevent pregnancy, but by using hers, perhaps she has control over whether to use it or not. That could be a manipulative tactic to pressure him into unprotected sex under the guise of using her condom.\n\nBut wait, if she's the one providing the condom, maybe she's testing his compliance or trying to see if he's willing to follow her lead. However, that's speculative. The main issue is the refusal to use his own prepared condom and the ultimatum. Consent requires that both parties are comfortable and not pressured. The fact that she threatened to end the encounter if he didn't use hers is a form of coercion. \n\nOn the other hand, the guy could have negotiated differently. Instead of leaving, maybe he could have tried to talk it out more, explain his concerns, or find a middle ground. However, given that she was insistent and even had a friend text him calling him an asshole, it shows that the pressure was coming from her side, possibly to make him feel guilty for not complying.\n\nSo considering all that, the author might not be in the wrong because he was using a condom, which is responsible, and he was willing to use it but was forced to back out. The woman's behavior seems more manipulative and controlling. But maybe there's a different perspective. Some might argue that he should have respected her choice, but if she's using it as a tactic to have unprotected sex, then he was right to hold his ground.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there's a misunderstanding. If she genuinely wanted to use her own condom for her own reasons, then he could have agreed. But the story suggests she wanted him to use hers specifically, possibly to have control. The fact that he left shows he wasn't willing to compromise on his own safety. So in terms of being in the wrong, it's more about who's being coercive. The woman's ultimatum and possible manipulation makes him not the one at fault.\n"
