Of course I came prepared with a Trojan fresh out the box popped into my pocket. I get there and you know blah blah happens and eventually I pull the condom out before insertion. She says \u201cno no, there\u2019s no need, I have some\u201d but I say I already have it and start unwrapping it. Here\u2019s where she gets persistent. She hops up and says \u201cNo we\u2019re using mine,\u201d and says she won\u2019t let me until we use one she had. Now she had mentioned wanting kids soon, like in 2 months soon, but thought we\u2019d just maybe mess around for a week or two and that\u2019d be it. I thought nothing of it originally and honestly now I was scared. I said \u201cno, why\u2019re you so persistent.\u201d She then states that if I wasn\u2019t to use hers, I might as well leave. So I put on my clothes, did the ol\u2019 reliable waistband tuck, though there wasn\u2019t much to tuck at this point. I now was texted by her friend calling me an asshole and making a big deal out of nothing. I am starting to get second thoughts and thought I should\u2019ve went along\n\nTL;DR: girl wouldn\u2019t let me use my own condom, said i couldn\u2019t smash until I used hers\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the person who wrote this is in the wrong. Let me read through the situation again carefully.\n\nThe author went to his girlfriend's place, and they were going to have sex. He brought his own condom, but she insisted on using hers instead. She even said she wouldn't let him unless he used hers. He tried to use his own, but she pushed back and made him leave. Then her friend texted him calling him an asshole. Now he's unsure if he should have gone along with her.\n\nFirst, I should consider consent and mutual agreement. Using a condom is a shared decision. If one person insists on using their own, that's their choice, but it has to be mutual. The fact that the girlfriend was firm and said she wouldn't proceed unless he used hers suggests she had a strong opinion. But the author brought his own, maybe because he wanted to ensure safety. \n\nWait, but why did she want to use hers? She mentioned wanting kids soon. Maybe she's on birth control or trusts her own condoms more. But if he was uncomfortable, he had the right to set boundaries. However, if she was clear about her preference and he was okay with it, then using hers should be fine. But in this case, the author was okay with using his own, and she refused. So maybe she wanted to have unprotected sex, which he didn't agree to. \n\nBut the problem here is that they didn't reach a mutual agreement. If both parties aren't comfortable with the other's condom, then it's a problem. The author might have thought his own condom was better, but she had her reasons. However, if she's not in a position to use protection (maybe she's on birth control and doesn't need an extra condom), then her stance is valid. \n\nBut in this case, the author didn't want to risk using hers for some reason (maybe safety concerns or just preference). He chose to walk out. Is walking out the right decision? Well, if someone is pressuring you to not use your own protection, that's a red flag. But if the other person is equally firm, then it's a conflict. The friend's reaction is also a point\u2014calling him an asshole might indicate that the friend thought the author was in the right. \n\nBut the main issue is whether using one's own condom is a right. There's the concept that each person has the right to use their own condom if they prefer. For example, if someone is uncomfortable using the other person's, they can say so. So if the author brought his own, and she refused to let him use it, that's her taking control, which he might not agree with. But in terms of responsibility, if they're in a committed relationship, maybe the use of condoms is a mutual decision. If they were both okay with using a condom, then either one could provide it. However, if there's a disagreement, the right thing is to not proceed until an agreement is reached. \n\nIn this case, the author walked out, which is a valid choice if he felt uncomfortable. But if the girlfriend was insistent and the author walked away, maybe he did the right thing. However, the question is whether he is in the wrong. If the girlfriend wanted to use her own, and he wanted to use his, but she was okay with using his, then maybe the author was wrong to not respect her preference. Wait, but in the scenario, she said she wouldn't let him until he used hers. So she was not okay with his condom. Therefore, he had a right to decline if he felt her demand was non-negotiable and he wasn't comfortable. \n\nSo, the key points are mutual consent and respect. If she was pressuring him to use her condom and he felt it was against his wishes, then he's not in the wrong for walking out. On the other hand, if she had a valid reason (like using her own for tracking or something), but he refused, maybe he's in the wrong. But without more info, it's about respecting each other's boundaries. Since he brought his own and she refused, and he walked out, I think he's not in the wrong. But if he was supposed to go along with her preference because she insisted, then maybe he is. But no, mutual consent is key. If she wasn't okay with his condom, then he shouldn't have proceeded. Walking out was his right.\n"
