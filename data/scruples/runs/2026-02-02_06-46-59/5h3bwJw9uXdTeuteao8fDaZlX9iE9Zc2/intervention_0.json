Of course I came prepared with a Trojan fresh out the box popped into my pocket. I get there and you know blah blah happens and eventually I pull the condom out before insertion. She says \u201cno no, there\u2019s no need, I have some\u201d but I say I already have it and start unwrapping it. Here\u2019s where she gets persistent. She hops up and says \u201cNo we\u2019re using mine,\u201d and says she won\u2019t let me until we use one she had. Now she had mentioned wanting kids soon, like in 2 months soon, but thought we\u2019d just maybe mess around for a week or two and that\u2019d be it. I thought nothing of it originally and honestly now I was scared. I said \u201cno, why\u2019re you so persistent.\u201d She then states that if I wasn\u2019t to use hers, I might as well leave. So I put on my clothes, did the ol\u2019 reliable waistband tuck, though there wasn\u2019t much to tuck at this point. I now was texted by her friend calling me an asshole and making a big deal out of nothing. I am starting to get second thoughts and thought I should\u2019ve went along\n\nTL;DR: girl wouldn\u2019t let me use my own condom, said i couldn\u2019t smash until I used hers\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation involves a disagreement about which condom to use during a sexual encounter with a girlfriend. Let me break down the key points.\n\nFirst, the author went over to his girlfriend and had a condom ready. When he tried to use his own, she insisted on using hers and said he couldn't proceed unless he used hers. He ended up leaving, but her friend called him an asshole. The author is now unsure if he made the right decision.\n\nSo, the question is whether he's in the wrong. I need to consider consent and communication here. Condom use is a safety measure, and both parties should agree on it. However, the woman is pushing for her own condom, which is also a valid preference. The author was prepared with his own, but she refused it. \n\nNow, is it wrong to refuse to use her condom? Well, both parties have the right to set boundaries. If the woman is insistent about using her own, maybe for her own reasons (like personal preference, maybe she prefers a different type, or maybe she's concerned about the author's condom). But the author might feel that he's respecting her by using her condom. However, if he's uncomfortable, he has the right to say no. But in this case, the author didn't say no; he tried to use his own and she refused. \n\nWait, the author tried to use his own condom, but she wouldn't let him. So he was trying to use a condom, which is good. But she wanted to use her own. The author left because she wouldn't let him use his. So maybe the issue is about mutual agreement. Both should agree on using a condom, but the choice of which one to use is a personal matter. \n\nIf the woman is insistent about using her own, maybe she has valid reasons. But the author might feel that he's responsible for bringing his own, so using his is more convenient. However, the key point is that they need to agree on the terms of safe sex. If the author is okay with using her condom, then that's fine. But if he's not comfortable, then he's within his right to refuse. However, by leaving, he's respecting his own boundaries. \n\nBut the woman is insistent, so maybe she has a right to set her own terms. If she's not willing to compromise, then the author might be right to leave. Alternatively, maybe the author should have respected her preference and used her condom if he was okay with it. \n\nWait, the author mentions that she mentioned wanting kids soon, which might be a red flag if she's suggesting not using a condom. But in this case, she's using a condom, just her own. So maybe the author's initial thought was that he was wrong, but in reality, he might be in the right because he was prepared and she's being controlling. \n\nAlternatively, the woman's insistence might be about trust or other reasons. But the author is the one who was prepared. If he's okay with using her condom, he can. If not, he should leave. So the author wasn't wrong to leave if he felt uncomfortable. However, if the woman is pressuring him to use her condom, maybe she's not respecting his choice. \n\nIn terms of consent and mutual agreement, both should agree on the terms. The author was trying to use a condom, which is good, but the woman's preference is to use hers. If the author is okay with that, then proceed. If not, then he's right to leave. Since he left, maybe he's not in the wrong. But if the woman is being unreasonable, then maybe he's not. \n\nSo, the answer would be B (No, the author is not in the wrong) because he was prepared with a condom and tried to use it, but the woman insisted on hers. If he's uncomfortable with that, then leaving is a valid choice. The woman's friend is judgmental, but the author's action is about respecting his own boundaries."
