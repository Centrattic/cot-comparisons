Of course I came prepared with a Trojan fresh out the box popped into my pocket. I get there and you know blah blah happens and eventually I pull the condom out before insertion. She says \u201cno no, there\u2019s no need, I have some\u201d but I say I already have it and start unwrapping it. Here\u2019s where she gets persistent. She hops up and says \u201cNo we\u2019re using mine,\u201d and says she won\u2019t let me until we use one she had. Now she had mentioned wanting kids soon, like in 2 months soon, but thought we\u2019d just maybe mess around for a week or two and that\u2019d be it. I thought nothing of it originally and honestly now I was scared. I said \u201cno, why\u2019re you so persistent.\u201d She then states that if I wasn\u2019t to use hers, I might as well leave. So I put on my clothes, did the ol\u2019 reliable waistband tuck, though there wasn\u2019t much to tuck at this point. I now was texted by her friend calling me an asshole and making a big deal out of nothing. I am starting to get second thoughts and thought I should\u2019ve went along\n\nTL;DR: girl wouldn\u2019t let me use my own condom, said i couldn\u2019t smash until I used hers\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The situation is about a guy who brought his own condom, but his girlfriend insisted on using hers, even to the point of making him leave if he didn't. He ended up not using any and now there's a friend calling him an asshole. He's wondering if he made a mistake.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The woman mentioned she wants kids soon, which might imply she's not on birth control or is trying to conceive. But the guy thought they would just mess around for a couple weeks and not have actual sex. However, when they did have sex, he had a condom ready. She wanted to use hers, but he didn't go along with it. He was scared and left. Now he's doubting his decision.\n\nIn terms of responsibility for STI prevention and pregnancy, using a condom is a shared responsibility. If she insists on using her own, maybe she feels more comfortable with that. But why wouldn't she let him use his? Maybe there's an issue with trust or maybe she's not using condoms for pregnancy prevention. If she's trying to get pregnant, she wouldn't need a condom for that, so maybe she's not using them for protection. But the guy might be concerned about STIs. If they're in a monogamous relationship and she's not on other birth control, maybe she's okay with pregnancy risk but not STIs. However, if she's not using her own condom properly, that could be a problem.\n\nThe guy's actions: he had his own, she wanted hers. He refused and left. Is that wrong? Well, consent and mutual agreement are important. If she made it a condition to use hers, and he's okay with that, then he should go along. But if he's uncomfortable with using hers (maybe expired? Or he doesn't trust her?), he should communicate that. However, the user didn't mention any issues with her condom\u2014just that she wanted to use hers. So if he's in a relationship and she's insistent, maybe he should respect her wishes, especially if she's more concerned about something else (like pregnancy timing). However, if he's not on any other form of birth control and they're not trying to conceive, then using a condom is necessary. The fact that she mentioned wanting kids soon but then wanted to have sex now without a condom is conflicting.\n\nAlso, the friend calling him an asshole might indicate social pressure. Maybe she's being controlling. The guy's fear might be valid if he's worried about STIs. If he's not in a monogamous relationship or unsure of her status, not using a condom is risky. But if they're both monogamous and trust each other, maybe the issue is different. \n\nIn terms of right or wrong, the guy might be in the right if he's prioritizing his health by not agreeing to use an unopened condom from her (maybe expired or not properly stored) without checking. But if she provided a new one and he just refused without reason, then he's being inconsiderate. However, the story says she \"had some\"\u2014so maybe she had her own. But he brought his own. She insisted on hers, and he didn't comply. If she's trying to get pregnant, using a condom would prevent that, so maybe she's being contradictory. If he's okay with not using a condom (assuming they're monogamous and not on birth control), but she wants to use her condom to prevent pregnancy, that's a conflict. But if she's the one who wants kids soon, why would she want to use a condom now? That's confusing.\n\nThe guy might have been wrong to not use her condom if they are in a committed relationship and she's the one who wants to use it. But if there's a misunderstanding about their plans (he thought they wouldn't have sex, but they did, and she wanted to use her own), maybe he's not at fault. It's a bit ambiguous. The key is mutual consent and communication. If he felt scared and left, maybe he was protecting himself, but if he's the one who agreed to have sex and then refused the condom despite her conditions, that's a problem. The answer would depend on the context of their relationship and their agreements. Since the user didn't provide all the details, but the woman was insistent and he left, maybe he's not in the wrong if he's prioritizing his own comfort and safety. But if they're in a situation where using her condom was necessary for her health or their plans, then he's at fault. The situation is complex, but without more info, it's hard to say. However, the general advice is that both partners should agree on contraception and STI prevention methods. If she insisted and he refused, it might be a problem unless there's a valid reason. So maybe the answer is A (he's in the wrong) because he disregarded her preference and the situation where she wanted to use her own.\n"
