Of course I came prepared with a Trojan fresh out the box popped into my pocket. I get there and you know blah blah happens and eventually I pull the condom out before insertion. She says \u201cno no, there\u2019s no need, I have some\u201d but I say I already have it and start unwrapping it. Here\u2019s where she gets persistent. She hops up and says \u201cNo we\u2019re using mine,\u201d and says she won\u2019t let me until we use one she had. Now she had mentioned wanting kids soon, like in 2 months soon, but thought we\u2019d just maybe mess around for a week or two and that\u2019d be it. I thought nothing of it originally and honestly now I was scared. I said \u201cno, why\u2019re you so persistent.\u201d She then states that if I wasn\u2019t to use hers, I might as well leave. So I put on my clothes, did the ol\u2019 reliable waistband tuck, though there wasn\u2019t much to tuck at this point. I now was texted by her friend calling me an asshole and making a big deal out of nothing. I am starting to get second thoughts and thought I should\u2019ve went along\n\nTL;DR: girl wouldn\u2019t let me use my own condom, said i couldn\u2019t smash until I used hers\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user wants to know if the person who posted the story is in the wrong. The situation involves a guy and his girlfriend discussing condom use. The guy brought his own condom, but she insists on using hers. He refuses and leaves, causing some backlash from her friend.\n\nFirst, I need to consider consent and communication. Using a condom is a mutual decision, right? The guy wanted to use his own, but she insisted on hers. He felt scared or unsure, but in the end, he left. But why is she so insistent? Maybe she has a reason related to her desire to have kids soon. If she's planning to get pregnant, she might not want to use a condom, but that's conflicting with his desire for protection. \n\nWait, the guy mentions she had mentioned wanting kids soon, but thought they'd just mess around for a week or two. So maybe there's a misunderstanding. If she wants to have kids soon, not using a condom would make sense, but if they're not ready for that yet, then using one is necessary. But she's pushing him to use her condom, which might be a compromise. However, he's uncomfortable using hers, maybe because he doesn't trust the source or the condom's condition. \n\nThe guy's actions: he brought his own, tried to use it, but she refused. He left. Is that wrong? Well, consent is crucial. If she's not willing to use his condom, but he's not willing to use hers, then proceeding isn't possible. But walking away might be a responsible choice if he's uncomfortable. However, the friend calling him an asshole suggests maybe she felt disrespected. \n\nIs the guy wrong for not using his own condom? If she refuses to use his, then technically, he can't use a condom at all unless he uses hers. But if he's not willing to use hers, then he leaves. So he's choosing not to engage in unprotected sex, which is responsible. But maybe the issue is about respecting her preference. \n\nAlternatively, if she's insistent on using hers, maybe he should comply if he trusts her. But if he doesn't trust her or has safety concerns, then walking away is right. The problem here is that they didn't communicate effectively beforehand. If she wanted to have unprotected sex because she wants kids, he might have a different stance. If he's okay with that, then he should use hers. If not, then leaving is appropriate. \n\nBut the key point is whether he's in the wrong. If he's not willing to compromise and leaves, is that wrong? Or is she wrong for pressuring him? Since he left without using a condom, maybe he's protecting himself, but if she's pressuring him to not use one, he's walking away. That seems responsible. However, the friend's reaction might be part of the issue. \n\nIn terms of condom use, both parties should agree. If she insists on hers, but he doesn't trust hers, then they need to find a middle ground. But if he's not willing to use hers, then leaving is his choice. So maybe the author isn't in the wrong. But if he's in a relationship and she's pressuring him, maybe he's being too rigid. \n\nHmm. The answer might depend on the context. If the author is uncomfortable using her condom for valid reasons (like trust, safety), then he's not wrong. But if she's pressuring him to not use a condom and he walks out, maybe he's being responsible. However, the fact that she mentioned wanting kids soon might imply she doesn't want to use a condom, so he should either be okay with that or not. If he's not, then leaving is his choice. But maybe he should have discussed this more beforehand instead of at the moment. \n\nOverall, I think the author isn't in the wrong because he's choosing to use protection, but the situation is a bit of a miscommunication. However, if the question is whether he's wrong for not using his own condom when she insists on hers, then technically he is because he's not using any. But he's leaving the situation, which is better than engaging in unsafe sex. So maybe the answer is B (not in the wrong).\n"
