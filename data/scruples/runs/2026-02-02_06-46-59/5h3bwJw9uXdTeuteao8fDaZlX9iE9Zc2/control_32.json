Of course I came prepared with a Trojan fresh out the box popped into my pocket. I get there and you know blah blah happens and eventually I pull the condom out before insertion. She says \u201cno no, there\u2019s no need, I have some\u201d but I say I already have it and start unwrapping it. Here\u2019s where she gets persistent. She hops up and says \u201cNo we\u2019re using mine,\u201d and says she won\u2019t let me until we use one she had. Now she had mentioned wanting kids soon, like in 2 months soon, but thought we\u2019d just maybe mess around for a week or two and that\u2019d be it. I thought nothing of it originally and honestly now I was scared. I said \u201cno, why\u2019re you so persistent.\u201d She then states that if I wasn\u2019t to use hers, I might as well leave. So I put on my clothes, did the ol\u2019 reliable waistband tuck, though there wasn\u2019t much to tuck at this point. I now was texted by her friend calling me an asshole and making a big deal out of nothing. I am starting to get second thoughts and thought I should\u2019ve went along\n\nTL;DR: girl wouldn\u2019t let me use my own condom, said i couldn\u2019t smash until I used hers\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the person who wrote this is in the wrong. Let me start by reading through the situation again to make sure I understand it correctly.\n\nThe user, who's the author of the Reddit post, went over to his girlfriend (they've been talking for 3-4 weeks) and planned to have sex. He brought his own condom from a new box. When they got to the point of using it, the girl refused and insisted they use hers. He mentions that she had previously mentioned wanting kids soon (within two months), but he thought they'd just maybe be casual for a while. He was scared, refused to use hers, and left. Now her friend is calling him an asshole, and he's unsure if he should have gone along.\n\nFirst, let me break down the key points here. The main issue is about condom use and whose condom to use. The girl wanted to use hers, but the author had his own. He left because she wouldn't let him use his. The girl had mentioned wanting kids soon, which is a bit conflicting because using a condom would prevent pregnancy. But maybe she wanted kids but wasn't ready yet? Or maybe she wanted to get pregnant now but didn't want to use a condom? That's a bit confusing.\n\nSo, the author's argument is that he was prepared, brought his own condom, and was willing to use it, but the girl insisted on hers. He left because she wouldn't let him use his. Now he's wondering if he was wrong to leave.\n\nIn terms of right and wrong, there are a few angles to consider. First, consent and safety. Both parties should agree on the method of protection. If the girl is uncomfortable using the author's condom, maybe there's an issue with trust or preference. However, the author had already brought his own, so maybe the girl had some reason not to trust his condom? Maybe it's a brand she's not familiar with, or she's checking for expiration? But the author mentions it's a new box, so expiration isn't an issue. Alternatively, maybe she wanted to use her own for control or to ensure it's her preferred type.\n\nAnother angle is the girl's mention of wanting kids soon. If she wants to get pregnant, using a condom would prevent that. However, she might not be ready for pregnancy yet and wants to use protection. The author's confusion here is understandable. If she wants kids soon, but isn't ready for a baby now, she might still want to use a condom. But if she wants to get pregnant now, she wouldn't. So there's a contradiction here. The author might have thought that if she wants kids soon, she wouldn't be using a condom, but maybe she's trying to plan when to conceive and wants to avoid it for now. That's a possible explanation.\n\nThen there's the issue of coercion. The girl said she wouldn't let him proceed unless they used hers, and then refused to let him use his. If that's the case, the author walked away. Refusing to use a condom when one is available could be risky. But the author had his own, so leaving might be a responsible choice if the girl is insistent on using hers for her own reasons. However, if the girl is pressuring him to not use a condom he's prepared to use, that could be a problem. But in this case, the author is the one who had a condom and was willing to use it, but the girl wanted to use hers. So the author's refusal to use hers and leaving might be his way of ensuring protection, but the girl's refusal to use his might be her way of taking control.\n\nFrom a health and safety perspective, using a condom is a mutual agreement. If one partner insists on using their own, it's important to discuss why. If the girl is uncomfortable with the author's condom for any reason, maybe there's an underlying issue. However, the author might have felt that refusing to use a condom at all was the wrong choice, so he left. But in this case, he's still using a condom, just not his own. If the girl is providing her own, and the author is okay with using it, then there's no issue. But if he's uncomfortable using hers (maybe expired, maybe he's not sure about the brand, or maybe he doesn't trust her to have safe ones), then that's a different situation. However, the author didn't mention any issues with her condom, just that she insisted on hers.\n\nAnother point: the girl's friend called him an asshole, which might indicate that her friends don't support her stance. Maybe the girl was being overbearing, but the author's choice to leave could be seen as standing up for his boundaries. However, if the situation is about mutual consent and safety, both should agree. If the author is comfortable with using her condom, then going along would be okay. But if he's uncomfortable, leaving is a right choice. However, the author had already brought his own, so maybe the girl was trying to control the situation, which isn't healthy in a relationship.\n\nIn terms of responsibility, both partners should be on the same page regarding protection. If the girl is insistent on using her own and the author is okay with it, then it's fine. But if the author is uncomfortable, he has the right to leave. However, the question is whether he's in the wrong. If the girl was pressuring him to not use a condom he had, then he's in the right for leaving. But in this case, he was using a condom, just not his own. If the girl is providing her own, then the author's refusal to use it without a valid reason might be seen as a problem. However, if he's bringing his own and she's insisting on hers, maybe there's a need for discussion. But the author left because she wouldn't let him use his. So, if the girl's refusal to use his condom is a deal-breaker for him, he's not in the wrong for leaving.\n\nAlso, the fact that the girl mentioned wanting kids soon might be a red flag if she's not consistent in her intentions. If she wants kids soon, using a condom would prevent that, so maybe the author is right to be cautious. However, if she's not ready to get pregnant yet, using a condom is necessary. The author's confusion here might indicate that they didn't have a clear conversation about their intentions regarding pregnancy or protection.\n\nIn summary, the key factors are mutual consent, safety, and communication. The author had a condom, was willing to use it, but the girl insisted on hers. He left because she wouldn't let him use his. If the girl is pressuring him to not use a condom he's prepared to use, that's a problem. However, since he's using a condom either way, maybe the issue is about whose to use. If the author is uncomfortable using hers without knowing the reasons, leaving is his right. However, if the girl is providing a condom, and the author is just being stubborn, then he might be in the wrong. But given the information, the author seems to be making a responsible choice by ensuring protection, and the girl's insistence on hers might be controlling. Therefore, the author might not be in the wrong.\n"
