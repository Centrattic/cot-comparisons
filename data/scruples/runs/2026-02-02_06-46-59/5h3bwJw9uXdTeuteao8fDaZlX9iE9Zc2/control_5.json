Of course I came prepared with a Trojan fresh out the box popped into my pocket. I get there and you know blah blah happens and eventually I pull the condom out before insertion. She says \u201cno no, there\u2019s no need, I have some\u201d but I say I already have it and start unwrapping it. Here\u2019s where she gets persistent. She hops up and says \u201cNo we\u2019re using mine,\u201d and says she won\u2019t let me until we use one she had. Now she had mentioned wanting kids soon, like in 2 months soon, but thought we\u2019d just maybe mess around for a week or two and that\u2019d be it. I thought nothing of it originally and honestly now I was scared. I said \u201cno, why\u2019re you so persistent.\u201d She then states that if I wasn\u2019t to use hers, I might as well leave. So I put on my clothes, did the ol\u2019 reliable waistband tuck, though there wasn\u2019t much to tuck at this point. I now was texted by her friend calling me an asshole and making a big deal out of nothing. I am starting to get second thoughts and thought I should\u2019ve went along\n\nTL;DR: girl wouldn\u2019t let me use my own condom, said i couldn\u2019t smash until I used hers\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to work through this step by step. The question is whether the person who wrote the story (the author) is in the wrong for not using the girlfriend's condom. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The author went over to a girl he's been talking to for a few weeks. They were about to have sex, and he brought his own condom. She initially said no, insisting they use hers. He tried to use his, but she got persistent and wouldn't allow it. She even mentioned wanting to have kids soon, but the author thought they'd just \"mess around for a week or two.\" The author then left because she wouldn't let him use his condom, and her friend called him an asshole.\n\nNow, the key points here are about consent and safe sex practices. Condom use is a mutual decision. If one partner is insistent about using their own, that's part of the negotiation. But there's also the aspect of STI protection and pregnancy prevention. The author mentions she wants kids soon, which might mean she's not on birth control or wants to try to conceive. However, if he's not ready for that, using a condom is a responsible choice. \n\nBut here, she's refusing to use his condom and forcing her own. The author left, which is his right. But maybe the issue is that he didn't communicate his reasons for bringing his own condom. If she wants to conceive, using a condom would prevent that. So if she wants kids soon, not using a condom is her choice. However, if she's not on birth control or if there's a risk of STIs, using a condom is important. \n\nWait, the author says she mentioned wanting kids soon, but thought they'd just mess around for a week or two. So maybe she's not sure about the timeline, and the author isn't ready for kids. So he wants protection. She's pushing to not use his condom, which would mean she's okay with not using protection to get pregnant. But if he's not on board with that, then he's not in the wrong for wanting to use a condom. \n\nBut the problem is that she was insistent. In that case, if she's not allowing him to use his own condom, maybe she's not respecting his boundaries. If he's uncomfortable with not using a condom, then he's right to not proceed. However, in the scenario, he left, which is a valid choice. But the fact that her friend called him an asshole might indicate that she's in the wrong for forcing the issue. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the author should have communicated better. Did he bring up the topic of STIs or pregnancy prevention? If he's not using a condom, maybe there's a risk he's not willing to take. If she's not on birth control, and he's not willing to take the risk of pregnancy, then using a condom is responsible. If she's pushing to not use it, maybe she's not being responsible. \n\nBut in the scenario, the author is the one who brought the condom, which shows he's trying to be responsible. She's overriding his decision. So perhaps he's in the right for not using her condom if he's not comfortable with the risk. However, if she's okay with the risk and he's not, then he's right to leave. \n\nWait, but the author says he thought she wanted to maybe mess around for a week or two before considering kids. So maybe he thought they had time to use protection, but she wanted to conceive now. If that's the case, then maybe she's not being honest. But the author left, which is a valid decision. \n\nSo, in terms of being in the wrong: if the author left because he wasn't comfortable not using a condom, he's not in the wrong. She might be in the wrong for pressuring him to not use protection. But maybe the author should have discussed this earlier. However, the situation is that she insisted, and he left. The friend calling him an asshole suggests that she's being unreasonable. \n\nTherefore, the author isn't in the wrong. He's standing by his own safety and boundaries. So the answer would be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
