Of course I came prepared with a Trojan fresh out the box popped into my pocket. I get there and you know blah blah happens and eventually I pull the condom out before insertion. She says \u201cno no, there\u2019s no need, I have some\u201d but I say I already have it and start unwrapping it. Here\u2019s where she gets persistent. She hops up and says \u201cNo we\u2019re using mine,\u201d and says she won\u2019t let me until we use one she had. Now she had mentioned wanting kids soon, like in 2 months soon, but thought we\u2019d just maybe mess around for a week or two and that\u2019d be it. I thought nothing of it originally and honestly now I was scared. I said \u201cno, why\u2019re you so persistent.\u201d She then states that if I wasn\u2019t to use hers, I might as well leave. So I put on my clothes, did the ol\u2019 reliable waistband tuck, though there wasn\u2019t much to tuck at this point. I now was texted by her friend calling me an asshole and making a big deal out of nothing. I am starting to get second thoughts and thought I should\u2019ve went along\n\nTL;DR: girl wouldn\u2019t let me use my own condom, said i couldn\u2019t smash until I used hers\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong in this situation. Let me start by reading through the scenario again to make sure I understand it.\n\nThe author went over to his girlfriend (though they've only been talking for 3-4 weeks, so maybe they are not officially a couple yet) and they were about to have sex. He brought his own condom, but she insisted on using hers. She even got angry and said he couldn't have sex with her unless he used her condom. He refused, left, and now her friend is calling him an asshole. He's unsure if he was wrong to not use her condom.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points here. Condom use is a personal and medical decision between partners. The author had his own, but the woman preferred hers. She might have a reason for that\u2014maybe she has a specific type she's comfortable with, or maybe there's an issue with his condom. However, the bigger issue here is about consent and personal boundaries.\n\nWhen it comes to sexual health, using a condom is a form of consent and responsibility. If one partner is refusing to use a condom, that's a red flag. Wait, but in this case, the author was ready to use a condom, and the woman didn't want to. Wait, no, actually, the woman was insistent that they use hers. Wait, he was going to use his own, but she didn't want that. So he was in favor of using a condom, but she wanted to use hers. But why would she be so insistent on using hers? Maybe she had her own reasons. But the key here is that the author is not comfortable using her condom, perhaps because he's unsure of her reasons or doesn't trust her. \n\nWait, the user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not using his girlfriend's condom. The author had his own, but she wanted to use hers. He refused, left, and now is questioning if he should have gone along with her.\n\nIn terms of consent, both partners should agree on the terms of sexual activity, including the use of protection. If one partner is pressuring the other to not use a condom, that's a problem. But in this case, the author was in favor of using a condom, and the woman was against using his, but wanted to use hers. Maybe the author felt that using his own condom was his responsibility, and she was trying to take that away. Or perhaps she had a different reason, like STI concerns.\n\nWait, the woman mentioned wanting kids soon but thought they would just mess around for a week or two. Maybe she wanted to use her own condom for pregnancy prevention, but the author was okay with using his. However, if she's trying to get pregnant, maybe she's not using a condom at all. But she said she had some. Maybe she had different types? But the author is concerned about using her condom, perhaps because of trust issues or not knowing if it's safe. \n\nIn terms of right and wrong, the author's actions are about respecting his own boundaries. If he felt uncomfortable using her condom, he had the right to say no. However, if the woman was insistent and they are in a relationship where she's pressuring him to not use a condom, that could be a problem. But the question is whether the author is in the wrong for not using her condom. \n\nFrom a health and safety perspective, using a condom is a personal choice. If the woman is pressuring him to not use his own, that's a red flag. However, the author had his own, so using his own is a safer choice. The woman's insistence might indicate a lack of respect for his boundaries. \n\nOn the other hand, if the woman has her reasons (like maybe she has a medical device she needs to use, or she's on a specific method of protection), but in this case, she's the one who is against his condom. So if the author is uncomfortable with her condom, then he has the right to refuse. However, the problem arises if he's pressuring her to not use a condom, but in this case, he was the one who was trying to use a condom. \n\nSo, the author's decision to leave when she was pressuring him to not use his own condom might be the right choice. Because in a consensual relationship, both parties should agree on the terms of protection. If she's refusing to use a condom that he's prepared, and is pressuring him to not use it, that's a problem. Therefore, the author is not in the wrong for not using her condom and leaving.\n"
