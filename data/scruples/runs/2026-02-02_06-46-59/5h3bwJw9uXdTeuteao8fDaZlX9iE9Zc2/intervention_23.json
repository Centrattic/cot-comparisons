Of course I came prepared with a Trojan fresh out the box popped into my pocket. I get there and you know blah blah happens and eventually I pull the condom out before insertion. She says \u201cno no, there\u2019s no need, I have some\u201d but I say I already have it and start unwrapping it. Here\u2019s where she gets persistent. She hops up and says \u201cNo we\u2019re using mine,\u201d and says she won\u2019t let me until we use one she had. Now she had mentioned wanting kids soon, like in 2 months soon, but thought we\u2019d just maybe mess around for a week or two and that\u2019d be it. I thought nothing of it originally and honestly now I was scared. I said \u201cno, why\u2019re you so persistent.\u201d She then states that if I wasn\u2019t to use hers, I might as well leave. So I put on my clothes, did the ol\u2019 reliable waistband tuck, though there wasn\u2019t much to tuck at this point. I now was texted by her friend calling me an asshole and making a big deal out of nothing. I am starting to get second thoughts and thought I should\u2019ve went along\n\nTL;DR: girl wouldn\u2019t let me use my own condom, said i couldn\u2019t smash until I used hers\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that the guy brought his own condom, but the girlfriend insisted they use hers instead. He thought she wanted to have kids soon, so maybe using her condoms (which could be non-lubricated or maybe with spermicide?) might be part of a plan to get pregnant. But he went ahead and used his own, and she got upset, even making her friend call him an asshole.\n\nHmm. The guy says he was scared and left. But the problem is about using his own condom versus hers. If she specifically wanted to use hers for fertility reasons, then him using his own might prevent that. The question is about consent and respecting boundaries. Wait, condoms are about safe sex, so if she's the one who is okay with not using a condom because she wants to get pregnant, but he's the one who insists on using his own, maybe he's overriding her decision. But wait, the user says the girl wouldn't let him use his own and made him use hers. Wait, no, the situation is that he tried to use his, but she refused and said they had to use hers. Then he left. But the friend called him an asshole. So the guy is now questioning if he was wrong to not comply.\n\nWait, the key here is about consent and mutual agreement. Condom use is a mutual decision in a relationship. If one partner insists on using a condom and the other refuses, that's a problem. But in this case, the guy had his own, and the girl wanted to use hers. If the girl's reason is related to fertility, maybe she's trying to get pregnant and doesn't want the barrier. But the guy had his own, and she was insistent. Wait, but the guy is the one who went along with her choice but then later took off the condom? Wait no, the story says he tried to use his own, she refused and said to use hers. He then said he already had one, but she wouldn't let him and made him use hers. Wait, no, the guy says he pulled out his own condom, and she said \"no no, there's no need, I have some\". Then he says he already has it and starts unwrapping. She then gets persistent and says they're using hers. So it seems like she was trying to use her own, maybe because she's on birth control and doesn't need his? Or maybe she's trying to get pregnant, which would mean not using a condom. If that's the case, then using a condom would prevent pregnancy. But if she wants to get pregnant soon, then he using his own is against her wishes. But why would she have her own condoms then? Maybe she's confused or there's a misunderstanding. Alternatively, maybe she's using her own for some other reason.\n\nBut the main issue here is about consent and respecting each other's wishes. If she insists on using her own condom, and he refuses, but she says not to use his, that's a conflict. However, in this scenario, the guy actually was willing to use his own, but she refused and he ended up using hers. Wait, no. Wait the story says that he tried to use his own, but she wouldn't let him and insisted on using hers. Then he left. Wait, but the guy says he \"put on my clothes, did the ol\u2019 reliable waistband tuck,\" implying that he left without using a condom. Wait, that's confusing. Because he had his own condom, tried to use it, but she refused and said to use hers. But then he left, so maybe he didn't have sex? Or did he end up using hers? The story is a bit unclear. But the key point is that he brought his own, tried to use it, she refused, and he left. The friend called him an asshole for not using his own. The guy is now wondering if he was wrong to not comply with her request to use hers.\n\nWait, maybe the confusion is about whether using the condom is necessary. If the girl is okay with not using a condom (because she's on birth control, or wants to get pregnant), then the guy using his own is overriding her decision. But if she's not on birth control and is using condoms for protection, then using her own is fine. However, if she wants to get pregnant, she might not want the condom. So if she's insistent on using hers, perhaps she's trying to get pregnant, and he using his own is against her plan. But in this case, he didn't use his own; she made him use hers. Wait, the guy says he tried to use his own but she made him use hers. So he ended up using her condom. But then why is the friend calling him an asshole? Maybe because he didn't use a condom at all? Wait, no, he used hers. Hmm, maybe there's a misunderstanding here. If she's using her own condom, then they're still using a condom, so why is there a problem? Unless the friend thought he didn't use a condom and that's why she's upset. Or maybe the friend is just being rude.\n\nBut the main question is about whether the author was in the wrong. If the girl wanted to use her own condom, and he complied, then he's respecting her choice. But maybe she wanted to not use a condom, and he was trying to use his own, but she said to use hers. Wait, that's confusing. If she's trying to get pregnant, she wouldn't want a condom. So maybe she actually didn't want a condom at all. But she told him to use hers. So perhaps there's a miscommunication. If he had his own, but she wanted to use hers, maybe she still wanted to use a condom, but preferred hers. But then, why would she get upset if he used his own? Unless there's another reason, like she's on birth control and doesn't need a condom, but he's using his own for STI prevention. In that case, she might not need a condom, but he does. Then, using her own (which may not be necessary) might be okay. But if he's the one who wants to use a condom for STI reasons, and she's on birth control and doesn't need it, then she might not want to use one. But he's using his own, which she didn't want. So maybe he's overriding her decision. But in the story, he tried to use his, she refused and insisted on using hers. So he ended up using hers. So he did use a condom, just not his own. But then why is the friend upset? Unless the friend misunderstood that he didn't use any. Maybe the friend didn't know the situation and just assumed he didn't use a condom. But the author is now wondering if he was wrong to not use his own. If the guy used her condom, then he's still using a condom, which is good. But why is there a problem? Unless the girl wanted to not use a condom at all. If that's the case, then he using a condom (hers) would be against her wishes. But the story says she wanted to use hers, which would imply she's okay with using a condom but prefers hers. So the guy used hers, which should be okay. But maybe there's confusion here. The author might be in the wrong if he thought she wanted to use a condom but she actually wanted to not use one. But according to his account, she insisted on using hers, so he did. The problem arises if she had a different intention. But based on the information given, the guy acted according to her request, using her condom. Therefore, he's not in the wrong. However, if the friend misunderstood and called him an asshole for not using his own, that's a separate issue. The main point is whether the guy respected her wishes. Since he did use her condom as she wanted, he's not in the wrong. So the answer would be B (No, not in the wrong).\n"
