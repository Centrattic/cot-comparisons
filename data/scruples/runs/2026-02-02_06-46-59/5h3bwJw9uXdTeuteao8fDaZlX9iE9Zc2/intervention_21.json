Of course I came prepared with a Trojan fresh out the box popped into my pocket. I get there and you know blah blah happens and eventually I pull the condom out before insertion. She says \u201cno no, there\u2019s no need, I have some\u201d but I say I already have it and start unwrapping it. Here\u2019s where she gets persistent. She hops up and says \u201cNo we\u2019re using mine,\u201d and says she won\u2019t let me until we use one she had. Now she had mentioned wanting kids soon, like in 2 months soon, but thought we\u2019d just maybe mess around for a week or two and that\u2019d be it. I thought nothing of it originally and honestly now I was scared. I said \u201cno, why\u2019re you so persistent.\u201d She then states that if I wasn\u2019t to use hers, I might as well leave. So I put on my clothes, did the ol\u2019 reliable waistband tuck, though there wasn\u2019t much to tuck at this point. I now was texted by her friend calling me an asshole and making a big deal out of nothing. I am starting to get second thoughts and thought I should\u2019ve went along\n\nTL;DR: girl wouldn\u2019t let me use my own condom, said i couldn\u2019t smash until I used hers\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the person in the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is that the author went to his girlfriend's place and wanted to use his own condom, but she insisted on using hers. He thought she might want to get pregnant soon, but instead, she was very persistent, even threatening to make him leave if he didn't use hers. He ended up not using a condom and left, but her friend messaged him calling him an asshole. Now he's unsure if he should have complied.\n\nSo, the main points here are consent and the use of condoms. The author came prepared with a condom, which shows he was considering protection. However, the girlfriend didn't want him to use it, possibly because she didn't want to use her own or had a different plan. But why would she push him to use hers? Maybe she wants pregnancy, but that's a big step. Alternatively, she might feel that using her own is a personal choice or part of her control over the situation. \n\nBut the key issue is that the author is a man, and the condom is on him. If she's not on birth control, using her condom would be important for her to protect against pregnancy. If she's on birth control, maybe she's not worried about pregnancy and just wants to have sex without a condom. However, the author is using a condom as a precaution, which is responsible. \n\nWait, the user's original thought is that the author is in the wrong. That might be because the girlfriend was insistent, and he left instead of complying. But in reality, the author had the right to use a condom. The girlfriend can't force him to not use one he brought. If she's not comfortable with him using his own, maybe they should have discussed it before. \n\nThe post mentions that the girlfriend said she had some, but he had already brought one. She then got persistent and made him leave. If she's not on birth control and wants to avoid pregnancy, using her own would be necessary. But if the author wanted to use his own, and she was unwilling to do that, the situation becomes a conflict over mutual agreement on protection. \n\nIn relationships, both partners should agree on the use of protection. If he's uncomfortable not using a condom, it's his right to do so. However, if the girlfriend is asserting her own choice, maybe she wants to take the risk. But the problem arises when she's coercing him into not using his own. \n\nThe author's decision to leave might be seen as standing up for his own boundaries, which is not wrong. However, if the girlfriend is on birth control and he's not on any, then maybe there's a misunderstanding. The post doesn't specify if she's on birth control, so we might have to assume. \n\nThe friend calling him an asshole could be due to seeing it as disrespectful that he didn't comply with her wishes. But if he was bringing up protection and she was trying to override that, who's at fault? It's a bit of a gray area. From a health and safety perspective, using a condom is important. If the author was the one who wanted to use it, and the girlfriend was against it, maybe the issue is about her not respecting his choice to be safe. \n\nAlternatively, if the girlfriend is using the condoms to prevent pregnancy and he's not using hers, then he's not respecting her method. However, since he had his own, and she insisted on hers, maybe he's the one who should have been more flexible. \n\nI think the main point is that both partners should have a mutual agreement. If she's not using her own method (like birth control) and is relying on condoms, but the author is the one who should use them, then he's in the right. But if she's on birth control and he's not, then maybe the condom is unnecessary. The post doesn't say if she's on the pill or not. \n\nIn any case, the author chose not to use his condom because of her insistence. That could be seen as not respecting her boundaries if she was uncomfortable with him using his own. Wait, but why would she be uncomfortable? Maybe she felt he was being controlling or didn't trust her. Or perhaps she wanted to use her own for some reason. \n\nCondom use is a personal decision, and if one partner is uncomfortable with the other's use of a condom, that's a communication issue. The author could have discussed with her why he wanted to use his own, maybe she was okay with it. But in this case, he was just using his own, and she didn't want him to. \n\nThe friend's reaction is also a factor. The friend's message might indicate that the girlfriend was being unreasonable. If the author left because he wasn't willing to compromise, maybe that's not his fault. However, if she wanted to use her own method and he's not respecting that, then he's in the wrong. \n\nBut the post says she mentioned wanting kids soon. If she's trying to conceive, then using a condom would be counterproductive, so she might be on birth control. Wait, if she's trying to get pregnant in two months, then she's not on birth control. So using a condom would prevent pregnancy. But she wanted to use her own, maybe for a different reason, like testing it or just preferring it. But the author had his own, so maybe she didn't want to use protection at all. \n\nIn that case, the author is right to use a condom if they aren't on the same page about pregnancy. However, she might be in a hurry to get pregnant and didn't want to use a condom. So the conflict is between his desire for protection and her wanting to conceive. The author's choice to leave because of the disagreement might be his right, but the girlfriend's insistent behavior could be seen as pressuring him, which is not okay. \n\nAlternatively, if she's not on birth control and wants to avoid pregnancy, using her own condom is necessary. If he's not using it, then he's putting her at risk. But the post says he was going to use his own. So if he didn't use hers, he was using his own. Wait, the story is a bit confusing. The author had a condom in his pocket, and she said they should use hers. He was going to use his, but she insisted on hers. But he didn't use any, so that's where the confusion is. \n\nWait, the original post says he pulled out the condom, she said \"no no, there\u2019s no need, I have some\" but he said he already had it and started unwrapping. Then she got persistent and said to leave. So he didn't actually use the condom. He had one but didn't use it. So the problem is that he was ready to use a condom, but she wouldn't let him. He was trying to be responsible, but she forced him to not use it. \n\nIn that case, the author is in the right because he was trying to use protection, and she was pressuring him not to. But the girlfriend's insistence might be because she's on birth control, or maybe she was trying to conceive. If she's on birth control, maybe the condom is unnecessary. But if he's not using any protection, that's a risk for her. However, he was bringing up the need for a condom, and she was overriding that. \n\nWait, but the author is a guy, so the responsibility for using the condom is on him. If the girlfriend is on birth control, then maybe the condom isn't necessary. But the author thought she wanted to get pregnant, so maybe she's not on birth control. So if she's not on birth control and he's not using a condom, then he's not respecting her wishes to avoid pregnancy. But in this case, she wanted to use her own condom, so maybe she is on birth control. \n\nThis is a bit of a mess. The main ethical points are about consent and health. If the author was insistent on using his own, but the girlfriend wanted to use hers, and he ended up not using any, then he's in the wrong if he was supposed to use a condom for her protection. Alternatively, if she was pressuring him to not use a condom, then she's in the wrong. \n\nBut the story is that he was going to use his own, she said she has hers, but when he went to use his, she got persistent and made him leave. So he didn't use any. That's risky for her if she's not on birth control. If he's the one who wanted to use a condom, but she wouldn't let him, and he complied, then he might be in the wrong for not using protection. However, if she was pressuring him, but he left instead of not using it, maybe he's not wrong. \n\nBut according to the story, he had the condom, started unwrapping, and she told him not to. He then left. So he didn't use his own, and she didn't use hers. So no protection. If he had the option to use his own, but she prevented him, then he's at fault for not standing up for his choice. Alternatively, if she was pressuring him, and he chose to leave to not compromise his safety, maybe he's not at fault. \n\nThe friend's reaction suggests that the girlfriend's side is being supported. But without more context, it's hard. However, in general, both partners should agree on the use of protection. The author was right to want to use a condom, but if he left without using one, that's a problem. The girlfriend's insistence might be due to her own reasons, but if he's the one who brought it up, and she's trying to override, then he's in the right to not proceed without protection. \n\nSo maybe the answer is that the author is not in the wrong because he was trying to use a condom, which is responsible, and she was pressuring him not to. He chose to leave rather than not use it, which shows he respects his own boundaries. Therefore, answer B: No.\n"
