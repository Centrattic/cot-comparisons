Of course I came prepared with a Trojan fresh out the box popped into my pocket. I get there and you know blah blah happens and eventually I pull the condom out before insertion. She says \u201cno no, there\u2019s no need, I have some\u201d but I say I already have it and start unwrapping it. Here\u2019s where she gets persistent. She hops up and says \u201cNo we\u2019re using mine,\u201d and says she won\u2019t let me until we use one she had. Now she had mentioned wanting kids soon, like in 2 months soon, but thought we\u2019d just maybe mess around for a week or two and that\u2019d be it. I thought nothing of it originally and honestly now I was scared. I said \u201cno, why\u2019re you so persistent.\u201d She then states that if I wasn\u2019t to use hers, I might as well leave. So I put on my clothes, did the ol\u2019 reliable waistband tuck, though there wasn\u2019t much to tuck at this point. I now was texted by her friend calling me an asshole and making a big deal out of nothing. I am starting to get second thoughts and thought I should\u2019ve went along\n\nTL;DR: girl wouldn\u2019t let me use my own condom, said i couldn\u2019t smash until I used hers\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the given situation is in the wrong. The scenario involves a couple using a condom, but there's a dispute over whose condom to use. The author had their own, but the girlfriend insisted on using hers, even to the point of not allowing the author to proceed if he didn't use hers. The author left and is now questioning their decision.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The girlfriend wanted to use her own condom, possibly due to personal reasons. Maybe she prefers her brand, has specific instructions, or there's an issue with the author's condom. The author, on the other hand, had already brought his own. But the girlfriend was firm, even threatening to end the encounter if he didn't comply.\n\nIn terms of consent and boundaries, it's important to respect a partner's wishes. If the partner is clear and insistent about using her own condom, the author should have complied. The fact that the girlfriend mentioned wanting kids soon might be relevant. Maybe she's on birth control but prefers condoms, or she has a specific method. However, the author's main point is that they were uncomfortable using her condom and felt pressured to leave.\n\nBut wait, the author was the one who brought his own condom. If the partner is insistent, perhaps there's a reason. For example, maybe her condom is more effective, or she has a specific way she wants to use it. The author might have overruled her preference. In that case, the author might be in the wrong for not respecting her choice.\n\nHowever, the author was also in a position where he felt pressured. But generally, in relationships, respecting each other's boundaries is key. If she's not willing to proceed without her condom, then the author should have honored that to maintain trust and safety. The friend calling him an asshole might indicate that the girlfriend's side is seen as more justified.\n\nSo, considering the situation, the author didn't respect her boundary, hence he's in the wrong. So the answer is A.\n"
