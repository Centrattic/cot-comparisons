Of course I came prepared with a Trojan fresh out the box popped into my pocket. I get there and you know blah blah happens and eventually I pull the condom out before insertion. She says \u201cno no, there\u2019s no need, I have some\u201d but I say I already have it and start unwrapping it. Here\u2019s where she gets persistent. She hops up and says \u201cNo we\u2019re using mine,\u201d and says she won\u2019t let me until we use one she had. Now she had mentioned wanting kids soon, like in 2 months soon, but thought we\u2019d just maybe mess around for a week or two and that\u2019d be it. I thought nothing of it originally and honestly now I was scared. I said \u201cno, why\u2019re you so persistent.\u201d She then states that if I wasn\u2019t to use hers, I might as well leave. So I put on my clothes, did the ol\u2019 reliable waistband tuck, though there wasn\u2019t much to tuck at this point. I now was texted by her friend calling me an asshole and making a big deal out of nothing. I am starting to get second thoughts and thought I should\u2019ve went along\n\nTL;DR: girl wouldn\u2019t let me use my own condom, said i couldn\u2019t smash until I used hers\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the \"AITA\" post is in the wrong. The situation is about not using their own condom and the girlfriend insisting on using hers.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points here. The man brought his own condom, but the woman refused and insisted on using hers. He was okay with using a condom, but she wouldn't let him use his. Then she said she wouldn't proceed unless they used hers. He left, and her friend called him an asshole. He's now wondering if he was wrong.\n\nSo, the main issue is about consent and control over contraceptive methods. In a sexual relationship, both partners should have a say in what they're comfortable with. Condoms are a form of protection and contraception, and each person has the right to their preferences. If one person is uncomfortable with the other's choice, they should discuss it beforehand.\n\nThe woman wanted to use her own condom, maybe for personal reasons like trusting her own supply, or perhaps she's more familiar with it. But by refusing the man's condom, she's taking control over the method of protection without considering his preference. On the other hand, the man had already brought his own, so he might have a preference for using that. \n\nHowever, the woman's insistence might be about her own comfort. Maybe she's concerned about STIs and wants to ensure that the condom is from her, or she might have specific reasons for not trusting his. Alternatively, she mentioned wanting kids soon, which might complicate things because if they're trying to conceive, using a condom wouldn't be the case. Wait, but the man was using a condom, which suggests he didn't want to risk pregnancy. If she wants to conceive, maybe she's not on birth control and wants to have unprotected sex. But she's trying to use her own condom, which seems contradictory. Hmm, that part is a bit confusing. The user says she mentioned wanting kids soon, but then they were going to \"do the deed,\" which might mean having sex. If she wants to conceive, using a condom would prevent that. So maybe there's a misunderstanding here. The man might have thought she wanted to use a condom for protection, but she actually wanted to get pregnant. However, the user mentions that he thought she wanted to maybe mess around for a while, not sure if that's related.\n\nBut focusing back on the condom issue. The man brought his, she refused and wanted to use hers. He left when she wouldn't allow his. Is that in the wrong? Well, the woman is in control of her own body and her own preferences. If she's comfortable with using her own condom, that's her choice. But if the man is uncomfortable with that for any reason (maybe he doesn't trust her, or he has a preference), then it's a mutual decision. However, in this case, he was okay with using a condom, just not hers. But she was insistent. \n\nIn terms of consent and negotiation, both parties should agree on the terms. If she's refusing his condom for any reason, he has the right to leave if he's not comfortable. On the other hand, she has the right to set boundaries. But if the refusal is based on her own health or safety (like if she has STIs and wants to use her own condom for some reason?), that might be a factor. But the scenario doesn't mention that. \n\nThe man's action of leaving was his choice, and he wasn't forced to have sex. However, the woman's friend calling him an asshole might be a point. The friend's reaction could be influenced by the woman's decision, but the man's choice to leave was his right. \n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? If he was willing to use a condom but the woman insisted on hers, and he left, then he's not in the wrong. He didn't pressure her; he respected her boundary by leaving. The woman's boundary was using her own condom, but the man had a preference for his. They didn't find a middle ground. However, in sexual situations, both parties need to agree. If she's refusing his method, maybe he should have discussed why she wanted hers before proceeding. Alternatively, if he was comfortable using hers, that would resolve the issue. But since he wasn't okay with that, leaving was his choice. \n\nIn terms of responsibility, neither is entirely in the wrong if they both had valid reasons and communicated. But the key here is that the man was willing to use a condom, just not hers. The woman wanted to use hers. If there's no health issue involved, it's more about preference. The fact that she mentioned wanting kids soon might be a red flag. If she wanted to get pregnant, why use a condom? Maybe there's a misunderstanding here. If the man thought she wanted to use a condom for protection but she actually wanted to conceive, that's a problem. But the user says she mentioned wanting kids soon, but they were going to \"do the deed,\" which might mean having sex. If she wants to get pregnant, using a condom would prevent that. So maybe she wanted to have unprotected sex, but the man was using a condom for protection. That would be a bigger issue. However, the user's story says that she insisted on using her own, which complicates things. \n\nWait, if she wants to get pregnant soon, maybe she's not on birth control and wants to have unprotected sex. But she's using a condom? That doesn't make sense. Unless she's using the condom for another reason, like STI protection. If she's not on birth control, using a condom would prevent pregnancy. But if she wants to get pregnant, she wouldn't use a condom. So perhaps there's a confusion here. The man might have thought she was using the condom for protection, but she actually wants to conceive. This could be a case of mismatched intentions. \n\nIf that's the case, then the man is trying to prevent pregnancy by using a condom, but she wants to get pregnant. So she's trying to have unprotected sex, but instead of removing the condom, she's providing her own. That's a bit confusing. Maybe she's trying to get him to use a condom for STI prevention but not for birth control. But if she wants to get pregnant, why use any condom? That part is unclear. \n\nGiven that, the man's decision to leave when she refused his condom is his right. If she wanted to have unprotected sex, he's not obligated to comply. However, if her intention is to get pregnant, using a condom would contradict that. There's a potential communication issue here. The man might not have realized her intention, and she might not have been clear. \n\nIn terms of who is in the wrong, it's a bit of a gray area. Both parties have a right to their preferences, but there's a lack of clear communication. The man left, which was his choice, but the girl's friend's reaction might be unfair. \n\nSo, considering all that, the answer would be B (No, the author is not in the wrong) because he was willing to use a condom and left when she refused his, which is his right. However, there's room for better communication. But in terms of being in the wrong, he's not, as he respected her boundary to some extent by leaving, even though he had a preference.\n"
