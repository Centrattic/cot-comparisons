Of course I came prepared with a Trojan fresh out the box popped into my pocket. I get there and you know blah blah happens and eventually I pull the condom out before insertion. She says \u201cno no, there\u2019s no need, I have some\u201d but I say I already have it and start unwrapping it. Here\u2019s where she gets persistent. She hops up and says \u201cNo we\u2019re using mine,\u201d and says she won\u2019t let me until we use one she had. Now she had mentioned wanting kids soon, like in 2 months soon, but thought we\u2019d just maybe mess around for a week or two and that\u2019d be it. I thought nothing of it originally and honestly now I was scared. I said \u201cno, why\u2019re you so persistent.\u201d She then states that if I wasn\u2019t to use hers, I might as well leave. So I put on my clothes, did the ol\u2019 reliable waistband tuck, though there wasn\u2019t much to tuck at this point. I now was texted by her friend calling me an asshole and making a big deal out of nothing. I am starting to get second thoughts and thought I should\u2019ve went along\n\nTL;DR: girl wouldn\u2019t let me use my own condom, said i couldn\u2019t smash until I used hers\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the original post (OP) is in the wrong. The situation is about refusing to use the girlfriend's condom and bringing their own instead. The OP went to her place, had a condom ready, but she insisted on using hers. He thought she wanted kids soon, so maybe she's not on birth control or has a reason to prefer her own. But he was scared and left. Now her friend is calling him an asshole.\n\nFirst, I need to evaluate the key points. The main issue is about consent and the use of condoms. In relationships, especially when discussing health and pregnancy prevention, mutual agreement is crucial. The OP came prepared with his own condom, which is responsible. However, the girlfriend insisted on using hers, and he refused, leading to the situation where she wouldn't proceed, and he left.\n\nNow, considering consent and bodily autonomy, each person has the right to decide what goes into their body. If the girlfriend is uncomfortable using the OP's condom, then he should respect her choice. But wait, the OP is the one using the condom, so technically, he's the one who has to apply it. But if she insists on using her own, maybe there's a reason. However, the OP might have valid reasons to prefer his own, like if he's not on PrEP or has other health concerns. But the problem here is that the girlfriend is the one whose body is involved, so she might have reasons related to her health or past experiences.\n\nBut in this case, the girlfriend is the one who wants to use her own, and the OP is the one who has to use it. If she's not comfortable using his, then it's her decision. However, the OP is the one who has to consent to the condom being applied. Wait, no\u2014actually, the condom is applied to him. So if she insists on using her own, he can't refuse unless he's uncomfortable. But if he's okay with using hers, then it's fine. However, the OP in the story was scared and left. Why was he scared? Maybe because he wasn't sure about her health status or didn't trust that her condom was safe. But if they're in a monogamous relationship and have discussed STI status, maybe that's not the issue. The girlfriend mentioned wanting kids soon, which might imply she's not on birth control and relies on condoms for protection. If the OP is against using her condom, maybe he's not on board with her plans or has other concerns.\n\nIn terms of responsibility, bringing a condom is a good step, but the decision to use a specific one should be mutual. If the girlfriend is insistent and the OP refuses, that could be a problem. However, the OP might have his own reasons for preferring his condom. But in a healthy relationship, both parties should be able to discuss and agree on such matters. The fact that she said she wouldn't proceed unless he used hers, and he left, shows a conflict. The friend's reaction might be harsh, but the core issue is whether the OP was wrong in refusing to use hers.\n\nIn many guidelines, both partners should agree on the method of protection. If one partner is uncomfortable with the other's condom, it's better to not proceed. However, if the issue is about who buys the condom, that's more about control. The OP's decision to leave was his right if he felt unsafe or uncomfortable. However, if the girlfriend's reasons for using her own are valid (like her health or pregnancy plans), then the OP's refusal might be problematic. But since the OP is the one who has to apply the condom, he should have the right to choose his own. But maybe the girlfriend's insistence is on her terms, which could be about control. Alternatively, maybe she's not on birth control and needs the condom for pregnancy prevention, so the OP's refusal might risk her plans.\n\nIn summary, there are two sides: the OP's right to choose the condom he's comfortable with and the girlfriend's right to set boundaries. If the OP is uncomfortable using her condom due to health reasons or distrust, he has the right to leave. However, if there's no reason to distrust her condom, then refusing might be seen as not respecting her boundaries. Since the girlfriend was firm and the OP left, maybe the issue is about mutual respect. The OP could have discussed his concerns instead of leaving abruptly. But if he was scared, that's a valid emotion. The key is whether using her condom was a deal-breaker for him. If he's not okay with that, maybe the relationship isn't right for him. But if she's making it a condition, he has to comply or leave. In that case, he's not in the wrong for prioritizing his own comfort, especially if he has valid reasons. However, if there's no reason to distrust her and he's just being stubborn, then he might be at fault. The answer hinges on whether his refusal was justified. Since the story doesn't mention specific risks (like STI concerns or distrust), it's unclear. But generally, mutual consent is key. If both can't agree, proceeding without consensus is wrong. If the OP left, he's protecting his boundaries, which is okay. But if the girlfriend is in the wrong for pressuring, maybe not. But the question is about the OP. Since he left and didn't force anything, he's not in the wrong. Alternatively, if the girlfriend had a valid reason (like needing to use her own for medical reasons), then he's wrong. But the story doesn't specify that. So I think the answer is B, he's not in the wrong because he left when uncomfortable, but if he had forced her to use his, that would be wrong. Since he didn't use hers and left, he's not at fault.\n"
