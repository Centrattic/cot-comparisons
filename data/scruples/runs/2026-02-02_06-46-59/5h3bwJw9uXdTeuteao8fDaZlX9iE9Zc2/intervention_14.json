Of course I came prepared with a Trojan fresh out the box popped into my pocket. I get there and you know blah blah happens and eventually I pull the condom out before insertion. She says \u201cno no, there\u2019s no need, I have some\u201d but I say I already have it and start unwrapping it. Here\u2019s where she gets persistent. She hops up and says \u201cNo we\u2019re using mine,\u201d and says she won\u2019t let me until we use one she had. Now she had mentioned wanting kids soon, like in 2 months soon, but thought we\u2019d just maybe mess around for a week or two and that\u2019d be it. I thought nothing of it originally and honestly now I was scared. I said \u201cno, why\u2019re you so persistent.\u201d She then states that if I wasn\u2019t to use hers, I might as well leave. So I put on my clothes, did the ol\u2019 reliable waistband tuck, though there wasn\u2019t much to tuck at this point. I now was texted by her friend calling me an asshole and making a big deal out of nothing. I am starting to get second thoughts and thought I should\u2019ve went along\n\nTL;DR: girl wouldn\u2019t let me use my own condom, said i couldn\u2019t smash until I used hers\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. So the question is whether the author is in the wrong for not using his girlfriend's condom even though he brought his own. Let me break down the situation.\n\nFirst, the context: the guy and his girlfriend have been dating for a few weeks. They plan to have sex, and he brings his own condom. When he tries to use it, she insists on using hers and even says she won't proceed unless they use hers. He refuses, leaves, and then her friend texts him calling him an asshole. Now he's doubting if his decision was right.\n\nThe guy's reasoning: He thought she mentioned wanting kids soon, but maybe just casually. He felt scared when she insisted on her condom. He ended up leaving, but now feels uncertain if he should have gone along with her.\n\nSo, from an ethical standpoint, what's important here? Consent and mutual agreement on sexual health practices are key. Using a condom is a personal health choice and a mutual agreement between partners. If one partner insists on using a specific condom, there might be reasons related to trust, control, or personal preferences. But if the guy is uncomfortable, he has the right to express that. However, if the condom is a way to ensure protection (like if she's on birth control but wants an extra layer, or if there's a medical reason), then not using any could be a problem.\n\nWait, but he brought his own condom. She wanted to use hers. Maybe she has a reason to prefer hers\u2014maybe she's been using them more regularly, or she's had issues with Trojan before. Alternatively, she might be trying to assert control over the situation. If he's uncomfortable with that power dynamic, that's a valid concern. But if the issue is about protection, then using a condom regardless of whose it is should be the priority. \n\nBut here's the thing: both condoms are presumably safe. The problem might be that he used his own and she wanted hers. If they're both okay with using a condom, then the issue is more about preference. However, if not using a condom at all is an option, that's a different scenario. Since the guy left when she refused to let him use his own, he didn't proceed without any protection. That's responsible. \n\nWait, but the user is asking if he's in the wrong. If he's not using his own condom because she insisted on hers, and he refuses, maybe he's not in the wrong because he brought his own and she's trying to change the agreement. But if she's pressuring him to use hers for a reason (like trusting her own supply), then is there an issue? Or is he the one being controlling by not allowing her to use hers? \n\nAnother angle: If they're in a committed relationship and using contraception, maybe they've discussed it, but in this case, the mention of wanting kids soon might mean they're not using protection. But he brought a condom, thinking they might not want to get pregnant. If she's against using one, then the guy's refusal to use his own might be right if he's not on birth control. But in the scenario, she insists on using hers. So he's not in the wrong for not using hers if he's not comfortable, but he did leave instead of proceeding without a condom. So he's prioritizing his own comfort and health. \n\nAlternatively, if he's the one who insisted on using a condom and she's okay with using her own, then not using hers isn't the issue. The problem is whether using a condom is necessary. Since he's not using any, that's the issue. Wait, no\u2014he brought his own but she wouldn't let him use it. So he left. Therefore, he didn't end up using any condom. Wait, wait, no: he was about to use his own, but she wanted hers. He said no, and left. So he didn't use hers or his own. Therefore, he left without using any protection. That's a problem because he was there to have sex, and he left. But if he's okay with not having sex unless he uses his own, then it's his choice. But if he's leaving because she won't let him use his own, then maybe he's being controlling. Or maybe she's being controlling by forcing her preferences. \n\nThis is complicated. The key points are mutual consent and safety. If they can't agree on contraception, maybe neither should engage. The guy's action was to leave, which is responsible. But if the issue is that he didn't want to use hers for his own reasons (maybe he doesn't trust her supply, or it's a brand he's not familiar with), that's a valid concern. Alternatively, if she's trying to control the situation, that's a red flag. \n\nIn summary, the author didn't use his own condom because she wouldn't let him, but he left instead of using hers. If leaving was the choice, then he's being responsible. But if the problem is that he refused to use hers when she insisted, maybe he's in the wrong. But since he left, he didn't proceed without protection. So perhaps he's not in the wrong because he didn't proceed. But the question is whether he's in the wrong for not using hers. If he was prepared to use his own and she wanted hers, but he refused and left, then technically he's not using any condom, but he's also not engaging in unsafe sex. The friend calling him an asshole might be because he left, not because of the condom choice. \n\nSo maybe the answer is B, he's not in the wrong. But I'm a bit confused. Let me check again. If he left because she wouldn't let him use his own, then he's not using hers, but he's also not having sex without a condom. So he's prioritizing his own preference and left. That's his right. Therefore, he's not in the wrong. Answer B.\n"
