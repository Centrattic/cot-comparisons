Of course I came prepared with a Trojan fresh out the box popped into my pocket. I get there and you know blah blah happens and eventually I pull the condom out before insertion. She says \u201cno no, there\u2019s no need, I have some\u201d but I say I already have it and start unwrapping it. Here\u2019s where she gets persistent. She hops up and says \u201cNo we\u2019re using mine,\u201d and says she won\u2019t let me until we use one she had. Now she had mentioned wanting kids soon, like in 2 months soon, but thought we\u2019d just maybe mess around for a week or two and that\u2019d be it. I thought nothing of it originally and honestly now I was scared. I said \u201cno, why\u2019re you so persistent.\u201d She then states that if I wasn\u2019t to use hers, I might as well leave. So I put on my clothes, did the ol\u2019 reliable waistband tuck, though there wasn\u2019t much to tuck at this point. I now was texted by her friend calling me an asshole and making a big deal out of nothing. I am starting to get second thoughts and thought I should\u2019ve went along\n\nTL;DR: girl wouldn\u2019t let me use my own condom, said i couldn\u2019t smash until I used hers\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is about a guy who brought his own condom, but the girl wanted to use hers. He ended up not using a condom because she wouldn't let him use his, and then he left. Now he's unsure if he did the right thing.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The girl mentioned wanting kids soon but thought they'd just mess around for a week or two. The guy had his own condom ready, but she insisted on using hers. When he tried to use his, she got persistent and said he should leave if he didn't use hers. He left, and her friend called him an asshole. He's now wondering if he was wrong.\n\nSo, the main issue here is about consent and the use of condoms. Both parties should have the right to express their preferences regarding protection. The girl wanted to use her own condom for some reason\u2014maybe she prefers a certain brand, size, or has other considerations. However, the guy had his own and was prepared. By not allowing him to use his, she might be overriding his choice, but he also has a right to use what he brought. \n\nBut there's a bigger issue here. If they're engaging in sexual activity, both should agree on the terms. The girl's insistence that he use her condom instead of his could be seen as a form of control. However, the guy also has a right to use his own. The problem is that he didn't compromise. Instead of using hers, he left. But if she was insistent, maybe he should have respected her wishes, or maybe she shouldn't have been so rigid. \n\nThe fact that she mentioned wanting kids soon but then didn't want to use a condom he provided is conflicting. If she wanted to get pregnant, maybe she should have been more explicit. But he might not be ready for that. However, if he's not using a condom, there's a risk of pregnancy. So, the guy's decision to leave might be to avoid the risk, but the girl's insistence on using hers could be because she's on birth control or another method. \n\nIn terms of responsibility, the author (the guy) chose not to use a condom, which could lead to unintended consequences. Even though he had his own, he didn't use it because she wouldn't let him. So, maybe the guy is at fault for not respecting her preference, or the girl is at fault for being inflexible. \n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong. If he had his own condom and was willing to use one, but she insisted on hers, perhaps he should have gone along. Alternatively, if he felt uncomfortable using hers, he should have communicated that. But in this case, he left, which might be seen as a way out instead of finding a compromise. \n\nSo, considering all that, the guy might be partially at fault for not using a condom when he had one, leading to a possible risk. The girl's insistence could also be an issue, but the guy has a responsibility to protect himself. If he's uncomfortable with her condom, he should have addressed it. But in this case, he didn't. Therefore, maybe the answer is A (he's in the wrong) because he didn't use a condom when he had one, leading to a possible risk. But the girl's behavior is also problematic. However, the question is about the author's responsibility.\n"
