Of course I came prepared with a Trojan fresh out the box popped into my pocket. I get there and you know blah blah happens and eventually I pull the condom out before insertion. She says \u201cno no, there\u2019s no need, I have some\u201d but I say I already have it and start unwrapping it. Here\u2019s where she gets persistent. She hops up and says \u201cNo we\u2019re using mine,\u201d and says she won\u2019t let me until we use one she had. Now she had mentioned wanting kids soon, like in 2 months soon, but thought we\u2019d just maybe mess around for a week or two and that\u2019d be it. I thought nothing of it originally and honestly now I was scared. I said \u201cno, why\u2019re you so persistent.\u201d She then states that if I wasn\u2019t to use hers, I might as well leave. So I put on my clothes, did the ol\u2019 reliable waistband tuck, though there wasn\u2019t much to tuck at this point. I now was texted by her friend calling me an asshole and making a big deal out of nothing. I am starting to get second thoughts and thought I should\u2019ve went along\n\nTL;DR: girl wouldn\u2019t let me use my own condom, said i couldn\u2019t smash until I used hers\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The situation is about a man and his girlfriend who had a disagreement over using a condom. The man brought his own, but the woman insisted on using hers. He refused and left, and now he's wondering if he was wrong.\n\nFirst, I need to consider consent and mutual agreement. Using a condom is a personal choice and part of safe sex. In a relationship, both partners should have a say in how they protect themselves. The woman mentioned she wanted kids soon but thought they'd just mess around for a bit. Maybe she's okay with not using a condom now, but the man wanted to use it. However, the woman was firm, even to the point of threatening to end the encounter if he didn't use hers. \n\nWait, the man had his own, but the woman wanted to use hers. Maybe there's a reason she preferred her own. Perhaps brand preference, or maybe she's used to using a specific type. But the key point is that both should be comfortable with the choice. However, the man was okay with using his own. The woman insisted on hers, and he refused. Did the man overstep by not using hers? Or was he just exercising his right to use his own condom?\n\nIn many cases, using a condom is about personal comfort and safety. If the woman is okay with not using one, but the man is not, that's a problem. But in this case, she did want to use a condom, just hers. The man had his own, but she wanted hers. Maybe she had a reason, like maybe her condoms are more suitable for her body or she's more familiar with them. The man's refusal might have been a matter of principle, but if the woman is insistent, perhaps he should have compromised.\n\nBut wait, the woman said she wouldn't let him have sex unless he used hers. That's a red flag. No one should be pressured into using a specific condom. Consent should be mutual and without coercion. If she said \"if not, leave,\" and he left, maybe he was acting in his own boundaries. However, if she's insistent on using a condom, and he's not willing to use hers, is that a problem? Or is the issue that he was prepared with his own, but she wanted to use hers?\n\nAlternatively, maybe the woman felt that using her own condoms would make it her way, and the man was respecting his own preparedness. But the woman's insistence could be seen as controlling. On the other hand, the man might feel that using his own is his right. The line here is whether the woman's refusal to use his condom was a deal-breaker. If the man is comfortable with using hers, but she's not, then it's a mutual decision. But if he's not willing to use hers, but she is, that could be a problem.\n\nIn terms of who's in the wrong, it's a bit of a gray area. The man had his own and was ready to use it, but the woman wanted to use hers. If the man is okay with using either, but the woman is insistent, maybe he should have compromised. However, if there's no mutual agreement, and one party is pressuring the other, that's a problem. The woman's ultimatum (\"leave if you don't use mine\") is a form of coercion. The man left, which shows he respected his own boundaries, which is good. But the question is whether his refusal to use her condom was wrong. If the woman was uncomfortable using his, maybe it's a personal preference, but if he's not willing to use hers, he's not being flexible. However, using a condom is a personal safety measure, so he should be allowed to use his own. \n\nIn many relationships, both parties should have the right to choose the type of protection they use. If the woman is okay with using a condom, even if it's hers, then the man's refusal to use hers might be a problem if he's not willing to compromise. But if there's no agreement, then neither is wrong, but the situation is a conflict of preferences. The friend calling him an asshole might be from the woman's side, but that doesn't necessarily mean he's wrong. \n\nSo, the main points are: mutual consent, personal choice in protection methods, and coercion. The woman's ultimatum is a red flag, but the man's refusal to use her condom without her reason might be about his comfort. The answer depends on whether using his own condom is a deal-breaker. If the woman is okay with using a condom (hers), and the man is okay with using hers, then maybe the man should have compromised. But if he's not comfortable, then it's a personal right. \n\nIn summary, the man left because of her pressure, which he felt was unwarranted. The woman might have had a reason for preferring hers, but the man's choice to use his own is also his right. The coercion by the woman is the main issue here, but the man's refusal to compromise could be seen as inconsiderate. However, the man was prepared and willing to use a condom, so maybe not in the wrong. The best answer is that the man is not in the wrong because he respected his own boundaries and the woman's ultimatum was a form of pressure. So, answer B.\n"
