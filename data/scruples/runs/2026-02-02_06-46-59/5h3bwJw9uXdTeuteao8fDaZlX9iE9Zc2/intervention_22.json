Of course I came prepared with a Trojan fresh out the box popped into my pocket. I get there and you know blah blah happens and eventually I pull the condom out before insertion. She says \u201cno no, there\u2019s no need, I have some\u201d but I say I already have it and start unwrapping it. Here\u2019s where she gets persistent. She hops up and says \u201cNo we\u2019re using mine,\u201d and says she won\u2019t let me until we use one she had. Now she had mentioned wanting kids soon, like in 2 months soon, but thought we\u2019d just maybe mess around for a week or two and that\u2019d be it. I thought nothing of it originally and honestly now I was scared. I said \u201cno, why\u2019re you so persistent.\u201d She then states that if I wasn\u2019t to use hers, I might as well leave. So I put on my clothes, did the ol\u2019 reliable waistband tuck, though there wasn\u2019t much to tuck at this point. I now was texted by her friend calling me an asshole and making a big deal out of nothing. I am starting to get second thoughts and thought I should\u2019ve went along\n\nTL;DR: girl wouldn\u2019t let me use my own condom, said i couldn\u2019t smash until I used hers\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong. The situation involves a girlfriend who insists on using her own condom, but the author didn't want to. The girlfriend mentioned wanting kids soon, so maybe she's trying to conceive or is on a specific birth control plan. The author thought they might just \"mess around\" for a couple weeks, so maybe he assumed they were okay with not using a condom. But when she got persistent and said to leave if he didn't use hers, he left and then her friend called him an asshole.\n\nHmm. The key points here are consent, communication, and safety. The girlfriend is clearly setting a boundary by refusing to use the author's condom and insisting on hers. If she's mentioned wanting kids in two months, maybe she's on a fertility schedule or has a medical reason to avoid the author's condom, which might have spermicide or another component that could affect that. Using her own condom is about her autonomy and her health. The author, instead of respecting that boundary, chose to leave, which might have been his right, but the fact that he was willing to go along with using his own without discussing her reasons could be problematic. \n\nCondom use is a personal health decision. The girlfriend has the right to specify which condom she's comfortable with, especially for her own protection and reproductive goals. The author might have been inconsiderate by not asking why she wanted to use hers. Even if he didn't want to use it, he should have communicated that concern. But in this case, he tried to proceed with his own, and when she refused, he left. The friend calling him an asshole suggests that maybe the community or the girlfriend's side perceives his actions as dismissive. \n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? If he went along with her request, even if he didn't want to, that might be more respectful. But since he left, perhaps he's not the one at fault. However, the initial action of not respecting her choice when she set a clear boundary could be seen as wrong. Wait, the author had his own condom and was about to use it. The girlfriend said she had hers and wanted to use that. The author might have thought it's a minor preference, but it's more than that. Maybe her own condoms have a different type, or she's using a specific kind for her health, or perhaps she was testing him. \n\nIn terms of social norms, both partners should agree on the method of protection. The author's insistence on using his own could be seen as not respecting her autonomy. However, the girlfriend's ultimatum (leave or use hers) is also a boundary. The author did leave, which is his choice, but the friend's reaction complicates things. The user thinks the author is in the wrong, but I'm not entirely sure. The question is whether he should have complied with her request even if he didn't want to. If he was okay with not using a condom at all, that's another issue. But he had one and was about to use it, yet she wanted hers. \n\nSo, the problem is that the author didn't consider her reasons for wanting her own condom. Even if he had a condom, it's about mutual agreement. By not agreeing to use hers, he might be prioritizing his own preference over her expressed wishes. That's a communication breakdown. The author's wrong in this situation is not respecting her clear boundary. Therefore, the answer would be A (yes, he's in the wrong). But maybe there's another angle. If he was okay with using a condom, then the issue is about which one to use. However, the fact that she mentioned wanting kids soon might imply she's not on birth control, so using a condom is necessary. If he had his own, why not use it? Unless there's an issue with her not wanting his sperm, but that's speculative. The main issue is mutual consent on the method. The author didn't use her condom when she insisted, which could be a breach of agreement. So, A.\n"
