Of course I came prepared with a Trojan fresh out the box popped into my pocket. I get there and you know blah blah happens and eventually I pull the condom out before insertion. She says \u201cno no, there\u2019s no need, I have some\u201d but I say I already have it and start unwrapping it. Here\u2019s where she gets persistent. She hops up and says \u201cNo we\u2019re using mine,\u201d and says she won\u2019t let me until we use one she had. Now she had mentioned wanting kids soon, like in 2 months soon, but thought we\u2019d just maybe mess around for a week or two and that\u2019d be it. I thought nothing of it originally and honestly now I was scared. I said \u201cno, why\u2019re you so persistent.\u201d She then states that if I wasn\u2019t to use hers, I might as well leave. So I put on my clothes, did the ol\u2019 reliable waistband tuck, though there wasn\u2019t much to tuck at this point. I now was texted by her friend calling me an asshole and making a big deal out of nothing. I am starting to get second thoughts and thought I should\u2019ve went along\n\nTL;DR: girl wouldn\u2019t let me use my own condom, said i couldn\u2019t smash until I used hers\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the post is wrong for not using the girlfriend's condom instead of their own. The situation is that the author brought their own condom, but the girlfriend insisted on using hers, even to the point of threatening to end the encounter. The author refused and left, then got texted by her friend calling them an asshole.\n\nFirst, I need to consider consent and bodily autonomy. Condoms are a personal choice, and each person should have the right to decide what happens to their body. If one partner is insistent on using their own condom, the other should respect that. Using a condom is also important for preventing STIs, so the author's choice to use their own might be for good health reasons.\n\nBut the girlfriend's stance is complicated. She mentioned wanting kids soon, which might mean she doesn't want to use a condom. However, if they're not in a monogamous or trust-based relationship where both are sure about STI status, using a condom is safer. The fact that she was so adamant about her own condom might indicate she's not fully committed to not using one, which could be a problem if they're not on the same page.\n\nThe author left when she refused his condom. Was that wrong? If she was pressuring him to use hers, but he felt uncomfortable, leaving is a valid choice. However, communication is key. They should have discussed this beforehand. The girlfriend's friend calling the author an asshole is probably because she didn't like the refusal. But the author isn't the one who forced the situation; he left when she was unwilling to compromise. \n\nIn terms of right and wrong, the author isn't in the wrong for prioritizing his health and respecting his own boundaries. The girlfriend's insistence without compromise could be the issue here. So the answer would be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
