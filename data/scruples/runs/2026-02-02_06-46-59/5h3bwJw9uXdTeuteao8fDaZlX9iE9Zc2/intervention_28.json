Of course I came prepared with a Trojan fresh out the box popped into my pocket. I get there and you know blah blah happens and eventually I pull the condom out before insertion. She says \u201cno no, there\u2019s no need, I have some\u201d but I say I already have it and start unwrapping it. Here\u2019s where she gets persistent. She hops up and says \u201cNo we\u2019re using mine,\u201d and says she won\u2019t let me until we use one she had. Now she had mentioned wanting kids soon, like in 2 months soon, but thought we\u2019d just maybe mess around for a week or two and that\u2019d be it. I thought nothing of it originally and honestly now I was scared. I said \u201cno, why\u2019re you so persistent.\u201d She then states that if I wasn\u2019t to use hers, I might as well leave. So I put on my clothes, did the ol\u2019 reliable waistband tuck, though there wasn\u2019t much to tuck at this point. I now was texted by her friend calling me an asshole and making a big deal out of nothing. I am starting to get second thoughts and thought I should\u2019ve went along\n\nTL;DR: girl wouldn\u2019t let me use my own condom, said i couldn\u2019t smash until I used hers\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The situation is about a guy who brought a condom, but his girlfriend insisted on using hers instead. He didn't want to, she got upset, and he left. Then her friend called him an asshole.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The girl mentioned wanting kids soon. Using her own condom might be part of her birth control plan, especially if she's on something else and uses condoms as backup. Or maybe she has a specific reason to prefer her own. But the guy had his own and was willing to use it, right? So why did she refuse his?\n\nCondoms are a shared responsibility. If both are bringing their own, maybe there's a miscommunication. But if she's insistent, maybe there's a health concern or something. But the guy is concerned about her wanting to get pregnant soon. Wait, if she wants to get pregnant, why use a condom? Unless she meant she wants to have kids soon but not right now. So maybe she's trying to avoid pregnancy for now, but the guy isn't sure.\n\nThe guy's point is that he brought his own, she wouldn't let him use it. He felt scared. But why? Maybe because he thought she was trying to control the situation or there was a hidden agenda. But using a condom is a standard practice for safe sex. If she's on birth control, maybe she's more relaxed, but if he's not on anything, he might be worried about STIs.\n\nSo, the question is about consent and mutual agreement. Both should agree on the method of protection. If she insists on using her own, but he's okay with using his, there's a conflict. However, condoms are a joint decision. He shouldn't force his on her, but she shouldn't force hers on him if he's uncomfortable. But why would he be scared? Maybe he's worried about her pushing him to have sex without protection, even though she mentioned wanting kids soon. That's confusing.\n\nIn terms of right or wrong, the key is communication. If he had a reason to use his own (like STI protection), and she's not on birth control, then he's in the right. But if she's on birth control and the issue is about her preference, maybe he should respect that. But if he's concerned about her not being honest about her intentions (like not wanting to get pregnant now), then using a condom is his right. However, refusing to use any condom if she's on birth control might be her choice. \n\nThe problem here is that they didn't communicate properly. The guy assumed she wanted to use her own for some reason, but maybe she had a different plan. If he's not comfortable with her condom, he has the right to refuse, but she also has the right to refuse his. However, the fact that he left and then the friend called him an asshole complicates things. Maybe the girl felt disrespected by not using her condom, but the guy felt pressured. \n\nIn terms of responsibility, both should have discussed their needs beforehand. The guy brought a condom, which is responsible, but the girl's insistence might be about her own health or birth control. If the guy is worried about STIs and the girl isn't on protection, he's in the right to use his own. But if she's on birth control and the issue is about pregnancy, then maybe he's overcomplicating it. \n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? If he's refusing to use her condom solely because he prefers his own, without a valid reason like STI concerns, then maybe he's being controlling. But if he's worried about her not being honest about her birth control or STI status, then he's in the right. The story doesn't specify if he knows her birth control status. If she's on the pill, maybe she's okay with no condom, but if he's not, that's a problem. Without more info, it's hard to say. But generally, both should have a mutual agreement. Since the guy left and she got upset, maybe he was in the right to protect himself. But if she's on birth control and it's safe, maybe he's overreacting. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the girl was trying to get him to have unprotected sex for some reason, which he rightfully refused. But without more context, it's a toss-up. The answer probably depends on their communication and health status. Since the user says they thought the author was in the wrong but are unsure, I need to weigh the options. \n\nIn conclusion, without knowing if the girl is on birth control or has an STI, it's hard. But generally, using a condom is a responsible choice. If the guy is refusing to use her condom when she's on birth control, maybe he's being overly cautious. But if she's not on birth control, he's right to insist. Since the girl mentioned wanting kids soon, maybe she's on birth control but wants to stop. If he's not on anything, using a condom is safer. So the author might be right to stick with his own. But if the girl's refusal was based on her own birth control, then the author is being inflexible. \n\nHmm. This is tricky. I think the answer hinges on whether using a condom is necessary. If they both trust each other and are on birth control, maybe not. But if there's any doubt, using a condom is better. The author didn't use his own but left, which shows he's concerned about safety. However, the girl's insistence might have been about her own preferences. If the guy left because he felt pressured, he might be in the right. But if he was being controlling by not allowing her to use hers, maybe he's wrong. \n\nGiven that, I think the author is not in the wrong because he's prioritizing protection, and the girl's insistence might have been about her own preferences. So answer B.\n"
