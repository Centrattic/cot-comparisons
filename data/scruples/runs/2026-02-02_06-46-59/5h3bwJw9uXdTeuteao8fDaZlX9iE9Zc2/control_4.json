Of course I came prepared with a Trojan fresh out the box popped into my pocket. I get there and you know blah blah happens and eventually I pull the condom out before insertion. She says \u201cno no, there\u2019s no need, I have some\u201d but I say I already have it and start unwrapping it. Here\u2019s where she gets persistent. She hops up and says \u201cNo we\u2019re using mine,\u201d and says she won\u2019t let me until we use one she had. Now she had mentioned wanting kids soon, like in 2 months soon, but thought we\u2019d just maybe mess around for a week or two and that\u2019d be it. I thought nothing of it originally and honestly now I was scared. I said \u201cno, why\u2019re you so persistent.\u201d She then states that if I wasn\u2019t to use hers, I might as well leave. So I put on my clothes, did the ol\u2019 reliable waistband tuck, though there wasn\u2019t much to tuck at this point. I now was texted by her friend calling me an asshole and making a big deal out of nothing. I am starting to get second thoughts and thought I should\u2019ve went along\n\nTL;DR: girl wouldn\u2019t let me use my own condom, said i couldn\u2019t smash until I used hers\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the story is in the wrong. The situation is about a guy who brought his own condom to a sexual encounter with his girlfriend, but she insisted on using hers instead. He refused and left, and now he's unsure if he did the right thing.\n\nFirst, I need to consider consent and communication. The key points here are the girlfriend's insistence on using her own condom and the author's refusal. The girlfriend mentioned wanting kids soon, so maybe she's on birth control or has her own reasons for using her condoms. But she's pressuring him to use hers instead of his. \n\nIn terms of sexual health, using any condom is better than none, but there might be reasons someone prefers their own. For example, maybe she's concerned about STIs and wants to use her own to ensure it's her own, or maybe she has a specific type. However, the author had already brought his own, which he's comfortable with. \n\nThe girlfriend's reaction seems extreme\u2014saying she wouldn't let him proceed unless he used hers and then threatening to make him leave if he didn't comply. That sounds like coercion. Healthy relationships should involve mutual respect and consent. If one person is pressuring the other to use a different method without discussion, that's a red flag.\n\nAlso, the friend's reaction, calling him an asshole, might indicate social pressure, but that doesn't necessarily validate the girlfriend's actions. The author's refusal could be about his comfort with using her condom, which is his right. However, if the girlfriend has a valid health reason, that's different. But the story doesn't mention any such reasons.\n\nThe fact that the author is now having second thoughts suggests he might feel conflicted. But standing by his decision to use his own condom isn't wrong. Insisting on using one's own method is about personal boundaries and safety. If the girlfriend is insistent without a valid reason, that's where the issue lies. \n\nIn conclusion, the author isn't in the wrong for prioritizing his own comfort and safety. The girlfriend's behavior of pressuring him to use her condom without mutual agreement is the real issue here. So the answer should be B.\n"
