Of course I came prepared with a Trojan fresh out the box popped into my pocket. I get there and you know blah blah happens and eventually I pull the condom out before insertion. She says \u201cno no, there\u2019s no need, I have some\u201d but I say I already have it and start unwrapping it. Here\u2019s where she gets persistent. She hops up and says \u201cNo we\u2019re using mine,\u201d and says she won\u2019t let me until we use one she had. Now she had mentioned wanting kids soon, like in 2 months soon, but thought we\u2019d just maybe mess around for a week or two and that\u2019d be it. I thought nothing of it originally and honestly now I was scared. I said \u201cno, why\u2019re you so persistent.\u201d She then states that if I wasn\u2019t to use hers, I might as well leave. So I put on my clothes, did the ol\u2019 reliable waistband tuck, though there wasn\u2019t much to tuck at this point. I now was texted by her friend calling me an asshole and making a big deal out of nothing. I am starting to get second thoughts and thought I should\u2019ve went along\n\nTL;DR: girl wouldn\u2019t let me use my own condom, said i couldn\u2019t smash until I used hers\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the author is at fault for not using the girlfriend's condom instead of his own. Let me break down the situation step by step.\n\nFirst, the author went over to a girl he's been talking to for 3-4 weeks. They were planning to have sex, and he brought a condom from his own supply. When he tried to use it, she insisted they use hers instead. She even went as far as saying she wouldn't proceed unless he used hers. The author felt scared and left. Later, her friend called him an asshole. Now he's wondering if he did the wrong thing.\n\nSo the key points here are consent, personal boundaries, and the use of condoms. Condom use is a personal choice and an important part of safe sex. The author had his own condom, which he was prepared to use. The girl's insistence on using hers might be about her own preferences or health reasons. But when she made it conditional for him to use hers, that's where the conflict arises.\n\nFrom a health and safety perspective, using a condom is a mutual agreement. If one partner insists on a specific method, it's important to discuss reasons. However, if someone refuses to use any condom the other has prepared, that could be a red flag. The author had his own, which was safe and ready to use. The girl's refusal might have been about control or other issues, but the author's decision to leave could be seen as respecting his own boundaries and health.\n\nOn the other hand, if the girl had a valid reason for preferring her own condoms (like testing, STI concerns), then the author might have been wrong to not comply. But the story doesn't mention any discussion about her reasons. The author felt scared and left, which could indicate he was uncomfortable with her insistence. In such cases, it's important to prioritize personal safety and consent. If someone feels pressured or unsafe, leaving is a valid choice.\n\nSo, considering all this, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong because he had his own protection and left when he felt uncomfortable. The issue might be more about the girl's controlling behavior rather than the author's actions. However, sometimes people might feel that using the condom they brought is a given, but since the situation led to a conflict, the author's choice to leave was his right.\n"
