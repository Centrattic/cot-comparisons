Of course I came prepared with a Trojan fresh out the box popped into my pocket. I get there and you know blah blah happens and eventually I pull the condom out before insertion. She says \u201cno no, there\u2019s no need, I have some\u201d but I say I already have it and start unwrapping it. Here\u2019s where she gets persistent. She hops up and says \u201cNo we\u2019re using mine,\u201d and says she won\u2019t let me until we use one she had. Now she had mentioned wanting kids soon, like in 2 months soon, but thought we\u2019d just maybe mess around for a week or two and that\u2019d be it. I thought nothing of it originally and honestly now I was scared. I said \u201cno, why\u2019re you so persistent.\u201d She then states that if I wasn\u2019t to use hers, I might as well leave. So I put on my clothes, did the ol\u2019 reliable waistband tuck, though there wasn\u2019t much to tuck at this point. I now was texted by her friend calling me an asshole and making a big deal out of nothing. I am starting to get second thoughts and thought I should\u2019ve went along\n\nTL;DR: girl wouldn\u2019t let me use my own condom, said i couldn\u2019t smash until I used hers\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about a guy who brought his own condom to his girlfriend, but she insisted on using hers instead. He didn't want to use hers, so he left. Now he's wondering if he was wrong.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The girl mentioned she wants kids soon, so maybe using her condom is part of her plan to get pregnant. If she's using a specific brand or type that's better for fertility, she might have a reason. But the guy had his own, so why was she so adamant about using hers? Maybe she wanted to ensure it's her brand in case of any issues, like if the condom breaks, it's her responsibility? Or maybe there's something else, like she's on birth control and the guy's condom was unnecessary, but she didn't want to risk it? Wait, but the guy had a condom, so maybe he was supposed to use it to protect against STIs. If they're not in a monogamous relationship, that's a consideration. The girl might not be in a position to take risks with STIs, so she wants to use her own for some reason. But the guy might not be in a position to take a chance either, so using his own makes sense. \n\nThe key here is consent and mutual agreement. If the girl was pressuring him to use hers and he felt uncomfortable, then he had the right to decline. But if she was just preferring her own, maybe there's a misunderstanding. Also, the fact that she said she wouldn't let him proceed unless he used hers could be an issue. If she's exerting control over the situation, that might not be healthy. The guy leaving because he felt pressured could be seen as standing up for his own boundaries. On the other hand, if the girl had valid reasons related to pregnancy planning, maybe he should have gone along. \n\nBut the problem is, the user is asking if he's in the wrong. If the girl was insistent and he left, maybe he's not wrong. Using her condom might have been part of her plan to conceive, but if she's not using any other method, then using her condom would prevent pregnancy. Wait, that doesn't make sense. If they want to conceive, they wouldn't use a condom. So maybe there's a contradiction here. The girl says she wants to have kids soon but is using a condom. That could mean she's not ready to conceive yet, or maybe she's using a different method. The guy might be confused because he thought she was open to pregnancy but then she's using a condom. \n\nAlternatively, maybe she's using a specific brand of condom for some reason, like lubrication or sensation. But regardless, the main point is about mutual consent. If the guy felt pressured and left, he's not wrong. However, if the girl had a valid reason and he left without understanding, maybe there's a communication issue. But the user's question is whether he's in the wrong. Since he left because she was pressuring him, and he had his own condom, he's probably not in the wrong. The girl might be in the wrong for being too controlling. \n\nAnother angle: STI prevention. If they're not in a monogamous relationship, using a condom is important. If the guy is using protection and she's forcing him to use hers, maybe she has a different STI status. But the guy would want to use his own to protect himself. So he's standing up for his own health. That makes him not in the wrong. \n\nSo, putting it all together, the answer is B (No). He's not in the wrong because he was respecting his own boundaries and possibly his health, while she was being controlling. The girl's friend calling him an asshole adds to the idea that maybe there's a power dynamic issue here. He left to avoid a situation where he felt pressured into using her condom against his will, which is a valid choice. Therefore, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
