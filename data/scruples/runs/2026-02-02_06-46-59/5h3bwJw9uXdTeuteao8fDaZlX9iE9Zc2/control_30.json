Of course I came prepared with a Trojan fresh out the box popped into my pocket. I get there and you know blah blah happens and eventually I pull the condom out before insertion. She says \u201cno no, there\u2019s no need, I have some\u201d but I say I already have it and start unwrapping it. Here\u2019s where she gets persistent. She hops up and says \u201cNo we\u2019re using mine,\u201d and says she won\u2019t let me until we use one she had. Now she had mentioned wanting kids soon, like in 2 months soon, but thought we\u2019d just maybe mess around for a week or two and that\u2019d be it. I thought nothing of it originally and honestly now I was scared. I said \u201cno, why\u2019re you so persistent.\u201d She then states that if I wasn\u2019t to use hers, I might as well leave. So I put on my clothes, did the ol\u2019 reliable waistband tuck, though there wasn\u2019t much to tuck at this point. I now was texted by her friend calling me an asshole and making a big deal out of nothing. I am starting to get second thoughts and thought I should\u2019ve went along\n\nTL;DR: girl wouldn\u2019t let me use my own condom, said i couldn\u2019t smash until I used hers\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not using the girlfriend's condom and instead using their own. The situation is that they met up, and the girlfriend insisted on using her own condom, threatening to end the encounter if they didn't. The author initially brought their own but decided to use hers, but then ended up not using any and left, which made the girlfriend's friend upset.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the key points here. The main issue is about consent and the use of condoms. The author thought the girlfriend wanted to use theirs, but she insisted on using hers. However, the author then left without using hers, which led to some conflict. The girlfriend mentioned wanting kids soon, so maybe she's not on birth control or is trying to conceive, but that's a bit unclear. \n\nCondoms are a form of protection and contraception, and both partners should agree on their use. If the girlfriend is uncomfortable with the author's condom for any reason, maybe it's about trust, personal preference, or she might be planning to get pregnant. But if she's using her own condom to prevent pregnancy or STIs, the author should respect that. However, the author didn't use hers and left. That could be a problem because the girlfriend might have been relying on her own method. \n\nWait, the user said they \"now was texted by her friend calling me an asshole and making a big deal out of nothing.\" The friend's reaction suggests that the girlfriend was upset with the author for not using the condom she provided. But the author didn't use it because they left the situation. So, if the author left before using the condom, maybe they didn't have unprotected sex. But the girlfriend wanted to use her own, perhaps because she had specific reasons. \n\nThe line \"if I wasn\u2019t to use hers, I might as well leave\" from the girlfriend implies she didn't want to proceed with the author's condom. The author then left, which could be seen as honoring her request, but the friend is upset. However, the real issue is whether the author is in the wrong for not using the provided condom. If the girlfriend is insistent and the author is willing to proceed, they should use her condom. But the author didn't, which might have been a breach of her wishes. However, in this case, the author left, so maybe there was no actual sex without a condom. \n\nBut there's a nuance here. The author had their own condom, but she wanted to use hers. The author could have used hers instead. The problem is that the author didn't use any. If they left, and didn't have sex, then maybe the issue is about the initial refusal to use hers. However, if the author left the situation without engaging in sexual activity, then perhaps they are not in the wrong. The girlfriend's friend is upset, but that's a third party's opinion. The main question is about the author's actions. \n\nAnother angle: insisting on using one's own condom can be a red flag. If the girlfriend is against using the author's, maybe she's trying to control the situation or has other issues. But the author could have compromised by using her condom. The fact that the author didn't use any and left might be seen as not respecting her decision, even if they left. \n\nWait, the author says \"I now was texted by her friend calling me an asshole and making a big deal out of nothing.\" That might imply that the author didn't follow through with using her condom, leading to the friend's disapproval. But if the author left before having sex, maybe there's a misunderstanding. However, the author's actions might still be wrong if they were insistent on using their own and then didn't use any. \n\nIn terms of consent and safety, if the girlfriend is uncomfortable with the author's condom, the author should respect that. The author had the right to refuse if they felt pressured, but the correct action would have been to use her condom if they were going to proceed. Leaving might have been the right move in terms of respecting boundaries, but the initial decision not to use her condom could be problematic. \n\nSo, if the author didn't use her condom and left, but the friend is upset, perhaps the author made a mistake by not using her condom. The right answer would depend on whether the author actually had unprotected sex. The user says \"I now was texted by her friend...\" which suggests that maybe the author had sex without using the provided condom. If that's the case, then the author is in the wrong for not following through. \n\nAlternatively, if the author left and didn't have sex, then the issue is about the initial refusal. But the user says \"I put on my clothes, did the ol\u2019 reliable waistband tuck,\" which might mean they didn't have sex. However, the girlfriend's friend is upset, so maybe there's a misunderstanding. The user is asking if they are in the wrong, and the key point is that the girlfriend was insistent on using her own, and the author didn't comply, leading to the friend's reaction. \n\nIn any case, the author could have either used the girlfriend's condom or left. The fact that they left but then the friend is upset might indicate that the girlfriend was expecting the author to use hers, and the author didn't. Therefore, the author might be in the wrong for not respecting her request. But if they didn't have sex, maybe not. However, the user's summary says \"said I couldn't smash until I used hers,\" which might be a typo for \"have sex.\" So, if the author didn't have sex because they left, then maybe they aren't in the wrong. But the initial action of not using her condom could still be seen as not respecting her wishes. \n\nThis is a bit confusing. The main takeaway is that when a partner is insistent about using her own protection, the correct action is to use it if you're proceeding. The author's choice to not do so, even if they left, shows a lack of respect for her boundaries. Therefore, the answer is A (yes, the author is in the wrong).\n"
