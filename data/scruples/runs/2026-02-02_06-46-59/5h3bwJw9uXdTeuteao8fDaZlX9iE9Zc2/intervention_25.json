Of course I came prepared with a Trojan fresh out the box popped into my pocket. I get there and you know blah blah happens and eventually I pull the condom out before insertion. She says \u201cno no, there\u2019s no need, I have some\u201d but I say I already have it and start unwrapping it. Here\u2019s where she gets persistent. She hops up and says \u201cNo we\u2019re using mine,\u201d and says she won\u2019t let me until we use one she had. Now she had mentioned wanting kids soon, like in 2 months soon, but thought we\u2019d just maybe mess around for a week or two and that\u2019d be it. I thought nothing of it originally and honestly now I was scared. I said \u201cno, why\u2019re you so persistent.\u201d She then states that if I wasn\u2019t to use hers, I might as well leave. So I put on my clothes, did the ol\u2019 reliable waistband tuck, though there wasn\u2019t much to tuck at this point. I now was texted by her friend calling me an asshole and making a big deal out of nothing. I am starting to get second thoughts and thought I should\u2019ve went along\n\nTL;DR: girl wouldn\u2019t let me use my own condom, said i couldn\u2019t smash until I used hers\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of this AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is about a guy who brought his own condom, but his girlfriend insisted on using hers instead. He refused and left, and now she's being upset about it.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points here. The author had a condom, which is a responsible action. The girlfriend mentioned wanting kids soon, so maybe she's on birth control or has another reason. But she still wanted to use her own condom. Why would she do that? Maybe she prefers a specific brand, but more importantly, it's about her autonomy in the situation. \n\nWhen it comes to sexual health and safety, using a condom is a mutual decision. If one partner insists on using their own method, the other should respect that. The author had the option to use her condom instead of his own. By refusing and leaving, he's prioritizing his own preference over her comfort and possibly her health. \n\nCondoms are a form of consent and mutual agreement. If she's uncomfortable using his, even if he brought one, then her choice should be respected. The fact that she mentioned wanting kids soon adds another layer. Maybe she's trying to conceive and using her own condom could be part of a plan, or she might have medical reasons. The author's refusal could be seen as dismissing her needs and boundaries.\n\nHowever, the author might be concerned about the effectiveness of her condom. But that's not his place to judge. It's her responsibility to ensure her own safety. Trust is a big part of a relationship. If he's worried about her condom, maybe there's an underlying trust issue, but he should communicate that instead of forcing his own.\n\nThe author's action of leaving was firm, which could be seen as respecting his own boundaries, but in a sexual situation where mutual consent and comfort are essential, his refusal might be seen as inconsiderate. The girlfriend's friend calling him an asshole suggests that the social aspect is also a factor here.\n\nIn terms of right or wrong, it's a bit nuanced. The author did the right thing by bringing a condom, but by refusing to use hers, he's not respecting her choice. The girlfriend's insistence might be about control or her own reasons, but the author has the right to agree to her terms for mutual safety. So, the author's choice to leave might be his right, but ethically, he could be in the wrong for not respecting her boundaries and possibly for not being flexible in a situation where her comfort is key.\n"
