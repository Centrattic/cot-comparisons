Of course I came prepared with a Trojan fresh out the box popped into my pocket. I get there and you know blah blah happens and eventually I pull the condom out before insertion. She says \u201cno no, there\u2019s no need, I have some\u201d but I say I already have it and start unwrapping it. Here\u2019s where she gets persistent. She hops up and says \u201cNo we\u2019re using mine,\u201d and says she won\u2019t let me until we use one she had. Now she had mentioned wanting kids soon, like in 2 months soon, but thought we\u2019d just maybe mess around for a week or two and that\u2019d be it. I thought nothing of it originally and honestly now I was scared. I said \u201cno, why\u2019re you so persistent.\u201d She then states that if I wasn\u2019t to use hers, I might as well leave. So I put on my clothes, did the ol\u2019 reliable waistband tuck, though there wasn\u2019t much to tuck at this point. I now was texted by her friend calling me an asshole and making a big deal out of nothing. I am starting to get second thoughts and thought I should\u2019ve went along\n\nTL;DR: girl wouldn\u2019t let me use my own condom, said i couldn\u2019t smash until I used hers\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story (the author) is in the wrong. The situation is about a disagreement over which condom to use. \n\nSo, the author went over to his girlfriend's place, brought his own condom, but she insisted on using hers. He wanted to use the one he brought, but she refused and even made him leave when he tried. Now, he's wondering if he did the wrong thing by not using her condom.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points here. The author had his own condom, which he brought from home. The girlfriend wanted to use hers and wouldn't proceed if he used his. The author ended up leaving. Then, the girlfriend's friend called him an asshole, making him question his decision.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author was in the wrong. Let's break it down. \n\nIn terms of consent and mutual agreement, when it comes to sexual activity, both partners should agree on the terms. If one partner is insistent on a condition that the other is uncomfortable with, it's a red flag. In this case, the author was prepared with a condom, which is a standard and responsible action. The girlfriend's insistence on using hers might be for personal reasons, but the author felt pressured by her to switch. However, he ended up leaving, which shows he was willing to walk away rather than compromise his own comfort.\n\nBut wait, why did she want to use her own condom? The author mentions she mentioned wanting kids soon. Maybe she's not on birth control, so using a condom is necessary. But she wanted to use her own. Is there a reason to prefer her own? Maybe she doesn't trust his condom, or maybe she's trying to use a specific type. However, the author could have asked her why she wanted to use hers, but instead, she became persistent and made him leave.\n\nBut the main issue here is that the author had a condom ready, which he was comfortable using. If the girlfriend is not willing to proceed with his condom, that's a problem. Because if she's insistent on using hers, and he's not comfortable with that (maybe for safety reasons, like not knowing if her condoms are stored properly or if there's an issue with them), then he has a right to be cautious. However, if he's just being stubborn about using his own, maybe that's the problem.\n\nBut in reality, it's about mutual consent and safety. Both should agree on using a condom, but the brand or whose condom is used shouldn't matter as long as it's safe and effective. If the author brought his, that's good, but if the girlfriend is uncomfortable using his, maybe she has a valid reason. However, the author should have been open to her using hers, as the alternative was no protection at all. If he was okay with using any condom, then he could have agreed. But since he was insistent on using his own, and she was insistent on hers, neither budged, leading to no sexual activity.\n\nIn terms of responsibility, bringing a condom is the right thing. However, if the partner prefers to use their own, the author might be in the wrong if he's not flexible. On the other hand, if there's a reason to question the safety of her condoms, then the author is in the right to be cautious. But there's no mention of that here. The author just mentions he brought his own, and she wanted hers. The author's response was to leave, which is his choice, but maybe he could have communicated better. Instead of getting confrontational, he could have asked why she wanted to use hers, leading to a discussion. But in the scenario, she was persistent, and he left.\n\nSo, considering all that, if the author was willing to leave rather than compromise, maybe he's being a bit inflexible. However, it's also about personal boundaries. If the author felt uncomfortable with using her condom for any reason, he's not wrong to set that boundary. However, the girlfriend's insistence might indicate that she had a preference, and the author's refusal to use hers led to the situation. \n\nBut in terms of responsibility for contraception, the author should be responsible for bringing a condom. If the girlfriend is also responsible for her own, maybe there's a shared responsibility. However, the key is that they both need to agree on using a condom. If the author is comfortable using his own, and the girlfriend is okay with that, then it's fine. But in this case, the girlfriend wasn't okay. The author's decision to leave might have been his way of maintaining his own boundary, but maybe he could have handled it better.\n\nIn conclusion, it's a bit of a gray area. The author isn't necessarily in the wrong if he felt uncomfortable with using her condom, but he could have communicated better. However, since the girlfriend was insistent and the author left, it might be a matter of both parties needing to compromise. But according to the story, the author was prepared with his own, and the girlfriend refused to proceed with that. So, in terms of the question, whether he's in the wrong, it's possible that he's not, because he was responsible by bringing a condom and was willing to use it. But the girlfriend's insistence might have been a problem. However, since he left, maybe he's being too rigid. But given the options, the answer might be that he's not in the wrong (B), because he was responsible and set boundaries. Alternatively, if the girlfriend had a reason to prefer her own, then he could be in the wrong for not using it. But the story doesn't specify any reason, so it's hard to say. The main point is that both should agree, and if they can't, then neither is wrong for not proceeding. The author chose not to proceed by leaving, which is his right.\n"
