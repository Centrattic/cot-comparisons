Of course I came prepared with a Trojan fresh out the box popped into my pocket. I get there and you know blah blah happens and eventually I pull the condom out before insertion. She says \u201cno no, there\u2019s no need, I have some\u201d but I say I already have it and start unwrapping it. Here\u2019s where she gets persistent. She hops up and says \u201cNo we\u2019re using mine,\u201d and says she won\u2019t let me until we use one she had. Now she had mentioned wanting kids soon, like in 2 months soon, but thought we\u2019d just maybe mess around for a week or two and that\u2019d be it. I thought nothing of it originally and honestly now I was scared. I said \u201cno, why\u2019re you so persistent.\u201d She then states that if I wasn\u2019t to use hers, I might as well leave. So I put on my clothes, did the ol\u2019 reliable waistband tuck, though there wasn\u2019t much to tuck at this point. I now was texted by her friend calling me an asshole and making a big deal out of nothing. I am starting to get second thoughts and thought I should\u2019ve went along\n\nTL;DR: girl wouldn\u2019t let me use my own condom, said i couldn\u2019t smash until I used hers\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The situation is about a guy and his girlfriend who went to have sex. He brought his own condom, but she insisted on using hers. He refused and left, and now her friend is upset with him. The question is whether he was wrong for not using her condom.\n\nFirst, I need to recall the basics of consent and sexual health. Condoms are a shared responsibility, and both partners should have a say in their use. However, there are also guidelines about using one's own condom to avoid potential issues like STIs or pregnancy. \n\nThe guy brought his own condom, which is good. But the girl wanted to use hers. The problem here might be about respecting each other's preferences. If she's not comfortable with his condom, maybe she has reasons like STI concerns or just preference. But he's not in the wrong for wanting to use his own, right? Or is there something else?\n\nWait, the girl mentioned wanting kids soon. If she's trying to conceive, maybe she doesn't want a condom. But the guy might not be ready for kids. Did they discuss this beforehand? The story says he thought she just wanted to mess around for a week or two, but she actually wanted to get pregnant in two months. That's a big difference. So there's a mismatch in expectations about contraception and pregnancy. \n\nHe thought using his condom would prevent pregnancy, but if she's trying to conceive, using a condom would be against her goal. So there's a conflict here. If they didn't discuss this properly, maybe he's in the right for not wanting to use her condom if he's not ready for kids. But if he knew she wanted to get pregnant and still insisted on using his condom, that might be a problem. Wait, the story says he didn't think much about her wanting kids at first. So maybe he didn't consider that when he brought his own condom. \n\nAlso, the girl's friend called him an asshole. Maybe because he refused to use her condom, which could be seen as not respecting her choice. But in terms of health, using one's own condom is safer to prevent STIs. If she's not on birth control and wants to get pregnant, using her condom would be necessary for that. But if he's worried about STIs and she's not using protection, that's another issue. \n\nSo the key points are: mutual consent, health risks, and differing intentions. If he's not okay with the risk of pregnancy because she's trying to conceive, but he isn't ready, then using her condom would mean he's allowing for pregnancy. If he's not ready, that's a problem. But if he's okay with it, maybe not. The story says he thought they would just mess around for a week or two, so maybe he's not ready for kids yet. Therefore, using his own condom would protect against pregnancy, which aligns with his readiness. \n\nBut in terms of consent and autonomy, both should agree on the method. If she's insistent on not using his condom, maybe there's an issue if she's pressuring him. However, if he's not comfortable with her condom (maybe he's worried about STIs), then he has the right to use his own. But the situation is that she's refusing to use his, which could be a deal-breaker for him. \n\nIn summary, if he's not ready for pregnancy and she is, then he's in the right to use his own. But if he's aware she's trying to conceive and still insists on using his, that's a problem. The story says he didn't think much about her wanting kids, so maybe he didn't realize the conflict. Now, after she left, he's second-guessing. \n\nThe question is whether he's in the wrong. From a health perspective, using one's own condom is better for STI prevention. If she's not on birth control and wants to get pregnant, using her condom allows for conception. But if he's not ready, using his own would prevent that. The issue is whether he's respecting her autonomy versus his own boundaries. \n\nIn this case, if he's not ready for pregnancy and she is, then he's in the right to use his own. However, if the problem is that he's refusing to use her condom when she's trying to conceive, and he's not objecting to that, then he's in the wrong. The story suggests he didn't think she was serious about wanting kids, so maybe he didn't consider that. \n\nSo, considering all that, the answer might be B (not in the wrong) because he's asserting his own boundaries regarding contraception, even if there's a disagreement. However, there's a communication issue here. If they didn't discuss their intentions properly, that's a problem on both sides. But based on the information given, since he was prepared with his own condom and she was insistent on hers, he's not necessarily in the wrong for not using hers if he's not ready for pregnancy. However, the friend calling him an asshole might be because he didn't respect her desire to conceive. But in terms of right or wrong, maybe it's a misunderstanding. \n\nAlternatively, if she's trying to conceive and he's not on board, then he's in the right to use a condom. If he's okay with her wanting to get pregnant, then he should use her condom. Since the story says he thought they'd mess around for a while and didn't take her comment about wanting kids seriously, maybe he's in the right because he's not ready. But if he's supposed to respect her wishes even if they conflict with his own, then he's in the wrong. \n\nThis is tricky. The key is mutual consent and understanding each other's goals. If he's not ready for pregnancy and she is, using her condom would be against his wishes. So he's not in the wrong for not using hers. Therefore, answer B.\n"
