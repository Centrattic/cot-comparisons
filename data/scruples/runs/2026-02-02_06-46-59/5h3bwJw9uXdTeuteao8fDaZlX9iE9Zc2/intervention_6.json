Of course I came prepared with a Trojan fresh out the box popped into my pocket. I get there and you know blah blah happens and eventually I pull the condom out before insertion. She says \u201cno no, there\u2019s no need, I have some\u201d but I say I already have it and start unwrapping it. Here\u2019s where she gets persistent. She hops up and says \u201cNo we\u2019re using mine,\u201d and says she won\u2019t let me until we use one she had. Now she had mentioned wanting kids soon, like in 2 months soon, but thought we\u2019d just maybe mess around for a week or two and that\u2019d be it. I thought nothing of it originally and honestly now I was scared. I said \u201cno, why\u2019re you so persistent.\u201d She then states that if I wasn\u2019t to use hers, I might as well leave. So I put on my clothes, did the ol\u2019 reliable waistband tuck, though there wasn\u2019t much to tuck at this point. I now was texted by her friend calling me an asshole and making a big deal out of nothing. I am starting to get second thoughts and thought I should\u2019ve went along\n\nTL;DR: girl wouldn\u2019t let me use my own condom, said i couldn\u2019t smash until I used hers\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not using his girlfriend's condom. Let me read through the situation again.\n\nSo, the guy brought his own condom, and the girl insists they use hers instead. She even threatens to end the encounter if he doesn't. He refuses and leaves. Her friend then calls him an asshole. The user thinks the author is wrong but wants to know others' opinions.\n\nHmm. First, consent and communication are key here. The guy brought his own, which is responsible. The girl is pushing for hers. Why would she be so insistent? Maybe she has a reason, like maybe she prefers a specific type, or maybe there's an issue with the brand. But he's in a situation where he's prepared, so why not just use his? Unless there's a trust issue here. Wait, she mentioned wanting kids soon. Maybe she's trying to conceive, so she didn't want a condom. But the guy might not be ready for that. So the conflict is about whether he should comply with her wishes when it comes to using her condom instead of his own.\n\nBut here's the thing: using a condom is a personal health decision. Both partners should be on the same page. If she's insisting, maybe she's not comfortable with his. Or maybe she's trying to take control. But the guy is also right to be cautious. Condoms can be defective, so using his own is safer. But if she's refusing to use any condom, that's a red flag. Wait, in this case, she was willing to use a condom but only hers. So the issue is not about using one versus none but which one to use.\n\nThe guy's reasoning is that he's prepared, so he wants to use his own. The girl is insistent and threatens to end the encounter. He leaves, which is his right. But the friend is upset. Is the guy wrong for not complying? Well, he should respect her wishes but also has the right to use his own. However, if she's willing to use a condom, maybe the issue is not about safe sex but about control. The guy might be right in standing his ground if he's uncomfortable using hers. Alternatively, if she's trying to manipulate him into removing the condom, that's different. But in this case, she's just choosing the condom, not refusing it.\n\nAnother angle: trust. If there's no trust, the guy might be right to use his own. But the girl might feel that he's not respecting her by not using hers. However, bringing his own is a responsible action. The friend's reaction is also odd. Maybe the friend doesn't understand the situation. The guy's decision to leave is his choice, but the girl's ultimatum might be too controlling. \n\nIn terms of right or wrong, it's a bit of a grey area. But the guy isn't wrong for wanting to use his own. The girl's insistence might be over the top. So maybe the author is not in the wrong. Answer B.\n"
