Of course I came prepared with a Trojan fresh out the box popped into my pocket. I get there and you know blah blah happens and eventually I pull the condom out before insertion. She says \u201cno no, there\u2019s no need, I have some\u201d but I say I already have it and start unwrapping it. Here\u2019s where she gets persistent. She hops up and says \u201cNo we\u2019re using mine,\u201d and says she won\u2019t let me until we use one she had. Now she had mentioned wanting kids soon, like in 2 months soon, but thought we\u2019d just maybe mess around for a week or two and that\u2019d be it. I thought nothing of it originally and honestly now I was scared. I said \u201cno, why\u2019re you so persistent.\u201d She then states that if I wasn\u2019t to use hers, I might as well leave. So I put on my clothes, did the ol\u2019 reliable waistband tuck, though there wasn\u2019t much to tuck at this point. I now was texted by her friend calling me an asshole and making a big deal out of nothing. I am starting to get second thoughts and thought I should\u2019ve went along\n\nTL;DR: girl wouldn\u2019t let me use my own condom, said i couldn\u2019t smash until I used hers\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The person is asking if they're at fault for not using their girlfriend's condom. Here's what happened: they had a condom prepared, but the girlfriend insisted on using hers. He thought she wanted kids soon, so maybe she's on birth control? But he didn't push back at first. When she said he had to use hers or leave, he left. Now he's confused and thinking maybe he should have gone along.\n\nFirst, consent and mutual agreement are key here. Using a condom is a common way to prevent pregnancy and STIs. If the girlfriend is using her own condom, that's her choice. But if she's on birth control, maybe she's confident in that method. However, condoms also provide STI protection, which he might be relying on. \n\nThe situation becomes tricky when she says she won't allow him to proceed unless he uses hers. That could be a power dynamic issue. If she's pressuring him to use her condom, maybe she's not respecting his preparedness. But he's leaving when she won't let him use his own. Is that his right? Or is her insistence on her own condom reasonable if she's using it for another reason?\n\nHe mentions she mentioned wanting kids soon. If she's planning pregnancy, maybe she's not using birth control, so using her condom might be to prevent pregnancy. But if she's using her own, he's taking her word that it's safe. However, he might be worried about STIs if he's not sure about her status. But that's a separate issue from pregnancy.\n\nHe left the situation when she said he had to use hers. That could be a sign of respecting boundaries, but if he's uncomfortable with using her condom without checking it, maybe he should have. However, condoms are usually safe, so maybe he's overthinking. The text from her friend calling him an asshole suggests maybe the girlfriend and her friend are upset he didn't comply.\n\nIn terms of responsibility, both parties have a right to their own methods of protection. If he's not comfortable with using her condom, he has the right to leave. On the other hand, if she's pressuring him to use hers without discussing his concerns, that could be an issue. It's a mutual decision. If he's in a relationship where she's making decisions about protection without considering his preferences, that's a problem. But if he's not willing to compromise, that's also an issue.\n\nThe key is communication. They didn't talk about birth control or STI status before. He assumed she wanted kids, but maybe she's using condoms as backup. He didn't want to use hers, maybe because of brand preference or checking expiration, but she was firm. He left to avoid conflict, which is a valid choice, but maybe he should have had a more open conversation instead of taking it to extremes. \n\nSo, is he in the wrong? If he's choosing to protect himself (using his own condom) and she's pressuring him to use hers, he's not wrong for wanting to use his own. But if she's pressuring him to use hers, she's not respecting his choice. However, leaving the situation when she's not allowing his method could be his way of asserting his boundaries. In that case, he's not in the wrong. But if the issue is about pregnancy prevention and she's using condoms for that, he might be missing the point. \n\nThe answer likely leans towards him not being in the wrong because he's acting on his own preparedness and leaving when she's not allowing his choice. But there's a need for better communication. So the answer is B.\n"
