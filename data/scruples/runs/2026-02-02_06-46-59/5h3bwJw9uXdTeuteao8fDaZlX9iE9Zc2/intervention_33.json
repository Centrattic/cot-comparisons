Of course I came prepared with a Trojan fresh out the box popped into my pocket. I get there and you know blah blah happens and eventually I pull the condom out before insertion. She says \u201cno no, there\u2019s no need, I have some\u201d but I say I already have it and start unwrapping it. Here\u2019s where she gets persistent. She hops up and says \u201cNo we\u2019re using mine,\u201d and says she won\u2019t let me until we use one she had. Now she had mentioned wanting kids soon, like in 2 months soon, but thought we\u2019d just maybe mess around for a week or two and that\u2019d be it. I thought nothing of it originally and honestly now I was scared. I said \u201cno, why\u2019re you so persistent.\u201d She then states that if I wasn\u2019t to use hers, I might as well leave. So I put on my clothes, did the ol\u2019 reliable waistband tuck, though there wasn\u2019t much to tuck at this point. I now was texted by her friend calling me an asshole and making a big deal out of nothing. I am starting to get second thoughts and thought I should\u2019ve went along\n\nTL;DR: girl wouldn\u2019t let me use my own condom, said i couldn\u2019t smash until I used hers\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the author of the post is in the wrong for not using his girlfriend's condom. The situation is that they were about to have sex, the author brought his own condom, but the girlfriend insisted on using hers and even refused to proceed if he didn't. The author ended up leaving because she wouldn't let him use his, and now he's questioning if he made a mistake.\n\nFirst, I need to recall some basic principles about consent and sexual health. Condoms are about protecting both partners from STIs and unwanted pregnancies. The key here is mutual consent on which condom to use. But in this case, the girlfriend is pushing to use hers, and the author is okay with using a condom but not hers. \n\nWait, the author mentions that the girlfriend had mentioned wanting kids soon. That's a bit conflicting. If she wants to have kids soon, maybe she's not using a condom at all? But she's insisting on using hers, so maybe she's trying to prevent pregnancy for now but wants to get pregnant later. But why would she use her own condom? Maybe there's an issue with the author's condom? Or maybe she's not sure about the timing yet.\n\nThe author had his own condom, which is good because it shows he's responsible. But when she insists on using hers, he refuses and leaves. The problem is that both parties should have a mutual agreement on contraception. If she's insistent and he's unwilling to comply, maybe there's a power dynamic here. But is it wrong for him to hold his ground?\n\nIn terms of consent, if she's pressuring him to use her condom and he doesn't want to, but she's not allowing him to use his own, that could be a form of coercion. However, the author could have negotiated more. Maybe he could have asked why she wanted to use hers, or if there was an issue with his. But he left because she wouldn't let him use his. \n\nOn the other hand, using his own condom is his right. If she's forcing him to use hers against his will, that's a problem. But if he's okay with using a condom in general, but not hers, maybe he should have been more flexible. The fact that she's insistent and even threatened to not proceed unless he used hers might be crossing a line. \n\nAlso, the girlfriend's friend is now calling the author an asshole, which suggests that her side of the story is being portrayed as the victim. But maybe her friend doesn't know the whole context. The user's question is whether the author is in the wrong. \n\nConsidering all this, the author had the right to use his own condom. If the girlfriend is pressuring him to use hers without his consent, that's a problem. However, if the issue is about her wanting to prevent pregnancy for now and he's okay with that, maybe there's a miscommunication. But since he left because she wouldn't allow his condom, maybe he's in the right for not compromising on his own safety. Alternatively, if he was okay with using her condom but she was the one who made a deal, then maybe he's in the wrong for not being flexible. \n\nWait, the author says he was \"scared\" when she mentioned wanting kids soon. Maybe he thought she wanted to get pregnant now, but she actually meant in a few months. That could be a misunderstanding. If he's not ready for pregnancy, using her condom would be necessary, but if she's not ready either, maybe they should be on the same page. \n\nI think the main issue is mutual consent and negotiation. If both parties can't agree on a method, then proceeding without agreement is problematic. The author took a stand by leaving, which could be seen as responsible if he doesn't want to risk STIs, but if she's insisting, maybe he should have tried to understand her reasoning. \n\nIn terms of right or wrong, it's a bit of a gray area. The author isn't wrong for wanting to use his own condom, but he could have been more communicative. However, the girlfriend's behavior might be pressuring him, which is not good. So maybe the answer is that the author isn't in the wrong (B), because he's standing by his own choice and left when she became insistent. But some might argue that he should have been more flexible. It's a tough call.\n"
