Of course I came prepared with a Trojan fresh out the box popped into my pocket. I get there and you know blah blah happens and eventually I pull the condom out before insertion. She says \u201cno no, there\u2019s no need, I have some\u201d but I say I already have it and start unwrapping it. Here\u2019s where she gets persistent. She hops up and says \u201cNo we\u2019re using mine,\u201d and says she won\u2019t let me until we use one she had. Now she had mentioned wanting kids soon, like in 2 months soon, but thought we\u2019d just maybe mess around for a week or two and that\u2019d be it. I thought nothing of it originally and honestly now I was scared. I said \u201cno, why\u2019re you so persistent.\u201d She then states that if I wasn\u2019t to use hers, I might as well leave. So I put on my clothes, did the ol\u2019 reliable waistband tuck, though there wasn\u2019t much to tuck at this point. I now was texted by her friend calling me an asshole and making a big deal out of nothing. I am starting to get second thoughts and thought I should\u2019ve went along\n\nTL;DR: girl wouldn\u2019t let me use my own condom, said i couldn\u2019t smash until I used hers\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so the user is asking whether the person in the situation is in the wrong. Let me read through the scenario again carefully.\n\nThe person went over to his girlfriend and had a condom with him. When they were about to have sex, the girl said not to use his and insisted on hers. He thought nothing of it at first, but then she got more persistent, saying she wouldn't let him proceed unless he used hers. He tried to question why, she said if he didn't use hers, he should leave. He left, and her friend texted him calling him an asshole. Now he's second-guessing whether he should have complied.\n\nFirst, let's break down the key points. The girl was very insistent on using her own condom. The user had his own, but she refused. He tried to use his, she pushed back, and when he left, her friend criticized him. The user is wondering if he was wrong to leave.\n\nNow, considering consent and safety. Condom use is a mutual decision. If one partner insists on a specific method of contraception, the other should respect it. However, the user was prepared with his own. The girl's insistence that he use hers might be about her preference, possibly due to brand, comfort, or other reasons. But if she's not comfortable using his, she has the right to specify her own.\n\nThe user says the girl mentioned wanting kids soon. Maybe she's on birth control, but if she's using condoms as a backup, she might prefer her own for trust or other reasons. But if the user is uncomfortable using her condom, that's a valid concern too. However, in this case, the user tried to use his own, and the girl refused. He left because she wouldn't compromise. \n\nBut wait, the user had already brought his own. The girl's refusal to use that and insistence on hers might be a dealbreaker for him. However, if the user had been okay with using her condom, that would have resolved the issue. But he wasn't comfortable with her pushing him to use hers. \n\nBut is it the user's fault for not using her condom? Or is it about respecting her boundaries? If the girl is setting a boundary by saying she won't proceed unless he uses her condom, then the user's refusal to comply could be seen as not respecting her boundaries. However, he could argue that he's also setting a boundary by not wanting to use her condom. \n\nBut in terms of consent, both parties should agree to the terms. If she's unwilling to proceed unless he uses her condom, and he's unwilling to use hers, then neither side is necessarily wrong. However, if the user left because she wouldn't let him proceed unless he used hers, and he's now questioning if he should have complied, maybe the issue is about mutual respect and communication. \n\nThe user might be in the right if he felt uncomfortable using her condom and left rather than compromise. On the other hand, if the girl had valid reasons for preferring her own, he might have been wrong to leave. But since she's the one who set the boundary (saying he can't proceed unless he uses hers), the user's choice to leave could be seen as respecting her boundary, but also not compromising his own. \n\nWait, but the user had already brought his own. Maybe the girl didn't trust the user's condom? Or maybe she's on a different brand, or it's a matter of personal preference. The user might not be wrong if he's not comfortable using her condom. But if the girl is insistent, maybe the user should have used hers. \n\nAlternatively, if the user is okay with using her condom, but she's okay with him using his, but she's choosing hers, then it's a matter of mutual agreement. The problem here is that the user tried to use his, she refused, and then he left. So the user's choice to leave might be a sign of not wanting to compromise, which could be a red flag. \n\nBut in terms of right or wrong, it's a bit of a gray area. The user is in the wrong if he didn't respect her boundary. But he's also in the right if he felt she was being unreasonable. However, the girl's actions (telling him to leave if he doesn't use hers) could be seen as setting a clear boundary, which the user didn't respect by leaving instead of complying. \n\nWait, no. If he left because she wouldn't let him proceed unless he used her condom, then he's not using hers. So he's choosing not to comply with her condition. If he's okay with that, then he's not in the wrong. But if the girl is setting a boundary that she won't proceed unless he uses hers, then the user's refusal to comply could be seen as not respecting her boundary. \n\nBut in that case, the user might be in the wrong for not respecting her terms. However, mutual consent requires both parties to be on the same page. If the user is uncomfortable with her conditions, then perhaps he shouldn't proceed. \n\nThis is a bit tricky. The user had his own condom, but the girl refused. He tried to use his, she pushed back, he left. The key is whether the user should have respected her boundary and used her condom. If the user is okay with using her condom, then he should have. If not, then he's not in the wrong. \n\nBut the user left because she wouldn't let him use his. So he's not respecting her boundary by leaving instead of finding a compromise. Therefore, he's in the wrong because he didn't respect her decision to use her own condom. \n\nAlternatively, if the user had valid concerns about using her condom (e.g., expired, not his preference), then he's in the right. But in this case, there's no mention of such issues. The user just wanted to use his own. The girl's insistence on hers might be a personal preference. So the user might be in the wrong for not respecting her preference. \n\nBut in the end, mutual consent is key. If both can't agree, then proceeding isn't appropriate. The user left, so maybe he's respecting his own boundaries, which is okay. But the girl's friend is calling him an asshole, implying she's in the right. \n\nHmm. The answer might depend on the cultural or personal norms. However, in terms of right or wrong, the user is in the wrong if he didn't respect her boundary. But if he felt she was being unreasonable, then he's not. \n\nGiven the information, since the user had his own and she refused, and he left, the user is in the wrong for not using her condom when she insisted. Therefore, answer A.\n"
