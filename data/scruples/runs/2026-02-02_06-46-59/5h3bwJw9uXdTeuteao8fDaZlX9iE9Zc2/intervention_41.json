Of course I came prepared with a Trojan fresh out the box popped into my pocket. I get there and you know blah blah happens and eventually I pull the condom out before insertion. She says \u201cno no, there\u2019s no need, I have some\u201d but I say I already have it and start unwrapping it. Here\u2019s where she gets persistent. She hops up and says \u201cNo we\u2019re using mine,\u201d and says she won\u2019t let me until we use one she had. Now she had mentioned wanting kids soon, like in 2 months soon, but thought we\u2019d just maybe mess around for a week or two and that\u2019d be it. I thought nothing of it originally and honestly now I was scared. I said \u201cno, why\u2019re you so persistent.\u201d She then states that if I wasn\u2019t to use hers, I might as well leave. So I put on my clothes, did the ol\u2019 reliable waistband tuck, though there wasn\u2019t much to tuck at this point. I now was texted by her friend calling me an asshole and making a big deal out of nothing. I am starting to get second thoughts and thought I should\u2019ve went along\n\nTL;DR: girl wouldn\u2019t let me use my own condom, said i couldn\u2019t smash until I used hers\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see here. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for not using his girlfriend's condom. Alright, so the situation is that the couple is about to have sex, and the guy brought his own condom. The girl says they should use hers, and he refuses, leading to a conflict where she won't proceed unless he uses hers. He ends up leaving, and her friend texts him calling him an asshole.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points here. The author had a condom ready, which is a good sign. The girl wanted to use hers, possibly because she mentioned wanting kids soon. But the author didn't think they were ready for that, hence bringing his own. The conflict arises when the girl insists on using hers, and he refuses, leading to the situation where she won't have sex unless he does.\n\nNow, from a health and safety perspective, using a condom is important to prevent STIs and unintended pregnancies. However, the girl is the one who wants to use hers, implying she has her own reasons. If she's on birth control, maybe that's a factor, but the author might not know that. The girl's insistence might be about control or trust in the relationship.\n\nBut the author is using his own condom, which he brought prepared. If the girl is pressuring him not to use his own, maybe there's an underlying issue. However, the girl's refusal to proceed unless he uses hers could be a form of coercion, making him feel like he has to give in to her demand. But the author is standing his ground, which could be seen as respecting his own boundaries. \n\nOn the other hand, if the girl is trying to use the situation to assert control, the author might be right to refuse. However, if the girl's reason for wanting her own condom is valid (like trusting her supply or health reasons), the author might be disregarding her needs. But the author's concern about not being ready for kids is also valid. \n\nThe text from her friend calling him an asshole suggests that the girl's side might view his refusal as inconsiderate. But the author's perspective is that he didn't want to use hers because of her mention of wanting kids soon. However, maybe he should have discussed it more, but in the moment, he made a decision based on his own comfort. \n\nIn terms of consent and mutual agreement, both partners should discuss and agree on contraceptive methods. The author's refusal to use hers might be a breach of that mutual agreement if they had discussed it beforehand. But since they didn't, it's unclear. The author's actions might be seen as not respecting her choice, but he's also protecting his own boundaries. \n\nConsidering all angles, the answer might hinge on whether using one's own condom is a personal right or if the partner's preference takes precedence. Health-wise, both are responsible for their own protection, but the situation here is more about control and readiness for pregnancy. The author's decision to leave might indicate that he's standing by his own boundaries, but the girl's insistence could be seen as pressuring him. \n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? If the girl is pressuring him to use her condom as a condition for having sex, that's a form of coercion. However, the author's refusal to comply with her demand might be justified if he has valid reasons (like not wanting to risk pregnancy). But if the girl's refusal to proceed unless he uses hers is a form of control, then the author is in the right to leave. \n\nBut the key issue here is mutual agreement. If they hadn't discussed contraceptive preferences beforehand, the author shouldn't be blamed for bringing his own. However, the girl's reaction (making him leave) and the friend's judgment might indicate that the author's choice was not the best. \n\nIn conclusion, the situation is a bit of a gray area. The author isn't necessarily in the wrong if he's acting on his own boundaries, but the girl's insistence might be problematic. However, since the question is whether the author is in the wrong, and considering the possible coercion from the girl's side, the answer might be that the author is not in the wrong.\n"
