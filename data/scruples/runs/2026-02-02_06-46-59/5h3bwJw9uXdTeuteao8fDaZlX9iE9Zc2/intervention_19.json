Of course I came prepared with a Trojan fresh out the box popped into my pocket. I get there and you know blah blah happens and eventually I pull the condom out before insertion. She says \u201cno no, there\u2019s no need, I have some\u201d but I say I already have it and start unwrapping it. Here\u2019s where she gets persistent. She hops up and says \u201cNo we\u2019re using mine,\u201d and says she won\u2019t let me until we use one she had. Now she had mentioned wanting kids soon, like in 2 months soon, but thought we\u2019d just maybe mess around for a week or two and that\u2019d be it. I thought nothing of it originally and honestly now I was scared. I said \u201cno, why\u2019re you so persistent.\u201d She then states that if I wasn\u2019t to use hers, I might as well leave. So I put on my clothes, did the ol\u2019 reliable waistband tuck, though there wasn\u2019t much to tuck at this point. I now was texted by her friend calling me an asshole and making a big deal out of nothing. I am starting to get second thoughts and thought I should\u2019ve went along\n\nTL;DR: girl wouldn\u2019t let me use my own condom, said i couldn\u2019t smash until I used hers\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not using the girlfriend's condom when she insisted on using hers. The situation is that they were about to have sex, the author brought his own condom, but the girlfriend refused and said they had to use hers. The author then left because she wouldn't let him use his, and now he's getting messages from her friend about being an asshole.\n\nFirst, I need to consider consent and communication. The author came prepared with a condom, which shows he was thinking about safety. However, the girlfriend wanted to use her own. In a consensual relationship, both partners should have a say in such matters. But the girlfriend was firm, even to the point of making him leave if he didn't comply. \n\nNow, the author's reasoning was possibly about trust or preference. Maybe he had concerns about her condoms not being safe, but he didn't mention that here. Instead, he left, which might indicate he felt uncomfortable. However, if both are in a committed relationship, maybe there's an assumption of mutual trust. But the girlfriend's insistence might have been about her own health or preferences.\n\nThe key here is whether using her condom was a deal-breaker. If the author was uncomfortable with that, he had the right to leave, but maybe he should have discussed it more beforehand. However, the girlfriend also had the right to set boundaries. The text mentions she mentioned wanting kids soon, which might imply she's on birth control and doesn't need a condom, but the author might not trust that. \n\nOn the other hand, if they're not in a monogamous relationship, the author's insistence on using his own could be about protection. The problem arises from not communicating better. The author might have thought he was being responsible, but the girlfriend's refusal could be about her own comfort. \n\nIn terms of right or wrong, it's a bit nuanced. The author left when she wouldn't let him use his, which could be seen as standing by his own boundaries. But maybe he should have respected her decision, especially if he was okay with trusting her. Alternatively, if he wasn't comfortable using her condom, walking away was the right move. \n\nThe girlfriend's friend calling him an asshole might indicate that she's the one being unreasonable. But the girlfriend's stance could be about her own health or something else. Without more context, it's hard to say. The author's action was to leave, which is his choice, but whether he's in the wrong depends on the circumstances. If there's mutual trust and no health concerns, using her condom should be okay. If not, then the author was right to leave. \n\nOverall, it's a situation where both sides have valid points. The author isn't necessarily in the wrong if he felt it was important to use his own condom, but if the girlfriend's insistence was based on her own health or trust in her product, then maybe he should have complied. However, the text doesn't clarify if there were health issues, so it's a toss-up. The answer might lean towards B because he walked away instead of forcing the issue, but I'm not entirely sure.\n"
