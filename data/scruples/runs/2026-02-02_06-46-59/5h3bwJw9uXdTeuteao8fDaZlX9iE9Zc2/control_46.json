Of course I came prepared with a Trojan fresh out the box popped into my pocket. I get there and you know blah blah happens and eventually I pull the condom out before insertion. She says \u201cno no, there\u2019s no need, I have some\u201d but I say I already have it and start unwrapping it. Here\u2019s where she gets persistent. She hops up and says \u201cNo we\u2019re using mine,\u201d and says she won\u2019t let me until we use one she had. Now she had mentioned wanting kids soon, like in 2 months soon, but thought we\u2019d just maybe mess around for a week or two and that\u2019d be it. I thought nothing of it originally and honestly now I was scared. I said \u201cno, why\u2019re you so persistent.\u201d She then states that if I wasn\u2019t to use hers, I might as well leave. So I put on my clothes, did the ol\u2019 reliable waistband tuck, though there wasn\u2019t much to tuck at this point. I now was texted by her friend calling me an asshole and making a big deal out of nothing. I am starting to get second thoughts and thought I should\u2019ve went along\n\nTL;DR: girl wouldn\u2019t let me use my own condom, said i couldn\u2019t smash until I used hers\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is at fault for not using the girlfriend's condom. The situation is that the author had his own condom ready, but the girlfriend insisted on using hers, even to the point of threatening to end things if he didn't. He left, and now her friend is upset.\n\nFirst, consent and mutual agreement are key in any sexual situation. The girlfriend was clear that she wanted to use her own condom, which is her right. The author had another opinion but she was firm. The girlfriend also mentioned wanting kids soon, which might be relevant if not using her condom was part of her contraceptive plan. But the main issue here is that she refused to proceed unless he used hers, so he left. \n\nFrom a safety standpoint, using a condom is important to prevent STIs and unintended pregnancy. The fact that she had her own and wanted to use it shows she's responsible. The author might have been concerned about the effectiveness of her condom, but without evidence of it being expired or faulty, it's hard to say. \n\nThe girlfriend's friend calling him an asshole might be overreacting, but that doesn't mean the author is in the right. The key is whether he respected her decision. By not using her condom, he might have disregarded her boundaries. However, if her insistence was non-negotiable and he felt pressured, walking away was a valid choice. \n\nBut in terms of responsibility, the author should have used her condom if that was her condition. Refusing could be seen as not respecting her wishes. However, if she was pressuring him into a non-safe situation, leaving was the right move. This is a bit of a gray area. But traditionally, if someone refuses to use a condom, that's a red flag. However, in this case, the author had his own but she insisted on hers. So, maybe the author isn't wrong for prioritizing her method, but if he had a reason to doubt her condom's safety or her intentions, he might be right. But the story doesn't mention any issues with her condoms. So, the author's choice to leave might be justified, but not using her condom could be seen as not respecting her consent. Hmm. This is tricky. I think the answer leans towards B, No, because he left when she refused to use his, so he didn't proceed without her consent. Wait, but he had his own, but she refused. Did he actually have sex without using her condom? No, he left. So he didn't proceed. Therefore, he's not in the wrong for not using her condom because he didn't engage in the activity without mutual agreement. So B.\n"
