Of course I came prepared with a Trojan fresh out the box popped into my pocket. I get there and you know blah blah happens and eventually I pull the condom out before insertion. She says \u201cno no, there\u2019s no need, I have some\u201d but I say I already have it and start unwrapping it. Here\u2019s where she gets persistent. She hops up and says \u201cNo we\u2019re using mine,\u201d and says she won\u2019t let me until we use one she had. Now she had mentioned wanting kids soon, like in 2 months soon, but thought we\u2019d just maybe mess around for a week or two and that\u2019d be it. I thought nothing of it originally and honestly now I was scared. I said \u201cno, why\u2019re you so persistent.\u201d She then states that if I wasn\u2019t to use hers, I might as well leave. So I put on my clothes, did the ol\u2019 reliable waistband tuck, though there wasn\u2019t much to tuck at this point. I now was texted by her friend calling me an asshole and making a big deal out of nothing. I am starting to get second thoughts and thought I should\u2019ve went along\n\nTL;DR: girl wouldn\u2019t let me use my own condom, said i couldn\u2019t smash until I used hers\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The situation is about a condom disagreement with his girlfriend. He brought his own condom, but she insisted on using hers. He refused and left.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The girl mentioned wanting kids soon, so maybe she's not on birth control and using her own condoms for pregnancy prevention. But the guy had his own, so why the insistence on hers? Maybe there's a trust issue or she prefers her brand. However, the user left because she wouldn't let him use his own, which seems like a big deal.\n\nIn terms of consent and safety, both parties should agree on the method of protection. The guy brought his own, which is responsible. However, the girl didn't want to use his, which might be her choice. But forcing him to use hers without compromise could be an issue. If he's uncomfortable with that, he's within his right to leave. But if she felt pressured into not using her own, maybe there's a problem there too.\n\nThe main points: He had his own, she wanted hers. He refused to use hers, so he left. The friend called him an asshole. The user is unsure if he was wrong. \n\nIn terms of right or wrong, it's a bit of a gray area. Both should communicate and agree. If she's insistent and he's not willing to compromise, maybe he's not wrong to leave. But if he was dismissive of her needs (like her wanting to use her own for planning pregnancy), then he might be wrong. However, the story mentions she mentioned wanting kids soon but thought they'd just mess around. Maybe he was confused about her intentions. \n\nSince he left when she wouldn't let him use his own, and she's the one who set the condition, maybe she's at fault for being inflexible. But if he was okay with using hers but she was pushing for hers, then he's not wrong. The key is mutual agreement. If he didn't agree to her terms, he's not wrong to leave. So answer B, he's not in the wrong.\n"
