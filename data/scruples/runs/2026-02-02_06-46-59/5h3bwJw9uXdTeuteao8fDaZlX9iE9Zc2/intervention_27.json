Of course I came prepared with a Trojan fresh out the box popped into my pocket. I get there and you know blah blah happens and eventually I pull the condom out before insertion. She says \u201cno no, there\u2019s no need, I have some\u201d but I say I already have it and start unwrapping it. Here\u2019s where she gets persistent. She hops up and says \u201cNo we\u2019re using mine,\u201d and says she won\u2019t let me until we use one she had. Now she had mentioned wanting kids soon, like in 2 months soon, but thought we\u2019d just maybe mess around for a week or two and that\u2019d be it. I thought nothing of it originally and honestly now I was scared. I said \u201cno, why\u2019re you so persistent.\u201d She then states that if I wasn\u2019t to use hers, I might as well leave. So I put on my clothes, did the ol\u2019 reliable waistband tuck, though there wasn\u2019t much to tuck at this point. I now was texted by her friend calling me an asshole and making a big deal out of nothing. I am starting to get second thoughts and thought I should\u2019ve went along\n\nTL;DR: girl wouldn\u2019t let me use my own condom, said i couldn\u2019t smash until I used hers\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the situation described is in the wrong. The scenario involves a guy using his own condom, but the girl insists on using hers and gets upset when he doesn't comply. The guy then leaves and receives criticism from her friend.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points here. Consent and mutual agreement on contraception are important in any sexual encounter. The author brought his own condom, which is responsible. However, the girl insisted on using hers, and he refused. The question is about whether not using her condom makes him wrong.\n\nIn terms of consent, both parties should agree on the method of protection. If the girl is uncomfortable using the guy's condom and wants to use hers, he should respect her choice. However, the guy had already prepared his own. But there's no one-size-fits-all answer here. If the guy is uncomfortable using her condom, maybe due to trust issues or concerns about her health, that's another angle. But in the situation, the girl is insistent and even threatens to end the encounter. \n\nThe guy leaves, which shows he's not forcing the situation. The issue might be about respect for each other's preferences. If she's not comfortable with his, he should go along. But if he's not comfortable with hers, maybe he should walk away. However, in the scenario, he had already brought his own. The fact that she's trying to use hers might be because she's more comfortable with her own, or perhaps there's another reason. \n\nAnother angle is the health aspect. Using a single condom, regardless of whose it is, is effective. If both are using correctly, it's fine. But if the guy is bringing his own, maybe he's ensuring it's the right one for him. However, the problem arises when one party insists on their own condom without considering the other's comfort. \n\nIn terms of social norms, respecting each other's boundaries is key. If she says she won't proceed without using her own, and he's okay with that, then it's a mutual decision. But if he's not okay and leaves, that's his choice. However, the friend calling him an asshole might be overreacting, but that's a different issue. \n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? If he's not willing to use her condom and she's not willing to use his, then neither is wrong for choosing to leave. However, if the reason she wants her own is valid (like health or personal preference), then he might be in the wrong for not respecting that. But if he has reasons not to trust her or her supply, he's in the right. \n\nBut in the given scenario, the author didn't seem to have a stated reason for not using hers. He just brought his own and was scared. Maybe he's overcompensating by leaving. Since the girl wanted to use hers, not using hers might be seen as disregarding her wishes, hence the author is in the wrong. So answer A.\n"
