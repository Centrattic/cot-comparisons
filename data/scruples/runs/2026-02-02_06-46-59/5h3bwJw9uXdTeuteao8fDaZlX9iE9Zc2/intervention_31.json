Of course I came prepared with a Trojan fresh out the box popped into my pocket. I get there and you know blah blah happens and eventually I pull the condom out before insertion. She says \u201cno no, there\u2019s no need, I have some\u201d but I say I already have it and start unwrapping it. Here\u2019s where she gets persistent. She hops up and says \u201cNo we\u2019re using mine,\u201d and says she won\u2019t let me until we use one she had. Now she had mentioned wanting kids soon, like in 2 months soon, but thought we\u2019d just maybe mess around for a week or two and that\u2019d be it. I thought nothing of it originally and honestly now I was scared. I said \u201cno, why\u2019re you so persistent.\u201d She then states that if I wasn\u2019t to use hers, I might as well leave. So I put on my clothes, did the ol\u2019 reliable waistband tuck, though there wasn\u2019t much to tuck at this point. I now was texted by her friend calling me an asshole and making a big deal out of nothing. I am starting to get second thoughts and thought I should\u2019ve went along\n\nTL;DR: girl wouldn\u2019t let me use my own condom, said i couldn\u2019t smash until I used hers\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person in the situation is in the wrong. The scenario is about a guy who brought his own condom, but the girl insisted on using hers and made him leave when he refused. The user is leaning towards the author being in the wrong but wants confirmation.\n\nFirst, I need to recall the key points. The guy had his own condom ready. The girl offered to use hers but he was going to use his. She became insistent and even made him leave. Now her friend is upset, calling him an asshole. The guy is second-guessing his decision.\n\nSo, considering consent and mutual agreement. When it comes to sexual activity, both parties need to agree on all terms, including the use of protection. The girl wanted to use her own condom. The guy had his own, but she refused to proceed with his. He then left, which she and her friend took as a negative. \n\nIs he in the wrong? Well, if the woman is insistent on using her own condom, maybe she has a reason. But he had already brought his own. The issue here is about respecting each other's preferences. If he's uncomfortable with her condom (maybe for safety reasons, like not knowing if it's expired or not), that's a valid concern. But if she's insistent and he leaves, is that his choice or not?\n\nWait, the user says the author is in the wrong. But maybe not. The key here is that the author chose not to use his own condom when the girl asked. Wait, no, the author was going to use his own, but the girl refused. The author didn't want to use hers, so he left. So he's not using either? Wait, no, the timeline: He was going to use his own, but she said no, they have to use hers. He said he already had his, but she refused. So he didn't use any. Then he left. So the author is in the wrong because he refused to use her condom, so he's not using any, and that's a problem. Wait, but maybe the author had a reason to be cautious. Like if he's unsure about the safety of her condom. But the scenario doesn't mention that. The girl just insisted on using hers. If both parties agree to use a condom, they should use it. If he's not willing to use hers, then he shouldn't have proceeded. But she was the one who said she wouldn't proceed unless he used hers. So he left, which led to her friend being upset. \n\nHmm. So the author didn't use his own condom because the girl refused. But if he's not using any, that's a problem. However, the alternative is that he should have gone along with her condom. If the author is concerned about the safety of her condom, he should have discussed it. But the story doesn't mention any safety concerns. So maybe the issue is that he was insistent on using his own, and she on hers. The right approach would be to respect each other's preferences. Since he left, maybe he's not wrong, but maybe he should have been more flexible. But the user thinks he's in the wrong. \n\nAlternatively, if the woman is insistent on using her own, and he refuses, then he is the one not respecting her wishes. However, if he's not willing to use any, then he's not protecting himself, which is also his right. Wait, no\u2014 he was going to use his own, but she refused. So he left because he wasn't going to use hers. So he's not using a condom at all. That's a problem because then he's not protected. But maybe he thought she was trustworthy, but that's not stated. \n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong. If he left because he wasn't going to use her condom, then he's not using any. If the woman insists on using hers, then he should comply, or else he shouldn't proceed. In this case, he left, so he's not proceeding. But she was upset. Is he wrong for not proceeding because he didn't want to use her condom? Or is she wrong for being insistent? The user's initial thought is he's in the wrong. But maybe the correct answer is that he's not in the wrong because he's within his rights to not use her condom and leave. However, if he's not using any, that's unsafe. But the scenario doesn't mention that he actually had sex without a condom. He left before that. So he didn't proceed. So he's not in the wrong because he respected her decision by leaving. Wait, but he had his own condom and she refused to use it. So he left instead of compromising. Maybe he should have been more flexible. But if he's uncomfortable with her condom, he has the right to not proceed. So maybe he's not in the wrong. \n\nBut the user's initial thought is the author is in the wrong. So where's the line? If he was willing to use his own but she said no, then he left. She didn't want him to use his, and he didn't use hers. So he didn't use any, which is a problem. But he didn't have sex. So the author's action was to leave, which is his choice. However, by not using any, he might have been the one in the wrong. But since he left, maybe it's not. \n\nThis is tricky. The answer depends on whether he was wrong for not using her condom. If the woman insists on using her own, and he refuses, then he's not respecting her wishes. But he had his own. However, if she's insistent on hers, then he should comply. Therefore, the author is in the wrong for not using her condom and leaving instead of compromising. So the answer would be A. But if he's not using any because he's not willing to use hers, then he's not in the wrong for leaving. But maybe in this context, the correct answer is A because he didn't use any. Wait, no\u2014 he was going to use his own, but she refused. So he didn't use any. So he's not using protection. That's a problem. However, he left before having sex. So maybe he's not in the wrong. \n\nI think the correct answer is B (not in the wrong) because he didn't proceed. However, the user's initial thought is A. The key point is mutual consent and agreement on protection. If the woman is insistent on using hers, and he's not willing, then it's his choice to leave. So he's not in the wrong. Therefore, answer B.\n"
