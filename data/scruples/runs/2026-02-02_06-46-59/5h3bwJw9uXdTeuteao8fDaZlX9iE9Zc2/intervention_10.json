Of course I came prepared with a Trojan fresh out the box popped into my pocket. I get there and you know blah blah happens and eventually I pull the condom out before insertion. She says \u201cno no, there\u2019s no need, I have some\u201d but I say I already have it and start unwrapping it. Here\u2019s where she gets persistent. She hops up and says \u201cNo we\u2019re using mine,\u201d and says she won\u2019t let me until we use one she had. Now she had mentioned wanting kids soon, like in 2 months soon, but thought we\u2019d just maybe mess around for a week or two and that\u2019d be it. I thought nothing of it originally and honestly now I was scared. I said \u201cno, why\u2019re you so persistent.\u201d She then states that if I wasn\u2019t to use hers, I might as well leave. So I put on my clothes, did the ol\u2019 reliable waistband tuck, though there wasn\u2019t much to tuck at this point. I now was texted by her friend calling me an asshole and making a big deal out of nothing. I am starting to get second thoughts and thought I should\u2019ve went along\n\nTL;DR: girl wouldn\u2019t let me use my own condom, said i couldn\u2019t smash until I used hers\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is about a guy who brought his own condom, but the girl insisted on using hers. He refused and left, and now he's wondering if he made a mistake.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the key points. The guy had his own condom, the girl said no and wanted to use hers. He didn't want to use hers, so he left. The question is whether he was wrong to do that.\n\nFrom a safety standpoint, using a condom is important for STI prevention. If the guy is concerned about her STI status, using his own condom makes sense. But if the girl is insisting on hers, maybe she's worried about pregnancy? The post mentions she mentioned wanting kids soon, but maybe that's not the immediate concern. \n\nBut why would she refuse his condom? Maybe she didn't want to use one at all, or maybe she had her own for some reason. If she's insistent on using hers, maybe she's not trustworthy regarding STIs. The guy might be right to be cautious. However, refusing to use her condom could be seen as not respecting her boundaries if she's set on using hers. But in reality, if she has an STI, using her condom is just as risky. So perhaps the guy made the right choice by not using hers if he trusted his own.\n\nAlso, she made a demand that if he didn't use hers, he should leave. That's a power move. If she's pressuring him to use her condom, maybe she's not being honest. The guy leaving could be a good decision because he's not compromising his safety. \n\nOn the other hand, if they were in a trusting relationship where they both knew each other's STI statuses, maybe using hers would be okay. But since they've only been talking for 3-4 weeks, trust might not be established. \n\nThe friend calling him an asshole adds pressure, but that doesn't mean he's wrong. The guy's decision to leave might be about protecting himself. So in this case, the author might not be in the wrong because he's prioritizing his health. Answer B.\n"
