Of course I came prepared with a Trojan fresh out the box popped into my pocket. I get there and you know blah blah happens and eventually I pull the condom out before insertion. She says \u201cno no, there\u2019s no need, I have some\u201d but I say I already have it and start unwrapping it. Here\u2019s where she gets persistent. She hops up and says \u201cNo we\u2019re using mine,\u201d and says she won\u2019t let me until we use one she had. Now she had mentioned wanting kids soon, like in 2 months soon, but thought we\u2019d just maybe mess around for a week or two and that\u2019d be it. I thought nothing of it originally and honestly now I was scared. I said \u201cno, why\u2019re you so persistent.\u201d She then states that if I wasn\u2019t to use hers, I might as well leave. So I put on my clothes, did the ol\u2019 reliable waistband tuck, though there wasn\u2019t much to tuck at this point. I now was texted by her friend calling me an asshole and making a big deal out of nothing. I am starting to get second thoughts and thought I should\u2019ve went along\n\nTL;DR: girl wouldn\u2019t let me use my own condom, said i couldn\u2019t smash until I used hers\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is that he went over to his girlfriend and had a condom in his pocket. She wanted to use her own, and he insisted on using his. She said no and made him leave. Then her friend called him an asshole.\n\nFirst, I need to consider consent and safety. Both parties should agree on the terms of any sexual activity. The guy brought his own condom, which is responsible. But the girl didn't want to use his. Maybe she had a preference, like brand, type, or maybe she wanted to use a specific one for some reason. But he didn't want to use hers. \n\nWait, he mentions she mentioned wanting kids soon. If she's not on birth control, maybe using a condom is important. But if he's not using a condom, that's a risk for pregnancy. But he thought she wanted to just mess around for a week or two. Maybe there's a mismatch in their intentions. \n\nIn terms of consent, if she's not in agreement to proceed without using her condom, then he shouldn't proceed. But he tried to use his, she said no, and he left. So he didn't pressure her. However, he was prepared and willing to use a condom, which is good. But she wanted to use hers. \n\nIs it about the right to choose which condom to use? In a consensual relationship, both should have a say, but there's a mutual agreement needed. If she's not okay with using his, and he's not okay with using hers, then maybe neither should proceed. The fact that he left shows he respected her boundaries to some extent, but he might have felt pressured to leave. \n\nHer friend called him an asshole, which might indicate she thought he was wrong. But maybe the friend was just defending her. \n\nThe key here is mutual consent. If she was adamant about using her own, and he refused, then he wasn't wrong in not using hers, but he also didn't proceed without her consent. However, if using her condom was a condition for her to consent, then not using it could be a problem. But in this case, she said she wouldn't let him proceed unless he used hers. So he didn't use hers, so he left. Therefore, he didn't force anything. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the issue is that he had a condom and brought it, but she wanted to use hers. If he's okay with using hers, then maybe he should have. But since he didn't, maybe he's at fault for not being flexible. But he was prepared, so maybe he's within his right to use his own. \n\nIn terms of STI protection, if they're in a monogamous relationship and both are tested, then maybe it's not an issue. But if they're not, using a condom is important. The article says she wanted to use hers, so maybe she has a reason. \n\nI think the main point is consent. He didn't use hers because he preferred his own, but she wouldn't allow it. Since he left, he didn't proceed without her consent. Therefore, he's not in the wrong. But maybe the problem is that he didn't respect her choice. Wait, if she said no, and he insisted, that's wrong. But in this case, he didn't proceed. So he respected her refusal. \n\nHmm, maybe the answer is B (No), because he didn't force anything and left when she said no. But some might argue that he should have used hers. However, since he had his own and she was making it a condition, maybe he was within his right to not use hers, thus not in the wrong.\n"
