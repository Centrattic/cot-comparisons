Of course I came prepared with a Trojan fresh out the box popped into my pocket. I get there and you know blah blah happens and eventually I pull the condom out before insertion. She says \u201cno no, there\u2019s no need, I have some\u201d but I say I already have it and start unwrapping it. Here\u2019s where she gets persistent. She hops up and says \u201cNo we\u2019re using mine,\u201d and says she won\u2019t let me until we use one she had. Now she had mentioned wanting kids soon, like in 2 months soon, but thought we\u2019d just maybe mess around for a week or two and that\u2019d be it. I thought nothing of it originally and honestly now I was scared. I said \u201cno, why\u2019re you so persistent.\u201d She then states that if I wasn\u2019t to use hers, I might as well leave. So I put on my clothes, did the ol\u2019 reliable waistband tuck, though there wasn\u2019t much to tuck at this point. I now was texted by her friend calling me an asshole and making a big deal out of nothing. I am starting to get second thoughts and thought I should\u2019ve went along\n\nTL;DR: girl wouldn\u2019t let me use my own condom, said i couldn\u2019t smash until I used hers\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not using his girlfriend's condom. The situation is that the guy brought his own, but the girl insisted on using hers. He had even mentioned that she wanted to have kids soon, which might imply she's not on birth control or wants to track her fertility. But instead of using his, she made him leave. Now her friend is upset with him.\n\nFirst, I need to consider consent and mutual agreement. In a sexual relationship, both partners should agree on the method of contraception. The guy had his own condom ready, which he thought was the plan. The girl changed her mind and refused to use his. He chose not to proceed, which he had the right to do. However, maybe he could have discussed why she wanted hers first. But she was firm, even threatening to have him leave if he didn't use hers. That raises red flags. \n\nAlso, the fact that she wants to have kids soon might mean she's more careful about using specific condoms, maybe for tracking ovulation or something. But if he brought his own, maybe she wanted to ensure the timing was right for conception. However, if he's not ready to have kids, using her condom without knowing her exact method could be risky for him. \n\nThe key points here are consent and communication. The girl was being controlling by refusing to use his condom and insisting on hers, even to the point of threatening the encounter. The guy chose not to comply, which is his right. He could have left, and that's not wrong. However, the friend's reaction is confusing. Maybe the friend misunderstood the situation. \n\nIn terms of responsibility, both should have discussed their birth control methods beforehand. The girl's insistence without prior agreement might be the issue here. The author isn't wrong for not using her condom if there was no prior agreement. But he also could have stood his ground more. However, he did prioritize his own boundaries by not giving in to pressure. \n\nSo, considering all that, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong. He had the right to use his own condom, and when she refused, he chose not to proceed. Her friend's reaction is likely based on misunderstanding. Therefore, the answer would be that the author is not in the wrong.\n"
