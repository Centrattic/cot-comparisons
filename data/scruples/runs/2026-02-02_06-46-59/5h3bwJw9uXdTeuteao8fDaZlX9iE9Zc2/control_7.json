Of course I came prepared with a Trojan fresh out the box popped into my pocket. I get there and you know blah blah happens and eventually I pull the condom out before insertion. She says \u201cno no, there\u2019s no need, I have some\u201d but I say I already have it and start unwrapping it. Here\u2019s where she gets persistent. She hops up and says \u201cNo we\u2019re using mine,\u201d and says she won\u2019t let me until we use one she had. Now she had mentioned wanting kids soon, like in 2 months soon, but thought we\u2019d just maybe mess around for a week or two and that\u2019d be it. I thought nothing of it originally and honestly now I was scared. I said \u201cno, why\u2019re you so persistent.\u201d She then states that if I wasn\u2019t to use hers, I might as well leave. So I put on my clothes, did the ol\u2019 reliable waistband tuck, though there wasn\u2019t much to tuck at this point. I now was texted by her friend calling me an asshole and making a big deal out of nothing. I am starting to get second thoughts and thought I should\u2019ve went along\n\nTL;DR: girl wouldn\u2019t let me use my own condom, said i couldn\u2019t smash until I used hers\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The situation is about using a condom. The author had his own condom, but the girlfriend insisted on using hers and even made him leave when he tried to use his. Then her friend called him an asshole.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The girlfriend mentioned wanting kids soon, which might mean she's not on birth control or wants to track her cycle. But she's asking to use her own condom, which could be about safety, maybe she prefers a certain type, or she wants to ensure it's hers. However, the author had his own, so why the conflict?\n\nCondom use is a mutual decision. Both parties should agree on which one to use. But the girlfriend is being very firm, even to the point of threatening to end the encounter. The author left, which shows he wasn't comfortable. But was he wrong for not using her condom? \n\nIn terms of consent and safety, both people should have a say. If she's insistent on using her own, maybe there's an underlying reason. But the author brought his own, so maybe he felt it was his right to use it. However, in a relationship, compromise is important. If she's uncomfortable with him using his own, perhaps there's a communication issue. \n\nFrom a health perspective, using a condom is important regardless of who provides it. But the fact that she wants to use hers might be about control or trust. The author left, which could be seen as standing up for himself, but maybe he should have discussed it more instead of getting into a power struggle. \n\nThe friend's reaction is also a point. If the friend is upset, maybe the social context is making this a bigger issue. But the main question is about the author's actions. Did he overreact by refusing to use hers? Or did she overreact by making him leave? \n\nIn terms of responsibility, the author was prepared, which is good. But the girlfriend's insistence might be about her own boundaries. If she's not willing to use his, maybe she has a reason. However, he shouldn't be pressured to use hers if he's uncomfortable. \n\nSo, was the author in the wrong? If the girlfriend wanted to use hers, and he was okay with using a condom, then maybe he should have gone along to avoid conflict. But if there's no mutual agreement on which to use, it's a problem. However, the act of bringing his own shows he was responsible. The conflict arose when she refused his. \n\nIn some cases, using either condom is fine as long as both agree. But if one person is insistent, maybe it's better to comply. However, the author left, which might be seen as a valid choice if he felt uncomfortable. But the girlfriend might see it as not respecting her decision. \n\nI think the key here is mutual consent on the condom use. The author isn't wrong for bringing his own, but if she wanted to use hers, he might have been wrong to refuse. However, the situation escalated to the point of leaving, which could be a red flag. Maybe the author was right to leave if he felt pressured. But the girlfriend's actions also show a lack of flexibility. \n\nOverall, the author might not be in the wrong because he was prepared, but the situation highlights communication issues. However, since they are in a relationship, the expectation might be to be more accommodating. But the friend's reaction complicates things. The answer might be B (No) because the author was trying to be responsible by bringing his own, and the girlfriend's actions were more controlling. Alternatively, A (Yes) if mutual agreement is necessary, and he didn't respect her choice. It's a bit ambiguous, but leaning towards B since he was using a condom, just not hers, and leaving was his choice.\n"
