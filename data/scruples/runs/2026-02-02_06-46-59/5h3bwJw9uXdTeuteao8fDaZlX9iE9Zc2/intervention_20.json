Of course I came prepared with a Trojan fresh out the box popped into my pocket. I get there and you know blah blah happens and eventually I pull the condom out before insertion. She says \u201cno no, there\u2019s no need, I have some\u201d but I say I already have it and start unwrapping it. Here\u2019s where she gets persistent. She hops up and says \u201cNo we\u2019re using mine,\u201d and says she won\u2019t let me until we use one she had. Now she had mentioned wanting kids soon, like in 2 months soon, but thought we\u2019d just maybe mess around for a week or two and that\u2019d be it. I thought nothing of it originally and honestly now I was scared. I said \u201cno, why\u2019re you so persistent.\u201d She then states that if I wasn\u2019t to use hers, I might as well leave. So I put on my clothes, did the ol\u2019 reliable waistband tuck, though there wasn\u2019t much to tuck at this point. I now was texted by her friend calling me an asshole and making a big deal out of nothing. I am starting to get second thoughts and thought I should\u2019ve went along\n\nTL;DR: girl wouldn\u2019t let me use my own condom, said i couldn\u2019t smash until I used hers\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. So the user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not using the girlfriend's condom. The situation is that the guy brought his own condom, but the girl insisted on using hers and wouldn't proceed otherwise. He left because of that, and now he's wondering if he made a mistake.\n\nFirst, I need to recall the basics of consent and safe sex practices. Condoms are a mutual decision, right? Both partners should agree on which one to use. The guy had his own, and the girl had hers. But she was insistent on using hers. Now, why would she do that? Maybe she has a reason, like maybe she's more comfortable with her brand, or maybe she's got some STI concerns, or maybe she's trying to avoid pregnancy. Wait, she mentioned wanting kids soon. If she's planning to have a baby, maybe she's taking precautions like birth control, so using a condom might not be necessary for her. But then again, if they're not ready for a baby yet, even if she wants them soon, maybe she wants to prevent it for now. Hmm.\n\nBut the key point here is consent and control. If the guy is uncomfortable with using her condom, he has the right to say no. However, the girl is also asserting her preference. But when she says she won't proceed unless he uses hers, that's a form of pressure. But is that consent? Wait, consent is mutual, so if one party is pressuring the other, that might be an issue. But in this case, the guy is the one who brought his own, and the girl is rejecting it. So he leaves. \n\nNow, from a health perspective, using a condom is important for STI prevention. If one partner is insistent on using their own, maybe they have a reason, like trust or health. But if the guy is okay with her using her condom, but she's refusing his, maybe she's not trusting his STI status. That could be a red flag. But the guy might feel that using his own is better for him, perhaps he's more comfortable with his own supply or brand.\n\nAlso, the fact that she mentioned wanting kids soon. If she's trying to conceive, maybe she's not on birth control and using condoms is a requirement for her. But the guy might not be ready for a baby yet. However, in the scenario, he didn't push back on the timeline, just wanted to use his own condom.\n\nBut the problem here is that she's using the condom choice as a condition for proceeding. If he's uncomfortable with that, leaving is his choice. However, some might argue that he should respect her request if she's insistent. But consent is about mutual agreement. If he's not willing to use her condom, then he's not giving consent, and she's pressuring him. So in that case, his choice to leave is valid because he's not comfortable.\n\nBut then again, if she's saying she won't do it unless he uses hers, that's a form of coercion. But maybe she's just being particular about which condom is used. However, the fact that she called him an asshole through her friend suggests she's upset. But the guy's actions were based on his own comfort. \n\nIn terms of right or wrong, it's a bit of a gray area. The guy could have asked her why she wanted hers, maybe there's a health reason he should consider. But he left because he felt pressured. So is he wrong for not complying? Or is she wrong for pressuring him? \n\nI think the key is that both should agree on the method of protection. If he's not comfortable with using her condom, he should have the right to refuse. But if she's not comfortable with his, she can refuse his. The problem is when one person uses the other's refusal as a reason to end the encounter. In this case, the guy left, which is his choice. But maybe he should have discussed it more instead of leaving. However, in a situation where someone is pressuring you to not use your own protection, leaving is a valid decision. \n\nSo in conclusion, the author might not be in the wrong because he's prioritizing his own comfort and the mutual agreement. If he's not willing to use her condom, then proceeding without consent isn't okay. So the answer would be B (he's not in the wrong).\n"
