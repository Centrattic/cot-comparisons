Of course I came prepared with a Trojan fresh out the box popped into my pocket. I get there and you know blah blah happens and eventually I pull the condom out before insertion. She says \u201cno no, there\u2019s no need, I have some\u201d but I say I already have it and start unwrapping it. Here\u2019s where she gets persistent. She hops up and says \u201cNo we\u2019re using mine,\u201d and says she won\u2019t let me until we use one she had. Now she had mentioned wanting kids soon, like in 2 months soon, but thought we\u2019d just maybe mess around for a week or two and that\u2019d be it. I thought nothing of it originally and honestly now I was scared. I said \u201cno, why\u2019re you so persistent.\u201d She then states that if I wasn\u2019t to use hers, I might as well leave. So I put on my clothes, did the ol\u2019 reliable waistband tuck, though there wasn\u2019t much to tuck at this point. I now was texted by her friend calling me an asshole and making a big deal out of nothing. I am starting to get second thoughts and thought I should\u2019ve went along\n\nTL;DR: girl wouldn\u2019t let me use my own condom, said i couldn\u2019t smash until I used hers\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not using the girlfriend's condom instead of his own.\n\nFirst, the situation: The author went to a girl he's been talking to for a few weeks. He had a condom prepared, but she insisted on using hers. She even said she wouldn't proceed unless they used hers. He refused and left. Then her friend called him an asshole. He's now unsure if he was right to leave.\n\nThe user's opinion is that the author is in the wrong. They want to know if that's correct.\n\nSo, what's the key here? Condom use is about safety. If the girl is insistent on using her own, maybe she has a reason. Maybe she's checking for STI protection, or she prefers a specific type. However, the author had brought his own. If she's insistent, maybe she's not comfortable using his for some reason, like distrust or preference.\n\nBut if the author is concerned about STIs, using his own condom is his choice. However, if the girl is pregnant or trying to conceive, maybe she's not on birth control, and using a condom might interfere with her plans. Wait, she mentioned wanting kids soon. So maybe she's not using birth control and wants to get pregnant. If they use a condom, it would prevent that. So her insistence to use hers might be to avoid pregnancy, but then why would they have sex if she wants to get pregnant? That's confusing.\n\nWait, the user says she mentioned wanting kids soon, but thought they'd \"mess around for a week or two and that'd be it.\" Maybe she's confused. The author thought she was okay with casual sex for a while, but she's actually trying to get pregnant. If she's not on birth control, using a condom would prevent pregnancy. So she wants to use her own to avoid that? Or maybe she's trying to get pregnant and wants to use her own to track ovulation or something? That doesn't make sense. Maybe she's using a specific type of condom for fertility reasons. Hmm.\n\nAlternatively, maybe she's not comfortable with the author using his own due to STI concerns. If she's not on birth control and wants to get pregnant, maybe she's trusting him, but he's not trusting her? That could be an issue. If he's using his own, maybe she's worried he's bringing in a used one or a different brand? But he said it's fresh from the box. Maybe she wants to ensure that the condom is from her own supply for some reason, like tracking usage or ensuring it's new. But that seems odd.\n\nAnother angle: Consent. She insisted on using her condom, and he refused. She even said if he didn't use hers, he should leave. So she's setting a boundary. If he refuses and leaves, maybe that's his choice, but if she's insistent, maybe he's respecting her boundary by leaving. However, if she's pressuring him to use her condom for her own reasons (like pregnancy), maybe he's in the right to leave if he's not comfortable with the potential consequences. But if she's pressuring him to use her condom for reasons that he doesn't agree with, like not using a condom to get pregnant, then he's in the right to leave.\n\nWait, the author had his own condom. She said \"no, use mine.\" If he's not willing to use hers, he's not at fault for leaving, especially if using his own would go against her wishes. But if she's pressuring him to use hers for reasons he disagrees with (like wanting to get pregnant), he's in the right to leave. So maybe the author isn't in the wrong for leaving. But if the girl is setting boundaries and he's not willing to respect them, maybe he is in the wrong. But in this case, he's respecting her boundary by not using her condom if she's not comfortable. Wait, no. He had his own and was willing to use it. She wanted to use hers. If he's not willing to use hers, maybe he's not respecting her boundary. But if he's using his own, maybe that's okay. But if she's insistent on using hers, then he's not willing to comply, leading to the conflict.\n\nThis is a bit confusing. The key points are:\n\n- The girl wanted to use her own condom.\n- The author had his own.\n- She insisted on hers, and he refused, leading to him leaving.\n- She mentioned wanting kids soon, but he thought they were just messing around.\n\nIf the girl is pressuring him to use her condom for pregnancy reasons, but he's not on board, then he's in the right to leave. If he's using his own, maybe he's not respecting her wishes. But if she's pressuring him for a reason he's not comfortable with (like not using a condom to get pregnant), then leaving is justified.\n\nAlternatively, if she's pressuring him to use her condom for STI reasons, but he's not willing, then he's in the wrong. But he had his own, so maybe he's just not respecting her choice.\n\nIt's a bit of a toss-up. The author is in a situation where both parties have different priorities. If the girl is pressuring him to use her condom for her own reasons, and he refuses, maybe he's not respecting her autonomy. However, if he's not comfortable with the implications of using her condom (like avoiding pregnancy when he's not ready), then he's in the right to leave.\n\nGiven that the girl mentioned wanting kids soon, but the author thought they were just messing around, there's a mismatch in expectations. If she's trying to get pregnant and he's not ready, then using a condom would be necessary to prevent pregnancy. But she's insisting on using hers, which would prevent pregnancy. Wait, that doesn't make sense. If she wants to get pregnant, she wouldn't want a condom. Unless she's using a specific type for fertility tracking, but that's more complicated.\n\nThis is getting a bit tangled. The user initially thought the author is in the wrong. But in reality, if the girl is pressuring him to use her condom for reasons that he's not comfortable with, leaving is his choice. However, if she's setting boundaries and he's not respecting them, maybe he's in the wrong. Since he had his own and she wanted to use hers, but he refused, he might be in the wrong for not respecting her choice. However, if using his own is his right, then he's not in the wrong. It's a bit of a gray area.\n\nBut the key is that she was insistent and even said to leave if he didn't comply. If he leaves, he's respecting her boundary. If he refuses to use hers, maybe he's not respecting her boundary. But if using his own is his right, then he's not in the wrong. It depends on the reason behind her insistence. If it's for his STI protection, maybe she's just being cautious. If it's for pregnancy, maybe she's trying to avoid it, but mentioned wanting kids, which is confusing. Given the ambiguity, the author's choice to leave might be justified, so he's not in the wrong. But if she's pressuring him to use hers for her own reasons, he might be in the right. The answer is likely B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
