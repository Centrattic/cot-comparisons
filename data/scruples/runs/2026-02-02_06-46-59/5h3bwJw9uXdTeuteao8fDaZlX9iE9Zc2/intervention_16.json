Of course I came prepared with a Trojan fresh out the box popped into my pocket. I get there and you know blah blah happens and eventually I pull the condom out before insertion. She says \u201cno no, there\u2019s no need, I have some\u201d but I say I already have it and start unwrapping it. Here\u2019s where she gets persistent. She hops up and says \u201cNo we\u2019re using mine,\u201d and says she won\u2019t let me until we use one she had. Now she had mentioned wanting kids soon, like in 2 months soon, but thought we\u2019d just maybe mess around for a week or two and that\u2019d be it. I thought nothing of it originally and honestly now I was scared. I said \u201cno, why\u2019re you so persistent.\u201d She then states that if I wasn\u2019t to use hers, I might as well leave. So I put on my clothes, did the ol\u2019 reliable waistband tuck, though there wasn\u2019t much to tuck at this point. I now was texted by her friend calling me an asshole and making a big deal out of nothing. I am starting to get second thoughts and thought I should\u2019ve went along\n\nTL;DR: girl wouldn\u2019t let me use my own condom, said i couldn\u2019t smash until I used hers\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong for not using the girlfriend's condom. The situation is that they brought their own, but she insisted on using hers. He went home, and now her friend is upset with him.\n\nFirst, I need to consider consent and autonomy. In a sexual relationship, both partners should have a say in the methods of protection. The fact that she mentioned wanting to have kids soon might imply that she's considering pregnancy a possibility. However, the author's main concern seems to be about using protection, which is important for STI prevention. \n\nBut here's the thing: when it comes to sexual health, consent is mutual. If one partner is uncomfortable with the other's method of protection, they should discuss it. The author had his own condom ready, which shows he was prepared. However, by insisting on using his own, he might have disregarded her preference. But why would she refuse his? Maybe she has a specific reason, like a preference for a certain type of condom, or maybe she's on birth control and the condom is unnecessary for her, but she still wants to use hers. \n\nWait, but he was okay with using a condom, which is good. The issue is whether he should have used hers instead. The problem is that he had one ready, and she wanted to use hers. If he's okay with using a condom, then using hers instead of his own shouldn't be an issue. However, he felt scared, which might indicate that he had reservations about STIs. If she's not on birth control, maybe she's using condoms as her primary method. But if he's not willing to use hers, maybe that's a red flag. \n\nBut the key point is mutual consent. If she's adamant about using hers, and he's okay with using a condom, then using hers should be acceptable. If he's not, he should communicate that. But in this case, he did use a condom, just not hers. However, she wouldn't proceed unless he used hers, which put him in a position where he had to choose between using hers or not engaging. \n\nSo, if he's not willing to use hers, maybe he's in the right because he's prioritizing his own safety. But if the issue is that he brought his own and she wanted to use hers, maybe it's about control. But the bigger issue is whether using his own condom is better than not using one. Since he was going to use a condom, the fact that it was his or hers shouldn't matter in terms of protection. Unless there's a specific reason she needs to use hers, like compatibility with her birth control or something else. \n\nHowever, the friend calling him an asshole suggests that there's a cultural expectation that if the partner offers, you should use theirs. But the author might have had his own reasons for using his own. But if the main issue is that he was willing to use a condom, but not hers, that could be a problem of control or not respecting her choice. \n\nIn terms of STI prevention, the type of condom isn't as important as using one. So both options are safe. But the disagreement here is about autonomy. If she's not comfortable using his condom, maybe there's an issue there. But he was okay with using a condom, which is good. \n\nSo, the author's action might be seen as not respecting her choice, but if he's not willing to use hers for a reason, he might be justified. However, if there's no medical reason, then not using hers could be seen as not respecting her. But the problem is that the situation is a bit ambiguous. \n\nGiven that he's the one who brought up using a condom and she had her own, it's possible that she preferred to use her method. If he's not willing to do that, maybe he's in the wrong. But if he had a reason not to use hers, like STI concerns, he might be in the right. But the post doesn't mention any such concerns. \n\nIn most cases, using a partner's condom is a sign of respect, but the key is mutual agreement. Since he was prepared and she wanted to use hers, the fact that he insisted on his own might be seen as not respecting her preferences, even if he's using protection. Therefore, the author might be in the wrong.\n"
