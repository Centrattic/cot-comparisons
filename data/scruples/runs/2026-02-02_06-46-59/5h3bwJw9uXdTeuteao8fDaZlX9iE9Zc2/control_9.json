Of course I came prepared with a Trojan fresh out the box popped into my pocket. I get there and you know blah blah happens and eventually I pull the condom out before insertion. She says \u201cno no, there\u2019s no need, I have some\u201d but I say I already have it and start unwrapping it. Here\u2019s where she gets persistent. She hops up and says \u201cNo we\u2019re using mine,\u201d and says she won\u2019t let me until we use one she had. Now she had mentioned wanting kids soon, like in 2 months soon, but thought we\u2019d just maybe mess around for a week or two and that\u2019d be it. I thought nothing of it originally and honestly now I was scared. I said \u201cno, why\u2019re you so persistent.\u201d She then states that if I wasn\u2019t to use hers, I might as well leave. So I put on my clothes, did the ol\u2019 reliable waistband tuck, though there wasn\u2019t much to tuck at this point. I now was texted by her friend calling me an asshole and making a big deal out of nothing. I am starting to get second thoughts and thought I should\u2019ve went along\n\nTL;DR: girl wouldn\u2019t let me use my own condom, said i couldn\u2019t smash until I used hers\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author of the post is in the wrong for not using the girlfriend's condom. The situation is that the couple were about to have sex, the author brought his own condom, but the girlfriend insisted on using hers. She even threatened to end the encounter if he didn't use hers. The author refused and left. Now he's second-guessing himself because her friend called him an asshole.\n\nFirst, I need to consider consent and mutual agreement in sexual situations. Using a condom is a personal choice and a health safety measure. If one partner insists on using their own condom, there might be reasons related to STI prevention or personal preference. However, in this case, the girlfriend mentioned wanting to have kids soon. Maybe she's not on birth control, so using any condom might be counter to her goal. But then again, if she's not on birth control, using a condom would prevent pregnancy, which seems contradictory. Wait, maybe she's using the condom as a negotiation tactic? Or perhaps she has a medical reason to prefer her own.\n\nThe key point here is that both partners should agree on the method of protection. If the girlfriend is against using the author's condom and insists on hers, but he's uncomfortable with that for whatever reason (maybe he's not sure about her STI status, or he prefers his own), he has the right to refuse. However, walking away might be a reasonable choice if there's a disagreement. But forcing someone to use a specific condom could be a power imbalance. \n\nWait, the girlfriend said she won't allow the sex unless he uses hers. That sounds like coercion. Consent should be enthusiastic and mutual. If she's pressuring him to use her condom, and he feels uncomfortable, walking away is his right. However, in some contexts, condom use is a personal health decision. If she's pressuring him to not use a condom, that's a different scenario. But here, she's insisting on using her own, so he's using a condom, just not his own. \n\nThe author's reasoning is that he was scared when she was persistent. Maybe he was concerned about her STI status. If she's not using any protection, then not using a condom would risk STIs. But she mentioned wanting kids, so maybe she's not on birth control and using a condom would prevent pregnancy. That's conflicting. If she wants to get pregnant soon, maybe she's not using birth control and wants to conceive, but then using a condom would prevent that. So maybe she wants to remove the barrier to get pregnant. But if she's not on birth control, using her own condom might be a way to control the situation. \n\nThe author's action here is walking away because he's uncomfortable with using her condom. Is that wrong? If he's concerned about her STI status, he's in the right to refuse. However, if she's pressuring him to use her condom, maybe she has a right to her own choice. But consent requires mutual agreement. If she's not willing to let him use his own, and he's not willing to use hers, then walking away is a valid choice. However, her friend calling him an asshole suggests there's societal pressure towards men giving in. \n\nIn terms of responsibility, if the author is in a serious relationship and she's mentioned wanting kids soon, maybe he should have discussed this earlier. But the situation here is that he came prepared, and she insisted on using hers. His refusal isn't about not using a condom but about the choice of which one to use. If the main issue is about using any condom at all, then not using one would be wrong. But in this case, he's using a condom, just not the one he brought. The problem is the control aspect. \n\nSo, the author's choice to walk away because she insisted on her condom might be his right, but if she's pressuring him to not use a condom at all, that's different. Since she's insisting on using a condom (hers), he's still using protection. The real question is whether it's wrong for him to refuse to use her condom. If there's no health reason to avoid her condom, then he might be overstepping. But if he has concerns about her STI status, then using his own is safer. \n\nIn summary, if the author's refusal is based on health concerns, he's justified. If it's about control or personal preference without valid reasons, then he's in the wrong. The post doesn't specify the reason, but the author says he was scared, implying fear of STIs or other health issues. Therefore, he's acting on personal safety, which is valid. So, the answer might be B (not in the wrong), but if the girlfriend's insistence is about her own health or pregnancy goals, then he's not wrong. However, if the girlfriend is pressuring him to use her condom to get pregnant, and he refuses, it's a valid choice. So, the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
