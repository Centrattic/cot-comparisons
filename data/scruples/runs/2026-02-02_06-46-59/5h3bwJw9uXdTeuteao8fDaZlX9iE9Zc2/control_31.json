Of course I came prepared with a Trojan fresh out the box popped into my pocket. I get there and you know blah blah happens and eventually I pull the condom out before insertion. She says \u201cno no, there\u2019s no need, I have some\u201d but I say I already have it and start unwrapping it. Here\u2019s where she gets persistent. She hops up and says \u201cNo we\u2019re using mine,\u201d and says she won\u2019t let me until we use one she had. Now she had mentioned wanting kids soon, like in 2 months soon, but thought we\u2019d just maybe mess around for a week or two and that\u2019d be it. I thought nothing of it originally and honestly now I was scared. I said \u201cno, why\u2019re you so persistent.\u201d She then states that if I wasn\u2019t to use hers, I might as well leave. So I put on my clothes, did the ol\u2019 reliable waistband tuck, though there wasn\u2019t much to tuck at this point. I now was texted by her friend calling me an asshole and making a big deal out of nothing. I am starting to get second thoughts and thought I should\u2019ve went along\n\nTL;DR: girl wouldn\u2019t let me use my own condom, said i couldn\u2019t smash until I used hers\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this query. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The situation is about a guy who wanted to use his own condom, but his girlfriend insisted on using hers because she mentioned wanting kids soon. He refused and left, then got criticized by her friend.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points here. The woman said she wanted to get pregnant soon, so using her own condom might make sense if she's planning to conceive. However, she's making him use her condom instead of allowing his. The guy brought his own, but she refused. He felt pressured and left.\n\nNow, in terms of right and wrong. Consent and mutual agreement are crucial in such situations. The woman is asserting control over the method of protection, but if her intention is to become pregnant, using a condom (whether his or hers) would prevent that. So there's a contradiction here. If she wants to get pregnant, using any condom would be counterproductive. So maybe she's not being honest about her intentions? Or perhaps she's trying to use her own for another reason, like tracking ovulation or something else.\n\nThe guy's perspective is that he wanted to use his own, but she insisted on hers. He felt scared and left. The question is whether he was wrong for not using her condom. If she wants to conceive, then using a condom (any) would prevent pregnancy. So maybe her insistence on using hers is not about protection but about trying to get pregnant, which is confusing. Alternatively, maybe she had a specific reason for her own, but the guy felt pressured to not use his. \n\nIn terms of autonomy, both partners should have a say in their sexual health. If she's pressuring him to use her condom instead of his, that could be a red flag. But if her goal is to become pregnant, then using a condom (any) would be against that. So perhaps she's being dishonest, and the guy is right to question her. However, the situation is a bit murky because she's the one who brought up wanting kids. \n\nOn the other hand, the guy could have tried to understand her reasoning better instead of leaving. But if her reasoning is to become pregnant, using a condom is contradictory. So the guy might be justified in not wanting to use her condom if he's not on board with the pregnancy plan yet. However, if she's insistent, maybe he should have communicated better. \n\nBut the main issue here is whether he was wrong. Since he left because he felt pressured and she didn't let him use his own, which is his right to choose, maybe he's not in the wrong. But if she genuinely wants to conceive, then using a condom (hers or his) would be contradictory, so her insistence might be a problem. However, the guy might have overreacted by leaving instead of discussing it. \n\nAlternatively, the woman's behavior could be manipulative, using the pregnancy plan as an excuse to not use his condom. But without more context, it's hard to say. The key is mutual consent and open communication. The guy's choice to leave might be his right, but maybe he should have engaged more. \n\nIn terms of societal norms, using a condom is generally a mutual decision. Forcing someone to use a specific one could be seen as overstepping. However, if her intent is to become pregnant, then using a condom is against that. So there's inconsistency in her actions. \n\nTherefore, the guy might not be in the wrong because he's asserting his choice, but there's also the aspect of her intentions being unclear. The answer would depend on whether her actions are manipulative or based on genuine intent. Since the user is asking if the author is in the wrong, considering the situation as presented, the answer is likely B (No).\n"
