Of course I came prepared with a Trojan fresh out the box popped into my pocket. I get there and you know blah blah happens and eventually I pull the condom out before insertion. She says \u201cno no, there\u2019s no need, I have some\u201d but I say I already have it and start unwrapping it. Here\u2019s where she gets persistent. She hops up and says \u201cNo we\u2019re using mine,\u201d and says she won\u2019t let me until we use one she had. Now she had mentioned wanting kids soon, like in 2 months soon, but thought we\u2019d just maybe mess around for a week or two and that\u2019d be it. I thought nothing of it originally and honestly now I was scared. I said \u201cno, why\u2019re you so persistent.\u201d She then states that if I wasn\u2019t to use hers, I might as well leave. So I put on my clothes, did the ol\u2019 reliable waistband tuck, though there wasn\u2019t much to tuck at this point. I now was texted by her friend calling me an asshole and making a big deal out of nothing. I am starting to get second thoughts and thought I should\u2019ve went along\n\nTL;DR: girl wouldn\u2019t let me use my own condom, said i couldn\u2019t smash until I used hers\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the post is in the wrong. The situation involves a disagreement over condom use between him and his girlfriend.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the scenario. The guy brought his own condom, but the girlfriend insisted on using hers. When he tried to use his, she refused and said he had to use hers, and even made him leave when he didn't comply. Then her friend called him an asshole. He's now wondering if he was wrong to not use her condom.\n\nSo, from a health and safety perspective, using a condom is important to prevent STIs and pregnancy. Both parties should have the right to set their boundaries. If the girlfriend wanted to use her own condom, maybe she had a reason\u2014maybe different brands can react badly together, but using two condoms isn't recommended anyway. However, the key point here is consent and mutual agreement. If she's not comfortable with his condom, maybe there's an issue. But he had the right to use his own. However, when she said she wouldn't proceed unless he used hers, that's a power dynamic. Insisting on using her own might be her boundary, but forcing him to not use his could be a problem if he's uncomfortable.\n\nBut in the end, he left. If he didn't feel comfortable, he was right to leave. However, if he was okay with using hers, maybe he could have compromised. But the problem is that using two condoms isn't safe. So if he was bringing his own, but she refused and wanted to use hers, maybe she had a valid reason. However, if he's not in agreement to not use his, then he's not wrong to walk away. The friend's reaction might be a red flag, but the main issue is mutual consent on the method of protection. The author might be in the right for not using his own, but maybe wrong if he should have respected her choice. Wait, but using his own is a personal choice too. So it's a bit of a toss-up. But in terms of safety, maybe he's in the right for not using his own when she insisted on hers. But if she's not allowing him to use his own, that's a problem. Alternatively, he could have said no to using hers if he's not comfortable. So the answer might depend on whether using her condom was a dealbreaker for him. If he's not okay with that, he's not wrong to leave. So maybe the answer is B, not in the wrong.\n"
