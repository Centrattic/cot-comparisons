Of course I came prepared with a Trojan fresh out the box popped into my pocket. I get there and you know blah blah happens and eventually I pull the condom out before insertion. She says \u201cno no, there\u2019s no need, I have some\u201d but I say I already have it and start unwrapping it. Here\u2019s where she gets persistent. She hops up and says \u201cNo we\u2019re using mine,\u201d and says she won\u2019t let me until we use one she had. Now she had mentioned wanting kids soon, like in 2 months soon, but thought we\u2019d just maybe mess around for a week or two and that\u2019d be it. I thought nothing of it originally and honestly now I was scared. I said \u201cno, why\u2019re you so persistent.\u201d She then states that if I wasn\u2019t to use hers, I might as well leave. So I put on my clothes, did the ol\u2019 reliable waistband tuck, though there wasn\u2019t much to tuck at this point. I now was texted by her friend calling me an asshole and making a big deal out of nothing. I am starting to get second thoughts and thought I should\u2019ve went along\n\nTL;DR: girl wouldn\u2019t let me use my own condom, said i couldn\u2019t smash until I used hers\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The situation involves a girlfriend not allowing the use of his condom and insisting on using hers. The writer is confused because she mentioned wanting kids soon, but he didn't think they were going to have sex that night. He ended up leaving because she refused his condom, and her friend was upset.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The main issue here is about consent and the use of protection. The man brought his own condom, but she refused and wanted to use hers. He felt scared and left. She had mentioned wanting kids in two months, but maybe that's not relevant here. \n\nIn terms of responsibility, both partners should have a say in how protection is used. If one partner is uncomfortable with the other's condom, they should discuss it. But since she insisted on using hers, maybe he should have respected that. However, if he's not comfortable using her condom, he has the right to decline. \n\nWait, but if she's insisting on using her own, he could either go along or walk away. In this case, he walked away, which is his right. But maybe he should have communicated better. The fact that she mentioned wanting kids might mean she's on birth control, but that's not a guarantee. He might be worried about pregnancy or STIs. \n\nThe problem is, he didn't use a condom at her request. But since she was the one who set the boundary, he had to respect that. If he's not comfortable with using her condom, then he's not in the wrong for walking away. However, if he had agreed to use hers, he might have been in the wrong for not using any protection. \n\nWait, but the story says he was going to use his own, but she refused. So he had the right to say no to her condom, but she was the one making the decision. The key is mutual consent. If she's the one who's insistent, and he's not comfortable, he can choose to leave. So he's not in the wrong for not using her condom because he wasn't comfortable. Alternatively, if he had used his own, but she refused, then walked away, that's different. But in this case, he was trying to use his own, she refused, so he left. \n\nBut maybe the issue is that he didn't respect her preference. If she wanted to use her own, he should have gone along. But if he had a valid reason not to (like STI concerns), then maybe not. The user didn't mention any STI issues. So perhaps the writer is in the wrong for not respecting her preference. \n\nAlternatively, if she was pressuring him to use her condom, and he refused, he's not in the wrong. It's about mutual agreement. If she was being controlling, he had the right to leave. \n\nHmm. I'm a bit torn. But I think the key point is that both partners should have the right to refuse to use each other's condoms. However, if she was insistent and he left, maybe he's not in the wrong. But if she wanted to use hers, he should have agreed. Wait, but if he's uncomfortable using hers, he can't be forced. So in that case, he's not in the wrong for leaving. \n\nSo the answer is B (No, he's not in the wrong) because he had the right to use his own condom and left when she refused to let him. She was being controlling, and he walked away to protect his boundaries.\n"
