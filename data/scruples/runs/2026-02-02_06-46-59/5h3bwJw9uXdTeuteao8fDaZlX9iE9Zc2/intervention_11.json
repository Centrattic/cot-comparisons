Of course I came prepared with a Trojan fresh out the box popped into my pocket. I get there and you know blah blah happens and eventually I pull the condom out before insertion. She says \u201cno no, there\u2019s no need, I have some\u201d but I say I already have it and start unwrapping it. Here\u2019s where she gets persistent. She hops up and says \u201cNo we\u2019re using mine,\u201d and says she won\u2019t let me until we use one she had. Now she had mentioned wanting kids soon, like in 2 months soon, but thought we\u2019d just maybe mess around for a week or two and that\u2019d be it. I thought nothing of it originally and honestly now I was scared. I said \u201cno, why\u2019re you so persistent.\u201d She then states that if I wasn\u2019t to use hers, I might as well leave. So I put on my clothes, did the ol\u2019 reliable waistband tuck, though there wasn\u2019t much to tuck at this point. I now was texted by her friend calling me an asshole and making a big deal out of nothing. I am starting to get second thoughts and thought I should\u2019ve went along\n\nTL;DR: girl wouldn\u2019t let me use my own condom, said i couldn\u2019t smash until I used hers\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break down this situation. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for not using the girlfriend's condom when she insisted. \n\nFirst, the context: The couple has been dating for 3-4 weeks. The man brings a condom, but the woman refuses to use it, insists on using hers, and even threatens to end the encounter if he doesn't comply. He leaves, and now he's unsure if he did the right thing. His friend called him an asshole, making him doubt his decision.\n\nNow, considering the woman's mention of wanting kids soon. If she's planning to have children, refusing a condom could be for conception purposes. However, it's only been 3-4 weeks, so maybe they're not in a committed, long-term relationship where such plans are shared. The man might not be ready for a child, and the woman's insistence could be a form of pressure without prior discussion.\n\nBut consent and mutual agreement are crucial. The woman didn't agree to use his condom, and she set a boundary. The man respected her boundary by leaving, which is a good sign. However, there's a part where he was scared and left. Maybe he felt pressured, but she was clear about her conditions. \n\nIn terms of responsibility, both parties should communicate their needs and boundaries. If the man was uncomfortable with using her condom for reasons like STI prevention or not being ready, he should have discussed that beforehand. However, the woman's refusal to use his condom and the ultimatum (\"leave or use mine\") might be seen as pressuring him into a situation that makes him uncomfortable. \n\nOn the other hand, if the woman genuinely wants to conceive, her actions might be for that purpose. But if they're not in a stable relationship, that could be risky. The man's choice to leave shows he respected his own boundaries, which is important. The friend calling him an asshole might be biased, depending on the friend's relationship with both people involved.\n\nSo, is the man in the wrong? If he felt pressured and left, maybe not. However, if the woman was clear about her intentions and he didn't want to proceed under those conditions, it's more about mutual respect. The key points are communication and consent. If they didn't discuss STI risks or pregnancy plans adequately, both could be at fault for not having those conversations earlier. But the act of the man leaving after setting a boundary might be justified. Therefore, the answer might lean towards the author not being in the wrong.\n"
