Of course I came prepared with a Trojan fresh out the box popped into my pocket. I get there and you know blah blah happens and eventually I pull the condom out before insertion. She says \u201cno no, there\u2019s no need, I have some\u201d but I say I already have it and start unwrapping it. Here\u2019s where she gets persistent. She hops up and says \u201cNo we\u2019re using mine,\u201d and says she won\u2019t let me until we use one she had. Now she had mentioned wanting kids soon, like in 2 months soon, but thought we\u2019d just maybe mess around for a week or two and that\u2019d be it. I thought nothing of it originally and honestly now I was scared. I said \u201cno, why\u2019re you so persistent.\u201d She then states that if I wasn\u2019t to use hers, I might as well leave. So I put on my clothes, did the ol\u2019 reliable waistband tuck, though there wasn\u2019t much to tuck at this point. I now was texted by her friend calling me an asshole and making a big deal out of nothing. I am starting to get second thoughts and thought I should\u2019ve went along\n\nTL;DR: girl wouldn\u2019t let me use my own condom, said i couldn\u2019t smash until I used hers\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is about a guy who brought his own condom, but his girlfriend insisted on using hers. He went ahead and didn't use hers, leading to some conflict.\n\nFirst, I need to recall the key points. The guy had his own condom ready. The girl said she had hers and insisted on using hers. He tried to use his, but she refused. He left, and now he's wondering if he was wrong.\n\nI remember that in matters of sexual health and consent, using a condom is about protection and mutual agreement. If someone is insistent on using their own, there might be reasons. But if the guy was okay with using his own, and she refused, maybe there's a power dynamic here. But also, if she said she has some, maybe she just wanted to use hers for personal reasons. However, forcing someone to use her condom or refusing to engage in a sexual act if they don't comply could be a form of coercion. \n\nOn the other hand, the guy had the right to use his own condom. If she was pressuring him to use hers and even threatening to end the encounter, that's a problem. But in the scenario, the guy says she told him to leave if he didn't use hers. So he left, which is his right. But the friend called him an asshole. Maybe the friend thinks he was wrong to leave despite her demands.\n\nAnother angle: if she was using her own condom, maybe there's an issue with her STI status or pregnancy intentions. The user mentioned she wants kids soon, but he thought they were just messing around. If they're not using protection, that could lead to pregnancy. However, the guy was prepared with his own, so maybe he wants to avoid pregnancy. But she wants to use hers, perhaps because she's on birth control and doesn't need condoms? Or maybe she's not, and she wants to get pregnant. If she's pressuring him to use hers to not use protection, that's a conflict. \n\nIn terms of consent, both parties should agree on the terms of the sexual activity. If she's making it a condition to use her condom, but he's not comfortable using hers (maybe due to STI concerns), then he's within his rights to decline. However, if she's refusing to proceed unless he uses hers, that's a form of pressure. The guy left, which is a valid choice, but maybe the friend is criticizing him for not going along with her wish.\n\nThe key here is mutual consent and safety. If the guy is concerned about STIs and she's not providing a condom that he trusts, he's in the right to prioritize his safety. Alternatively, if she's pressuring him to use hers against his will, that's not okay. The situation depends on why she wanted to use hers. If it's about her own health or pregnancy intentions, that's different. But if she's overriding his choice without valid reasons, he's justified.\n\nSo, is the author wrong? If he left because he didn't want to use hers, and she was pressuring him, then he's not wrong. However, if he was supposed to respect her boundaries (like she has a valid reason for using hers), then maybe he is. But the scenario is a bit unclear. Given the information, the guy made a choice that he felt comfortable with, and leaving is a valid choice when there's coercion.\n"
