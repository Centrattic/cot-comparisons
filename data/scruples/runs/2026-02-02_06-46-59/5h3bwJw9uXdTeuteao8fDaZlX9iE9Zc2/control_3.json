Of course I came prepared with a Trojan fresh out the box popped into my pocket. I get there and you know blah blah happens and eventually I pull the condom out before insertion. She says \u201cno no, there\u2019s no need, I have some\u201d but I say I already have it and start unwrapping it. Here\u2019s where she gets persistent. She hops up and says \u201cNo we\u2019re using mine,\u201d and says she won\u2019t let me until we use one she had. Now she had mentioned wanting kids soon, like in 2 months soon, but thought we\u2019d just maybe mess around for a week or two and that\u2019d be it. I thought nothing of it originally and honestly now I was scared. I said \u201cno, why\u2019re you so persistent.\u201d She then states that if I wasn\u2019t to use hers, I might as well leave. So I put on my clothes, did the ol\u2019 reliable waistband tuck, though there wasn\u2019t much to tuck at this point. I now was texted by her friend calling me an asshole and making a big deal out of nothing. I am starting to get second thoughts and thought I should\u2019ve went along\n\nTL;DR: girl wouldn\u2019t let me use my own condom, said i couldn\u2019t smash until I used hers\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for not using his girlfriend's condom. The situation is that the author brought his own condom, but the girlfriend insisted on using hers and even refused to proceed unless they used hers. The author then decided to leave.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context of consent and mutual agreement in a sexual situation. Using a condom is a personal choice and can be influenced by various factors like health, pregnancy prevention, or personal preference. The girlfriend mentioned wanting kids soon, so maybe she wanted to get pregnant, hence not using a condom. But the author might not be ready for that, which is why he brought his own.\n\nThe key here is whether the author had the right to refuse. If the girlfriend was pressuring him to use her condom and he felt uncomfortable, then he has the right to refuse. However, if the refusal led to a situation where she felt coerced into sex without a condom, that's a problem. But in this case, the author didn't have sex without a condom; he left instead. \n\nAnother angle is the pressure from her friend. The friend's reaction might indicate that the girlfriend's stance was not about her own comfort but maybe peer pressure or other reasons. The author's decision to leave could be seen as respecting his own boundaries, but if the girlfriend was not okay with that, it's a communication issue.\n\nIn terms of right and wrong, it's about mutual consent and respecting each other's boundaries. The author didn't force the situation; he left when he felt pressured. The girlfriend's insistence might have been overstepping if she was pressuring him to not use a condom, which could be a violation of his autonomy. So the author isn't necessarily in the wrong for leaving. However, if there was a prior agreement on using condoms, then not using hers might be an issue. But since the author brought his own and she suddenly changed the plan, it's more about her changing the terms unexpectedly.\n\nSo, considering all that, the answer is B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
