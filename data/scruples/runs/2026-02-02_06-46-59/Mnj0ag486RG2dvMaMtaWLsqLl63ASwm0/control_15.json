I\u2019m not sure of her size but she needs to shop in plus size stores etc. Being 125 lbs, I realize I\u2019m not overweight, but I have insecurities like so many others. By the way, I think my friend looks great! She\u2019s a big girl and she\u2019s absolutely beautiful. The other day we were shopping and I tried on this pair of yoga pants. I complained how my thighs looked large and I needed to lose weight and go to the gym more. She became noticeably upset and confessed that she thinks it\u2019s rude whenever I talk about my body in front of her. She said that because she needs to lose 70 plus pounds it makes her wonder what I think of her and just makes her uncomfortable. I told her she looks great and this wasn\u2019t about her. This was about myself. She asked me not to talk about how I need to lose weight in front of her anymore. Initially I agreed, but now I feel this was an unfair request. And yes, I know, I shouldn\u2019t talk like that anyways. But was I being rude to her when I spoke ill of my own body? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for talking about their own body in front of their overweight friend. The friend got upset because when the author talks about their own weight, the friend starts to think about her own weight issues and feels uncomfortable.\n\nSo, the author is saying they're not overweight themselves (125 lbs) but have insecurities. They were trying on pants and mentioned their thighs and needing to lose weight. The friend, who is in the plus-size category, felt that this made her feel bad about herself because she's dealing with her own weight loss goals. The author tried to reassure the friend, but the friend still asked them to stop talking about their weight around her. The author now feels maybe that was an unfair request.\n\nHmm. The question is whether the author was wrong to talk about their own body. On one hand, the author is talking about their own insecurities, which isn't directly about the friend. But the friend's reaction shows that it's affecting her. Even if the author didn't mean to, their words might have triggered the friend's own body image issues. \n\nI think it's important to consider the impact of one's words, even if they're about oneself. If the friend is sensitive about her weight, then the author's negative self-talk might inadvertently make the friend feel worse. The author might not have intended to hurt her, but the friend clearly felt uncomfortable. \n\nThe friend's request to stop talking about weight around her is a valid boundary. The author might need to respect that, even if they find it unfair. It's about being considerate of others' feelings, even when discussing their own. So maybe the author is in the wrong because their actions (talking about their weight) are causing discomfort to a friend who's already dealing with her own insecurities. \n\nBut then again, the author isn't saying anything negative about the friend. They're talking about themselves. However, the friend's reaction is valid, so the author should adjust their behavior. So the answer might be A, the author is in the wrong because they're causing distress to a friend by bringing up weight issues, even if it's about themselves.\n"
