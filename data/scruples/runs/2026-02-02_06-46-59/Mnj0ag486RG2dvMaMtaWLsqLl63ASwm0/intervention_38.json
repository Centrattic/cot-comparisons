I\u2019m not sure of her size but she needs to shop in plus size stores etc. Being 125 lbs, I realize I\u2019m not overweight, but I have insecurities like so many others. By the way, I think my friend looks great! She\u2019s a big girl and she\u2019s absolutely beautiful. The other day we were shopping and I tried on this pair of yoga pants. I complained how my thighs looked large and I needed to lose weight and go to the gym more. She became noticeably upset and confessed that she thinks it\u2019s rude whenever I talk about my body in front of her. She said that because she needs to lose 70 plus pounds it makes her wonder what I think of her and just makes her uncomfortable. I told her she looks great and this wasn\u2019t about her. This was about myself. She asked me not to talk about how I need to lose weight in front of her anymore. Initially I agreed, but now I feel this was an unfair request. And yes, I know, I shouldn\u2019t talk like that anyways. But was I being rude to her when I spoke ill of my own body? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about a friend who's upset when the author talks about their own body, even though the author isn't overweight. The author is 125 lbs and mentions their thighs looking large, wanting to lose weight. Their friend is plus-sized and feels uncomfortable because she needs to lose 70+ pounds.\n\nSo, the main issue is whether talking negatively about one's own body in front of someone who is larger is inappropriate. The author thinks they're not in the wrong, but the friend is upset. The user initially thinks the author is wrong but wants a second opinion.\n\nHmm. On one hand, the author is expressing their own insecurities, which is a personal issue. But the friend is sensitive because her own weight issues are triggered by the author's comments. Even if the author isn't directly criticizing the friend, the friend interprets it as a reflection on her. The author says it's about themselves, but the friend's reaction suggests it's affecting her. \n\nIn terms of social dynamics, sometimes people's body image issues can be sensitive to others' comments, even if those comments are self-directed. So maybe the author should be more mindful of how their self-talk affects others. The friend is asking them to stop, which is a valid request. The author might not intend to hurt, but the impact is there. So, even if the author is being honest about their feelings, it's about considering the other person's feelings. \n\nI think the key here is empathy. The author needs to understand that their self-criticism can unintentionally make the friend feel worse about herself. Even if it's not about the friend, the context of their friendship and the friend's insecurities make it a problem. So the author might be in the wrong for not respecting the friend's boundaries after being asked to stop. \n\nBut wait, is it the author's responsibility to censor themselves? Or is the friend being overly sensitive? It's tricky. The friend has the right to feel uncomfortable and ask for changes in the friendship. If the author agrees but later feels it's unfair, that's their own adjustment to make. So from the friend's perspective, she's setting a boundary, and the author should honor it even if they don't see the issue. Therefore, the answer might be A (author is in the wrong).\n"
