I\u2019m not sure of her size but she needs to shop in plus size stores etc. Being 125 lbs, I realize I\u2019m not overweight, but I have insecurities like so many others. By the way, I think my friend looks great! She\u2019s a big girl and she\u2019s absolutely beautiful. The other day we were shopping and I tried on this pair of yoga pants. I complained how my thighs looked large and I needed to lose weight and go to the gym more. She became noticeably upset and confessed that she thinks it\u2019s rude whenever I talk about my body in front of her. She said that because she needs to lose 70 plus pounds it makes her wonder what I think of her and just makes her uncomfortable. I told her she looks great and this wasn\u2019t about her. This was about myself. She asked me not to talk about how I need to lose weight in front of her anymore. Initially I agreed, but now I feel this was an unfair request. And yes, I know, I shouldn\u2019t talk like that anyways. But was I being rude to her when I spoke ill of my own body? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. Let me start by understanding the situation. The author is a friend of someone who is overweight. The author is 125 lbs and not overweight, but has body insecurities. The friend is in plus size stores, so she's definitely larger. The author tried on yoga pants and complained about their thighs looking big and needing to lose weight. The friend got upset, saying it's rude for the author to talk about their body in front of her because she needs to lose 70 pounds and it makes her wonder what the author thinks of her. The author told the friend she looks great and it's about themselves, but the friend asked them to stop. The author agreed initially but now feels it was unfair. The question is whether the author was in the wrong.\n\nHmm. The key here is whether talking negatively about one's own body in front of someone else, especially someone who is also dealing with body image issues, is considered rude or not. The author might not think it's about the friend, but the friend is affected by it. The author is 125 lbs, so not overweight, but still has insecurities. The friend is plus-sized and has her own weight loss goals. \n\nWhen someone talks about their own body negatively, even if it's just about themselves, others might take it as a reflection on their own bodies. Especially if they're struggling with similar issues. The friend is sensitive because she's trying to lose weight and the author's comments might trigger her insecurities. Even if the author is not the one who is overweight in this case, their negative self-talk could be making the friend feel judged or worse about herself. \n\nThe friend is asking the author to stop. The author is confused because they thought it was okay to talk about their own body. But maybe they didn't consider how it affects others. The author says they told the friend she looks great, but the friend might still feel that the author's negative comments imply that the author doesn't like their own body, which could lead to the friend thinking the author doesn't like hers either. \n\nIn terms of social norms, it's generally advised to avoid body shaming others, but this is about self-talk. However, even self-talk can affect others. If someone is in a vulnerable position (like the friend here), negative comments from a friend could be hurtful. The author might not have intended to hurt the friend, but the friend's reaction shows that it did. \n\nSo, considering that the friend is uncomfortable and asked the author to stop, and the author's comments are impacting the friend's feelings, the author might be in the wrong. The author should respect the friend's feelings and avoid talking negatively about their body in front of her. Even if it's about themselves, the effect on the friend is real. Therefore, the answer might be A (the author is in the wrong).\n"
