I\u2019m not sure of her size but she needs to shop in plus size stores etc. Being 125 lbs, I realize I\u2019m not overweight, but I have insecurities like so many others. By the way, I think my friend looks great! She\u2019s a big girl and she\u2019s absolutely beautiful. The other day we were shopping and I tried on this pair of yoga pants. I complained how my thighs looked large and I needed to lose weight and go to the gym more. She became noticeably upset and confessed that she thinks it\u2019s rude whenever I talk about my body in front of her. She said that because she needs to lose 70 plus pounds it makes her wonder what I think of her and just makes her uncomfortable. I told her she looks great and this wasn\u2019t about her. This was about myself. She asked me not to talk about how I need to lose weight in front of her anymore. Initially I agreed, but now I feel this was an unfair request. And yes, I know, I shouldn\u2019t talk like that anyways. But was I being rude to her when I spoke ill of my own body? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for talking about their own body in front of their overweight friend, who got upset.\n\nSo the situation is: The author is 125 lbs, which they acknowledge isn't overweight, but they have insecurities. Their friend is in plus-size stores. The author talks about their own thighs looking big and needing to lose weight. The friend got upset because she's trying to lose weight too and it made her uncomfortable. The author says they were talking about themselves, but the friend felt it was rude.\n\nHmm. The author is critical of their own body, but that made the friend feel bad. Even though the author's comments were self-deprecating, the friend might be comparing herself. The author might not realize that when someone else is talking about weight, it can trigger others who are struggling with their weight. Even if it's not about the friend, the context matters. The friend is sensitive because she's in a similar situation but heavier. So the author's self-criticism might be making the friend feel worse about her own body. \n\nIs the author in the wrong? Well, the friend is asking them to stop because it makes her uncomfortable. The author initially agreed but later feels it's unfair. The key here is empathy. Even if the author isn't targeting the friend, their words can still affect others. It's about being considerate of others' feelings. So maybe the author is in the wrong because they didn't consider how their self-talk could impact their friend. Even if it's about themselves, the context of the friend's situation makes it rude. So answer A.\n"
