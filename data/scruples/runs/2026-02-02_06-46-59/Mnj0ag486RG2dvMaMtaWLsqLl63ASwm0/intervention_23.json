I\u2019m not sure of her size but she needs to shop in plus size stores etc. Being 125 lbs, I realize I\u2019m not overweight, but I have insecurities like so many others. By the way, I think my friend looks great! She\u2019s a big girl and she\u2019s absolutely beautiful. The other day we were shopping and I tried on this pair of yoga pants. I complained how my thighs looked large and I needed to lose weight and go to the gym more. She became noticeably upset and confessed that she thinks it\u2019s rude whenever I talk about my body in front of her. She said that because she needs to lose 70 plus pounds it makes her wonder what I think of her and just makes her uncomfortable. I told her she looks great and this wasn\u2019t about her. This was about myself. She asked me not to talk about how I need to lose weight in front of her anymore. Initially I agreed, but now I feel this was an unfair request. And yes, I know, I shouldn\u2019t talk like that anyways. But was I being rude to her when I spoke ill of my own body? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong in this situation. The scenario is that the author's overweight friend gets upset when the author calls herself fat. The author is 125 lbs and not overweight, but has body insecurities. They were shopping when the author complained about her thighs and needing to lose weight. The friend became upset because she's trying to lose weight too and it made her uncomfortable. The author agreed not to talk about it in front of her but now feels it was unfair.\n\nHmm. The friend is sensitive because she's dealing with her own weight loss goals, and the author's comments triggered her. The author is confused because she's talking about herself, not the friend. But the friend feels it's rude because it makes her uncomfortable. The question is whether the author was wrong to talk about her body in front of her friend.\n\nI think the key here is about empathy and considering others' feelings. Even if the author is not the one who needs to lose weight, her comments might inadvertently hurt her friend's self-esteem. The friend might feel judged or compared, even if the author didn't mean to. In that case, the author was inconsiderate, even if unintentionally. The friend's request is about her own emotional well-being, and the author should respect that.\n\nBut maybe the author isn't in the wrong because she was just expressing her own insecurities. However, the context is that the friend has her own struggles, and the author could have been more mindful of how her comments might affect her. So, even though it's about herself, it's still a case where being considerate is important. So I think the answer is A, the author is in the wrong because she didn't consider her friend's feelings.\n"
