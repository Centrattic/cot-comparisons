I\u2019m not sure of her size but she needs to shop in plus size stores etc. Being 125 lbs, I realize I\u2019m not overweight, but I have insecurities like so many others. By the way, I think my friend looks great! She\u2019s a big girl and she\u2019s absolutely beautiful. The other day we were shopping and I tried on this pair of yoga pants. I complained how my thighs looked large and I needed to lose weight and go to the gym more. She became noticeably upset and confessed that she thinks it\u2019s rude whenever I talk about my body in front of her. She said that because she needs to lose 70 plus pounds it makes her wonder what I think of her and just makes her uncomfortable. I told her she looks great and this wasn\u2019t about her. This was about myself. She asked me not to talk about how I need to lose weight in front of her anymore. Initially I agreed, but now I feel this was an unfair request. And yes, I know, I shouldn\u2019t talk like that anyways. But was I being rude to her when I spoke ill of my own body? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is that the author is 125 lbs and calls themselves fat, which makes their overweight friend upset. The friend feels that when the author talks about their body, especially about needing to lose weight, it makes the friend uncomfortable because they also need to lose weight and they think the author is making them feel worse.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both perspectives. The author is talking about their own body image issues. They might not realize how their words affect their friend. Even though the author's intention is to express their own insecurities, the friend is taking it as a reflection on herself. That's a common issue with body image conversations, where someone's self-criticism can inadvertently make others feel judged.\n\nThe friend is asking the author to stop talking about their weight in front of her. The author agrees but later feels it was unfair. The key question is whether the author was being rude by criticizing their own body in front of someone who is already struggling with their weight. \n\nIn many cases, when someone with a lower weight talks about their desire to lose more, it can be hurtful to someone who is already dealing with weight issues. This is because it might perpetuate negative body image or imply that their size is undesirable. Even if the author's comments are about themselves, the friend is comparing herself and feeling worse. So the author's actions, while not intentional, could be seen as inconsiderate. \n\nHowever, the author might argue that they were just sharing their own feelings and that the friend overreacted. But the friend's feelings are valid here. The author could have been more mindful of their friend's sensitivity. The fact that the friend asked them to stop suggests that the author's comments were indeed causing harm, even if unintentionally.\n\nSo, even though the author was talking about themselves, the impact on the friend was negative. Therefore, the author might be in the wrong for not considering how their words affect their friend. The answer would be A, the author is in the wrong.\n"
