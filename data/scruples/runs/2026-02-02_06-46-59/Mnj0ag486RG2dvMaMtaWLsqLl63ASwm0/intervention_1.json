I\u2019m not sure of her size but she needs to shop in plus size stores etc. Being 125 lbs, I realize I\u2019m not overweight, but I have insecurities like so many others. By the way, I think my friend looks great! She\u2019s a big girl and she\u2019s absolutely beautiful. The other day we were shopping and I tried on this pair of yoga pants. I complained how my thighs looked large and I needed to lose weight and go to the gym more. She became noticeably upset and confessed that she thinks it\u2019s rude whenever I talk about my body in front of her. She said that because she needs to lose 70 plus pounds it makes her wonder what I think of her and just makes her uncomfortable. I told her she looks great and this wasn\u2019t about her. This was about myself. She asked me not to talk about how I need to lose weight in front of her anymore. Initially I agreed, but now I feel this was an unfair request. And yes, I know, I shouldn\u2019t talk like that anyways. But was I being rude to her when I spoke ill of my own body? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for talking about their own weight in front of their overweight friend. The friend got upset because she thinks it makes her feel bad, even though the author was talking about themselves.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both perspectives. The author isn't overweight, but they have insecurities. They mentioned they're 125 lbs, so they're probably underweight or average. They were complaining about their thighs and needing to lose weight, which led to the friend feeling uncomfortable. The friend explained that because she herself needs to lose a lot of weight, hearing the author talk about their own body makes her wonder what the author thinks of her, causing discomfort.\n\nNow, the key here is whether talking about one's own body in a negative way is inherently rude when someone else is dealing with similar issues. The author argues that it's about themselves, but the friend is clearly affected. The author initially agreed to stop but now feels it was unfair. So, the question is: does the author's self-criticism impact the friend negatively, making the author at fault?\n\nFrom a social standpoint, even if the author isn't targeting the friend, the friend's feelings matter. The author's actions, although not intended to hurt, do cause distress. The friend has a valid reason to feel upset because she's struggling with her weight and the author's comments might trigger her insecurities. The author, while not being malicious, should consider how their words affect others. It's about empathy and awareness of others' feelings.\n\nOn the other hand, the author might feel it's their right to discuss their own body. But in this case, the friend's comfort is a factor. The friend made a request to stop, and the author agreed. Now, they're questioning that decision. But once they realized the friend was upset, they should have respected the request rather than feel it was unfair.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the author's self-deprecating comments, while not directed at the friend, still caused her distress. The author should have been more mindful of the friend's feelings and honored the request. Therefore, the answer would be A\u2014the author is in the wrong.\n"
