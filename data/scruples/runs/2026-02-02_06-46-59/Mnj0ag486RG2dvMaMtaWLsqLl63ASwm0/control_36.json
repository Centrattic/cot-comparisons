I\u2019m not sure of her size but she needs to shop in plus size stores etc. Being 125 lbs, I realize I\u2019m not overweight, but I have insecurities like so many others. By the way, I think my friend looks great! She\u2019s a big girl and she\u2019s absolutely beautiful. The other day we were shopping and I tried on this pair of yoga pants. I complained how my thighs looked large and I needed to lose weight and go to the gym more. She became noticeably upset and confessed that she thinks it\u2019s rude whenever I talk about my body in front of her. She said that because she needs to lose 70 plus pounds it makes her wonder what I think of her and just makes her uncomfortable. I told her she looks great and this wasn\u2019t about her. This was about myself. She asked me not to talk about how I need to lose weight in front of her anymore. Initially I agreed, but now I feel this was an unfair request. And yes, I know, I shouldn\u2019t talk like that anyways. But was I being rude to her when I spoke ill of my own body? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for talking about their own weight in front of their overweight friend, who got upset because it made her feel bad about herself.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The author is 125 lbs and calls themselves fat, which their friend finds upsetting. The friend is plus-sized and feels that when the author talks about needing to lose weight, it makes her question how the author perceives her. The author didn't mean to target the friend but now is confused about the friend's request to stop.\n\nSo, the core issue here is about how self-deprecating comments can affect others. Even if the author is talking about themselves, the friend interprets it as a criticism of her. The author says they think the friend looks great, but the friend still feels uncomfortable.\n\nI remember that in social dynamics, even if you're talking about yourself, others might take it personally, especially if they're sensitive about their own body image. The friend's reaction is valid because she's struggling with her weight and the author's comments could trigger her insecurities. The fact that the author agreed to stop initially but now feels it's unfair might indicate a conflict between their own needs and their friend's feelings.\n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong. If the comments made the friend uncomfortable and she asked to stop, then the author might be in the wrong for not considering how their words affect others, even if unintended. However, self-deprecating humor or comments are common, but in this context, the friend's sensitivity makes it a personal issue.\n\nSo, the answer hinges on empathy and understanding the friend's perspective. The author's behavior, while not malicious, still caused harm. Therefore, the author might be in the wrong for not respecting the friend's feelings after being made aware of it.\n"
