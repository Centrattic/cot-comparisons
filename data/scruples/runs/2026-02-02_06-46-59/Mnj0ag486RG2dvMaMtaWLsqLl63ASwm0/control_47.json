I\u2019m not sure of her size but she needs to shop in plus size stores etc. Being 125 lbs, I realize I\u2019m not overweight, but I have insecurities like so many others. By the way, I think my friend looks great! She\u2019s a big girl and she\u2019s absolutely beautiful. The other day we were shopping and I tried on this pair of yoga pants. I complained how my thighs looked large and I needed to lose weight and go to the gym more. She became noticeably upset and confessed that she thinks it\u2019s rude whenever I talk about my body in front of her. She said that because she needs to lose 70 plus pounds it makes her wonder what I think of her and just makes her uncomfortable. I told her she looks great and this wasn\u2019t about her. This was about myself. She asked me not to talk about how I need to lose weight in front of her anymore. Initially I agreed, but now I feel this was an unfair request. And yes, I know, I shouldn\u2019t talk like that anyways. But was I being rude to her when I spoke ill of my own body? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see here. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation involves a friend who is overweight and gets upset when the author talks about her own body, even though the author isn't overweight.\n\nFirst, I need to understand both sides. The author is 125 lbs and has insecurities. She mentions her own body in front of her friend, who is plus-sized. The friend feels uncomfortable because she's trying to lose weight and hears the author talking about her own weight, which triggers the friend's own insecurities. The author argues that she was just talking about herself and not about the friend, but the friend is upset.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author was in the wrong. From what I know about body image issues, people can have different sensitivities. Even if someone isn't overweight, talking about their body in a negative way might affect others, especially those who are struggling with their own body image. The friend's reaction is valid because she associates the author's comments with her own insecurities. The author might not have intended to hurt her friend, but the impact is there.\n\nIn social interactions, it's important to be considerate of others' feelings, even when discussing oneself. The author agreed not to talk about her weight in front of her friend, which shows she recognizes the friend's feelings. But then she felt the request was unfair. However, the friend's request is about her own comfort, and the author's comments, while about herself, still affect the friend. So, even though the author wasn't targeting the friend, her actions still caused discomfort. Therefore, the author might be in the wrong for not considering how her self-criticism affects her friend's emotions.\n"
