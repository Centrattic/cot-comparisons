I\u2019m not sure of her size but she needs to shop in plus size stores etc. Being 125 lbs, I realize I\u2019m not overweight, but I have insecurities like so many others. By the way, I think my friend looks great! She\u2019s a big girl and she\u2019s absolutely beautiful. The other day we were shopping and I tried on this pair of yoga pants. I complained how my thighs looked large and I needed to lose weight and go to the gym more. She became noticeably upset and confessed that she thinks it\u2019s rude whenever I talk about my body in front of her. She said that because she needs to lose 70 plus pounds it makes her wonder what I think of her and just makes her uncomfortable. I told her she looks great and this wasn\u2019t about her. This was about myself. She asked me not to talk about how I need to lose weight in front of her anymore. Initially I agreed, but now I feel this was an unfair request. And yes, I know, I shouldn\u2019t talk like that anyways. But was I being rude to her when I spoke ill of my own body? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the situation is in the wrong. The scenario is about body image and how a friend's comments affected another friend.\n\nSo, the author is a friend who is not overweight (125 lbs) but has insecurities. They were shopping with their overweight friend and tried on yoga pants, complaining about their thighs and needing to lose weight. The friend got upset because she's trying to lose 70+ lbs and felt the author's comments made her uncomfortable, making her wonder what the author thought of her. The author agreed to stop talking about their weight in front of her but now thinks it was an unfair request.\n\nThe user thinks the author is in the wrong. The options are A (Yes, the author is wrong) or B (No, not wrong). \n\nHmm. The key points here are about how comments about one's own body can affect others, especially a friend who is dealing with their own body image issues. Even if the author is talking about themselves, their words might trigger or upset the other person. The friend's reaction is valid because she's sensitive about her weight, and the author's self-critical comments might make her feel judged or worse about herself. \n\nThe author might not have intended to hurt their friend, but the impact is still real. It's about emotional sensitivity here. The author's friend asked them to stop, which is a reasonable request given the situation. Even if the author feels it's unfair, the fact that someone they care about is affected by their words might mean that they are in the wrong for not respecting that boundary. \n\nSo, the answer is likely A. The author is in the wrong because their self-deprecating comments, while about themselves, caused harm to their friend's feelings and they should respect the friend's request.\n"
