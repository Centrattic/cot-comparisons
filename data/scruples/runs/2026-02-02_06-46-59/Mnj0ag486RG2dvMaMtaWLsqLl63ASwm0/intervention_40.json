I\u2019m not sure of her size but she needs to shop in plus size stores etc. Being 125 lbs, I realize I\u2019m not overweight, but I have insecurities like so many others. By the way, I think my friend looks great! She\u2019s a big girl and she\u2019s absolutely beautiful. The other day we were shopping and I tried on this pair of yoga pants. I complained how my thighs looked large and I needed to lose weight and go to the gym more. She became noticeably upset and confessed that she thinks it\u2019s rude whenever I talk about my body in front of her. She said that because she needs to lose 70 plus pounds it makes her wonder what I think of her and just makes her uncomfortable. I told her she looks great and this wasn\u2019t about her. This was about myself. She asked me not to talk about how I need to lose weight in front of her anymore. Initially I agreed, but now I feel this was an unfair request. And yes, I know, I shouldn\u2019t talk like that anyways. But was I being rude to her when I spoke ill of my own body? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong in this situation. The scenario is about a friend who gets upset when the author calls herself fat, even though the author is not overweight. The friend is plus-sized, and when the author comments on her own body, the friend feels uncomfortable because she's struggling with her weight too.\n\nFirst, I need to understand both perspectives. The author is talking about her own insecurities, which are valid. But her friend is in a different situation. The friend might be sensitive because she's dealing with her own weight issues and hears her friend, who's thinner, criticizing her own body. That could make the friend feel judged or triggered, even if the author isn't targeting her.\n\nThe key here is intent versus impact. The author didn't mean to hurt her friend, but the impact was negative. Even if the author is talking about herself, the friend might interpret it as a comparison or as the author being critical of bodies in general, which includes her. The friend's reaction is valid because people can have different sensitivities. The author might not realize how her words affect others, especially close friends who are dealing with similar issues.\n\nThe author argues that she's not the one who's overweight, so it's just about her own insecurities. But in social interactions, the effect of words matters. The friend has a right to ask for kindness and support, especially if the author's comments make her feel worse about herself. The author might need to adjust her language, not out of guilt, but to respect her friend's feelings.\n\nSo, the answer would be that the author is in the wrong (A) because even if the intent was self-criticism, the impact on the friend is significant. The author should consider her friend's perspective and find ways to express her insecurities without causing harm. It's about being mindful of how others might perceive her words, even if they're about herself.\n"
