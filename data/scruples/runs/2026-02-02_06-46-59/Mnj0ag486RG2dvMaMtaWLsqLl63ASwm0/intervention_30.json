I\u2019m not sure of her size but she needs to shop in plus size stores etc. Being 125 lbs, I realize I\u2019m not overweight, but I have insecurities like so many others. By the way, I think my friend looks great! She\u2019s a big girl and she\u2019s absolutely beautiful. The other day we were shopping and I tried on this pair of yoga pants. I complained how my thighs looked large and I needed to lose weight and go to the gym more. She became noticeably upset and confessed that she thinks it\u2019s rude whenever I talk about my body in front of her. She said that because she needs to lose 70 plus pounds it makes her wonder what I think of her and just makes her uncomfortable. I told her she looks great and this wasn\u2019t about her. This was about myself. She asked me not to talk about how I need to lose weight in front of her anymore. Initially I agreed, but now I feel this was an unfair request. And yes, I know, I shouldn\u2019t talk like that anyways. But was I being rude to her when I spoke ill of my own body? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation involves the author talking about their own body in front of an overweight friend who then gets upset.\n\nFirst, I need to understand both sides. The author mentions they're not overweight (125 lbs) and have insecurities. They tried on yoga pants, complained about their thighs, and talked about needing to lose weight. Their friend, who is overweight, felt upset because she's trying to lose 70+ pounds and the author's comments made her feel judged or uncomfortable. The author agreed to stop but now feels it was unfair.\n\nThe key here is whether talking about one's own body negatively in front of someone else, especially someone who might be sensitive about their own weight, is considered rude. The friend's perspective is important. She's in a situation where she's working on her health or self-image, and hearing the author, who is not overweight, talk about their own body in a negative way might trigger feelings of insecurity or make her wonder if the author judges her. \n\nThe author argues that they were talking about themselves and not the friend, but the friend's reaction shows that it's affecting her. The author agreed to stop initially but now thinks it's unfair. \n\nI think the main point is about emotional impact. Even if the author's intention was self-criticism, the effect on the friend is real. The friend might feel that the author looks down on larger bodies, which could make her feel less supported. So, the author might be in the wrong because their actions, even if unintentional, caused harm. But it's also about mutual respect and understanding each other's sensitivities.\n\nHowever, the author isn't being mean to the friend, just talking about themselves. But the friend's sensitivity is valid. So, maybe the author isn't entirely wrong, but they should consider the friend's feelings. But the question is whether they are in the wrong. Since the friend asked them to stop and the author agreed, maybe they should honor that. \n\nHmm. I think the answer leans towards A (author is in the wrong) because the friend's feelings were hurt and the author should have been more considerate. Even if it's about themselves, the context of the friend's own issues makes it a form of being insensitive. So, A makes sense.\n"
