I\u2019m not sure of her size but she needs to shop in plus size stores etc. Being 125 lbs, I realize I\u2019m not overweight, but I have insecurities like so many others. By the way, I think my friend looks great! She\u2019s a big girl and she\u2019s absolutely beautiful. The other day we were shopping and I tried on this pair of yoga pants. I complained how my thighs looked large and I needed to lose weight and go to the gym more. She became noticeably upset and confessed that she thinks it\u2019s rude whenever I talk about my body in front of her. She said that because she needs to lose 70 plus pounds it makes her wonder what I think of her and just makes her uncomfortable. I told her she looks great and this wasn\u2019t about her. This was about myself. She asked me not to talk about how I need to lose weight in front of her anymore. Initially I agreed, but now I feel this was an unfair request. And yes, I know, I shouldn\u2019t talk like that anyways. But was I being rude to her when I spoke ill of my own body? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, so the user is asking whether the author is in the wrong in this situation. Let me read through the scenario again to make sure I understand it.\n\nThe author is a friend of an overweight person. They mention that their friend is in plus-size stores, but the author themselves is 125 lbs and not overweight. The author has body insecurities but is generally positive about their friend's appearance, saying she's beautiful. However, when they were shopping, the author tried on yoga pants, complained about their thighs, and said they need to lose weight and go to the gym more. The friend got upset, explaining that she finds it rude because she's trying to lose 70+ pounds and it makes her uncomfortable, thinking the author is judging her. The author told the friend they look great and it's about themselves, but the friend asked them not to talk about needing to lose weight in front of her. The author initially agreed but now feels it was an unfair request and is seeking validation on whether they were in the wrong.\n\nThe user thinks the author is in the wrong. Let me break this down. The key points here are about talking about one's own body in front of someone else who might be sensitive to such topics. The author is discussing their own insecurities, but the friend interprets that as a trigger for her own issues. The question is whether the author was being rude by speaking negatively about their own body in the presence of the friend.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics of communication and empathy in friendships. Even if the author is talking about themselves, their friend's feelings are being hurt. The friend has her own struggles with her weight and might be sensitive to any negative body talk, especially from someone she's close to. The author might not intend to hurt her, but the impact is there. \n\nNow, the author is 125 lbs and not overweight, so when they say they need to lose weight, it's likely not about being in a higher weight category but about their own insecurities. However, the friend is in a plus-size category and is working on losing a significant amount of weight. Negative body talk from others, even if it's about their own bodies, can sometimes trigger feelings of inadequacy or self-consciousness in others, particularly if they're already struggling with self-esteem related to their body.\n\nThe friend's reaction is valid. If she feels uncomfortable or triggered by the author's comments, then the author's actions did have a negative effect on her. The author might not have realized the emotional impact their words had. The friend is asking the author to respect her feelings by not speaking about their own weight in her presence. That's a reasonable request if it's causing her distress, even if the author's intent was self-criticism.\n\nOn the other hand, the author might feel that they are just expressing their own feelings and that the friend is being overly sensitive. But the reality is that in a friendship, it's important to consider how your words affect others. The friend is in a vulnerable position with her weight loss journey, so the author's self-deprecating comments might inadvertently make her feel worse about herself, even if the author is not in a plus-size category.\n\nSo, the question is whether it's the author's responsibility to avoid such language when they know it affects their friend. The friend's feelings are legitimate, and if the author is in a position where they can adjust their behavior to support their friend, that's part of being considerate. Even if the author's intention was self-awareness, the act of speaking negatively about their body in front of someone who has body image issues could be seen as insensitive.\n\nI should also think about the part where the author said they think their friend looks great. But maybe the friend is not there yet in her self-acceptance and hearing the author talk about their own weight could make her feel that the author is implying that their weight is okay while hers isn't, even if that's not the case. It's possible the author's comments create a comparison.\n\nThe author's own insecurities might not be the problem, but the way they're expressed in a context where the friend is already sensitive. The friend is asking for a boundary, which the author initially agreed to but now is questioning. The author needs to respect the friend's feelings, even if they don't fully understand why it's an issue. \n\nIn conclusion, the author was being insensitive, even if unintentionally. The fact that their friend is in a different body situation but is still affected by the author's comments shows that the author should be more mindful. So, the answer would be that the author is in the wrong (A).\n"
