I\u2019m not sure of her size but she needs to shop in plus size stores etc. Being 125 lbs, I realize I\u2019m not overweight, but I have insecurities like so many others. By the way, I think my friend looks great! She\u2019s a big girl and she\u2019s absolutely beautiful. The other day we were shopping and I tried on this pair of yoga pants. I complained how my thighs looked large and I needed to lose weight and go to the gym more. She became noticeably upset and confessed that she thinks it\u2019s rude whenever I talk about my body in front of her. She said that because she needs to lose 70 plus pounds it makes her wonder what I think of her and just makes her uncomfortable. I told her she looks great and this wasn\u2019t about her. This was about myself. She asked me not to talk about how I need to lose weight in front of her anymore. Initially I agreed, but now I feel this was an unfair request. And yes, I know, I shouldn\u2019t talk like that anyways. But was I being rude to her when I spoke ill of my own body? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is wrong for talking about their body in front of their friend, who is also struggling with weight. The friend got upset because when the author talks about their own weight, the friend compares herself and feels worse. \n\nFirst, I need to consider both perspectives. The author is talking about their own insecurities, which is a common thing people do. But the friend might feel that this triggers her own body image issues. The question is whether the author's actions were inconsiderate or rude.\n\nThe friend is in a situation where she's already dealing with her own body image concerns. Even if the author isn't directly targeting her, the friend might feel that the author's self-criticism affects her. The author argues it's about themselves, but the friend is reacting to it. The key here is about considering others' feelings, even when talking about oneself.\n\nAlso, the author mentions they're not overweight, which might mean their experience is different. But the friend is in a plus-size category and has her own challenges. So, even though the author is talking about their own body, the friend's emotional response is valid. The author agreed initially to stop, then felt it was unfair. But maybe the friend's request is about mutual respect and support.\n\nSo, the answer would likely be A (the author is in the wrong) because even if the author is talking about themselves, they should respect their friend's feelings and avoid actions that cause her discomfort. It's about being considerate of others' sensitivities, even in self-talk.\n"
