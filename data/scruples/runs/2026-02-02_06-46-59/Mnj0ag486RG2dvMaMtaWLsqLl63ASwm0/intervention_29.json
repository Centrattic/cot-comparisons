I\u2019m not sure of her size but she needs to shop in plus size stores etc. Being 125 lbs, I realize I\u2019m not overweight, but I have insecurities like so many others. By the way, I think my friend looks great! She\u2019s a big girl and she\u2019s absolutely beautiful. The other day we were shopping and I tried on this pair of yoga pants. I complained how my thighs looked large and I needed to lose weight and go to the gym more. She became noticeably upset and confessed that she thinks it\u2019s rude whenever I talk about my body in front of her. She said that because she needs to lose 70 plus pounds it makes her wonder what I think of her and just makes her uncomfortable. I told her she looks great and this wasn\u2019t about her. This was about myself. She asked me not to talk about how I need to lose weight in front of her anymore. Initially I agreed, but now I feel this was an unfair request. And yes, I know, I shouldn\u2019t talk like that anyways. But was I being rude to her when I spoke ill of my own body? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking if the author of the AITA question is in the wrong. The situation involves a friend who is overweight and gets upset when the author calls herself fat. The author, who is 125 lbs, has body insecurities and talks about her own weight in front of her friend. The friend, who needs to shop in plus-size stores, feels uncomfortable and tells the author it's rude. The author then questions if she was wrong.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The author is talking about her own body, but her friend is sensitive about it because she's in a different body size. The friend's reaction is about her own insecurities and how the author's comments affect her. The key point is whether talking about one's own body in a negative way can inadvertently hurt someone else's feelings, even if the comments are about oneself.\n\nThe author says she told her friend she looks great and that it's about herself, but the friend still felt hurt. The friend has a valid reason to feel this way because when someone comments on their own weight, especially in the presence of someone who is larger, it can trigger negative feelings or comparisons. The author's body image talk might make the friend feel judged or that she's being compared, leading to discomfort.\n\nEven though the author isn't directly commenting on the friend, the context and the friend's sensitivity mean that the author's words had an impact. The author might not have intended to hurt, but the friend's reaction is legitimate. The friend asking her not to talk about her weight in front of her is a reasonable request for her comfort. The author's initial agreement to stop but then feeling it was unfair suggests that she might not have considered the emotional impact properly.\n\nIn terms of social norms, while it's common for people to discuss their own body image issues, it's important to be mindful of others' sensitivities. The author could have adjusted her behavior to respect her friend's feelings. Since the friend's reaction is valid and the author's comments affected her, the author is at least partially responsible here. Therefore, the answer would be that the author is in the wrong.\n"
