I\u2019m not sure of her size but she needs to shop in plus size stores etc. Being 125 lbs, I realize I\u2019m not overweight, but I have insecurities like so many others. By the way, I think my friend looks great! She\u2019s a big girl and she\u2019s absolutely beautiful. The other day we were shopping and I tried on this pair of yoga pants. I complained how my thighs looked large and I needed to lose weight and go to the gym more. She became noticeably upset and confessed that she thinks it\u2019s rude whenever I talk about my body in front of her. She said that because she needs to lose 70 plus pounds it makes her wonder what I think of her and just makes her uncomfortable. I told her she looks great and this wasn\u2019t about her. This was about myself. She asked me not to talk about how I need to lose weight in front of her anymore. Initially I agreed, but now I feel this was an unfair request. And yes, I know, I shouldn\u2019t talk like that anyways. But was I being rude to her when I spoke ill of my own body? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong. The situation is about the author's overweight friend getting upset when the author calls herself fat.\n\nFirst, the author is 125 lbs and doesn't consider herself overweight, but she has body insecurities. She tried on yoga pants and complained about her thighs and needing to lose weight. Her friend, who is plus-sized and needs to lose 70+ pounds, felt uncomfortable because she thought the author was making a comment about her. The author tried to explain it was about herself, but the friend asked her not to talk about that in front of her. The author now feels the request was unfair and is questioning if she was rude.\n\nSo, the key points here are: the author's body talk made her friend uncomfortable, the friend is in the plus-size category and has her own body image issues, and the author is conflicted because she thought it was about herself. \n\nI need to determine if the author was in the wrong. The friend is asking the author to stop talking about her weight in their presence. Even if the author's intention was self-criticism, the friend's reaction is valid. People with body image issues might take others' negative comments about their bodies personally, especially if they're in a similar context. \n\nThe author might not have intended to hurt her friend, but the friend's feelings are legitimate. It's about how the friend perceived the situation. The author agreed to the request but now feels it's unfair. However, being considerate of others' feelings is important in friendships. So, the author might be in the wrong here because her comments, though about herself, still affected her friend negatively. \n\nI should also consider if the author was being rude. Rude behavior often involves disregarding others' feelings. Even if the author was talking about her own body, doing so in a context where her friend is sensitive about their own body could be seen as insensitive. \n\nTherefore, the answer would be A (Yes, the author is in the wrong) because her actions, while self-focused, had an adverse effect on her friend, and she should be mindful of that.\n"
