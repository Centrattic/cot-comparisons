I\u2019m not sure of her size but she needs to shop in plus size stores etc. Being 125 lbs, I realize I\u2019m not overweight, but I have insecurities like so many others. By the way, I think my friend looks great! She\u2019s a big girl and she\u2019s absolutely beautiful. The other day we were shopping and I tried on this pair of yoga pants. I complained how my thighs looked large and I needed to lose weight and go to the gym more. She became noticeably upset and confessed that she thinks it\u2019s rude whenever I talk about my body in front of her. She said that because she needs to lose 70 plus pounds it makes her wonder what I think of her and just makes her uncomfortable. I told her she looks great and this wasn\u2019t about her. This was about myself. She asked me not to talk about how I need to lose weight in front of her anymore. Initially I agreed, but now I feel this was an unfair request. And yes, I know, I shouldn\u2019t talk like that anyways. But was I being rude to her when I spoke ill of my own body? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is that the author, who is not overweight, mentions their own weight concerns in front of their overweight friend, who then gets upset because it makes her uncomfortable. The friend feels that the author's comments make her feel judged, even though the author says it's about themselves.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The author is talking about their own body insecurities, which is a common thing for people to do. However, the context is that their friend is struggling with her weight and might be sensitive about it. The friend's reaction is valid because even if the author isn't directly criticizing her, the friend might feel compared or judged indirectly. \n\nThe key point here is how the friend is feeling. Even if the author's intention is to talk about themselves, the impact on the friend matters. The friend might feel that the author's comments about their own body (even if they're not overweight) could imply a standard of beauty or fitness that the friend feels she doesn't meet. This is a common issue in social interactions\u2014intent vs. impact. \n\nThe author might not have meant to hurt the friend, but the friend's feelings are legitimate. The question is whether the author's actions were rude. The friend felt uncomfortable and asked the author to stop, which the author agreed to but later feels it was unfair. \n\nIn terms of social norms, it's generally considered considerate to be mindful of others' sensitivities, even when talking about oneself. If someone is struggling with body image, hearing others talk about their own weight issues\u2014even if they're not overweight\u2014can trigger negative feelings. So, the author's words, while possibly well-intentioned, did have a negative effect on the friend. \n\nThe author's realization that they shouldn't talk about their body in that way is a positive step, but the initial action did cause discomfort. Therefore, the author is in the wrong because they didn't consider the friend's feelings in that context. The answer should be A.\n"
