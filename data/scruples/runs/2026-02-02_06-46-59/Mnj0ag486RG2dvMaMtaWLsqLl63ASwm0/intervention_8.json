I\u2019m not sure of her size but she needs to shop in plus size stores etc. Being 125 lbs, I realize I\u2019m not overweight, but I have insecurities like so many others. By the way, I think my friend looks great! She\u2019s a big girl and she\u2019s absolutely beautiful. The other day we were shopping and I tried on this pair of yoga pants. I complained how my thighs looked large and I needed to lose weight and go to the gym more. She became noticeably upset and confessed that she thinks it\u2019s rude whenever I talk about my body in front of her. She said that because she needs to lose 70 plus pounds it makes her wonder what I think of her and just makes her uncomfortable. I told her she looks great and this wasn\u2019t about her. This was about myself. She asked me not to talk about how I need to lose weight in front of her anymore. Initially I agreed, but now I feel this was an unfair request. And yes, I know, I shouldn\u2019t talk like that anyways. But was I being rude to her when I spoke ill of my own body? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong here. The situation is that the author, who is 125 lbs, calls herself fat and talks about needing to lose weight, which upsets her overweight friend. The friend is sensitive because she herself needs to lose more weight and feels uncomfortable when the author talks about her own body negatively in front of her.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both perspectives. The author is talking about her own body, which might be a personal issue with self-image, even if she's not overweight. But the friend is dealing with her own weight issues and might feel triggered or judged when the author talks that way, even if it's not directed at her.\n\nThe author says they're not trying to make the friend feel bad, but the friend is hurt. The key here is whether the author's self-criticism inadvertently affects the friend's self-esteem. Even if the author's comments are about herself, if they cause emotional harm to a friend, that's a consideration.\n\nAlso, the author acknowledges that she shouldn't talk like that in general, but she's questioning whether it's unfair to have to stop for her friend's sake. The friend's request is about mutual respect and sensitivity. In a friendship, being considerate of each other's feelings is important. If the friend feels that the author's self-criticism is making her feel worse about herself, then maybe the author should adjust her behavior, even if it's about her own body.\n\nSo, the question is whether it's wrong to talk negatively about one's own body in front of someone else who is sensitive about their weight. I think the answer leans towards the author being in the wrong because even though the comments are about herself, they have a negative impact on her friend. It's about empathy and respecting the friend's feelings. The author might need to find a balance, like discussing her insecurities in a way that doesn't trigger her friend, or maybe avoiding those comments altogether if they cause hurt.\n\nTherefore, the answer would be A (Yes, the author is in the wrong) because her actions, though self-directed, caused harm to her friend, and she should respect her friend's feelings and boundaries.\n"
