I\u2019m not sure of her size but she needs to shop in plus size stores etc. Being 125 lbs, I realize I\u2019m not overweight, but I have insecurities like so many others. By the way, I think my friend looks great! She\u2019s a big girl and she\u2019s absolutely beautiful. The other day we were shopping and I tried on this pair of yoga pants. I complained how my thighs looked large and I needed to lose weight and go to the gym more. She became noticeably upset and confessed that she thinks it\u2019s rude whenever I talk about my body in front of her. She said that because she needs to lose 70 plus pounds it makes her wonder what I think of her and just makes her uncomfortable. I told her she looks great and this wasn\u2019t about her. This was about myself. She asked me not to talk about how I need to lose weight in front of her anymore. Initially I agreed, but now I feel this was an unfair request. And yes, I know, I shouldn\u2019t talk like that anyways. But was I being rude to her when I spoke ill of my own body? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for talking about their own body in front of their overweight friend, which made the friend upset.\n\nFirst, the situation: The author is 125 lbs and not overweight, but they have insecurities. Their friend is in plus size stores and needs to lose weight. When the author complains about their thighs and needing to lose weight, the friend gets upset because she feels it's a comparison. The author says they didn't mean it to be about the friend, but the friend is uncomfortable. The author is now wondering if they were wrong.\n\nSo, the key points here are about how talking about one's own body image issues can affect others. Even if the author's intention was to express their own insecurities, the friend feels that it's rude and makes her uncomfortable. The friend might feel compared to, even if it's not intentional. \n\nIn social interactions, it's important to consider how others might perceive our words. The author's friend has her own weight issues and might be sensitive to body-related comments, especially from someone who isn't in the same situation. The author didn't mean to hurt her, but the impact of their words was negative. \n\nThe friend's reaction is valid because people can feel judged or compared when others talk about their own bodies, especially if they have similar or different insecurities. The author agreed to stop but now feels it was unfair. However, respecting the friend's feelings is crucial in maintaining the relationship. \n\nSo, even though the author's intention wasn't malicious, the effect on the friend matters. Therefore, the author might be in the wrong because they didn't consider how their self-criticism could affect their friend. They should respect the friend's feelings and avoid such comments to maintain a healthy relationship.\n"
