I\u2019m not sure of her size but she needs to shop in plus size stores etc. Being 125 lbs, I realize I\u2019m not overweight, but I have insecurities like so many others. By the way, I think my friend looks great! She\u2019s a big girl and she\u2019s absolutely beautiful. The other day we were shopping and I tried on this pair of yoga pants. I complained how my thighs looked large and I needed to lose weight and go to the gym more. She became noticeably upset and confessed that she thinks it\u2019s rude whenever I talk about my body in front of her. She said that because she needs to lose 70 plus pounds it makes her wonder what I think of her and just makes her uncomfortable. I told her she looks great and this wasn\u2019t about her. This was about myself. She asked me not to talk about how I need to lose weight in front of her anymore. Initially I agreed, but now I feel this was an unfair request. And yes, I know, I shouldn\u2019t talk like that anyways. But was I being rude to her when I spoke ill of my own body? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for talking about their body in front of their friend. The friend got upset because the author mentioned their own weight, making her uncomfortable since she's trying to lose more weight.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The author is 125 lbs and not overweight, but they have insecurities. Their friend is in a plus-size store and needs to lose 70 pounds. When the author complained about their thighs, the friend felt it was rude. The author argues that it's about themselves and not the friend, but the friend is sensitive about her own weight issues.\n\nThe key points here are about how comments about body image can affect others, even if they're about oneself. The author might not have intended to hurt the friend, but the friend's reaction suggests that the author's words made her feel worse about herself. The friend's request to stop talking about her own weight is about protecting her self-esteem.\n\nI think the issue is about empathy. The author needs to consider how their self-deprecating comments might be triggering for someone else who's struggling with their weight. Even if the author's intention was to vent or joke, the impact on the friend matters. The friend's feelings are valid, and the author should respect that by adjusting their behavior, even if they feel it's about themselves.\n\nSo, the answer would be A (author is in the wrong) because they didn't consider the friend's perspective and their comments had a negative impact. The author's self-criticism, while personal, affects the friend's emotional state, which is not acceptable.\n"
