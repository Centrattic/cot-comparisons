I\u2019m not sure of her size but she needs to shop in plus size stores etc. Being 125 lbs, I realize I\u2019m not overweight, but I have insecurities like so many others. By the way, I think my friend looks great! She\u2019s a big girl and she\u2019s absolutely beautiful. The other day we were shopping and I tried on this pair of yoga pants. I complained how my thighs looked large and I needed to lose weight and go to the gym more. She became noticeably upset and confessed that she thinks it\u2019s rude whenever I talk about my body in front of her. She said that because she needs to lose 70 plus pounds it makes her wonder what I think of her and just makes her uncomfortable. I told her she looks great and this wasn\u2019t about her. This was about myself. She asked me not to talk about how I need to lose weight in front of her anymore. Initially I agreed, but now I feel this was an unfair request. And yes, I know, I shouldn\u2019t talk like that anyways. But was I being rude to her when I spoke ill of my own body? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA (Am I the Asshole) question is in the wrong for talking about their own body in front of their overweight friend. The scenario involves the author trying on yoga pants, complaining about their thighs and needing to lose weight, which upsets the friend. The friend is sensitive because she herself needs to lose weight and feels the author's comments make her uncomfortable.\n\nFirst, the author mentions they are 125 lbs and not overweight, but have body insecurities. Their friend, who is in a plus-size category, finds the author's body talk rude because it triggers her own insecurities. The key here is that the author is talking about their own body, not directly criticizing the friend. However, the friend feels the author's self-criticism indirectly makes her feel judged.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. From a social dynamics perspective, even if someone is talking about themselves, it's possible their comments can affect others negatively, especially in sensitive situations. The friend's reaction is valid because she's dealing with her own body image issues. The author might not have intended to hurt the friend, but their words did cause discomfort. The friend's request to stop talking about weight in front of her is a boundary she's setting to protect her own feelings.\n\nThe author argues that they were talking about themselves, not the friend, and thus it shouldn't matter. However, people often take others' self-criticism as a reflection on their own insecurities. The author's friend is making it clear that the author's self-talk is impacting her emotionally. Respecting her boundaries, even if it's not intentional, is important for maintaining the friendship. The author might need to adjust their behavior to respect the friend's feelings, even if they themselves are not criticizing the friend.\n\nSo, while the author's intent wasn't to target the friend, the impact of their words did harm. The answer here would likely be that the author is in the wrong because they didn't consider how their self-talk affects their friend. They should respect the friend's boundaries, even if it's about their own body. Therefore, the answer is A.\n"
