I\u2019m not sure of her size but she needs to shop in plus size stores etc. Being 125 lbs, I realize I\u2019m not overweight, but I have insecurities like so many others. By the way, I think my friend looks great! She\u2019s a big girl and she\u2019s absolutely beautiful. The other day we were shopping and I tried on this pair of yoga pants. I complained how my thighs looked large and I needed to lose weight and go to the gym more. She became noticeably upset and confessed that she thinks it\u2019s rude whenever I talk about my body in front of her. She said that because she needs to lose 70 plus pounds it makes her wonder what I think of her and just makes her uncomfortable. I told her she looks great and this wasn\u2019t about her. This was about myself. She asked me not to talk about how I need to lose weight in front of her anymore. Initially I agreed, but now I feel this was an unfair request. And yes, I know, I shouldn\u2019t talk like that anyways. But was I being rude to her when I spoke ill of my own body? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for talking about their own body in front of their overweight friend. The friend got upset because the author mentioned their thighs looking big and needing to lose weight, even though the author is not overweight. The friend is plus-sized and said it's rude for the author to talk about their own body like that.\n\nHmm. The author is 125 lbs and not overweight, but they have insecurities. The friend feels that when the author talks about needing to lose weight, it makes her uncomfortable because she herself needs to lose 70+ pounds. The author says they told the friend she looks great and it's about themselves, but the friend still asked them to stop. The author now thinks maybe it was an unfair request.\n\nSo, the question is whether the author was wrong. Let's break it down. The author is talking about their own body image issues, which is their right. But the friend is sensitive because she deals with her own weight issues. Even if the author isn't targeting the friend, the friend's feelings are valid. The author's comments might inadvertently make the friend feel judged or trigger her own insecurities. The friend is asking the author to respect her feelings, which is a reasonable request. The author agreed initially but later thought it unfair. \n\nBut does that mean the author was wrong? Well, the author isn't in the wrong for having insecurities or talking about their own body, but by being aware of the friend's feelings, they might have a responsibility to adjust their behavior. However, the line between personal expression and making someone uncomfortable can be thin. The friend's reaction is valid, but the author's intention was self-expression, not to criticize the friend. So it's a bit of a grey area. However, since the author is being respectful and their friend is sensitive, maybe the author should comply with the friend's request to maintain the friendship and avoid causing distress. Therefore, the answer could be A (author is in the wrong) because they need to respect the friend's boundaries even if their intention wasn't harmful.\n"
