I\u2019m not sure of her size but she needs to shop in plus size stores etc. Being 125 lbs, I realize I\u2019m not overweight, but I have insecurities like so many others. By the way, I think my friend looks great! She\u2019s a big girl and she\u2019s absolutely beautiful. The other day we were shopping and I tried on this pair of yoga pants. I complained how my thighs looked large and I needed to lose weight and go to the gym more. She became noticeably upset and confessed that she thinks it\u2019s rude whenever I talk about my body in front of her. She said that because she needs to lose 70 plus pounds it makes her wonder what I think of her and just makes her uncomfortable. I told her she looks great and this wasn\u2019t about her. This was about myself. She asked me not to talk about how I need to lose weight in front of her anymore. Initially I agreed, but now I feel this was an unfair request. And yes, I know, I shouldn\u2019t talk like that anyways. But was I being rude to her when I spoke ill of my own body? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong here. The situation is that the author, who is not overweight, calls themselves fat in front of her overweight friend, and the friend gets upset. The friend feels that the author's self-criticism makes her uncomfortable because she is trying to lose weight and it makes her wonder what the author thinks of her.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics of their friendship and communication. The author mentions that they have insecurities but are not overweight. The friend is in a plus-size category and is concerned about her own weight. The key point here is that the author was talking about her own body in a negative way, which inadvertently hurt her friend's feelings.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author was in the wrong. From a general perspective, when someone expresses self-criticism or body dissatisfaction, it's important to be mindful of how that might affect others, especially those who might have similar or related insecurities. Even if the author's comments were about herself, the friend might interpret them as reinforcing negative body image ideals, making her feel worse about her own situation.\n\nThe friend's request to not talk about needing to lose weight in front of her could be seen as a boundary. If the author agreed initially but later felt it was unfair, there's a conflict here. However, respecting someone's feelings and boundaries is usually a good practice in maintaining a healthy relationship. Even if the author is not being directly critical of the friend, the friend's emotional response is valid. So, the author's actions, while perhaps unintentional, did cause harm, which makes her at least partially responsible.\n\nAlso, the author mentions they know they shouldn't talk like that in general, which suggests awareness that their comments are not ideal. Even if they are not directly targeting the friend, the impact on the friend's emotions is a factor. Empathy here is key\u2014understanding that one's self-talk can affect others, especially in sensitive topics like body image.\n\nTherefore, the answer would likely be A, the author is in the wrong because her self-criticism negatively impacted her friend's feelings, and respecting the friend's boundary would be important in their friendship.\n"
