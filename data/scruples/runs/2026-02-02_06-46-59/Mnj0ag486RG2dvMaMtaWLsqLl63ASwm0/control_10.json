I\u2019m not sure of her size but she needs to shop in plus size stores etc. Being 125 lbs, I realize I\u2019m not overweight, but I have insecurities like so many others. By the way, I think my friend looks great! She\u2019s a big girl and she\u2019s absolutely beautiful. The other day we were shopping and I tried on this pair of yoga pants. I complained how my thighs looked large and I needed to lose weight and go to the gym more. She became noticeably upset and confessed that she thinks it\u2019s rude whenever I talk about my body in front of her. She said that because she needs to lose 70 plus pounds it makes her wonder what I think of her and just makes her uncomfortable. I told her she looks great and this wasn\u2019t about her. This was about myself. She asked me not to talk about how I need to lose weight in front of her anymore. Initially I agreed, but now I feel this was an unfair request. And yes, I know, I shouldn\u2019t talk like that anyways. But was I being rude to her when I spoke ill of my own body? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong in this situation. The scenario is that the author's overweight friend got upset when the author talked about themselves being fat. The author is 125 lbs, so not overweight, but they have insecurities. The friend, who is plus-sized, felt uncomfortable because the author's comments made her think about her own weight (she needs to lose 70+ pounds). The author is questioning if their own body talk was rude to the friend.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The friend has a sensitivity about weight issues. The author is talking about their own body image, which isn't directly about the friend. But the friend's reaction is based on her own insecurities. The author says they think the friend looks great, but the friend still feels triggered. \n\nIn terms of social etiquette, people can have different sensitivities. Even if the author is discussing their own body, if it causes someone else discomfort, especially a close friend, there might be a consideration for the friend's feelings. The author agreed to stop but now feels it was unfair. But the question is whether the author was actually in the wrong. \n\nIt's possible that the author wasn't intentionally targeting the friend, but their words still affected her. Sometimes, even self-critical comments can trigger others with body image issues. The friend might feel that the author's negative self-talk creates a judgmental environment that reflects poorly on her. The author might not realize the impact, but the friend's feelings are valid. \n\nOn the other hand, the author is allowed to express their own insecurities. However, since it's affecting a friend, maybe the author should be more mindful. The key point is that the friend felt uncomfortable, and the author was made aware of that. So, even if the author didn't mean to hurt, the effect is there. The author might be in the wrong because they didn't consider the friend's feelings in their comments. \n\nBut does that make the author truly \"in the wrong\"? Or is it more about sensitivity and communication? The friend's request to not talk about it in front of her is a boundary. If the author agreed, then going back on that could be an issue, but the original question is about whether they were in the wrong initially. \n\nI think the answer leans towards A (the author is in the wrong) because even if it's about themselves, their comments caused harm, and the friend's feelings are valid. The author should be more considerate of how their self-talk affects others, especially a close friend with known insecurities. Even if it's not malicious, the impact is what matters here. So the answer is A.\n"
