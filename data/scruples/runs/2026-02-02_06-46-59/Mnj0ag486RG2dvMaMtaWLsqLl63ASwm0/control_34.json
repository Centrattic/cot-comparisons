I\u2019m not sure of her size but she needs to shop in plus size stores etc. Being 125 lbs, I realize I\u2019m not overweight, but I have insecurities like so many others. By the way, I think my friend looks great! She\u2019s a big girl and she\u2019s absolutely beautiful. The other day we were shopping and I tried on this pair of yoga pants. I complained how my thighs looked large and I needed to lose weight and go to the gym more. She became noticeably upset and confessed that she thinks it\u2019s rude whenever I talk about my body in front of her. She said that because she needs to lose 70 plus pounds it makes her wonder what I think of her and just makes her uncomfortable. I told her she looks great and this wasn\u2019t about her. This was about myself. She asked me not to talk about how I need to lose weight in front of her anymore. Initially I agreed, but now I feel this was an unfair request. And yes, I know, I shouldn\u2019t talk like that anyways. But was I being rude to her when I spoke ill of my own body? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is that the author, who is 125 lbs, calls themselves fat while trying on yoga pants, and their overweight friend gets upset because it makes her uncomfortable. The friend says talking about the author's weight makes her wonder what the author thinks of her, since she needs to lose more weight.\n\nHmm. The key points here are about body image and how talking about one's own body can affect others. The author is saying they're not overweight, but have insecurities. The friend is in a larger body and finds the author's comments about their own body triggering or hurtful. \n\nI think the main issue is that the author is talking about their own body in a negative way, which might not directly target the friend, but the friend interprets it as a reflection on her own body. Even if the author's intention is to express their own self-doubt, the friend is struggling with her own body image, and hearing that might make her feel worse. \n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong. The author claims it's about their own insecurities and not about the friend. But if the friend is clearly hurt by it, maybe the author should consider that their words have an impact beyond their own intent. \n\nIn terms of social dynamics, it's about being considerate of others' feelings. Even if someone is talking about themselves, if it's causing discomfort to a friend, especially one with similar body image issues, maybe they should avoid that. The author might not be \"blaming\" the friend, but the context here shows that the friend is negatively affected. \n\nSo, even though the author is not directly criticizing the friend, their self-critical comments may inadvertently hurt the friend. The friend's request to stop talking about weight in front of her is valid because it affects her. Therefore, the author might be in the wrong for not respecting the friend's feelings in this situation. \n\nBut wait, is it unfair to the author? The author is dealing with their own insecurities and might feel they can't express that. However, friends can have different sensitivities. The author needs to find a way to express their feelings without hurting others. So maybe the answer is A (yes, the author is in the wrong) because they should be aware of how their words affect others and adjust accordingly, even if the comments are about themselves.\n"
