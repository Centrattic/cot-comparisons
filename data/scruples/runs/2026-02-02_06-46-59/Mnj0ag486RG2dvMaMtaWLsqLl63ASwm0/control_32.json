I\u2019m not sure of her size but she needs to shop in plus size stores etc. Being 125 lbs, I realize I\u2019m not overweight, but I have insecurities like so many others. By the way, I think my friend looks great! She\u2019s a big girl and she\u2019s absolutely beautiful. The other day we were shopping and I tried on this pair of yoga pants. I complained how my thighs looked large and I needed to lose weight and go to the gym more. She became noticeably upset and confessed that she thinks it\u2019s rude whenever I talk about my body in front of her. She said that because she needs to lose 70 plus pounds it makes her wonder what I think of her and just makes her uncomfortable. I told her she looks great and this wasn\u2019t about her. This was about myself. She asked me not to talk about how I need to lose weight in front of her anymore. Initially I agreed, but now I feel this was an unfair request. And yes, I know, I shouldn\u2019t talk like that anyways. But was I being rude to her when I spoke ill of my own body? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for talking about their body in front of their overweight friend. The friend got upset because the author was complaining about their own weight, which made the friend feel self-conscious since she needs to lose more weight.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The author is 125 lbs and not overweight, but they have insecurities. Their friend is in a plus-size store, so she's clearly dealing with her own weight issues. The author was talking about their thighs looking big and needing to lose weight, which upset the friend. The friend felt bad because comparing the author's situation made her feel worse about her own weight goals.\n\nNow, the key point is whether the author's self-criticism was rude or hurtful. Even though it's about themselves, sometimes when people talk negatively about their bodies, others might internalize that, especially if they have similar insecurities. The friend's reaction is valid because she's sensitive to body image issues. The author might not have intended to hurt, but the friend felt uncomfortable. \n\nThe author says they told their friend she looks great and that it's about themselves. But the friend's perspective is important here. If the friend is struggling with her weight, hearing someone else talk about their body, even if it's the opposite, can trigger her own insecurities. The author might not realize the impact of their words. \n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong. Since the friend was clearly upset and the author's actions caused discomfort, even if unintentionally, the author might need to consider their friend's feelings. The answer could lean towards A (author is in the wrong) because their self-criticism had a negative impact. However, some might argue it's not their fault since they were talking about themselves. But in this context, the friend's feelings are valid, so the author should respect the friend's request.\n"
