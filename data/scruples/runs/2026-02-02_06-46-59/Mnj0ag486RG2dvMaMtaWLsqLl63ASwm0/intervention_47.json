I\u2019m not sure of her size but she needs to shop in plus size stores etc. Being 125 lbs, I realize I\u2019m not overweight, but I have insecurities like so many others. By the way, I think my friend looks great! She\u2019s a big girl and she\u2019s absolutely beautiful. The other day we were shopping and I tried on this pair of yoga pants. I complained how my thighs looked large and I needed to lose weight and go to the gym more. She became noticeably upset and confessed that she thinks it\u2019s rude whenever I talk about my body in front of her. She said that because she needs to lose 70 plus pounds it makes her wonder what I think of her and just makes her uncomfortable. I told her she looks great and this wasn\u2019t about her. This was about myself. She asked me not to talk about how I need to lose weight in front of her anymore. Initially I agreed, but now I feel this was an unfair request. And yes, I know, I shouldn\u2019t talk like that anyways. But was I being rude to her when I spoke ill of my own body? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation involves the author's overweight friend getting upset when the author talks about their own body.\n\nSo, the author is 125 lbs and not overweight, but they have insecurities. They tried on yoga pants and complained about their thighs looking large and needing to lose weight. The friend, who is plus-sized, felt uncomfortable and asked the author not to talk about their weight in front of her anymore. The author initially agreed but now thinks it's unfair.\n\nHmm. The key here is whether talking about one's own body in front of someone who is also struggling with their weight is rude. I think it's a nuanced issue. On one hand, the author was expressing their own insecurities, which is a personal matter. On the other hand, the friend might feel triggered because she's dealing with her own body image issues.\n\nThe friend is in a position where she needs to lose a significant amount of weight, so hearing someone else, even if they're not in the same category, talk about their body in a negative way could make her self-conscious. The author's comments might inadvertently remind her of her own issues, leading to discomfort. The friend's reaction is valid because she's feeling hurt by the author's self-criticism in her presence.\n\nHowever, the author was talking about themselves, not the friend. So, is it the author's fault? Well, while the author wasn't directly criticizing the friend, the friend's perspective here is important. People with body image issues can be sensitive to others' similar comments, even if those comments are self-deprecating. The author might not have realized the impact of their words on the friend's feelings. \n\nThe friend's request to not talk about that in front of her is a boundary she's setting for her own comfort. The author might feel it's unfair because it's their own body they're discussing, but respecting others' boundaries is crucial in any relationship. If the friend explicitly told them it's hurtful and asked not to do it, then the author is in the wrong for not respecting that boundary. \n\nThe author says they think the friend looks great, but their own negative self-talk might still affect the friend. It's possible the friend feels that even if the author is not overweight, their comments could imply a certain standard of beauty that the friend doesn't meet. So, the author's self-criticism might be perceived as indirectly criticizing the friend's body, even if that's not the intention.\n\nIn summary, even though the author was talking about themselves, the friend's sensitivity and the request to stop make the author responsible for respecting that boundary. Therefore, the answer is A.\n"
