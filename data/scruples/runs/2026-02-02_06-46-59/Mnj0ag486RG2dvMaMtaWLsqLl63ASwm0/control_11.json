I\u2019m not sure of her size but she needs to shop in plus size stores etc. Being 125 lbs, I realize I\u2019m not overweight, but I have insecurities like so many others. By the way, I think my friend looks great! She\u2019s a big girl and she\u2019s absolutely beautiful. The other day we were shopping and I tried on this pair of yoga pants. I complained how my thighs looked large and I needed to lose weight and go to the gym more. She became noticeably upset and confessed that she thinks it\u2019s rude whenever I talk about my body in front of her. She said that because she needs to lose 70 plus pounds it makes her wonder what I think of her and just makes her uncomfortable. I told her she looks great and this wasn\u2019t about her. This was about myself. She asked me not to talk about how I need to lose weight in front of her anymore. Initially I agreed, but now I feel this was an unfair request. And yes, I know, I shouldn\u2019t talk like that anyways. But was I being rude to her when I spoke ill of my own body? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The question is whether the author is in the wrong for talking about their own body in front of their overweight friend. The friend got upset because when the author talks about their own weight and needing to lose weight, the friend feels it makes her wonder what the author thinks of her.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both perspectives. The author is addressing their own insecurities, which is a natural thing to do. They tried on pants, complained about their thighs, etc. But the friend is uncomfortable because she's trying to lose a significant amount of weight, and hearing the author talk about their own weight makes her feel self-conscious. The friend might be internalizing the author's self-criticism as a reflection on her own body, even if the author isn't directly commenting on her.\n\nThe author says they told the friend she looks great and that it's about themselves. But the friend still felt hurt. The key here is whether the author's self-criticism is inherently hurtful to the friend. Even if the author isn't intending to comment on the friend's size, the friend's reaction shows that it's affecting her. \n\nFrom a social standpoint, sometimes people's comments can unintentionally affect others. Even if the author is talking about themselves, if it makes someone else feel bad, there's a responsibility to be aware of that. The author was initially respectful, agreeing not to talk about it in front of the friend. Now they're questioning if that was unfair. But the friend's feelings are valid here. The author might not be in the wrong in a malicious sense, but they are contributing to the friend's discomfort unintentionally. \n\nSo the answer would be A (Yes, the author is in the wrong) because even though it's about their own body, it's causing distress to the friend, and they should consider the impact of their words. It's about being mindful of others' sensitivities, even when discussing oneself.\n"
