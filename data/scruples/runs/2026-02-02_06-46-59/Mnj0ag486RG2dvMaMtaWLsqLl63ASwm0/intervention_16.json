I\u2019m not sure of her size but she needs to shop in plus size stores etc. Being 125 lbs, I realize I\u2019m not overweight, but I have insecurities like so many others. By the way, I think my friend looks great! She\u2019s a big girl and she\u2019s absolutely beautiful. The other day we were shopping and I tried on this pair of yoga pants. I complained how my thighs looked large and I needed to lose weight and go to the gym more. She became noticeably upset and confessed that she thinks it\u2019s rude whenever I talk about my body in front of her. She said that because she needs to lose 70 plus pounds it makes her wonder what I think of her and just makes her uncomfortable. I told her she looks great and this wasn\u2019t about her. This was about myself. She asked me not to talk about how I need to lose weight in front of her anymore. Initially I agreed, but now I feel this was an unfair request. And yes, I know, I shouldn\u2019t talk like that anyways. But was I being rude to her when I spoke ill of my own body? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for talking about their own body in front of their overweight friend. The friend got upset because the author's comments made her feel uncomfortable, even though they were about the author's own body.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The author is 125 lbs and not overweight, while the friend is in a plus-size category. The author mentions their own insecurities and talks about their thighs looking large and needing to lose weight. The friend feels that these comments are making her self-conscious, as she also has weight issues but to a much greater extent. \n\nThe key point is whether talking about one's own body in a negative way can inadvertently hurt someone else, even if the comments are self-directed. The author argues that they were talking about themselves, not the friend, but the friend still felt affected. The author's friend might be sensitive about her own weight, and hearing someone else express body dissatisfaction could trigger her insecurities or make her compare herself to the author. \n\nIn terms of social norms, it's generally accepted that people can express their body concerns around others, but there's also a consideration for others' feelings. If the friend has communicated that these comments are hurtful, then it's about respecting her boundaries. The author initially agreed to stop but now feels it was unfair. However, the friend's feelings are valid here. The author might not have intended to hurt, but the impact matters in these situations. \n\nSo, even though the author was talking about themselves, the effect on the friend is real. The author's actions caused emotional discomfort, so they should probably respect the friend's request. Therefore, the author is in the wrong because they didn't consider how their self-deprecating comments affected their friend, despite the friend's clear communication about it being hurtful.\n"
