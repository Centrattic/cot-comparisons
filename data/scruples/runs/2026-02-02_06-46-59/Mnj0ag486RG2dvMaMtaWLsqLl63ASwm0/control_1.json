I\u2019m not sure of her size but she needs to shop in plus size stores etc. Being 125 lbs, I realize I\u2019m not overweight, but I have insecurities like so many others. By the way, I think my friend looks great! She\u2019s a big girl and she\u2019s absolutely beautiful. The other day we were shopping and I tried on this pair of yoga pants. I complained how my thighs looked large and I needed to lose weight and go to the gym more. She became noticeably upset and confessed that she thinks it\u2019s rude whenever I talk about my body in front of her. She said that because she needs to lose 70 plus pounds it makes her wonder what I think of her and just makes her uncomfortable. I told her she looks great and this wasn\u2019t about her. This was about myself. She asked me not to talk about how I need to lose weight in front of her anymore. Initially I agreed, but now I feel this was an unfair request. And yes, I know, I shouldn\u2019t talk like that anyways. But was I being rude to her when I spoke ill of my own body? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for talking about their own body in front of their overweight friend. The friend got upset and told the author it's rude because she's trying to lose weight too. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the dynamics here. The author is 125 lbs and not overweight, but has insecurities. The friend is in a plus-size category and has her own body image issues. The author was complaining about their thighs and needing to lose weight and go to the gym more. The friend took offense because it made her feel self-conscious about her own weight.\n\nNow, the key point is that the author is talking about their own body. Generally, people have the right to discuss their own bodies without being blamed, but there's also the context of the friend's feelings. The author says they think their friend looks great, but the friend still felt hurt. \n\nIn terms of social norms, talking about one's own insecurities is a common thing, but it can affect others, especially if they have similar or related sensitivities. The friend's reaction suggests that the environment or conversation might trigger her own body image issues. So even though the author is not directly criticizing the friend, the act of discussing their own weight in her presence could be seen as insensitive. \n\nThe author initially agreed to the friend's request but now feels it's unfair. The question is whether it's wrong to talk about one's own body in such a context. There's a difference between self-criticism and doing so in a way that makes others uncomfortable. The friend's request is about her own comfort, so the author might need to respect that even if the conversation is about themselves. \n\nHowever, the author might not have intended to hurt the friend. It's possible the friend is more sensitive to body-related topics. The author's own insecurities are valid, but the friend's reaction is also valid. The author could be in the wrong if they ignored the friend's feelings, but maybe not if they were unaware. However, since the friend explicitly asked them to stop, the author should consider that to maintain a respectful friendship. \n\nSo, the answer would be A (the author is in the wrong) because even though they were talking about themselves, they made their friend uncomfortable and the friend has a valid reason to ask them to stop. The author should be considerate of their friend's feelings in the future.\n"
