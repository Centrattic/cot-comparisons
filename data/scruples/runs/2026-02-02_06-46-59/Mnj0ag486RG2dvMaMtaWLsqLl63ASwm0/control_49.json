I\u2019m not sure of her size but she needs to shop in plus size stores etc. Being 125 lbs, I realize I\u2019m not overweight, but I have insecurities like so many others. By the way, I think my friend looks great! She\u2019s a big girl and she\u2019s absolutely beautiful. The other day we were shopping and I tried on this pair of yoga pants. I complained how my thighs looked large and I needed to lose weight and go to the gym more. She became noticeably upset and confessed that she thinks it\u2019s rude whenever I talk about my body in front of her. She said that because she needs to lose 70 plus pounds it makes her wonder what I think of her and just makes her uncomfortable. I told her she looks great and this wasn\u2019t about her. This was about myself. She asked me not to talk about how I need to lose weight in front of her anymore. Initially I agreed, but now I feel this was an unfair request. And yes, I know, I shouldn\u2019t talk like that anyways. But was I being rude to her when I spoke ill of my own body? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong based on the situation described. The author's friend is upset when they talk about their own body, specifically mentioning that the friend needs to lose a lot of weight and feels uncomfortable.\n\nThe author is 125 lbs and feels they're not overweight, but they still have insecurities. They mentioned their thighs in yoga pants and needing to lose weight, which made the friend upset. The friend asked them to stop talking about their weight in front of her, and the author agreed but now feels it was unfair.\n\nHmm. So the main issue is whether it's wrong for the author to talk about their own body in a negative way around someone who is struggling with their weight. The author is not overweight themselves, so maybe they're projecting their own insecurities, but the friend is taking it as a reflection on herself. \n\nI remember that even if someone is talking about themselves, it can affect others, especially if those others have weight issues. The friend's reaction is valid because she might feel judged or triggered by the author's comments. The author might not intend to hurt her, but the friend is clearly affected. \n\nBut the question is about the author being in the wrong. The author admitted that they shouldn't talk like that in general, which suggests they're aware it's not ideal. However, the friend made a specific request, which the author agreed to but now regrets. \n\nSo, the key points are: the author's comments, even self-deprecating ones, can be hurtful to others. The friend's request is about her own comfort and feelings. The author's agreement to stop, even if they later feel it's unfair, means they should honor that. \n\nAlso, the author might have their own insecurities, but that doesn't negate the impact on the friend. People have different sensitivities, and respecting others' boundaries is important. \n\nTherefore, the author's behavior, while not malicious, was inconsiderate and affected their friend. The correct answer would be A (the author is in the wrong) because they didn't consider how their words might impact someone else who is dealing with weight issues. Even if it's about themselves, the friend's feelings are legitimate, and the author should have been more mindful.\n"
