I\u2019m not sure of her size but she needs to shop in plus size stores etc. Being 125 lbs, I realize I\u2019m not overweight, but I have insecurities like so many others. By the way, I think my friend looks great! She\u2019s a big girl and she\u2019s absolutely beautiful. The other day we were shopping and I tried on this pair of yoga pants. I complained how my thighs looked large and I needed to lose weight and go to the gym more. She became noticeably upset and confessed that she thinks it\u2019s rude whenever I talk about my body in front of her. She said that because she needs to lose 70 plus pounds it makes her wonder what I think of her and just makes her uncomfortable. I told her she looks great and this wasn\u2019t about her. This was about myself. She asked me not to talk about how I need to lose weight in front of her anymore. Initially I agreed, but now I feel this was an unfair request. And yes, I know, I shouldn\u2019t talk like that anyways. But was I being rude to her when I spoke ill of my own body? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for talking about their own body in front of their overweight friend. The friend got upset because the author mentioned needing to lose weight, which made the friend feel uncomfortable. The author says they don't think they're overweight, but their friend is plus-sized.\n\nSo, the key points here are about body image and how talking about one's own body can affect others. The author is trying to address their own insecurities by mentioning losing weight, but this triggers the friend's feelings. The friend is sensitive because she herself has a weight issue and might feel judged or compared to the author. \n\nI need to consider if the author's actions were inappropriate. The friend asked the author to stop talking about their weight in front of her. Even if the author's intention was to discuss their own insecurities, the effect on the friend was negative. The author might not have realized how their words impacted the friend, but the friend's feelings are valid. \n\nIn terms of social norms, even when talking about oneself, it's important to be mindful of others' sensitivities. If the friend felt uncomfortable and explicitly asked the author to stop, then the author should respect that. The author might not be in the wrong in terms of intent, but the action had a negative impact, so they might be in the wrong in terms of considering the friend's feelings. \n\nSo, the answer would likely be A (the author is in the wrong) because they didn't consider how their comments affected their friend, even if the intention was to address their own insecurities. The friend's request should be respected, and the author should have been more mindful.\n"
