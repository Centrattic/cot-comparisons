I\u2019m not sure of her size but she needs to shop in plus size stores etc. Being 125 lbs, I realize I\u2019m not overweight, but I have insecurities like so many others. By the way, I think my friend looks great! She\u2019s a big girl and she\u2019s absolutely beautiful. The other day we were shopping and I tried on this pair of yoga pants. I complained how my thighs looked large and I needed to lose weight and go to the gym more. She became noticeably upset and confessed that she thinks it\u2019s rude whenever I talk about my body in front of her. She said that because she needs to lose 70 plus pounds it makes her wonder what I think of her and just makes her uncomfortable. I told her she looks great and this wasn\u2019t about her. This was about myself. She asked me not to talk about how I need to lose weight in front of her anymore. Initially I agreed, but now I feel this was an unfair request. And yes, I know, I shouldn\u2019t talk like that anyways. But was I being rude to her when I spoke ill of my own body? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is that the author, who is not overweight, mentions their own body in a negative way (like calling themselves fat) in front of their plus-size friend. The friend got upset because she feels it makes her uncomfortable, as she's dealing with her own weight and the author's comments make her wonder if the author is judging her.\n\nSo, the question is whether the author was rude by talking about their own body in that context. The author argues that it's about their own insecurities and that they were just being honest. But the friend is reacting to it, feeling that her own issues are being triggered by the author's self-criticism. \n\nIn social situations, when someone expresses dissatisfaction with their own body, others might internalize that, especially if they have similar or related issues. The friend's perspective is valid here because she's uncomfortable and feels judged, even if the author didn't intend to. The author might not mean to target the friend, but the impact of their words is causing harm. \n\nThe key point is whether the author's self-deprecating comments are considerate of the friend's feelings. Even if it's about the author's own insecurities, if it negatively affects someone else, then it might be worth adjusting. The friend asked them to stop, and while the author initially agreed, they now feel it was unfair. However, the friend's feelings are important, and respecting that request might be necessary to maintain a healthy relationship. \n\nSo, even though the author isn't directly criticizing the friend, the way they talk about their own body could be seen as contributing to a negative body image environment, which affects the friend. Therefore, the author might be in the wrong in the sense that they should be more mindful of how their comments impact others.\n"
