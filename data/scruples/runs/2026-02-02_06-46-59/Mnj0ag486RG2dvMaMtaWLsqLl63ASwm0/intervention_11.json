I\u2019m not sure of her size but she needs to shop in plus size stores etc. Being 125 lbs, I realize I\u2019m not overweight, but I have insecurities like so many others. By the way, I think my friend looks great! She\u2019s a big girl and she\u2019s absolutely beautiful. The other day we were shopping and I tried on this pair of yoga pants. I complained how my thighs looked large and I needed to lose weight and go to the gym more. She became noticeably upset and confessed that she thinks it\u2019s rude whenever I talk about my body in front of her. She said that because she needs to lose 70 plus pounds it makes her wonder what I think of her and just makes her uncomfortable. I told her she looks great and this wasn\u2019t about her. This was about myself. She asked me not to talk about how I need to lose weight in front of her anymore. Initially I agreed, but now I feel this was an unfair request. And yes, I know, I shouldn\u2019t talk like that anyways. But was I being rude to her when I spoke ill of my own body? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author (the person who wrote the AITA post) is in the wrong. The situation involves the author talking about their own body in front of their overweight friend, which made the friend upset.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both perspectives. The author is not overweight themselves but has insecurities and mentions their thighs looking large and needing to lose weight. Their friend, who is overweight and trying to lose 70 pounds, feels uncomfortable because the author's comments make her question what the author thinks of her. The author argues that their comments were about themselves, not the friend, and feels the friend's request is unfair.\n\nFrom the friend's perspective, when someone who is not in the same body image situation talks about their own weight, it can inadvertently trigger insecurities in someone who is already struggling with their weight. The friend might feel that the author is making a comparison or that their own issues are being highlighted through the author's comments. Even if the author's intention was purely self-critical, the friend's reaction is valid because it's about how the author's words made her feel.\n\nOn the other hand, the author is sharing their own insecurities, which is a common human experience. They might not have realized the impact of their words. However, the key point here is whether the author's self-talk was respectful and considerate of the friend's feelings. The friend explicitly asked the author to stop, which suggests that the author's actions crossed a boundary.\n\nThe question is whether self-deprecating comments about one's own body can be considered rude if they cause discomfort to another person. Some might argue that people should be free to express their own insecurities, but others would say that when it affects someone else negatively, it's important to be mindful and adjust behavior to respect others' feelings.\n\nIn this case, the author's friend is in a vulnerable position with her own weight issues. The author's comments, even if self-directed, might have inadvertently made the friend feel judged or compared. The author's agreement to the friend's request initially shows understanding, but their later hesitation might stem from not fully realizing the emotional impact. However, the fact that the friend asked for this change and the author agreed means that the author's actions were indeed a problem in the context of their friendship.\n\nSo, considering the friend's valid feelings and the fact that the author's comments caused her distress, the author is in the wrong for not respecting the friend's boundaries, even if the comments were about themselves. The right action would be to respect the friend's request to avoid causing her discomfort.\n"
