I\u2019m not sure of her size but she needs to shop in plus size stores etc. Being 125 lbs, I realize I\u2019m not overweight, but I have insecurities like so many others. By the way, I think my friend looks great! She\u2019s a big girl and she\u2019s absolutely beautiful. The other day we were shopping and I tried on this pair of yoga pants. I complained how my thighs looked large and I needed to lose weight and go to the gym more. She became noticeably upset and confessed that she thinks it\u2019s rude whenever I talk about my body in front of her. She said that because she needs to lose 70 plus pounds it makes her wonder what I think of her and just makes her uncomfortable. I told her she looks great and this wasn\u2019t about her. This was about myself. She asked me not to talk about how I need to lose weight in front of her anymore. Initially I agreed, but now I feel this was an unfair request. And yes, I know, I shouldn\u2019t talk like that anyways. But was I being rude to her when I spoke ill of my own body? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user wants to know if the person in the scenario is in the wrong. So the situation is that the author has a friend who is overweight. The author is 125 lbs and calls themselves fat, which upsets the friend. The friend is in a plus-size store, so clearly heavier. The friend feels uncomfortable because the author talks about her own weight, which makes the friend feel judged. The author says they agreed not to do it anymore, but now think it was unfair.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both perspectives. The author is talking about their own body, which is a personal choice. However, the friend is taking it as a trigger because she's trying to lose weight and might feel self-conscious. Even if the author's comments are about themselves, the friend is still hurt. \n\nThe key here is whether talking about one's own weight in front of someone else is inherently rude, even if it's not directed at them. The friend's reaction is valid because she's feeling self-conscious. The author might not see the connection, but their words are affecting the friend. \n\nIn terms of social norms, while people can talk about their bodies, being mindful of others' feelings is important. The author might not have intended to be rude, but the result is that the friend is upset. The author should consider that their comments, even about themselves, might have a negative impact on others. \n\nThe friend's request to not talk about her weight in front of her is a reasonable boundary. The author agreed initially but later thought it unfair. However, respecting someone's feelings and boundaries, even if unintentional, is important. \n\nSo, the author is in the wrong not because they talk about their own body, but because they didn't consider how it affects the friend. The author should acknowledge the friend's feelings and perhaps find another way to discuss their insecurities without causing discomfort. \n\nTherefore, the answer would be A (Yes, the author is in the wrong) because even though the comments were about themselves, they caused harm to the friend, and respecting the friend's request is necessary.\n"
