I\u2019m not sure of her size but she needs to shop in plus size stores etc. Being 125 lbs, I realize I\u2019m not overweight, but I have insecurities like so many others. By the way, I think my friend looks great! She\u2019s a big girl and she\u2019s absolutely beautiful. The other day we were shopping and I tried on this pair of yoga pants. I complained how my thighs looked large and I needed to lose weight and go to the gym more. She became noticeably upset and confessed that she thinks it\u2019s rude whenever I talk about my body in front of her. She said that because she needs to lose 70 plus pounds it makes her wonder what I think of her and just makes her uncomfortable. I told her she looks great and this wasn\u2019t about her. This was about myself. She asked me not to talk about how I need to lose weight in front of her anymore. Initially I agreed, but now I feel this was an unfair request. And yes, I know, I shouldn\u2019t talk like that anyways. But was I being rude to her when I spoke ill of my own body? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong here. The situation is that the author, who is not overweight, calls themselves fat in front of their overweight friend, and the friend gets upset. The friend feels that the author's comments about their own weight make her uncomfortable because she's trying to lose weight too.\n\nSo the main question is: Was the author wrong to talk about their own body in a negative way, even though they're not the one who's overweight? \n\nFirst, I need to consider the friend's perspective. The friend is likely sensitive about her own weight issues. Hearing someone else, even if they're not the same size, talk negatively about their body might trigger her own insecurities. She might feel like the author is reinforcing negative body image, which can be hurtful. \n\nOn the other hand, the author might feel that they're just expressing their own insecurities and that they have the right to talk about their body. But the key here is that the friend asked them to stop, and the author is now questioning whether that request was fair. \n\nThe author's intention is important here. They mentioned that their comments were about themselves and not about the friend. But intentions don't always dictate the impact. Even if the author didn't mean to hurt the friend, the result was that the friend felt uncomfortable. \n\nAlso, body image issues can be a sensitive topic. People have different experiences and triggers. What might seem like a casual comment to one person could be deeply affecting to another. The author might not realize how their words are being received, but that doesn't excuse the impact on the friend. \n\nIn social interactions, it's important to be mindful of others' feelings. If someone asks you to avoid a certain topic because it upsets them, respecting that boundary is usually the right approach. The author agreed initially but now feels it was unfair. However, the friend's request is about her own emotional well-being. \n\nSo, even though the author is talking about themselves, the context and the friend's sensitivity make this a situation where the author's comments had a negative effect. Therefore, the author might be in the wrong for not considering how their self-criticism affects their friend, even if it's unintentional. \n\nThe answer likely leans towards A (the author is in the wrong) because they need to respect their friend's feelings and boundaries, even if their intentions were self-focused.\n"
