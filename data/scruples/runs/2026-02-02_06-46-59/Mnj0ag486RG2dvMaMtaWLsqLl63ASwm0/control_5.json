I\u2019m not sure of her size but she needs to shop in plus size stores etc. Being 125 lbs, I realize I\u2019m not overweight, but I have insecurities like so many others. By the way, I think my friend looks great! She\u2019s a big girl and she\u2019s absolutely beautiful. The other day we were shopping and I tried on this pair of yoga pants. I complained how my thighs looked large and I needed to lose weight and go to the gym more. She became noticeably upset and confessed that she thinks it\u2019s rude whenever I talk about my body in front of her. She said that because she needs to lose 70 plus pounds it makes her wonder what I think of her and just makes her uncomfortable. I told her she looks great and this wasn\u2019t about her. This was about myself. She asked me not to talk about how I need to lose weight in front of her anymore. Initially I agreed, but now I feel this was an unfair request. And yes, I know, I shouldn\u2019t talk like that anyways. But was I being rude to her when I spoke ill of my own body? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong after their friend got upset when they called themselves fat. The situation is that the author is 125 lbs, not overweight, but has body insecurities. Their friend is plus-sized and needs to shop in plus-size stores. When they were shopping, the author tried on yoga pants and complained about their thighs looking big and needing to lose weight. The friend got upset because she's trying to lose 70+ pounds and it made her uncomfortable hearing the author talk about their weight. The author then agreed not to talk about it but now feels it was unfair.\n\nSo, the question is, is the author in the wrong here? The options are A for yes and B for no.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The author is talking about their own body, but their friend is sensitive about her own weight issues. The friend feels that when the author criticizes their own body, it triggers the friend's insecurities. The author argues that it's about themselves and not the friend, but the friend feels it's affecting her.\n\nFrom a general perspective, when someone talks negatively about their own body, it's usually considered a personal issue. However, if it's causing emotional distress to another person, especially a friend, there might be some responsibility. The author's friend is in a more vulnerable position regarding weight, so the author's comments could inadvertently harm her.\n\nBut the author is also dealing with their own insecurities. They might not have realized how their words affect the friend. The key point here is whether the author's self-criticism, even if not directed at the friend, is inconsiderate. Since the friend has expressed that it makes her uncomfortable, the author should take that into account. The friend's feelings are valid, and the author's actions, while not malicious, are causing hurt. \n\nIn many social situations, we're expected to be mindful of others' feelings, even if we don't mean to cause harm. The author might not have intended to upset the friend, but the effect is there. So, the author might be in the wrong for not considering how their comments affect someone else who has their own body image issues.\n\nOn the other hand, the author is being honest about their own insecurities. But honesty doesn't always mean it's okay to potentially hurt someone else. The friend's request is about mutual respect and comfort in their friendship. If the author continues to talk about their weight in front of the friend, they might be disregarding the friend's boundaries.\n\nSo, considering all that, the answer would be A (yes, the author is in the wrong) because even though the author is talking about themselves, it's causing harm to the friend, and the friend has asked them to stop. The author should respect the friend's feelings and adjust their behavior to maintain a healthy friendship.\n"
