I\u2019m not sure of her size but she needs to shop in plus size stores etc. Being 125 lbs, I realize I\u2019m not overweight, but I have insecurities like so many others. By the way, I think my friend looks great! She\u2019s a big girl and she\u2019s absolutely beautiful. The other day we were shopping and I tried on this pair of yoga pants. I complained how my thighs looked large and I needed to lose weight and go to the gym more. She became noticeably upset and confessed that she thinks it\u2019s rude whenever I talk about my body in front of her. She said that because she needs to lose 70 plus pounds it makes her wonder what I think of her and just makes her uncomfortable. I told her she looks great and this wasn\u2019t about her. This was about myself. She asked me not to talk about how I need to lose weight in front of her anymore. Initially I agreed, but now I feel this was an unfair request. And yes, I know, I shouldn\u2019t talk like that anyways. But was I being rude to her when I spoke ill of my own body? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The situation is about the author talking about their own body image issues in front of their overweight friend, which made the friend upset. The friend is in a plus-size category and is dealing with her own weight, and she felt uncomfortable when the author mentioned her own weight and body parts. The author is asking if they were in the wrong.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both perspectives. The author is sharing their insecurities, which might be a normal part of self-expression. However, the friend has her own body image struggles, and hearing the author talk about their own weight loss goals might trigger her. Even if the author's comments were about themselves, the friend could feel compared or invalidated. \n\nThe key here is empathy. The author might not have intended to hurt, but the friend's feelings were affected. The friend's request is about setting boundaries, which is valid. The author agreed initially but now feels it was unfair. But respecting the friend's feelings is important. \n\nAlso, the author mentions that they aren't overweight (125 lbs), while the friend is in plus-size stores. The author's self-criticism might inadvertently make the friend feel worse about her own situation. Even if the author is trying to be honest, the impact matters here. \n\nIn social interactions, especially with friends who have similar issues, it's important to consider how our words affect others. The friend's reaction shows that the author's comments, though about themselves, had a negative effect. So the author might be in the wrong for not considering the friend's feelings and violating her boundary. \n\nTherefore, the answer is A (the author is in the wrong) because they didn't respect their friend's boundary and their self-criticism inadvertently hurt the friend.\n"
