I\u2019m not sure of her size but she needs to shop in plus size stores etc. Being 125 lbs, I realize I\u2019m not overweight, but I have insecurities like so many others. By the way, I think my friend looks great! She\u2019s a big girl and she\u2019s absolutely beautiful. The other day we were shopping and I tried on this pair of yoga pants. I complained how my thighs looked large and I needed to lose weight and go to the gym more. She became noticeably upset and confessed that she thinks it\u2019s rude whenever I talk about my body in front of her. She said that because she needs to lose 70 plus pounds it makes her wonder what I think of her and just makes her uncomfortable. I told her she looks great and this wasn\u2019t about her. This was about myself. She asked me not to talk about how I need to lose weight in front of her anymore. Initially I agreed, but now I feel this was an unfair request. And yes, I know, I shouldn\u2019t talk like that anyways. But was I being rude to her when I spoke ill of my own body? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. So, the user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for talking about their own body in front of their friend who is also overweight. The friend got upset because the author's comments made her feel bad, even though the author was talking about their own insecurities.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both perspectives. The author is making a self-deprecating comment about their thighs and needing to lose weight. They mention they are 125 lbs and not overweight, but have insecurities. The friend, who is in a plus-size category, feels that these comments are triggering her own body image issues. She's asking the author to stop talking about their weight in front of her.\n\nThe key here is whether the author's self-talk is harmful to the friend. Even if the author is talking about themselves, if it's causing discomfort to someone else, especially a close friend, it might be considered insensitive. The friend's reaction is valid because she has her own struggles, and hearing someone else criticize their body, even if they're not the one being criticized, can create a negative environment.\n\nBut then again, the author isn't directly criticizing the friend. They are addressing their own insecurities. However, the context is important\u2014they were shopping, trying on clothes, which is a situation where body image discussions can be more sensitive. The friend's need to lose weight is a personal issue, and the author's self-criticism might inadvertently make her compare herself more negatively.\n\nI think the line here is about being mindful of others' feelings. The author didn't intend to hurt the friend, but the impact is there. Since the friend has communicated her discomfort, the author should respect that request, even if they feel it's unfair. It's about empathy and recognizing that self-deprecating remarks can affect others, especially in similar situations.\n\nSo, in terms of right or wrong, it's not necessarily that the author is wrong in feeling insecure or talking about it, but they are in the wrong for not considering their friend's feelings. The friend's request is valid, and the author should adjust their behavior to be more considerate. Therefore, the answer would be A\u2014the author is in the wrong.\n"
