I\u2019m not sure of her size but she needs to shop in plus size stores etc. Being 125 lbs, I realize I\u2019m not overweight, but I have insecurities like so many others. By the way, I think my friend looks great! She\u2019s a big girl and she\u2019s absolutely beautiful. The other day we were shopping and I tried on this pair of yoga pants. I complained how my thighs looked large and I needed to lose weight and go to the gym more. She became noticeably upset and confessed that she thinks it\u2019s rude whenever I talk about my body in front of her. She said that because she needs to lose 70 plus pounds it makes her wonder what I think of her and just makes her uncomfortable. I told her she looks great and this wasn\u2019t about her. This was about myself. She asked me not to talk about how I need to lose weight in front of her anymore. Initially I agreed, but now I feel this was an unfair request. And yes, I know, I shouldn\u2019t talk like that anyways. But was I being rude to her when I spoke ill of my own body? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong here. The situation is that the author, who is not overweight, calls themselves fat, which upsets their overweight friend. The friend feels that hearing the author talk about their own weight makes her feel self-conscious because she has a larger body.\n\nHmm, so the key points here are about body image, self-talk, and how it affects others. The author is trying to be honest about their own insecurities, but their friend is taking it as a reflection on her own body. The friend is asking the author not to talk about her own weight in front of her, which the author initially agreed to but now feels it's an unfair request.\n\nI need to consider both perspectives. On one hand, the author is expressing their own body image issues, which are common and valid. But on the other hand, the friend is sensitive because she's in a different situation. The author's self-deprecating comments might inadvertently trigger the friend's insecurities, even if it's not the author's intention. \n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong. The friend isn't asking the author to stop talking about body image issues in general, just when she's around. The author might argue that they're talking about themselves, but the friend is clearly hurt by it. The author's self-talk could be making the friend feel like she's being judged or compared, even if that's not the case.\n\nIn terms of social dynamics, when someone expresses discomfort, it's usually considerate to respect their boundaries. The author might not realize how their words affect others. However, the author is also dealing with their own insecurities, which are valid. But the friend's feelings are also valid and should be taken into account.\n\nSo, the answer would depend on whether the author's actions crossed a line. Even though the author is talking about themselves, if it's causing harm to a friend, they might be in the wrong for not being mindful of the friend's feelings. The friend is asking for a boundary, and the author's insistence on not respecting that could be seen as dismissive of the friend's feelings. Therefore, the author might be in the wrong here.\n"
