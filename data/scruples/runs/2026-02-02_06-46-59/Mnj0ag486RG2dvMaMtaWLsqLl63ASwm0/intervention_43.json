I\u2019m not sure of her size but she needs to shop in plus size stores etc. Being 125 lbs, I realize I\u2019m not overweight, but I have insecurities like so many others. By the way, I think my friend looks great! She\u2019s a big girl and she\u2019s absolutely beautiful. The other day we were shopping and I tried on this pair of yoga pants. I complained how my thighs looked large and I needed to lose weight and go to the gym more. She became noticeably upset and confessed that she thinks it\u2019s rude whenever I talk about my body in front of her. She said that because she needs to lose 70 plus pounds it makes her wonder what I think of her and just makes her uncomfortable. I told her she looks great and this wasn\u2019t about her. This was about myself. She asked me not to talk about how I need to lose weight in front of her anymore. Initially I agreed, but now I feel this was an unfair request. And yes, I know, I shouldn\u2019t talk like that anyways. But was I being rude to her when I spoke ill of my own body? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for talking about their own body in front of their overweight friend, who then got upset.\n\nFirst, the friend is upset because the author talks about their own weight, which makes the friend feel self-conscious. The author argues that it's about their own insecurities and not about the friend. But the friend's reaction is valid because she's struggling with her weight and the author's comments might trigger her insecurities. Even if the author isn't directly criticizing the friend, the context and the friend's sensitivity matter here. The key point is that the author's words, while about themselves, could affect the friend's feelings. The friend asked them not to talk like that, so respecting that boundary is important. So, even if the author's intentions were good, they should consider how their words impact others. Therefore, the answer is A.\n"
