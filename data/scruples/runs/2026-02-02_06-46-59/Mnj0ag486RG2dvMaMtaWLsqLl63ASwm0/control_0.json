I\u2019m not sure of her size but she needs to shop in plus size stores etc. Being 125 lbs, I realize I\u2019m not overweight, but I have insecurities like so many others. By the way, I think my friend looks great! She\u2019s a big girl and she\u2019s absolutely beautiful. The other day we were shopping and I tried on this pair of yoga pants. I complained how my thighs looked large and I needed to lose weight and go to the gym more. She became noticeably upset and confessed that she thinks it\u2019s rude whenever I talk about my body in front of her. She said that because she needs to lose 70 plus pounds it makes her wonder what I think of her and just makes her uncomfortable. I told her she looks great and this wasn\u2019t about her. This was about myself. She asked me not to talk about how I need to lose weight in front of her anymore. Initially I agreed, but now I feel this was an unfair request. And yes, I know, I shouldn\u2019t talk like that anyways. But was I being rude to her when I spoke ill of my own body? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. So the user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for talking about their own body in front of their friend, who is also overweight. The friend got upset because when the author complained about their thighs and needing to lose weight, the friend felt it made her uncomfortable and made her wonder what the author thought about her.\n\nHmm. The author is 125 lbs, so they aren't overweight, but they have insecurities. Their friend is in a plus-size category. The author was trying on yoga pants and complaining about their body, which led the friend to feel self-conscious. The friend told the author it's rude, and now the author is questioning if they were wrong.\n\nI think the key here is about how talking about one's own body can affect others, even if it's about oneself. Even though the author is not part of the group the friend is in, sometimes when people talk about their own body dissatisfaction, it can trigger similar feelings in others. The friend might feel that if the author is self-critical, it's harder for her to feel confident, especially if she's in a different body size category. The author might not realize that their comments are creating a comparison or making the friend feel worse about herself.\n\nBut on the other hand, the author is also dealing with their own insecurities. They might not have intended to make the friend feel bad. The question is whether it's the author's responsibility to avoid talking about their body in front of someone who might be affected by it. \n\nIn some cases, people might feel that talking about their own body is a personal issue and shouldn't be judged, but the friend's reaction is valid. If someone asks you to stop doing something because it's hurting them, even if it's about you, respecting their feelings might be important. So maybe the author is in the wrong because even though it's their own body talk, it's causing harm to their friend. \n\nBut maybe it's not entirely the author's fault. They might not have realized the impact. However, after being told, they should consider the friend's request. The author agreed initially but now feels it's unfair. But the friend's feelings are valid. So perhaps the answer is A, the author is in the wrong because their comments, though about themselves, are affecting the friend negatively, and respecting the friend's boundaries is important.\n"
