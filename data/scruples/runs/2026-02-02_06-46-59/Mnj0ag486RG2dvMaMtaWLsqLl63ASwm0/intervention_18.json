I\u2019m not sure of her size but she needs to shop in plus size stores etc. Being 125 lbs, I realize I\u2019m not overweight, but I have insecurities like so many others. By the way, I think my friend looks great! She\u2019s a big girl and she\u2019s absolutely beautiful. The other day we were shopping and I tried on this pair of yoga pants. I complained how my thighs looked large and I needed to lose weight and go to the gym more. She became noticeably upset and confessed that she thinks it\u2019s rude whenever I talk about my body in front of her. She said that because she needs to lose 70 plus pounds it makes her wonder what I think of her and just makes her uncomfortable. I told her she looks great and this wasn\u2019t about her. This was about myself. She asked me not to talk about how I need to lose weight in front of her anymore. Initially I agreed, but now I feel this was an unfair request. And yes, I know, I shouldn\u2019t talk like that anyways. But was I being rude to her when I spoke ill of my own body? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for talking about their own body in front of their friend, who is plus-sized. The situation is that the author, who is 125 lbs and not overweight, makes comments about their thighs and needing to lose weight. The friend gets upset because she's trying to lose weight herself and it makes her uncomfortable when the author talks about their own body like that.\n\nFirst, I need to consider how the friend feels. Even though the author is talking about themselves, the friend might feel compared to the author or feel that the author is implying that her weight is a problem. The friend is in a plus-size store, so she's likely dealing with societal pressures and insecurities about her body. When someone she's close to expresses dissatisfaction with their own body, especially in the presence of someone who is also struggling with weight, it can trigger negative emotions. The friend might feel that the author's comments are indirectly criticizing her or adding to her own self-esteem issues.\n\nOn the other hand, the author is sharing their own insecurities. It's common for people to talk about their body image issues, and the author might not intend to hurt anyone. However, the key here is the impact on the friend. Even if the author's intention is to express their own feelings, the friend's reaction is valid and should be acknowledged. The author might not have considered how their words affect others, which is something to be mindful of in relationships.\n\nThe friend's request to not talk about weight in front of her is a boundary. The author agreed initially but now feels it's unfair. However, respecting the friend's feelings and boundaries is important for maintaining the relationship. Even if the author thinks they're just talking about themselves, their words can have an unintended effect. So, the author might need to adjust their behavior to respect the friend's comfort level.\n\nIn terms of whether the author is in the wrong, it's not about being rude in the traditional sense but about being insensitive to the friend's feelings. The author can still work on their own insecurities but in a way that doesn't negatively impact their friend. So, the answer would be that the author is in the wrong (A) because their comments, while about themselves, caused emotional distress to the friend, and they should have been more considerate of how their words might affect someone else who is also dealing with body image issues.\n"
