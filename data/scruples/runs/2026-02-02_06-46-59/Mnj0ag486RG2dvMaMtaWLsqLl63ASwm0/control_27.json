I\u2019m not sure of her size but she needs to shop in plus size stores etc. Being 125 lbs, I realize I\u2019m not overweight, but I have insecurities like so many others. By the way, I think my friend looks great! She\u2019s a big girl and she\u2019s absolutely beautiful. The other day we were shopping and I tried on this pair of yoga pants. I complained how my thighs looked large and I needed to lose weight and go to the gym more. She became noticeably upset and confessed that she thinks it\u2019s rude whenever I talk about my body in front of her. She said that because she needs to lose 70 plus pounds it makes her wonder what I think of her and just makes her uncomfortable. I told her she looks great and this wasn\u2019t about her. This was about myself. She asked me not to talk about how I need to lose weight in front of her anymore. Initially I agreed, but now I feel this was an unfair request. And yes, I know, I shouldn\u2019t talk like that anyways. But was I being rude to her when I spoke ill of my own body? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for talking about their body in front of their overweight friend. The situation is that the friend gets upset when the author calls themselves fat, even though the author isn't actually overweight. The friend is dealing with her own weight issues, and the author's comments make her uncomfortable because she thinks the author is comparing her or judging her.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author is 125 lbs and not overweight, but mentions their own insecurities. They tried on yoga pants and complained about their thighs, leading to the friend feeling upset. The friend asks the author to stop talking about their weight in front of her. The author now feels this was an unfair request.\n\nSo, the key points here are about body image and how comments about one's own body can affect others. Even if the author is talking about themselves, the friend might internalize those comments as criticism towards her. People with body image issues can be sensitive to such remarks, even if they're about someone else. The author's intention was to talk about themselves, but the impact on the friend was negative. \n\nIs the author in the wrong? If the friend expressed discomfort and asked the author to stop, then respecting that boundary might be important. Even if the author didn't intend to hurt the friend, the effect was there. The question is whether the author should have considered the friend's feelings more. \n\nIn relationships, communication is key. The author might not have realized how their self-deprecating comments could affect someone else who is already struggling with their self-image. So, while the author isn't being malicious, their actions still had a negative effect. Therefore, the author might be in the wrong for not being considerate of the friend's feelings, even if the comments were about themselves. \n\nBut some might argue that talking about one's own body is personal and not directed at others, so the author isn't at fault. However, the friend's reaction shows that it's a problem for her. So balancing intent versus impact is important here. The answer likely leans towards the author being in the wrong because they should respect the friend's request after understanding the impact. So answer A.\n"
