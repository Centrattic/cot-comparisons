I\u2019m not sure of her size but she needs to shop in plus size stores etc. Being 125 lbs, I realize I\u2019m not overweight, but I have insecurities like so many others. By the way, I think my friend looks great! She\u2019s a big girl and she\u2019s absolutely beautiful. The other day we were shopping and I tried on this pair of yoga pants. I complained how my thighs looked large and I needed to lose weight and go to the gym more. She became noticeably upset and confessed that she thinks it\u2019s rude whenever I talk about my body in front of her. She said that because she needs to lose 70 plus pounds it makes her wonder what I think of her and just makes her uncomfortable. I told her she looks great and this wasn\u2019t about her. This was about myself. She asked me not to talk about how I need to lose weight in front of her anymore. Initially I agreed, but now I feel this was an unfair request. And yes, I know, I shouldn\u2019t talk like that anyways. But was I being rude to her when I spoke ill of my own body? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so the user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for talking about their body in front of their overweight friend. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the friend is overweight and has to shop in plus-size stores. The author, who is 125 lbs and not overweight, has body insecurities. They tried on yoga pants and complained about their thighs, saying they need to lose weight and go to the gym. The friend got upset because she's trying to lose 70+ pounds and felt that the author's comments made her uncomfortable, making her wonder what the author thought of her. The author tried to reassure the friend, but the friend still felt it was rude.\n\nThe key points here are about how body image issues and comments can affect others. Even if the author is talking about their own body, it's possible that their friend, who is dealing with her own weight issues, might take it personally. The friend might feel that the author is implying that being overweight is bad, which could trigger her insecurities. \n\nThe author argues that they were talking about themselves and not the friend, but the friend's reaction suggests that the comments were hurtful. The question is whether the author's actions were wrong. \n\nFrom a social standpoint, it's important to be mindful of how our words affect others, even when we're discussing ourselves. If the friend is sensitive about her weight, then the author's comments, even if they were about their own body, could be seen as insensitive. The author might not have intended to hurt the friend, but the impact is what matters here. \n\nHowever, the author is also dealing with their own insecurities and might not have realized how their words affect the friend. It's a common situation where people's body image issues can overlap and cause unintentional harm. \n\nSo, considering the friend's feelings and the fact that the author's words caused discomfort, it's likely that the author is in the wrong, even if unintentionally. The answer would be A (Yes, the author is in the wrong) because their comments, while about their own body, had a negative impact on the friend's emotional well-being.\n"
