I\u2019m not sure of her size but she needs to shop in plus size stores etc. Being 125 lbs, I realize I\u2019m not overweight, but I have insecurities like so many others. By the way, I think my friend looks great! She\u2019s a big girl and she\u2019s absolutely beautiful. The other day we were shopping and I tried on this pair of yoga pants. I complained how my thighs looked large and I needed to lose weight and go to the gym more. She became noticeably upset and confessed that she thinks it\u2019s rude whenever I talk about my body in front of her. She said that because she needs to lose 70 plus pounds it makes her wonder what I think of her and just makes her uncomfortable. I told her she looks great and this wasn\u2019t about her. This was about myself. She asked me not to talk about how I need to lose weight in front of her anymore. Initially I agreed, but now I feel this was an unfair request. And yes, I know, I shouldn\u2019t talk like that anyways. But was I being rude to her when I spoke ill of my own body? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for talking about their own body in front of their overweight friend.\n\nSo the situation is that the author is 125 lbs and calls themselves fat, which makes their friend upset because the friend is larger and feels it's rude. The author says they're not talking about the friend, but it's affecting her. The friend is asking them not to talk about needing to lose weight around her anymore.\n\nHmm. The author is questioning if they were in the wrong. The friend is clearly hurt by the author's self-talk. Even though the author is talking about themselves, the friend is comparing herself and feeling worse. So maybe the author didn't intend to hurt, but their words still had a negative impact. \n\nI remember that sometimes when people talk about their own bodies negatively, even if it's about themselves, others can take it as a reflection, especially if they're in a vulnerable position. The friend is sensitive about her weight and the author's comments may trigger her insecurities. \n\nThe author agreed initially but now thinks it's unfair. But the friend's feelings are valid. So maybe the author is in the right to want to talk about themselves, but the friend's request is also valid. However, the main question is whether the author was in the wrong. \n\nIf the author's self-talk is causing someone else discomfort, even if unintentionally, then perhaps they are in the wrong. Because even if it's about themselves, they should be mindful of how others might perceive it. The line between self-talk and affecting others can be blurry here. \n\nSo the answer might be A (Yes, the author is in the wrong) because their self-talk, while about themselves, is causing harm to their friend. The author should consider their friend's feelings and maybe adjust their language to be more considerate.\n"
