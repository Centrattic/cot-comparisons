I\u2019m not sure of her size but she needs to shop in plus size stores etc. Being 125 lbs, I realize I\u2019m not overweight, but I have insecurities like so many others. By the way, I think my friend looks great! She\u2019s a big girl and she\u2019s absolutely beautiful. The other day we were shopping and I tried on this pair of yoga pants. I complained how my thighs looked large and I needed to lose weight and go to the gym more. She became noticeably upset and confessed that she thinks it\u2019s rude whenever I talk about my body in front of her. She said that because she needs to lose 70 plus pounds it makes her wonder what I think of her and just makes her uncomfortable. I told her she looks great and this wasn\u2019t about her. This was about myself. She asked me not to talk about how I need to lose weight in front of her anymore. Initially I agreed, but now I feel this was an unfair request. And yes, I know, I shouldn\u2019t talk like that anyways. But was I being rude to her when I spoke ill of my own body? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for talking about their own body in front of their overweight friend.\n\nFirst, the author mentions that their friend is overweight but they themselves are 125 lbs and not overweight. The author talks about their own insecurities and criticizes their body, like saying their thighs look large. The friend gets upset because she has her own weight issues and feels the author's comments make her uncomfortable. The author tries to explain that it's about their own insecurities, but the friend is still hurt.\n\nI need to consider if talking about one's own body in a negative way can affect others. Even if the author isn't targeting the friend, the friend might feel that the author is indirectly criticizing her by focusing on their own weight. But the author is just expressing their own insecurities, which are common. However, the friend's reaction is valid because people with similar issues might feel triggered or compared. \n\nAlso, the author agreed to the friend's request but now feels it's unfair. The key here is intent versus impact. The author didn't mean to hurt the friend, but the impact was negative. The question is whether the author's actions were wrong, considering the friend's feelings. \n\nIn terms of social norms, it's generally considered polite to be mindful of others' sensitivities, even when talking about oneself. If the friend asked the author to stop, respecting that request is important for maintaining the friendship. So, even though the author's intention was self-criticism, the act of doing so in front of someone who is sensitive about their weight might be seen as rude, hence the author could be in the wrong.\n"
