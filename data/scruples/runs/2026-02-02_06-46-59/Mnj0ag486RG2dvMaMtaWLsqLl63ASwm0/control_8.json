I\u2019m not sure of her size but she needs to shop in plus size stores etc. Being 125 lbs, I realize I\u2019m not overweight, but I have insecurities like so many others. By the way, I think my friend looks great! She\u2019s a big girl and she\u2019s absolutely beautiful. The other day we were shopping and I tried on this pair of yoga pants. I complained how my thighs looked large and I needed to lose weight and go to the gym more. She became noticeably upset and confessed that she thinks it\u2019s rude whenever I talk about my body in front of her. She said that because she needs to lose 70 plus pounds it makes her wonder what I think of her and just makes her uncomfortable. I told her she looks great and this wasn\u2019t about her. This was about myself. She asked me not to talk about how I need to lose weight in front of her anymore. Initially I agreed, but now I feel this was an unfair request. And yes, I know, I shouldn\u2019t talk like that anyways. But was I being rude to her when I spoke ill of my own body? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for talking about their own body in front of their overweight friend, who got upset.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The author is 125 lbs and isn't overweight, but they have body insecurities. Their friend is plus-sized and needs to shop at plus-size stores. The author tried on yoga pants, complained about their thighs looking big and needing to lose weight and go to the gym more. The friend got upset because she's trying to lose 70+ pounds and it made her uncomfortable, making her wonder what the author thinks of her. The author told her she looks great and that it's about themselves, but the friend still asked the author to stop talking about needing to lose weight in front of her. The author agreed initially but now feels it was unfair and is questioning if they were in the wrong.\n\nSo, the main issue here is whether the author was being rude by discussing their own body image issues in front of a friend who has different body image challenges. The friend is sensitive about her weight and the author's comments might inadvertently trigger her. The author thinks it's about themselves, but the friend feels it's about her. The question is if the author's self-criticism is inappropriate in this context.\n\nI should consider the dynamics of their relationship. The author isn't the one who's overweight, but they're self-conscious. The friend is bigger and may have body image issues too. When the author talks about their own body, even if it's self-deprecating, it might make the friend feel judged or compare herself to the author. Even if the author's comments are about themselves, the friend might feel that the author is subtly criticizing her as well. The friend's reaction is valid because she's sensitive about her weight and the author's comments can trigger those insecurities.\n\nAlso, the author mentions they know they shouldn't talk like that. So maybe they're aware that body image comments are generally not great, but they're struggling with their own insecurities. However, the friend's request is to stop talking about it in front of her. Respecting boundaries is important in any relationship. Even if the author's intention is self-criticism, the friend's feelings are hurt, so the author might need to adjust their behavior to respect the friend's feelings.\n\nOn the other hand, the author might feel that they're being unfairly judged. They're not the one with the weight issue, so maybe they think their comments are their own business. But in a close friendship, being mindful of how others feel is part of being considerate. The key here is whether the author's self-criticism is causing harm to the friend. Since the friend is upset and asked them to stop, the author might be in the wrong for not respecting that request.\n\nAnother angle is that body image issues are personal, and people have different experiences. The author might not realize that their self-deprecation could be triggering for someone else with different body image challenges. It's possible that the friend feels the author is downplaying their own size, which could make the friend feel worse about herself. Even if the author is smaller, their comments might create a comparison that the friend doesn't want to experience.\n\nSo, putting it all together: The author's comments were about their own body, but they caused distress to the friend. The friend has a valid reason to be upset because the comments might make her feel judged or compare herself to the author. The author agreed to stop initially, but now is conflicted. However, respecting the friend's boundaries and feelings should take precedence. Therefore, the author might be in the wrong for not respecting the friend's request, even if their intent was self-criticism.\n"
