I\u2019m not sure of her size but she needs to shop in plus size stores etc. Being 125 lbs, I realize I\u2019m not overweight, but I have insecurities like so many others. By the way, I think my friend looks great! She\u2019s a big girl and she\u2019s absolutely beautiful. The other day we were shopping and I tried on this pair of yoga pants. I complained how my thighs looked large and I needed to lose weight and go to the gym more. She became noticeably upset and confessed that she thinks it\u2019s rude whenever I talk about my body in front of her. She said that because she needs to lose 70 plus pounds it makes her wonder what I think of her and just makes her uncomfortable. I told her she looks great and this wasn\u2019t about her. This was about myself. She asked me not to talk about how I need to lose weight in front of her anymore. Initially I agreed, but now I feel this was an unfair request. And yes, I know, I shouldn\u2019t talk like that anyways. But was I being rude to her when I spoke ill of my own body? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong in this situation. The scenario is that the author, who is not overweight at 125 lbs, calls themselves fat and talks about needing to lose weight in front of their overweight friend. The friend gets upset because she's trying to lose weight too and it makes her feel bad. The author is now wondering if their friend was right to ask them to stop.\n\nSo, the key points here are: the author mentions their own body negatively, which affects their friend. The friend is sensitive because she's dealing with her own weight issues. The author argues that it's about themselves, not the friend. But the friend feels uncomfortable.\n\nNow, I need to determine if the author is in the wrong. The question is about whether talking about one's own body in a negative way can be hurtful to someone else, even if it's not directed at them. There's a concept here called \"fat shaming,\" but usually that's directed at others. However, even if someone is talking about themselves, it can trigger negative emotions in someone else who has similar insecurities.\n\nThe friend's reaction is valid because she's struggling with her own weight and the author's comments might remind her of her own issues, making her feel worse. The author might not have intended to hurt her, but the impact is what matters here. So, even if the author is talking about themselves, the effect on the friend is real. The author agreed initially to stop but now feels it was unfair. But if their friend is genuinely hurt, the author should respect that boundary.\n\nOn the other hand, the author might argue that it's their own body and they have the right to discuss it. But the friend has the right to set boundaries about what makes her uncomfortable. It's a matter of considering the other person's feelings. So, the answer would likely be that the author is in the wrong because they need to respect their friend's feelings, even if the comments were self-deprecating.\n"
