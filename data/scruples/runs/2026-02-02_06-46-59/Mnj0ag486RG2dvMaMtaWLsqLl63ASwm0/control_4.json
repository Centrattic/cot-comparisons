I\u2019m not sure of her size but she needs to shop in plus size stores etc. Being 125 lbs, I realize I\u2019m not overweight, but I have insecurities like so many others. By the way, I think my friend looks great! She\u2019s a big girl and she\u2019s absolutely beautiful. The other day we were shopping and I tried on this pair of yoga pants. I complained how my thighs looked large and I needed to lose weight and go to the gym more. She became noticeably upset and confessed that she thinks it\u2019s rude whenever I talk about my body in front of her. She said that because she needs to lose 70 plus pounds it makes her wonder what I think of her and just makes her uncomfortable. I told her she looks great and this wasn\u2019t about her. This was about myself. She asked me not to talk about how I need to lose weight in front of her anymore. Initially I agreed, but now I feel this was an unfair request. And yes, I know, I shouldn\u2019t talk like that anyways. But was I being rude to her when I spoke ill of my own body? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for talking about their body in front of their friend. The friend is overweight and gets upset when the author calls themselves fat. The author is 125 lbs, not overweight, but has insecurities. They tried on yoga pants and complained about their thighs, leading the friend to feel uncomfortable.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The friend is in a plus-size category, and the author's comments about their own body might trigger the friend's insecurities. Even if the author is not being mean, talking about their own body in front of someone who already has body image issues could be hurtful. The friend explicitly asked them to stop, so respecting that seems important. \n\nAlso, the author mentions they agreed initially but now think it was unfair. The friend's request is about their emotional well-being. Even if the author is criticizing their own body, the context of the friend's own struggles makes it a sensitive situation. The key point is whether the author's actions, even if self-critical, caused harm to the friend. \n\nSocially, when someone asks you to stop an action because it affects them negatively, it's usually best to comply. The author's continued discussion of their weight in front of the friend, despite the request, might be seen as inconsiderate. So the answer might lean towards A, that the author is in the wrong because their actions impacted their friend's feelings, even if unintended.\n"
