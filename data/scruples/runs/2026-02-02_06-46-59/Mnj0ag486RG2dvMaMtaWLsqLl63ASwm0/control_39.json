I\u2019m not sure of her size but she needs to shop in plus size stores etc. Being 125 lbs, I realize I\u2019m not overweight, but I have insecurities like so many others. By the way, I think my friend looks great! She\u2019s a big girl and she\u2019s absolutely beautiful. The other day we were shopping and I tried on this pair of yoga pants. I complained how my thighs looked large and I needed to lose weight and go to the gym more. She became noticeably upset and confessed that she thinks it\u2019s rude whenever I talk about my body in front of her. She said that because she needs to lose 70 plus pounds it makes her wonder what I think of her and just makes her uncomfortable. I told her she looks great and this wasn\u2019t about her. This was about myself. She asked me not to talk about how I need to lose weight in front of her anymore. Initially I agreed, but now I feel this was an unfair request. And yes, I know, I shouldn\u2019t talk like that anyways. But was I being rude to her when I spoke ill of my own body? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person in the scenario is in the wrong. The situation is about a friend who is upset when the author calls herself fat, even though the author is not overweight. The friend is plus-sized and the author is 125 lbs. The author tried on yoga pants, commented on her thighs looking big and needing to lose weight, which made her friend uncomfortable. The friend says it's rude because she herself needs to lose weight and feels judged.\n\nSo the question is whether the author was wrong to talk about her own body in front of her friend. Let me break this down. The author is talking about her own insecurities and body image, which is a personal issue. But her friend interprets it as a comparison or judgment because she's also dealing with her own body image issues. \n\nI think the key here is about sensitivity and how others might react. Even if the author's intention was to talk about herself, her friend might feel that the author is indirectly making her feel worse. The friend is already dealing with her own self-esteem issues, so hearing someone else talk about their body in a negative way, even if it's not directed at her, could trigger her insecurities. \n\nThe author says she agreed initially to stop talking about it but now feels it was unfair. The friend's request is about her own comfort. So maybe the author isn't wrong in a direct sense, but she should have considered her friend's feelings. However, the friend's reaction is valid because she has her own struggles. \n\nBut the question is whether the author is in the wrong. If the author is talking about her own body, it's not inherently rude, but if it's causing someone else distress, then maybe it's something to be mindful of. The friend's sensitivity is important here. Since the friend asked the author to stop, and the author agreed, maybe the author is in a bit of a dilemma. But the friend's feelings are valid, so the author might have been inconsiderate without malicious intent. \n\nI think the answer is A, the author is in the wrong because even though she was talking about herself, her comments caused her friend discomfort. The friend's request is about her emotional well-being, and the author should respect that. Even if the author thinks it's about herself, the impact on the friend matters. So the author needs to adjust her behavior to respect her friend's feelings.\n"
