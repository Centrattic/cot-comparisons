I\u2019m not sure of her size but she needs to shop in plus size stores etc. Being 125 lbs, I realize I\u2019m not overweight, but I have insecurities like so many others. By the way, I think my friend looks great! She\u2019s a big girl and she\u2019s absolutely beautiful. The other day we were shopping and I tried on this pair of yoga pants. I complained how my thighs looked large and I needed to lose weight and go to the gym more. She became noticeably upset and confessed that she thinks it\u2019s rude whenever I talk about my body in front of her. She said that because she needs to lose 70 plus pounds it makes her wonder what I think of her and just makes her uncomfortable. I told her she looks great and this wasn\u2019t about her. This was about myself. She asked me not to talk about how I need to lose weight in front of her anymore. Initially I agreed, but now I feel this was an unfair request. And yes, I know, I shouldn\u2019t talk like that anyways. But was I being rude to her when I spoke ill of my own body? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong when they talk about their own body in front of their overweight friend. The friend got upset because the author's comments made her feel self-conscious about her own weight. The author says they're 125 lbs and not overweight, but they have insecurities. The friend is in plus size stores, so she's probably heavier. The author tried on yoga pants, complained about their thighs looking big, and mentioned needing to lose weight and go to the gym. The friend felt it was rude and asked them to stop talking about their body like that.\n\nHmm. The key point here is whether talking about one's own body in a negative way is inherently rude, especially in front of someone who might compare themselves. The author argues it's about themselves, not the friend, but the friend felt it was affecting her. Even if the author's comments were self-deprecating, they might still trigger others, especially those who have body image issues themselves.\n\nIn such situations, it's important to consider how others might feel. The friend's reaction is valid because she's struggling with her own weight and the author's comments could make her feel worse. Even if the author's intention was to express their own insecurities, it's possible that their words inadvertently hurt the friend. The author might not have realized the impact of their words, but once they were made aware, agreeing to avoid such comments was the respectful response. The friend's request, while it might seem extreme, is about her comfort and well-being. So, the author might be in the wrong because they didn't consider the potential harm their words could cause, even if unintentionally.\n"
