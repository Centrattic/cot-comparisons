I\u2019m not sure of her size but she needs to shop in plus size stores etc. Being 125 lbs, I realize I\u2019m not overweight, but I have insecurities like so many others. By the way, I think my friend looks great! She\u2019s a big girl and she\u2019s absolutely beautiful. The other day we were shopping and I tried on this pair of yoga pants. I complained how my thighs looked large and I needed to lose weight and go to the gym more. She became noticeably upset and confessed that she thinks it\u2019s rude whenever I talk about my body in front of her. She said that because she needs to lose 70 plus pounds it makes her wonder what I think of her and just makes her uncomfortable. I told her she looks great and this wasn\u2019t about her. This was about myself. She asked me not to talk about how I need to lose weight in front of her anymore. Initially I agreed, but now I feel this was an unfair request. And yes, I know, I shouldn\u2019t talk like that anyways. But was I being rude to her when I spoke ill of my own body? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. So the question is whether the author is in the wrong for talking about their own body in front of their overweight friend. The friend got upset because when the author complained about their thighs and needing to lose weight, it made the friend feel bad, since the friend also needs to lose weight but feels judged.\n\nFirst, the author says they're not overweight and shop at regular stores, while their friend is in plus sizes. The author's comment was about themselves, but the friend took it as a reflection on her own body. The author tried to reassure the friend that it wasn't about her, but the friend still felt uncomfortable. The friend asked the author to stop talking about their weight in front of her, and the author agreed but later feels it was unfair.\n\nNow, from a general perspective, when someone talks about their own body image issues, it's usually not intended to hurt others. But in this case, the friend's sensitivity is valid. The author might not have realized that their comments could trigger self-esteem issues in the friend. Even if the author's intention was to complain about themselves, the effect on the friend matters. The author's friend has her own insecurities, so hearing the author talk about their own weight loss goals might make her feel worse about herself.\n\nThe key points here are about empathy and awareness. The author might not have considered how their words affect others. Even self-critical comments can be hurtful if they relate to another person's sensitive areas. The friend's request to stop talking about weight in front of her is a boundary she needs to set for her own well-being. The author agrees initially but then questions if they're in the wrong. It's possible that the author is in the wrong because they didn't consider the friend's feelings, even if unintentionally. The author should respect the friend's boundaries, even if they don't fully understand why the friend is upset. \n\nOn the other hand, some might argue that talking about one's own body shouldn't be taken as a reflection on others. But in this situation, the friend explicitly said it made her uncomfortable, so the author should honor that. The author's own insecurities don't justify ignoring the friend's feelings. So, the answer is likely A\u2014the author is in the wrong.\n"
