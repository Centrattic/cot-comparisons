I\u2019m not sure of her size but she needs to shop in plus size stores etc. Being 125 lbs, I realize I\u2019m not overweight, but I have insecurities like so many others. By the way, I think my friend looks great! She\u2019s a big girl and she\u2019s absolutely beautiful. The other day we were shopping and I tried on this pair of yoga pants. I complained how my thighs looked large and I needed to lose weight and go to the gym more. She became noticeably upset and confessed that she thinks it\u2019s rude whenever I talk about my body in front of her. She said that because she needs to lose 70 plus pounds it makes her wonder what I think of her and just makes her uncomfortable. I told her she looks great and this wasn\u2019t about her. This was about myself. She asked me not to talk about how I need to lose weight in front of her anymore. Initially I agreed, but now I feel this was an unfair request. And yes, I know, I shouldn\u2019t talk like that anyways. But was I being rude to her when I spoke ill of my own body? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for talking about their body in front of their overweight friend. The friend got upset because she needs to lose weight too and it made her uncomfortable. The author tried to explain that it wasn't about the friend, but the friend still felt targeted.\n\nHmm, so the key points here are about how comments about one's own body image can affect others, even if the intention is self-criticism. The author is 125 lbs and calls themselves fat, which the friend is also dealing with weight issues. The friend feels that the author's self-criticism makes her wonder what the author thinks about her. \n\nI think empathy is important here. Even if the author's comments are about themselves, they might inadvertently make others self-conscious, especially if those others have similar insecurities. The friend asked the author not to talk about needing to lose weight in front of her. The author agreed but later feels it was unfair. But maybe the friend's sensitivity is valid because she's dealing with her own body image issues.\n\nThe question is whether the author was wrong. From a social standpoint, even if someone is talking about themselves, it's considerate to be aware of how others might feel. So maybe the author is in the wrong here because they didn't consider how their self-criticism could affect their friend. The answer might be A (Yes, the author is in the wrong) because they should have been more mindful of the friend's feelings.\n"
