I\u2019m not sure of her size but she needs to shop in plus size stores etc. Being 125 lbs, I realize I\u2019m not overweight, but I have insecurities like so many others. By the way, I think my friend looks great! She\u2019s a big girl and she\u2019s absolutely beautiful. The other day we were shopping and I tried on this pair of yoga pants. I complained how my thighs looked large and I needed to lose weight and go to the gym more. She became noticeably upset and confessed that she thinks it\u2019s rude whenever I talk about my body in front of her. She said that because she needs to lose 70 plus pounds it makes her wonder what I think of her and just makes her uncomfortable. I told her she looks great and this wasn\u2019t about her. This was about myself. She asked me not to talk about how I need to lose weight in front of her anymore. Initially I agreed, but now I feel this was an unfair request. And yes, I know, I shouldn\u2019t talk like that anyways. But was I being rude to her when I spoke ill of my own body? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for talking about their own body in a way that upset their overweight friend. The friend is sensitive because she's trying to lose weight and feels the author's comments make her uncomfortable.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The author is 125 lbs, not overweight, but has insecurities. The friend is in a plus-size category and is trying to lose weight. The author was talking about their own thighs and needing to lose weight, which made the friend upset. The friend feels it's rude because she's dealing with her own weight issues and the author's comments make her self-conscious about her own body.\n\nThe author argues that the comments were about themselves, not the friend, and now feel the friend's request is unfair. But the key point is whether the author's self-deprecating remarks, even if not intended to target the friend, had a negative impact. \n\nIn many cases, when someone is struggling with body image issues, hearing others\u2014especially friends\u2014talk about their own weight in a negative light can trigger similar feelings. It's about empathy here. Even if the author isn't directly criticizing the friend, the act of self-criticism can reflect poorly on the friend's self-esteem, especially if the friend is already sensitive about her own weight. \n\nThe question is whether the author should avoid such comments if it affects their friend. The friend is within her rights to ask for that, as her feelings are valid. The author might not see the connection, but the impact is real. So, the author might be in the wrong for not considering how their words affect others, even if they're talking about themselves. \n\nHowever, there's a balance. People should be allowed to express their own insecurities. But in this context, since the friend is particularly sensitive, maybe the author should adjust their behavior. The answer might depend on the broader relationship and communication. But based on the situation described, the author's actions did cause pain, so they might be at least partially at fault. \n\nSo, the answer is A. The author is in the wrong because their self-criticism negatively affected their friend's feelings, even if unintentionally.\n"
