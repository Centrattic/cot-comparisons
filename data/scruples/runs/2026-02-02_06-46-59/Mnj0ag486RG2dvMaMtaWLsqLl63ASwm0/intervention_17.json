I\u2019m not sure of her size but she needs to shop in plus size stores etc. Being 125 lbs, I realize I\u2019m not overweight, but I have insecurities like so many others. By the way, I think my friend looks great! She\u2019s a big girl and she\u2019s absolutely beautiful. The other day we were shopping and I tried on this pair of yoga pants. I complained how my thighs looked large and I needed to lose weight and go to the gym more. She became noticeably upset and confessed that she thinks it\u2019s rude whenever I talk about my body in front of her. She said that because she needs to lose 70 plus pounds it makes her wonder what I think of her and just makes her uncomfortable. I told her she looks great and this wasn\u2019t about her. This was about myself. She asked me not to talk about how I need to lose weight in front of her anymore. Initially I agreed, but now I feel this was an unfair request. And yes, I know, I shouldn\u2019t talk like that anyways. But was I being rude to her when I spoke ill of my own body? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for talking about their own body in front of their overweight friend, who got upset.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The author is 125 lbs, not overweight, but has insecurities. Their friend is in a plus-size category and wants to lose 70+ pounds. When the author complained about their thighs in yoga pants, the friend got upset, feeling triggered. The friend thinks it's rude for the author to talk about their weight in her presence because it makes her self-conscious. The author argues it's about their own insecurities and not about the friend.\n\nSo, the question is whether the author was rude or not. The friend's reaction is valid because body image issues are sensitive. Even if the author is talking about themselves, the friend might feel judged or compared. The key here is intent vs. impact. The author didn't mean to hurt the friend, but the impact was negative. \n\nIn many cases, when someone talks about their own body in front of someone else who has different body image issues, it can be hurtful regardless of intent. The friend's request not to talk about it is a boundary the author should respect. The author might think it's not about the friend, but the friend's perspective is important. The author could adjust their behavior to respect the friend's feelings without necessarily changing their own insecurities.\n\nSo, the answer is likely A (the author is in the wrong) because even though they were talking about themselves, it affected the friend negatively, and respecting the friend's boundaries is essential. The author's initial agreement to stop talking about it shows they should honor that to maintain the friendship.\n"
