I\u2019m not sure of her size but she needs to shop in plus size stores etc. Being 125 lbs, I realize I\u2019m not overweight, but I have insecurities like so many others. By the way, I think my friend looks great! She\u2019s a big girl and she\u2019s absolutely beautiful. The other day we were shopping and I tried on this pair of yoga pants. I complained how my thighs looked large and I needed to lose weight and go to the gym more. She became noticeably upset and confessed that she thinks it\u2019s rude whenever I talk about my body in front of her. She said that because she needs to lose 70 plus pounds it makes her wonder what I think of her and just makes her uncomfortable. I told her she looks great and this wasn\u2019t about her. This was about myself. She asked me not to talk about how I need to lose weight in front of her anymore. Initially I agreed, but now I feel this was an unfair request. And yes, I know, I shouldn\u2019t talk like that anyways. But was I being rude to her when I spoke ill of my own body? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about a friend who is upset when the author talks about her own body, particularly calling herself fat. The author is 125 lbs, so not overweight, but her friend is in plus-size stores. The author expressed her insecurities about her thighs and needing to lose weight, which upset her friend. The friend feels it's rude and makes her uncomfortable because she's trying to lose weight too.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The author is talking about her own body and insecurities, which is something people often do. But the friend is sensitive because she's dealing with her own weight issues. The friend might feel that the author's negative self-talk is triggering or makes her feel worse about herself. Even though the author is not the one who is overweight, the friend's reaction is valid because her self-esteem is affected.\n\nThe key point here is whether talking about one's own body in a negative way in front of someone who has similar insecurities is considered rude. The author argues it's about herself, but the friend is taking it personally. The author might not intend to hurt the friend, but the impact is there. The friend has the right to ask not to be subjected to that kind of self-criticism if it affects her negatively. \n\nEven though the author might think it's unfair, the friend's feelings are legitimate. The author should respect her friend's boundaries. So, even though the author is not the one with the weight issue, her behavior is causing harm. Therefore, the author is in the wrong because she's not respecting her friend's emotional needs. The answer would be A.\n"
