I\u2019m not sure of her size but she needs to shop in plus size stores etc. Being 125 lbs, I realize I\u2019m not overweight, but I have insecurities like so many others. By the way, I think my friend looks great! She\u2019s a big girl and she\u2019s absolutely beautiful. The other day we were shopping and I tried on this pair of yoga pants. I complained how my thighs looked large and I needed to lose weight and go to the gym more. She became noticeably upset and confessed that she thinks it\u2019s rude whenever I talk about my body in front of her. She said that because she needs to lose 70 plus pounds it makes her wonder what I think of her and just makes her uncomfortable. I told her she looks great and this wasn\u2019t about her. This was about myself. She asked me not to talk about how I need to lose weight in front of her anymore. Initially I agreed, but now I feel this was an unfair request. And yes, I know, I shouldn\u2019t talk like that anyways. But was I being rude to her when I spoke ill of my own body? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is that the author is a thinner person who calls themselves fat, and their overweight friend gets upset. The friend explains that hearing the author talk about wanting to lose weight makes her feel bad because she has her own weight issues. The author argues that they were talking about themselves and not the friend, but the friend feels uncomfortable.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both perspectives. The author might feel that discussing their own body image is personal and not directed at anyone else. They might think that since they're not the one with weight issues, their comments don't affect the friend. However, the friend is clearly hurt by these comments, even if the author isn't targeting her. The friend's reaction shows that the author's words are having an impact, which the author might not have anticipated.\n\nThen there's the social aspect. Sometimes, when someone is struggling with their own body image, talking about it in front of someone else who has different experiences can be triggering. The friend might feel that the author's self-criticism reinforces negative body image for her, making her feel like her own issues are being judged indirectly. Even if the author isn't intending to, the friend could interpret the comments as a comparison or a reflection of societal standards that she also faces.\n\nAlso, the author mentions that they agreed initially to stop talking about their weight in front of the friend but now feel it was an unfair request. This suggests there's some conflict between the author's need to express their insecurities and the friend's need to feel comfortable. The author might not realize that their words, while self-directed, can still harm others. \n\nIs it the author's responsibility to be mindful of how their self-talk affects others? In many social contexts, yes. People often don't consider that their self-deprecating comments can influence others, especially those with similar or different body image issues. The friend is asking for consideration, which the author is now questioning. \n\nOn the other hand, the author isn't being mean-spirited; they're voicing their own insecurities. But the impact on the friend is real. It's possible that the author isn't in the wrong for expressing their feelings, but they might not be considering the friend's perspective enough. The key here is whether the author's actions, even if well-intentioned, are causing harm. If the friend is uncomfortable, it's reasonable for her to ask the author to stop. The author might need to find another way to discuss their body image without affecting the friend negatively. \n\nSo, weighing both sides, the author might not be entirely wrong, but they are responsible for being considerate of the friend's feelings. The friend's request is valid because the author's comments are affecting her. Therefore, the author should adjust their behavior, even if it's about themselves. Therefore, the answer might be that the author is in the wrong.\n"
