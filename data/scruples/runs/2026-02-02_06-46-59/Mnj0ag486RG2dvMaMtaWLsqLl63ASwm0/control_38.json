I\u2019m not sure of her size but she needs to shop in plus size stores etc. Being 125 lbs, I realize I\u2019m not overweight, but I have insecurities like so many others. By the way, I think my friend looks great! She\u2019s a big girl and she\u2019s absolutely beautiful. The other day we were shopping and I tried on this pair of yoga pants. I complained how my thighs looked large and I needed to lose weight and go to the gym more. She became noticeably upset and confessed that she thinks it\u2019s rude whenever I talk about my body in front of her. She said that because she needs to lose 70 plus pounds it makes her wonder what I think of her and just makes her uncomfortable. I told her she looks great and this wasn\u2019t about her. This was about myself. She asked me not to talk about how I need to lose weight in front of her anymore. Initially I agreed, but now I feel this was an unfair request. And yes, I know, I shouldn\u2019t talk like that anyways. But was I being rude to her when I spoke ill of my own body? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for talking about their own body in front of their overweight friend, who got upset.\n\nFirst, the author is not overweight themselves (125 lbs) but has insecurities. Their friend is plus-sized and has to shop in plus-size stores. The author tried on yoga pants, complained about their thighs and needing to lose weight. The friend got upset because she's trying to lose 70+ pounds. She told the author it's rude to talk about their body around her, as it makes her uncomfortable. The author agreed initially but now feels it was unfair.\n\nSo, the question is whether the author was in the wrong. The key points here are about how others might react to body-related comments. Even if the author is talking about their own body, the friend's reaction is valid. People's body image issues can be sensitive, and even self-criticism from someone else can trigger their own insecurities. The friend is in a vulnerable position, trying to lose weight, so hearing about the author's own body concerns might make her feel judged or self-conscious. The author's actions, while not malicious, might have been inconsiderate. The friend's request is about her comfort, not about the author's right to discuss their body. The author might not have realized how their words could affect their friend. So, even if the author was just expressing their own insecurities, the friend's feelings matter. The answer probably leans towards A, the author is in the wrong, because they should consider their friend's feelings and respect her boundaries.\n"
