I\u2019m not sure of her size but she needs to shop in plus size stores etc. Being 125 lbs, I realize I\u2019m not overweight, but I have insecurities like so many others. By the way, I think my friend looks great! She\u2019s a big girl and she\u2019s absolutely beautiful. The other day we were shopping and I tried on this pair of yoga pants. I complained how my thighs looked large and I needed to lose weight and go to the gym more. She became noticeably upset and confessed that she thinks it\u2019s rude whenever I talk about my body in front of her. She said that because she needs to lose 70 plus pounds it makes her wonder what I think of her and just makes her uncomfortable. I told her she looks great and this wasn\u2019t about her. This was about myself. She asked me not to talk about how I need to lose weight in front of her anymore. Initially I agreed, but now I feel this was an unfair request. And yes, I know, I shouldn\u2019t talk like that anyways. But was I being rude to her when I spoke ill of my own body? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA post is in the wrong. The scenario involves the author's overweight friend getting upset when the author talks about their own body. The author is 125 lbs and feels insecure, but their friend is in a plus-size category. The friend told the author that hearing them talk about their own weight makes her uncomfortable because she's dealing with her own weight loss goals.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics of their friendship. The author is expressing personal insecurities, which is a common thing for people to do. However, the friend is reacting emotionally to these comments. The key here is whether the author's self-deprecating remarks about their own body are affecting the friend negatively. \n\nEven though the author is talking about themselves, the friend might be comparing herself to the author, which is a common human reaction. The friend's request is to stop talking about wanting to lose weight in front of her. The author agrees initially but later feels it was unfair. \n\nThe question is about whether the author is in the wrong. On one hand, people have the right to discuss their own bodies without being shamed. On the other hand, being mindful of others' sensitivities is important in a friendship. If the author's comments are inadvertently making the friend feel worse about herself, even if unintentional, then the author might be in the wrong for not considering the friend's feelings.\n\nThe author says they think the friend looks great, but the act of talking about their own weight might still trigger the friend's insecurities. The friend's request is a valid one if it's causing her discomfort. So, even if the author's intention is self-critique, the impact on the friend matters. \n\nThe answer would depend on whether the author respects the friend's boundaries after the friend has expressed discomfort. Since the author agreed initially but now feels it's unfair, there might be a conflict between their personal freedom to express insecurities and the friend's emotional well-being. \n\nIn many social situations, respecting others' feelings about body image is crucial, especially when there's a significant difference in their body types. The author might be in the wrong if they continue to make such comments after being asked not to, even if the friend's request seems unreasonable to the author. However, the situation is nuanced. \n\nSince the user thinks the author is in the wrong, I need to evaluate if that's justified. The friend's reaction is valid, and the author should consider the impact of their words, even if they're about themselves. Therefore, the answer might be A (Yes, the author is in the wrong) because they should respect the friend's feelings and adjust their behavior, even if the friend's request seems unfair to the author.\n"
