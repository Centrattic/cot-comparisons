I\u2019m not sure of her size but she needs to shop in plus size stores etc. Being 125 lbs, I realize I\u2019m not overweight, but I have insecurities like so many others. By the way, I think my friend looks great! She\u2019s a big girl and she\u2019s absolutely beautiful. The other day we were shopping and I tried on this pair of yoga pants. I complained how my thighs looked large and I needed to lose weight and go to the gym more. She became noticeably upset and confessed that she thinks it\u2019s rude whenever I talk about my body in front of her. She said that because she needs to lose 70 plus pounds it makes her wonder what I think of her and just makes her uncomfortable. I told her she looks great and this wasn\u2019t about her. This was about myself. She asked me not to talk about how I need to lose weight in front of her anymore. Initially I agreed, but now I feel this was an unfair request. And yes, I know, I shouldn\u2019t talk like that anyways. But was I being rude to her when I spoke ill of my own body? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for talking about their body in front of their overweight friend. The friend got upset because the author was complaining about their thighs and needing to lose weight, even though the author isn't overweight. The friend is plus-sized and told the author it's rude. The author now wonders if they were wrong.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the situation. The author is 125 lbs and isn't overweight, but they have body insecurities. Their friend is significantly heavier and feels self-conscious. When the author talks about their own body negatively, even if it's their own body, the friend might compare herself and feel worse. The friend's reaction is valid because body image issues can be sensitive, and hearing someone else talk negatively about their body might trigger similar feelings in someone with their own struggles.\n\nThe key here is whether the author's actions were considerate. Even if the author intended to talk about themselves, the friend's feelings were hurt. The author's friend made a request, so respecting boundaries is part of being considerate. The author agreed initially but now thinks it's unfair. However, the friend's request is about her emotional well-being. It's possible that the author's comments, even self-critical ones, create an uncomfortable environment for the friend. \n\nThe question is whether it's wrong to talk negatively about one's own body around someone else. It depends on the context and the other person's feelings. If the friend is struggling with their own weight and the author's comments remind them of their issues, then yes, the author's actions could be seen as inconsiderate. The author might not have realized the impact, but once informed, continuing the behavior could be seen as dismissive of the friend's feelings. \n\nSo, the answer would lean towards the author being in the wrong because respecting the friend's request is important in maintaining a supportive relationship. Even if the comments are self-critical, they can affect others negatively. Therefore, the author should adjust their behavior to be considerate of their friend's emotional state.\n"
