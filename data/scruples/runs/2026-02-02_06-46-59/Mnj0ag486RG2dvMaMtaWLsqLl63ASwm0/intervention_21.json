I\u2019m not sure of her size but she needs to shop in plus size stores etc. Being 125 lbs, I realize I\u2019m not overweight, but I have insecurities like so many others. By the way, I think my friend looks great! She\u2019s a big girl and she\u2019s absolutely beautiful. The other day we were shopping and I tried on this pair of yoga pants. I complained how my thighs looked large and I needed to lose weight and go to the gym more. She became noticeably upset and confessed that she thinks it\u2019s rude whenever I talk about my body in front of her. She said that because she needs to lose 70 plus pounds it makes her wonder what I think of her and just makes her uncomfortable. I told her she looks great and this wasn\u2019t about her. This was about myself. She asked me not to talk about how I need to lose weight in front of her anymore. Initially I agreed, but now I feel this was an unfair request. And yes, I know, I shouldn\u2019t talk like that anyways. But was I being rude to her when I spoke ill of my own body? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for talking about their own body in front of their overweight friend. The friend got upset because she thinks the author's negative comments about their own weight made her feel judged, even though the author wasn't targeting her.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The author is 125 lbs and calls themselves fat, which is a lower weight compared to their friend who shops in plus-size stores. However, the author has insecurities. When they were shopping, they tried on yoga pants and complained about their thighs and needing to lose weight. The friend felt uncomfortable because she's trying to lose weight too and it made her question how the author saw her.\n\nThe key point is that the author was discussing their own body image issues, which the friend interpreted as a comparison or judgment. Even if the author didn't mean to target the friend, the friend's feelings are valid. People can be sensitive about their own insecurities, and hearing someone else talk negatively about their body might trigger those feelings, especially if they struggle with similar issues.\n\nThe author claims they're not being rude, but the friend felt it was rude. Intentions matter, but so do the effects on others. The author agreed initially to stop but later felt it was unfair. However, it's important to respect others' boundaries. If someone asks you not to talk about certain things that make them uncomfortable, it's considerate to comply, even if you don't see the issue immediately. The author might not have realized the impact of their words, but the friend's reaction is a sign that their comments were hurting her, regardless of the author's intent.\n\nSo, considering both perspectives, the author might be in the wrong because they didn't consider how their self-criticism could affect their friend's feelings. Even if the author's intention was self-improvement, the friend's emotional response shows that the communication was harmful. The author should have been more mindful of the friend's sensitivity and respected her request to avoid such discussions.\n"
