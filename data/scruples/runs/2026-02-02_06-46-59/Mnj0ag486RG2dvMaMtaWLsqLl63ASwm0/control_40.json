I\u2019m not sure of her size but she needs to shop in plus size stores etc. Being 125 lbs, I realize I\u2019m not overweight, but I have insecurities like so many others. By the way, I think my friend looks great! She\u2019s a big girl and she\u2019s absolutely beautiful. The other day we were shopping and I tried on this pair of yoga pants. I complained how my thighs looked large and I needed to lose weight and go to the gym more. She became noticeably upset and confessed that she thinks it\u2019s rude whenever I talk about my body in front of her. She said that because she needs to lose 70 plus pounds it makes her wonder what I think of her and just makes her uncomfortable. I told her she looks great and this wasn\u2019t about her. This was about myself. She asked me not to talk about how I need to lose weight in front of her anymore. Initially I agreed, but now I feel this was an unfair request. And yes, I know, I shouldn\u2019t talk like that anyways. But was I being rude to her when I spoke ill of my own body? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, so the user is asking whether the author is in the wrong here. Let me break this down.\n\nThe situation is that the author, who is not overweight, is talking about their own body, specifically their thighs and needing to lose weight, in front of their overweight friend. The friend gets upset because she feels that when the author talks about their own weight, it makes the friend feel judged or uncomfortable. The author is now questioning if they were in the wrong.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics of body image and self-talk. The author is expressing their own insecurities, which is common. But the friend is sensitive because she's in a different situation\u2014she's overweight and might be struggling with her own body image. Even though the author is talking about themselves, the friend could feel that such comments are triggering or reminiscent of the negative messages she might receive about her weight.\n\nThe friend's reaction is valid because people's sensitivities can vary a lot. Even if the author isn't intentionally targeting the friend, the friend's feelings are real. The author acknowledged that they agreed to stop talking about their weight in front of the friend, which shows some willingness to respect the friend's feelings. However, the author is now doubting if that was unfair. \n\nNow, the question is whether the author was in the wrong. On one hand, the author was talking about themselves, which isn't inherently wrong. But in a context where it affects a friend's emotional well-being, there's a social responsibility to be considerate. The friend's request is about creating a safe space for both parties. The author might not have realized the impact of their self-deprecating remarks on the friend.\n\nSo, even though the author's intention wasn't to hurt the friend, the effect was negative. In such cases, empathy and adjusting behavior to respect others' feelings is important. The answer here would likely be A, the author is in the wrong because their self-talk, while about themselves, negatively impacted the friend's comfort and the friend's request to stop is reasonable.\n"
