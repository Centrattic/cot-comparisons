I\u2019m not sure of her size but she needs to shop in plus size stores etc. Being 125 lbs, I realize I\u2019m not overweight, but I have insecurities like so many others. By the way, I think my friend looks great! She\u2019s a big girl and she\u2019s absolutely beautiful. The other day we were shopping and I tried on this pair of yoga pants. I complained how my thighs looked large and I needed to lose weight and go to the gym more. She became noticeably upset and confessed that she thinks it\u2019s rude whenever I talk about my body in front of her. She said that because she needs to lose 70 plus pounds it makes her wonder what I think of her and just makes her uncomfortable. I told her she looks great and this wasn\u2019t about her. This was about myself. She asked me not to talk about how I need to lose weight in front of her anymore. Initially I agreed, but now I feel this was an unfair request. And yes, I know, I shouldn\u2019t talk like that anyways. But was I being rude to her when I spoke ill of my own body? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for talking about their own body in front of their overweight friend. The friend got upset because the author was commenting on their own weight, and the author is now wondering if that was rude.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The author is 125 lbs, which they acknowledge is not overweight, but they have insecurities. Their friend is plus-sized and has her own body image issues. When the author talks about their own body, especially about needing to lose weight, it makes the friend uncomfortable because she's dealing with similar issues but more severe.\n\nBody image is a sensitive topic. People often compare themselves to others, especially when they have insecurities. Even if the author is talking about themselves, the friend might interpret it as a comparison or a reminder of her own struggles. The friend's reaction is valid because she's sharing her feelings of discomfort. \n\nThe author says they think their friend looks great, but maybe their words still trigger her. The key here is intent versus impact. The author's intent was to express their own insecurities, but the impact was hurting the friend's feelings. Even if the author didn't mean to, if the friend is upset, that's something to consider.\n\nNow, the friend asked the author to stop talking about needing to lose weight in front of her. The author agreed initially but later feels it was unfair. The question is, should the author comply with the friend's request or not?\n\nIn terms of social etiquette, when someone expresses discomfort about a topic, it's generally considerate to respect their boundaries. The author's friend is making a request to avoid a topic that causes her distress. The author might feel it's their right to talk about their own body, but in this case, it's about respecting the friend's feelings.\n\nSo, even though the author is talking about themselves, the context is that the friend has her own issues, and the author's comments are affecting her. Therefore, the author might be in the wrong for not respecting the friend's request, even if the intention was not to hurt her. The wrong here is more about the impact and the friend's request being disregarded after agreement.\n\nI think the answer is A (Yes, the author is in the wrong) because they didn't consider their friend's feelings enough and went against her request even if it's about themselves.\n"
