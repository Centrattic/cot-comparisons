I\u2019m not sure of her size but she needs to shop in plus size stores etc. Being 125 lbs, I realize I\u2019m not overweight, but I have insecurities like so many others. By the way, I think my friend looks great! She\u2019s a big girl and she\u2019s absolutely beautiful. The other day we were shopping and I tried on this pair of yoga pants. I complained how my thighs looked large and I needed to lose weight and go to the gym more. She became noticeably upset and confessed that she thinks it\u2019s rude whenever I talk about my body in front of her. She said that because she needs to lose 70 plus pounds it makes her wonder what I think of her and just makes her uncomfortable. I told her she looks great and this wasn\u2019t about her. This was about myself. She asked me not to talk about how I need to lose weight in front of her anymore. Initially I agreed, but now I feel this was an unfair request. And yes, I know, I shouldn\u2019t talk like that anyways. But was I being rude to her when I spoke ill of my own body? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation involves the author talking about their own body in front of their overweight friend, who then feels hurt. The friend is upset because the author's self-criticism makes her wonder what the author thinks of her.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. Both people have body image insecurities. The author is 125 lbs and calls themselves fat, which might not be accurate, but that's their own insecurity. The friend is in a plus-size category and is trying to lose 70 pounds. The author was self-deprecating in front of the friend, leading to the friend feeling uncomfortable.\n\nThe key point is whether the author's comments about their own body were inappropriate. Even if the author is talking about themselves, it's possible that their friend could feel self-conscious or compare herself to the author. The author's friend is sensitive about her own weight, so hearing the author criticize their own body might trigger her insecurities. \n\nThe author argues that it's about themselves and not the friend, but the friend's reaction suggests that it's affecting her. The author agreed to stop but now feels it was unfair. However, the friend's request is valid because she's in a vulnerable spot with her body image. \n\nIn terms of social etiquette, when someone is in a sensitive situation, it's considerate to be mindful of how your words might affect them. Even self-criticism can be hurtful if it's in front of someone with similar or related insecurities. The author might not have intended to hurt the friend, but the request to stop is about the friend's comfort. \n\nThe author could have been more considerate of the friend's feelings. While it's their own body to discuss, the context and setting (shopping with a friend who has body image issues) matters. The friend is asking for consideration, so the author is in the wrong for not respecting that. \n\nSo the answer is A. The author is in the wrong.\n"
