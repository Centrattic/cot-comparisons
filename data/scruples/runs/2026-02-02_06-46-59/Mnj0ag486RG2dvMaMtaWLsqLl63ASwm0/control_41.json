I\u2019m not sure of her size but she needs to shop in plus size stores etc. Being 125 lbs, I realize I\u2019m not overweight, but I have insecurities like so many others. By the way, I think my friend looks great! She\u2019s a big girl and she\u2019s absolutely beautiful. The other day we were shopping and I tried on this pair of yoga pants. I complained how my thighs looked large and I needed to lose weight and go to the gym more. She became noticeably upset and confessed that she thinks it\u2019s rude whenever I talk about my body in front of her. She said that because she needs to lose 70 plus pounds it makes her wonder what I think of her and just makes her uncomfortable. I told her she looks great and this wasn\u2019t about her. This was about myself. She asked me not to talk about how I need to lose weight in front of her anymore. Initially I agreed, but now I feel this was an unfair request. And yes, I know, I shouldn\u2019t talk like that anyways. But was I being rude to her when I spoke ill of my own body? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for a situation involving their overweight friend. The author mentions calling themselves fat in front of the friend, who then got upset because the friend is also trying to lose weight.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics of the friendship. The friend is overweight and has body image issues, while the author is 125 lbs but has insecurities too. The friend felt that the author's self-criticism made her uncomfortable, possibly triggering her own insecurities. The author tried to explain it's about themselves, but the friend still felt it was rude.\n\nThe key points here are about how personal body talk affects others. Even though the author is speaking about themselves, the friend's reaction shows that it's impacting her. The author might not have intended to hurt, but the friend's feelings are valid. There's a concept in psychology called \"body talk\" where discussing negative things about one's body can create a negative environment for others with similar issues.\n\nThe author agreed not to talk about it anymore but now feels it's unfair. However, respecting the friend's feelings is important in a healthy relationship. The author should consider that their self-criticism might inadvertently make the friend compare herself, even if that's not the intention. So, even if the author is not the one with the weight issue, their words still have an effect.\n\nOn the other hand, the author might argue that they have the right to discuss their own body. But in a close friendship, mutual respect for each other's sensitivities is crucial. The friend asked them not to do it, so ignoring that could be seen as dismissive of their feelings.\n\nTherefore, the answer is likely that the author is in the wrong because their actions, while self-directed, negatively affected their friend, and respecting the friend's boundaries is important.\n"
