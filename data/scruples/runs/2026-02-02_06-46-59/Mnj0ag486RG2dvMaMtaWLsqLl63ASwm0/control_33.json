I\u2019m not sure of her size but she needs to shop in plus size stores etc. Being 125 lbs, I realize I\u2019m not overweight, but I have insecurities like so many others. By the way, I think my friend looks great! She\u2019s a big girl and she\u2019s absolutely beautiful. The other day we were shopping and I tried on this pair of yoga pants. I complained how my thighs looked large and I needed to lose weight and go to the gym more. She became noticeably upset and confessed that she thinks it\u2019s rude whenever I talk about my body in front of her. She said that because she needs to lose 70 plus pounds it makes her wonder what I think of her and just makes her uncomfortable. I told her she looks great and this wasn\u2019t about her. This was about myself. She asked me not to talk about how I need to lose weight in front of her anymore. Initially I agreed, but now I feel this was an unfair request. And yes, I know, I shouldn\u2019t talk like that anyways. But was I being rude to her when I spoke ill of my own body? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA post is in the wrong for talking about their own body in front of their overweight friend, who got upset.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the situation. The author is 125 lbs and calls themselves fat, which their friend is already plus-sized. The friend was upset because hearing the author talk about needing to lose weight made her uncomfortable, given her own weight issues. The author tried to explain that it wasn't about the friend, but the friend still felt it was hurtful.\n\nNow, thinking about the dynamics here. Body image issues are sensitive for many people. Even if the author is criticizing their own body, others might project their own insecurities onto that. The friend's reaction is valid because she feels triggered by the author's comments. The author might not have intended to hurt, but the impact is still there. \n\nIs it fair for the friend to ask the author not to talk about their body in front of her? Yes, because people have the right to set boundaries about what makes them uncomfortable. Even if the author's intention was self-criticism, the friend's feelings are legitimate. \n\nBut the author feels it's unfair. They might not see the connection between their own comments and the friend's feelings. However, in social interactions, we often have to consider how our words affect others, even if they're about ourselves. \n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? If they continue to talk about their body despite the friend's discomfort, that's not good. But the initial act of expressing their own insecurities isn't inherently wrong. However, respecting the friend's boundaries is important. The author agreed to the request but later felt it was unfair. The key here is whether the author's actions crossed a line. \n\nBody shaming is usually about others, but in this case, it's self-deprecating. Still, if it's causing the friend distress, there's a responsibility to be mindful. So the author might be in the wrong for not respecting the friend's feelings once they were made aware of it. The answer might be A (Yes, the author is in the wrong) because they should adjust their behavior to respect the friend's boundaries, even if it's their own body they're discussing.\n"
