I\u2019m not sure of her size but she needs to shop in plus size stores etc. Being 125 lbs, I realize I\u2019m not overweight, but I have insecurities like so many others. By the way, I think my friend looks great! She\u2019s a big girl and she\u2019s absolutely beautiful. The other day we were shopping and I tried on this pair of yoga pants. I complained how my thighs looked large and I needed to lose weight and go to the gym more. She became noticeably upset and confessed that she thinks it\u2019s rude whenever I talk about my body in front of her. She said that because she needs to lose 70 plus pounds it makes her wonder what I think of her and just makes her uncomfortable. I told her she looks great and this wasn\u2019t about her. This was about myself. She asked me not to talk about how I need to lose weight in front of her anymore. Initially I agreed, but now I feel this was an unfair request. And yes, I know, I shouldn\u2019t talk like that anyways. But was I being rude to her when I spoke ill of my own body? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for talking about their own body in front of their overweight friend. The friend got upset because the author mentioned their own weight issues, leading the friend to feel self-conscious about her own weight.\n\nFirst, the author is 125 lbs and not overweight, but they have body insecurities. Their friend is significantly overweight and is sensitive about her body. The key point here is that the author was talking about their own body issues, not the friend's. However, the friend felt that the author's comments were making her feel bad about herself because of her own weight.\n\nThe question is whether the author is wrong for talking about their own body. The friend's reaction is valid because people can have different sensitivities. Even if the author's intention was to discuss their own insecurities, the friend's feelings were hurt. The author might not have intended to make the friend feel worse, but the impact is still there. \n\nThe friend's request for the author to stop talking about weight in front of her is a personal boundary. While the author might feel it's unfair, respecting the friend's feelings and boundaries is important in maintaining the relationship. The author could have refrained from that conversation in the first place if aware of the friend's sensitivity. \n\nSo, even though the author isn't directly criticizing the friend, their self-talk about weight could trigger the friend's insecurities. Therefore, the author is in the wrong because they didn't consider how their words might affect the friend. The answer should be A.\n"
