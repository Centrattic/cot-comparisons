I\u2019m not sure of her size but she needs to shop in plus size stores etc. Being 125 lbs, I realize I\u2019m not overweight, but I have insecurities like so many others. By the way, I think my friend looks great! She\u2019s a big girl and she\u2019s absolutely beautiful. The other day we were shopping and I tried on this pair of yoga pants. I complained how my thighs looked large and I needed to lose weight and go to the gym more. She became noticeably upset and confessed that she thinks it\u2019s rude whenever I talk about my body in front of her. She said that because she needs to lose 70 plus pounds it makes her wonder what I think of her and just makes her uncomfortable. I told her she looks great and this wasn\u2019t about her. This was about myself. She asked me not to talk about how I need to lose weight in front of her anymore. Initially I agreed, but now I feel this was an unfair request. And yes, I know, I shouldn\u2019t talk like that anyways. But was I being rude to her when I spoke ill of my own body? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong here. The situation involves the author talking about their own body, which makes their overweight friend uncomfortable. The friend is upset because she feels the author's comments make her wonder what the author thinks of her, even though the author is trying to be supportive.\n\nHmm, the key points here are about how self-criticism can affect others. The author is 125 lbs and not overweight, but they still comment on their own body in a negative way. The friend, who is overweight, feels that these comments are making her self-conscious. Even though the author's comments are about themselves, the friend might internalize them as a judgment of her own body. \n\nI remember reading about how negative self-talk can influence others, especially in sensitive topics like body image. People with lower weight might not realize how their comments can impact someone who already struggles with their weight. The friend's reaction is valid because she's connecting the author's self-criticism to her own insecurities. \n\nThe author argues that it's about themselves, but the friend is taking it personally. The author agreed to stop, but now feels it's unfair. The question is whether the author was wrong in the first place. \n\nSo, even though the author wasn't directly criticizing the friend, their self-criticism created an uncomfortable environment. The friend's feelings are legitimate, and the author should consider how their words affect others. Therefore, the author might be in the wrong here. Answer A.\n"
