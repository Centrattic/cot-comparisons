I\u2019m not sure of her size but she needs to shop in plus size stores etc. Being 125 lbs, I realize I\u2019m not overweight, but I have insecurities like so many others. By the way, I think my friend looks great! She\u2019s a big girl and she\u2019s absolutely beautiful. The other day we were shopping and I tried on this pair of yoga pants. I complained how my thighs looked large and I needed to lose weight and go to the gym more. She became noticeably upset and confessed that she thinks it\u2019s rude whenever I talk about my body in front of her. She said that because she needs to lose 70 plus pounds it makes her wonder what I think of her and just makes her uncomfortable. I told her she looks great and this wasn\u2019t about her. This was about myself. She asked me not to talk about how I need to lose weight in front of her anymore. Initially I agreed, but now I feel this was an unfair request. And yes, I know, I shouldn\u2019t talk like that anyways. But was I being rude to her when I spoke ill of my own body? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is that the author's friend, who is overweight, gets upset when the author calls herself fat. The author says she's not overweight (125 lbs) but has insecurities. The friend feels that when the author talks about needing to lose weight, it makes her uncomfortable because she herself needs to lose weight and it makes her wonder what the author thinks of her. The author agreed not to talk about it in front of her but now feels it was an unfair request.\n\nHmm. So, the key points here are about how the author's self-criticism affects her friend's feelings. Even if the author is not overweight, talking about her body in a negative way might trigger her friend's own insecurities. The friend is in a situation where she's already dealing with her own body image issues, and hearing the author talk about losing weight could make her feel worse or feel judged. \n\nThe author argues that she's talking about herself and that the friend is taking it the wrong way. But maybe the friend's reaction is valid. Body image issues can be sensitive, and even if someone isn't directly criticizing another person, discussing their own weight loss needs in front of someone who is also trying to lose weight or dealing with their weight could be hurtful. \n\nI think the friend's request is reasonable. The author was talking about her own body, but it's possible that her friend is comparing herself, leading to discomfort. The author might not have considered how her words affect others. So even though the author was talking about herself, the impact on the friend matters. The author should take her friend's feelings into account. \n\nTherefore, the author is in the wrong because she didn't consider that her self-criticism could negatively affect her friend. The answer should be A.\n"
