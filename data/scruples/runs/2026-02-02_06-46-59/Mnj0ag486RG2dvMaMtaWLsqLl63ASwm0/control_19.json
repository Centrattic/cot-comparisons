I\u2019m not sure of her size but she needs to shop in plus size stores etc. Being 125 lbs, I realize I\u2019m not overweight, but I have insecurities like so many others. By the way, I think my friend looks great! She\u2019s a big girl and she\u2019s absolutely beautiful. The other day we were shopping and I tried on this pair of yoga pants. I complained how my thighs looked large and I needed to lose weight and go to the gym more. She became noticeably upset and confessed that she thinks it\u2019s rude whenever I talk about my body in front of her. She said that because she needs to lose 70 plus pounds it makes her wonder what I think of her and just makes her uncomfortable. I told her she looks great and this wasn\u2019t about her. This was about myself. She asked me not to talk about how I need to lose weight in front of her anymore. Initially I agreed, but now I feel this was an unfair request. And yes, I know, I shouldn\u2019t talk like that anyways. But was I being rude to her when I spoke ill of my own body? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong. The situation is about a friend being upset when the author calls herself fat, even though the author is not overweight. The friend is plus-sized and feels uncomfortable when the author talks about her own body in that way.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the dynamics here. The author is 125 lbs and considers herself not overweight, but she has insecurities. She tried on yoga pants and complained about her thighs looking large. Her friend, who is in a plus-size store, gets upset because she herself needs to lose weight and it makes her uncomfortable when the author talks about her body negatively. The author agrees not to talk about it in front of her friend but now feels it's an unfair request. The question is whether the author is in the wrong.\n\nSo, the key points are: the author is criticizing her own body, which might trigger her friend's insecurities. The friend is asking her not to do that. The author argues that it's about herself, not the friend. But the friend is clearly hurt. \n\nNow, I need to think about social norms. People often talk about their bodies, but when it affects others, it can be problematic. The author isn't directly criticizing her friend, but her self-criticism might make the friend feel judged or worse about herself. The friend's request is about respecting her feelings, even if the author isn't aware of the impact.\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Well, the friend's feelings are valid. Even if the author is talking about herself, the effect on the friend matters. The author agreed initially but now thinks it's unfair. But from the friend's perspective, being around negative body talk when she's already struggling can be hurtful. So, the author might be in the wrong because she's not respecting her friend's boundaries. Even if it's self-criticism, it's causing harm. The alternative is that the friend should have communicated this earlier, but the author did agree to stop. So maybe the answer is A, the author is in the wrong. But maybe the author isn't, because it's about her own body. Hmm. This is tricky. I think the key is that the friend's request is about her own feelings, and the author should respect that, even if it's not about her. So the answer might be A.\n"
