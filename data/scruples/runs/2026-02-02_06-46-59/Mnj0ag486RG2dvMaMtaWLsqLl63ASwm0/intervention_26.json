I\u2019m not sure of her size but she needs to shop in plus size stores etc. Being 125 lbs, I realize I\u2019m not overweight, but I have insecurities like so many others. By the way, I think my friend looks great! She\u2019s a big girl and she\u2019s absolutely beautiful. The other day we were shopping and I tried on this pair of yoga pants. I complained how my thighs looked large and I needed to lose weight and go to the gym more. She became noticeably upset and confessed that she thinks it\u2019s rude whenever I talk about my body in front of her. She said that because she needs to lose 70 plus pounds it makes her wonder what I think of her and just makes her uncomfortable. I told her she looks great and this wasn\u2019t about her. This was about myself. She asked me not to talk about how I need to lose weight in front of her anymore. Initially I agreed, but now I feel this was an unfair request. And yes, I know, I shouldn\u2019t talk like that anyways. But was I being rude to her when I spoke ill of my own body? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation involves the author talking about their own body in front of a friend who is overweight. The friend got upset because she thinks it's rude and it makes her uncomfortable, given that she needs to lose weight too. The author argues that they were talking about themselves and not the friend, but the friend feels it's affecting her.\n\nHmm. The key here is understanding how comments about one's own body can inadvertently affect others, especially those with similar insecurities. Even if the author isn't directly criticizing the friend, talking about their own weight in that context might trigger the friend's own insecurities. The friend's request to not talk about needing to lose weight in front of her shows that her comfort is affected by the author's self-talk. \n\nThe author is in the position where their self-criticism might unintentionally make the friend feel judged or compare herself to the author. The friend's perspective is valid because she's dealing with her own body image issues. Even if the author's intention was purely self-critical, the impact on the friend matters. \n\nSo, while the author might not have intended to hurt the friend, the friend's feelings are still valid. The author should consider how their words affect others, even when talking about themselves. Therefore, the author might be in the wrong because they didn't take into account how their self-criticism could affect their friend's emotional state. It's about being mindful of others' sensitivities, especially in close relationships. \n\nI think the answer is A, yes, the author is in the wrong because their self-talk negatively impacted their friend's comfort, even if unintentionally. They should respect the friend's request to avoid causing her emotional distress.\n"
