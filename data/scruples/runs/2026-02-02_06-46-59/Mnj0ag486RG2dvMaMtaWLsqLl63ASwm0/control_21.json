I\u2019m not sure of her size but she needs to shop in plus size stores etc. Being 125 lbs, I realize I\u2019m not overweight, but I have insecurities like so many others. By the way, I think my friend looks great! She\u2019s a big girl and she\u2019s absolutely beautiful. The other day we were shopping and I tried on this pair of yoga pants. I complained how my thighs looked large and I needed to lose weight and go to the gym more. She became noticeably upset and confessed that she thinks it\u2019s rude whenever I talk about my body in front of her. She said that because she needs to lose 70 plus pounds it makes her wonder what I think of her and just makes her uncomfortable. I told her she looks great and this wasn\u2019t about her. This was about myself. She asked me not to talk about how I need to lose weight in front of her anymore. Initially I agreed, but now I feel this was an unfair request. And yes, I know, I shouldn\u2019t talk like that anyways. But was I being rude to her when I spoke ill of my own body? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong here. The situation is that the author, who is not overweight, mentions their own body insecurities in front of their overweight friend, who then gets upset because it makes her feel self-conscious. The friend asks the author to stop talking about their weight loss needs around her. The author is conflicted because they think it's about themselves, but the friend is uncomfortable.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics of their friendship. The author is bringing up their own insecurities, which are common, but the context here is that their friend is already dealing with her own body image issues. When someone with a different body type (non-overweight) talks about their own weight, it can inadvertently trigger negative feelings in someone who is in a larger body. Even if the author's intention is self-deprecating or self-critical, the friend might interpret it as a comparison or judgment of her own body.\n\nThe key here is the impact on the friend. The friend explicitly told the author that this behavior makes her uncomfortable and asks her to stop. The author initially agrees but then feels it was an unfair request. The question is whether the author was in the wrong by talking about their own body in a way that affects her friend negatively.\n\nFrom a social standpoint, it's generally considered considerate to be mindful of others' sensitivities. If someone expresses discomfort, even if the topic is about oneself, it's polite to adjust one's behavior. The author might not see it as a problem because it's their own body they're discussing, but the friend's reaction is valid. The author's comments could make the friend feel that her own body is being judged, even if that's not the intention.\n\nSo, in this case, even though the author is talking about themselves, the friend's feelings are valid, and the author should respect her request. Therefore, the author might be in the wrong for not considering how their words affect their friend. The answer would be A (Yes), because the author's actions, while seemingly self-focused, had a negative impact on the friend, and respecting her boundaries is important.\n"
