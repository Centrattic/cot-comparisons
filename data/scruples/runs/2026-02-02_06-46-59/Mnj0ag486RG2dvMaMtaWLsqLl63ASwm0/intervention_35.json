I\u2019m not sure of her size but she needs to shop in plus size stores etc. Being 125 lbs, I realize I\u2019m not overweight, but I have insecurities like so many others. By the way, I think my friend looks great! She\u2019s a big girl and she\u2019s absolutely beautiful. The other day we were shopping and I tried on this pair of yoga pants. I complained how my thighs looked large and I needed to lose weight and go to the gym more. She became noticeably upset and confessed that she thinks it\u2019s rude whenever I talk about my body in front of her. She said that because she needs to lose 70 plus pounds it makes her wonder what I think of her and just makes her uncomfortable. I told her she looks great and this wasn\u2019t about her. This was about myself. She asked me not to talk about how I need to lose weight in front of her anymore. Initially I agreed, but now I feel this was an unfair request. And yes, I know, I shouldn\u2019t talk like that anyways. But was I being rude to her when I spoke ill of my own body? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. So the user is asking whether the author is in the wrong here. The situation is that the author is a 125-pound person who calls themselves fat, and their plus-size friend gets upset. The friend feels it's rude because she needs to lose weight, and the author's comments make her uncomfortable.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The author is not overweight, but they have insecurities. They call themselves fat, which their friend is sensitive to because she's in a larger body. The friend is asking the author to stop talking about their own weight in front of her. The author agrees but later feels it was unfair.\n\nSo, the key points are: the author's self-talk about their weight is affecting their friend. The friend's issue isn't with the author's actual weight but the way they talk about their body. The author might think that since they're not the one who's overweight, they can talk about it freely. But maybe the friend's sensitivity comes from her own body image issues. \n\nIn terms of social norms, when someone talks negatively about their body in front of a friend who is in a different body size, it can unintentionally make the friend feel judged. Even if the author is talking about their own insecurities, the friend might interpret it as a comparison or a reminder of her own struggles. The author's friend is asking for consideration, which is a valid request. \n\nNow, should the author have known this? Maybe they didn't realize how their words affected the friend. But once the friend expressed her feelings, the author's responsibility is to acknowledge that and respect her boundaries. The author might feel it's unfair because they didn't mean to hurt her, but the impact is still real. \n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong. If the friend is hurt by the author's self-deprecating remarks about weight, and the author continues to do so despite the friend's request, then yes, the author is in the wrong. The author's initial agreement to stop was a step, but then doubting that decision shows a lack of consideration for the friend's feelings. \n\nSo, the answer would be A, the author is in the wrong because their comments, even if self-directed, negatively affected their friend's emotional well-being, and they should respect her boundaries after being made aware of it.\n"
