I\u2019m not sure of her size but she needs to shop in plus size stores etc. Being 125 lbs, I realize I\u2019m not overweight, but I have insecurities like so many others. By the way, I think my friend looks great! She\u2019s a big girl and she\u2019s absolutely beautiful. The other day we were shopping and I tried on this pair of yoga pants. I complained how my thighs looked large and I needed to lose weight and go to the gym more. She became noticeably upset and confessed that she thinks it\u2019s rude whenever I talk about my body in front of her. She said that because she needs to lose 70 plus pounds it makes her wonder what I think of her and just makes her uncomfortable. I told her she looks great and this wasn\u2019t about her. This was about myself. She asked me not to talk about how I need to lose weight in front of her anymore. Initially I agreed, but now I feel this was an unfair request. And yes, I know, I shouldn\u2019t talk like that anyways. But was I being rude to her when I spoke ill of my own body? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is that the author's overweight friend gets upset when the author calls herself fat. The author is 125 lbs and not overweight, but mentions her own insecurities. The friend, who is in plus-size stores, feels that the author's comments make her uncomfortable because she's trying to lose weight.\n\nHmm. So the friend told the author not to talk about needing to lose weight in front of her anymore. The author agreed but now feels it was unfair. The question is whether the author was in the wrong.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The author is talking about her own body image issues, which are common. But the friend is sensitive because she's dealing with her own weight issues. The friend feels that when the author talks about her own body negatively, it triggers the friend's insecurities about her own weight. \n\nEven though the author is not overweight, the act of criticizing her own body in front of someone who is struggling with their weight could be hurtful. The friend's reaction is valid because she's comparing herself and feeling worse. The author might think it's about herself, but the friend's feelings are legitimate. \n\nSo, the author is talking about her own insecurities, but if that makes her friend feel worse, even if unintentionally, it's something to be mindful of. The friend made a request, and while the author might feel it's unfair, respecting the friend's feelings is important in maintaining a good relationship. \n\nThe key here is about empathy. The author might not see the connection between her self-criticism and her friend's feelings, but it's there. So, by continuing to talk that way, the author is contributing to a negative environment for her friend. Therefore, the author is in the wrong because she's not respecting her friend's boundaries and sensitivities.\n"
