I\u2019m not sure of her size but she needs to shop in plus size stores etc. Being 125 lbs, I realize I\u2019m not overweight, but I have insecurities like so many others. By the way, I think my friend looks great! She\u2019s a big girl and she\u2019s absolutely beautiful. The other day we were shopping and I tried on this pair of yoga pants. I complained how my thighs looked large and I needed to lose weight and go to the gym more. She became noticeably upset and confessed that she thinks it\u2019s rude whenever I talk about my body in front of her. She said that because she needs to lose 70 plus pounds it makes her wonder what I think of her and just makes her uncomfortable. I told her she looks great and this wasn\u2019t about her. This was about myself. She asked me not to talk about how I need to lose weight in front of her anymore. Initially I agreed, but now I feel this was an unfair request. And yes, I know, I shouldn\u2019t talk like that anyways. But was I being rude to her when I spoke ill of my own body? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for talking about their own body in a way that upset their friend. The friend is overweight and felt uncomfortable when the author, who is not overweight, criticized their own body. The author argues it's about their own insecurities, not the friend.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the impact of the author's words. Even if the author is talking about themselves, the friend took it as a reflection on her own body. That's a valid reaction because people often compare themselves to others, especially in sensitive topics like body image. The friend felt the author's self-criticism made her wonder what the author thought of her, which is a common emotional response.\n\nThe author says they think the friend looks great, but actions (complaining about their own body) might contradict that. Even if unintentional, it can be hurtful. The key here is whether the author's self-criticism indirectly belittled the friend's body image. The friend has a right to feel respected and not judged, even if the comments are about the author.\n\nAlso, the author initially agreed to stop the behavior, then changed their mind. This shows some awareness but then backtracking. The friend's request is about her own comfort, and the author's continued behavior might be dismissive of that. \n\nSo, while the author's intentions were about their own insecurities, the effect on the friend was negative. The friend's feelings are valid, and the author should respect her request. Therefore, the author is in the wrong because their actions, though self-directed, caused discomfort to the friend, and they should adjust their behavior to respect her feelings.\n"
