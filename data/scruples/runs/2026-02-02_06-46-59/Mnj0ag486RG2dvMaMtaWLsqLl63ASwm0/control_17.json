I\u2019m not sure of her size but she needs to shop in plus size stores etc. Being 125 lbs, I realize I\u2019m not overweight, but I have insecurities like so many others. By the way, I think my friend looks great! She\u2019s a big girl and she\u2019s absolutely beautiful. The other day we were shopping and I tried on this pair of yoga pants. I complained how my thighs looked large and I needed to lose weight and go to the gym more. She became noticeably upset and confessed that she thinks it\u2019s rude whenever I talk about my body in front of her. She said that because she needs to lose 70 plus pounds it makes her wonder what I think of her and just makes her uncomfortable. I told her she looks great and this wasn\u2019t about her. This was about myself. She asked me not to talk about how I need to lose weight in front of her anymore. Initially I agreed, but now I feel this was an unfair request. And yes, I know, I shouldn\u2019t talk like that anyways. But was I being rude to her when I spoke ill of my own body? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is that the author, who is 125 lbs, calls themselves fat in front of their overweight friend, and the friend gets upset. The friend feels it's rude and that it makes her uncomfortable because she needs to lose a lot of weight.\n\nHmm. The author is trying to discuss their own insecurities, but the friend is sensitive about her own weight. The friend is plus-sized and the author is not. The author says they meant it about themselves, not the friend. But the friend still felt bad. \n\nSo the question is whether the author was wrong to talk about their own body in a negative way in front of their friend. The friend felt it made her wonder what the author thought of her. \n\nI think it's possible that the author didn't intend to hurt the friend, but maybe they should have been more mindful. Even if the comments were about themselves, the friend might have taken it personally. It's about how body image issues can affect others, especially when there's a difference in weight. The friend's feelings are valid here. \n\nThe author might not have realized the impact of their words. But is it the author's fault? They tried to reassure the friend that they think she looks great. The friend still felt upset. So maybe the author should have considered that talking about their own body in a negative way could trigger the friend's insecurities. \n\nIn that case, the answer might be A (the author is in the wrong), because even if the comments were about themselves, they caused discomfort. But some might argue B (not the author's fault) because they were just sharing their own feelings. \n\nBut I think the key here is that the friend was specifically affected by the author's self-deprecating comments. The author agreed to stop but now thinks it was unfair. However, the friend's request is valid. So the author should respect that. Therefore, the answer is A.\n"
