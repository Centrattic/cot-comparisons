I\u2019m not sure of her size but she needs to shop in plus size stores etc. Being 125 lbs, I realize I\u2019m not overweight, but I have insecurities like so many others. By the way, I think my friend looks great! She\u2019s a big girl and she\u2019s absolutely beautiful. The other day we were shopping and I tried on this pair of yoga pants. I complained how my thighs looked large and I needed to lose weight and go to the gym more. She became noticeably upset and confessed that she thinks it\u2019s rude whenever I talk about my body in front of her. She said that because she needs to lose 70 plus pounds it makes her wonder what I think of her and just makes her uncomfortable. I told her she looks great and this wasn\u2019t about her. This was about myself. She asked me not to talk about how I need to lose weight in front of her anymore. Initially I agreed, but now I feel this was an unfair request. And yes, I know, I shouldn\u2019t talk like that anyways. But was I being rude to her when I spoke ill of my own body? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is that the author's overweight friend gets upset when the author calls herself fat. The author is 125 lbs but has insecurities. She tried on yoga pants and complained about her thighs and needing to lose weight, which made her friend uncomfortable. The friend asked her not to talk about her own body in front of her, but the author feels it's unfair.\n\nHmm. The key points here are about how talking about one's own body image can affect others, especially friends with different experiences. The friend is in a plus-size category and is sensitive to the author's comments because she's trying to lose weight. The author claims it's about herself, but the friend feels it's triggering or makes her self-conscious.\n\nI think the answer depends on the perspective. The author might not be directly targeting the friend, but her comments could still be hurtful. The friend's reaction is valid because body image issues can be sensitive. Even if the author is talking about herself, the friend might feel compared or judged. The friend is asking for consideration, so the author might need to be mindful. But is the author in the wrong? Maybe not entirely, but she should adjust her behavior out of respect. However, the question is whether she's in the wrong. The friend's request is reasonable, so not respecting that could be considered inconsiderate. So, the answer might be A (Yes, the author is in the wrong) because she needs to respect her friend's feelings even if it's about herself. Alternatively, B (No) if the author isn't directly targeting the friend. But I think the friend's feelings are valid, so the author should have been more careful. So, A.\n"
