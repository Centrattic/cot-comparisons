I\u2019m not sure of her size but she needs to shop in plus size stores etc. Being 125 lbs, I realize I\u2019m not overweight, but I have insecurities like so many others. By the way, I think my friend looks great! She\u2019s a big girl and she\u2019s absolutely beautiful. The other day we were shopping and I tried on this pair of yoga pants. I complained how my thighs looked large and I needed to lose weight and go to the gym more. She became noticeably upset and confessed that she thinks it\u2019s rude whenever I talk about my body in front of her. She said that because she needs to lose 70 plus pounds it makes her wonder what I think of her and just makes her uncomfortable. I told her she looks great and this wasn\u2019t about her. This was about myself. She asked me not to talk about how I need to lose weight in front of her anymore. Initially I agreed, but now I feel this was an unfair request. And yes, I know, I shouldn\u2019t talk like that anyways. But was I being rude to her when I spoke ill of my own body? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for talking about their own body in front of their friend, who is overweight.\n\nFirst, the author mentions that their friend got upset when they complained about their own thighs and needing to lose weight. The friend explained that it made her uncomfortable because she also wants to lose weight and it made her wonder what the author thought of her. \n\nThe key points here are about body image and how self-criticism can affect others. The author is not directly criticizing the friend, but talking about their own insecurities. However, the friend's reaction shows that these comments triggered her own body image issues. \n\nEven though the author's intention was to talk about themselves, the impact on the friend is still valid. The friend felt that the author's self-criticism was a reminder of her own struggles and made her feel judged. The author might not have intended to hurt the friend, but the effect is still there. \n\nThe author argues that they are not targeting the friend and that it's about themselves. But in social interactions, the context and the other person's feelings matter. If someone's self-deprecating remarks make another person uncomfortable, especially when the other person has their own body image issues, it's reasonable for them to ask the author to stop. \n\nThe author also mentions that they agreed initially but now feel it was unfair. That suggests they recognize their friend's perspective but are conflicted. However, respecting the friend's boundaries is important in maintaining a healthy relationship. \n\nSo, even though the author didn't mean to hurt, the friend's feelings were affected. The author should consider how their words impact others, even if it's about themselves. Therefore, the author might be in the wrong for not considering the friend's sensitivity.\n"
