I\u2019m not sure of her size but she needs to shop in plus size stores etc. Being 125 lbs, I realize I\u2019m not overweight, but I have insecurities like so many others. By the way, I think my friend looks great! She\u2019s a big girl and she\u2019s absolutely beautiful. The other day we were shopping and I tried on this pair of yoga pants. I complained how my thighs looked large and I needed to lose weight and go to the gym more. She became noticeably upset and confessed that she thinks it\u2019s rude whenever I talk about my body in front of her. She said that because she needs to lose 70 plus pounds it makes her wonder what I think of her and just makes her uncomfortable. I told her she looks great and this wasn\u2019t about her. This was about myself. She asked me not to talk about how I need to lose weight in front of her anymore. Initially I agreed, but now I feel this was an unfair request. And yes, I know, I shouldn\u2019t talk like that anyways. But was I being rude to her when I spoke ill of my own body? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about the author talking about their own body in front of their overweight friend, who got upset because it made her uncomfortable, given her own weight issues.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author is 125 lbs and feels they're not overweight, but have insecurities. They mention their friend is in plus-size stores. The conflict arises when the author comments on their thighs and needing to lose weight, which upsets the friend. She says it's rude and makes her wonder what the author thinks of her, since she needs to lose 70+ pounds. The author then agreed but later feels it was unfair.\n\nNow, the main question is whether the author is in the wrong for talking about their own body. The user says they think the author is in the wrong but wants my opinion. \n\nI should think about the impact of body comments, even if self-deprecating. Sometimes when people talk negatively about their bodies, others might relate it to their own insecurities, especially if they are dealing with similar or different body image issues. The friend might feel that the author's comments, although about themselves, trigger her own feelings of being judged or make her self-conscious. \n\nBut the author is talking about their own body, not the friend's. So, is it the author's responsibility to adjust their self-talk because of the friend's sensitivity? On one hand, people have the right to discuss their own bodies without being silenced. On the other hand, if a friend is clearly hurt by it, maybe the author should consider their words. \n\nThe friend's reaction is understandable. She might be comparing herself, or the author's comment about needing to lose weight could make her feel like the author is also critical of her weight. Even if the author isn't intending that, the perception is important here. The author did agree to stop doing it, but now they're questioning if that was unfair. \n\nHowever, the author isn't being rude to the friend by criticizing her; they're talking about themselves. But the context is that the friend has her own body image struggles, and the author's comments might inadvertently trigger her. The author might need to be more mindful of how their self-talk affects others, but does that make the author in the wrong? \n\nIn terms of right or wrong: The author isn't wrong for having insecurities, but they might be wrong for not considering their friend's feelings. The friend's request is about her comfort, not the author's right to self-expression. So the author adjusting might be a kind gesture, even if they feel it's unfair. \n\nThe question is whether the author was in the wrong. If the friend felt uncomfortable and asked them to stop, the author's initial agreement shows they acknowledged the impact. But later they feel it was unfair. The problem is that even self-deprecating comments can have unintended effects. So, maybe the author is in the wrong for not being more considerate, but the answer might be a bit nuanced. \n\nBut the user's options are A (yes) or B (no). The user thinks A. I need to determine if A is correct. The key is whether the author's self-criticism was indeed rude. Since the friend was the one who felt it was, and the author later felt it was unfair, there's a conflict. However, from a social standpoint, being mindful of others' sensitivities is important. The author isn't directly criticizing the friend, but the context of their friendship and the friend's own issues make the author's comments a trigger. \n\nSo, the author might be in the wrong because they should have been more aware of how their words affect their friend. It's not just about what they say, but the effect it has. Therefore, the answer is A.\n"
