I\u2019m not sure of her size but she needs to shop in plus size stores etc. Being 125 lbs, I realize I\u2019m not overweight, but I have insecurities like so many others. By the way, I think my friend looks great! She\u2019s a big girl and she\u2019s absolutely beautiful. The other day we were shopping and I tried on this pair of yoga pants. I complained how my thighs looked large and I needed to lose weight and go to the gym more. She became noticeably upset and confessed that she thinks it\u2019s rude whenever I talk about my body in front of her. She said that because she needs to lose 70 plus pounds it makes her wonder what I think of her and just makes her uncomfortable. I told her she looks great and this wasn\u2019t about her. This was about myself. She asked me not to talk about how I need to lose weight in front of her anymore. Initially I agreed, but now I feel this was an unfair request. And yes, I know, I shouldn\u2019t talk like that anyways. But was I being rude to her when I spoke ill of my own body? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let me try to work through this. The situation is about whether the author is in the wrong for talking about their own body in front of their overweight friend. The friend got upset because the author mentioned their thighs looking large and needing to lose weight, even though the author isn't overweight.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The author is 125 lbs and not overweight, but has insecurities. The friend is in a plus-size category. The author was talking about their own body image, which the friend found triggering. The friend is trying to lose weight and the author's comments made her feel self-conscious. The author says they think the friend looks great and that their comments were about themselves, not the friend. The friend asked the author not to talk about needing to lose weight in front of her anymore. The author agreed at first but now feels it was an unfair request.\n\nSo, the key question is whether talking about one's own body image issues is rude to a friend who is struggling with their weight. The author is not making the friend feel bad directly, but their own self-criticism might be affecting the friend's self-esteem. \n\nFrom a sensitivity perspective, it's possible that the friend might compare herself to the author, even if the author isn't comparing her. For example, if the author says they need to lose weight, the friend might think, \"If even someone who isn't overweight needs to lose weight, then maybe I need to lose more, or maybe I'm not as good-looking as them.\" That could be unintentional but still hurtful.\n\nOn the other hand, the author is addressing their own insecurities. It's common for people to express their own body concerns, and the author isn't necessarily being mean. However, if the friend is in a vulnerable place, the author might need to be more aware of how their comments could impact the friend. The friend's feelings are valid, and if the author is aware that their comments are causing discomfort, even if unintended, then maybe they should adjust their behavior.\n\nThe author says they think the friend looks great, but their own self-criticism might still trigger the friend. It's about empathy. Even if the author isn't trying to be rude, the friend is clearly hurt. The author might not have considered how their words could affect the friend. The fact that the friend asked them to stop suggests that the author's comments were indeed causing harm. The author initially agreed but now feels it's unfair, which might indicate a lack of understanding of the friend's perspective.\n\nIn relationships, being considerate of each other's sensitivities is important. If the friend has made it clear that the author's comments are affecting her, then the author's continued talk about their own weight could be seen as inconsiderate, even if it's about themselves. So, the author might be in the wrong for not respecting the friend's boundaries once they were aware of the impact.\n"
