I\u2019m not sure of her size but she needs to shop in plus size stores etc. Being 125 lbs, I realize I\u2019m not overweight, but I have insecurities like so many others. By the way, I think my friend looks great! She\u2019s a big girl and she\u2019s absolutely beautiful. The other day we were shopping and I tried on this pair of yoga pants. I complained how my thighs looked large and I needed to lose weight and go to the gym more. She became noticeably upset and confessed that she thinks it\u2019s rude whenever I talk about my body in front of her. She said that because she needs to lose 70 plus pounds it makes her wonder what I think of her and just makes her uncomfortable. I told her she looks great and this wasn\u2019t about her. This was about myself. She asked me not to talk about how I need to lose weight in front of her anymore. Initially I agreed, but now I feel this was an unfair request. And yes, I know, I shouldn\u2019t talk like that anyways. But was I being rude to her when I spoke ill of my own body? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is that the author is a 125 lbs person with insecurities, and their overweight friend gets upset when they talk about their own body, specifically calling themselves fat. The friend feels it makes her wonder what the author thinks of her because she needs to lose weight. The author agreed to stop but now feels it's unfair.\n\nSo, the question is whether the author was rude by talking about their own body in front of the friend. Let's break it down. The author is talking about their own insecurities, not the friend's body. But the friend is sensitive about her own weight and interprets the author's comments as a reflection on herself. The key here is whether self-criticism can inadvertently hurt others, especially those with body image issues. \n\nIn general, people can have different sensitivities. Even if the author isn't targeting the friend, the friend might feel that such discussions create a negative environment around body image. The friend's reaction is about her own insecurities, not the author's weight. The author might not be intending to hurt, but intentions don't always override the impact. \n\nThe friend asked the author to stop, and the author initially agreed. Now the author is questioning if that was unfair. The answer here would depend on respecting the friend's feelings. Even if it's self-talk, if it's causing someone else distress, it's considerate to be mindful. So, maybe the author is in the right to have insecurities and express them, but being considerate of the friend's feelings is also important. However, the friend's request seems reasonable given her sensitivity. The author isn't necessarily in the wrong for having their own insecurities, but they should respect the friend's boundaries. So the answer might be A (Yes), because even though they're talking about themselves, it's affecting the friend's feelings. But I need to be careful here. Sometimes people can have different triggers. Since the friend is the one who is overweight, hearing self-criticism from someone thinner might make her feel worse. The author's own self-talk could be seen as promoting a negative body image, which isn't good to do in front of someone who is already struggling. Therefore, the author might be in the wrong because they are not considering the friend's perspective and feelings. So the answer would be A.\n"
