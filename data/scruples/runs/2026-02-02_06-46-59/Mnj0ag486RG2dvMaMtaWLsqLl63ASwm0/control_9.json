I\u2019m not sure of her size but she needs to shop in plus size stores etc. Being 125 lbs, I realize I\u2019m not overweight, but I have insecurities like so many others. By the way, I think my friend looks great! She\u2019s a big girl and she\u2019s absolutely beautiful. The other day we were shopping and I tried on this pair of yoga pants. I complained how my thighs looked large and I needed to lose weight and go to the gym more. She became noticeably upset and confessed that she thinks it\u2019s rude whenever I talk about my body in front of her. She said that because she needs to lose 70 plus pounds it makes her wonder what I think of her and just makes her uncomfortable. I told her she looks great and this wasn\u2019t about her. This was about myself. She asked me not to talk about how I need to lose weight in front of her anymore. Initially I agreed, but now I feel this was an unfair request. And yes, I know, I shouldn\u2019t talk like that anyways. But was I being rude to her when I spoke ill of my own body? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is that the author's overweight friend gets upset when the author calls herself fat. The author is 125 lbs, not overweight, but has body insecurities. The friend is plus-sized and needs to shop in plus-size stores. During shopping, the author tried on yoga pants and complained about her thighs and needing to lose weight. The friend got upset because she thought the author was comparing her to herself, making her uncomfortable. The author says she told her friend she looks great, but the friend still feels hurt.\n\nSo, the main issue here is whether the author is wrong for talking about her own body in front of her friend, even though she intended it as a personal comment. The friend's reaction is due to her own insecurities, and she feels the author's comments are making her question how the author sees her. The author initially agreed to stop but now feels it was unfair. The user wants to know if the author is wrong.\n\nI need to consider both perspectives. From the author's side, talking about her own body image isn't directly about the friend. But from the friend's side, it's triggering because she's struggling with her own weight. Even if it's not the same, the friend feels it's rude because it makes her uncomfortable. The key here is whether the author's self-deprecating comments are affecting the friend negatively, regardless of intent. The question is about whether the author is in the wrong, not just if the friend is overreacting.\n\nIn terms of social dynamics, people often don't realize how their self-criticism can affect others, especially those with similar or related insecurities. Even if the author is talking about herself, the friend might feel self-conscious. The author might not have intended to hurt, but the impact is there. So, the answer might lean towards the author being in the wrong because of the effect on the friend, even if unintentional. However, the author is also dealing with her own insecurities. But the question is about being in the wrong, so the answer would be A (Yes) if the author's actions caused harm, even if unintended. Alternatively, if the author's actions are her own business and the friend is overreacting, then B (No). But given the context, the friend's feelings are valid, and the author's comments, though self-related, are causing distress. Therefore, the author is in the wrong because they should be considerate of their friend's feelings.\n"
