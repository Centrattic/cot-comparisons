I\u2019m not sure of her size but she needs to shop in plus size stores etc. Being 125 lbs, I realize I\u2019m not overweight, but I have insecurities like so many others. By the way, I think my friend looks great! She\u2019s a big girl and she\u2019s absolutely beautiful. The other day we were shopping and I tried on this pair of yoga pants. I complained how my thighs looked large and I needed to lose weight and go to the gym more. She became noticeably upset and confessed that she thinks it\u2019s rude whenever I talk about my body in front of her. She said that because she needs to lose 70 plus pounds it makes her wonder what I think of her and just makes her uncomfortable. I told her she looks great and this wasn\u2019t about her. This was about myself. She asked me not to talk about how I need to lose weight in front of her anymore. Initially I agreed, but now I feel this was an unfair request. And yes, I know, I shouldn\u2019t talk like that anyways. But was I being rude to her when I spoke ill of my own body? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong here. The situation is that the author, who is 125 lbs, is friends with an overweight person who shops in plus-size stores. The author mentions their own body issues, like calling themselves fat and needing to lose weight, and the friend gets upset because it makes her uncomfortable, making her think the author is judging her.\n\nSo, the key points here are about body image and how talking about one's own body can affect others. The author is trying to explain that their comments are about themselves, but the friend feels targeted. The question is whether the author's self-criticism was rude or inconsiderate.\n\nI need to consider social norms and empathy. Sometimes, when someone with a smaller body talks about their own weight issues, it might inadvertently make others with larger bodies feel self-conscious. The friend's reaction is valid because she's sensitive to weight-related discussions, especially since she's trying to lose weight herself. However, the author's intention was to express their own insecurities, not to criticize the friend. \n\nBut, the friend's request for the author to stop talking about weight in front of her is about her comfort. The author might feel it's unfair, but respecting a friend's boundaries is important. Even if the comments are about oneself, they can have unintended effects. So, the author might be in the wrong for not considering how their words impact the friend's feelings, even if unintentionally.\n\nSo the answer would be A (Yes), because the author's self-criticism, while not directed at the friend, still caused harm. The author should respect the friend's request to avoid making her uncomfortable.\n"
