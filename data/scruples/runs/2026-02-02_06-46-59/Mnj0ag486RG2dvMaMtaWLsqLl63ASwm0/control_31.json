I\u2019m not sure of her size but she needs to shop in plus size stores etc. Being 125 lbs, I realize I\u2019m not overweight, but I have insecurities like so many others. By the way, I think my friend looks great! She\u2019s a big girl and she\u2019s absolutely beautiful. The other day we were shopping and I tried on this pair of yoga pants. I complained how my thighs looked large and I needed to lose weight and go to the gym more. She became noticeably upset and confessed that she thinks it\u2019s rude whenever I talk about my body in front of her. She said that because she needs to lose 70 plus pounds it makes her wonder what I think of her and just makes her uncomfortable. I told her she looks great and this wasn\u2019t about her. This was about myself. She asked me not to talk about how I need to lose weight in front of her anymore. Initially I agreed, but now I feel this was an unfair request. And yes, I know, I shouldn\u2019t talk like that anyways. But was I being rude to her when I spoke ill of my own body? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the \"AITA\" post is in the wrong. The situation is that the author's overweight friend gets upset when the author calls herself fat. The author is 125 lbs and not overweight, but she has body insecurities. They were shopping, the author tried on yoga pants, complained about her thighs and needing to lose weight. The friend felt upset, said it's rude for the author to talk about her body in front of her because she herself needs to lose weight, and it makes her uncomfortable. The author agreed not to do it, but now thinks it was unfair.\n\nSo, the main question is whether the author was in the wrong. The friend's reaction is based on her own insecurities. The author is talking about herself, not criticizing the friend. But the friend feels triggered. The author is confused because she's not targeting the friend, but the friend is upset. \n\nI need to consider if the author's actions were inappropriate. People have different sensitivities. Even if the author is talking about herself, it's possible that the friend feels compared or judged. However, the author didn't intend to hurt her friend. The friend's request is about her own feelings, but does that make the author responsible?\n\nOn one hand, the author might be in the right because she's expressing her own insecurities, which are valid. On the other hand, maybe the author should have considered how her friend feels and avoided bringing up weight issues in front of someone who might be sensitive. But the friend is the one with the weight issue, not the author. The author is not overweight.\n\nThe key points: The author's friend is the one with body image issues. The author's comments are about herself. The friend's reaction is based on her own insecurities. The author's intention wasn't to hurt the friend. However, the friend's feelings are valid. \n\nIn similar situations, it's often considered that even if someone is talking about themselves, it's good to be mindful of others' sensitivities. But if the friend is the one with the issue, does the author have to suppress her own thoughts? The friend's request might be a bit unfair, as the author is not the one who needs to lose weight. \n\nBut from a social standpoint, maybe the author should avoid such conversations if they make someone uncomfortable. However, the author is also dealing with her own insecurities, which are valid. It's a bit of a tough call. \n\nI think the answer depends on whether the author's actions were inherently rude. Since she's talking about her own body, it's not directly criticizing the friend. But the friend's feelings are important. The author might not be in the wrong because she's not targeting the friend, but she could consider being more sensitive. However, the friend's request seems a bit extreme. \n\nSo, maybe the answer is B (the author is not in the wrong), because she's expressing her own feelings, and the friend's reaction is based on her own issues. The author isn't being rude to the friend by talking about her own body. The responsibility is on the friend for her own sensitivity, not the author.\n"
