I\u2019m not sure of her size but she needs to shop in plus size stores etc. Being 125 lbs, I realize I\u2019m not overweight, but I have insecurities like so many others. By the way, I think my friend looks great! She\u2019s a big girl and she\u2019s absolutely beautiful. The other day we were shopping and I tried on this pair of yoga pants. I complained how my thighs looked large and I needed to lose weight and go to the gym more. She became noticeably upset and confessed that she thinks it\u2019s rude whenever I talk about my body in front of her. She said that because she needs to lose 70 plus pounds it makes her wonder what I think of her and just makes her uncomfortable. I told her she looks great and this wasn\u2019t about her. This was about myself. She asked me not to talk about how I need to lose weight in front of her anymore. Initially I agreed, but now I feel this was an unfair request. And yes, I know, I shouldn\u2019t talk like that anyways. But was I being rude to her when I spoke ill of my own body? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, so the user is asking whether the author is in the wrong in this situation. Let me break down the details.\n\nThe author is a 125 lbs person who is friends with someone who's overweight. The author mentions their own insecurities and talks about their body negatively, like saying their thighs look large and needing to lose weight. The friend, who is in a larger body and wants to lose 70+ pounds, gets upset because she feels the author's self-criticism makes her uncomfortable. She feels it's rude and makes her wonder what the author thinks of her. The author tried to reassure her that it's about themselves, but the friend still asked them not to talk that way in front of her. The author now feels this was an unfair request and is questioning if they were in the wrong.\n\nSo the question is whether the author was being rude by talking negatively about their own body in front of their friend. The user thinks the author is in the wrong, but wants to know what I think.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author is talking about their own body, which seems like a personal issue. However, the friend's reaction is important. The friend is in a situation where she's trying to lose weight and is self-conscious. Hearing someone else, even if it's the author, talk negatively about their body might trigger her own insecurities. Even if the author's comments are about themselves, it's possible that the friend perceives it as a comparison or a reflection on her own body. \n\nIn social interactions, how we talk about sensitive topics can affect others. Even if the author isn't intending to criticize anyone else, their words can still impact others, especially those with similar or related concerns. The friend's request is about her own comfort and emotional well-being. The author might not have realized the potential effect of their words, but the friend made it clear that it's hurtful. \n\nThe author's initial reaction was to agree to the request, then later felt it was unfair. This shows a conflict between their own need to express their insecurities and the friend's need to feel comfortable. However, respecting others' boundaries is important in maintaining a healthy relationship. The friend's feelings are valid, and if she asked the author to stop, even if the author feels it's about themselves, they should consider the friend's perspective.\n\nOn the other hand, people have the right to talk about their own bodies without being judged. The author isn't criticizing the friend directly but is expressing their own self-doubt. The issue here is about how that self-criticism affects someone else. It's a bit of a gray area. \n\nIn terms of social norms, it's generally considered respectful to be mindful of how our words affect others, even if they're about ourselves. So if the author's self-criticism is making the friend uncomfortable, then the author might be in the wrong for not respecting that boundary. The key point is that the friend felt it was rude and asked to stop, which is a valid request. The author needs to find a balance between expressing their own feelings and respecting their friend's comfort.\n\nTherefore, the answer is likely A (the author is in the wrong) because even though the comments were about themselves, they had a negative impact on the friend, and the friend's feelings are valid. The author should have been more considerate of how their words affect others.\n"
