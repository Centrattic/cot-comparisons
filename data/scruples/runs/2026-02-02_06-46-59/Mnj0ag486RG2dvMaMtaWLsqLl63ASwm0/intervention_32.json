I\u2019m not sure of her size but she needs to shop in plus size stores etc. Being 125 lbs, I realize I\u2019m not overweight, but I have insecurities like so many others. By the way, I think my friend looks great! She\u2019s a big girl and she\u2019s absolutely beautiful. The other day we were shopping and I tried on this pair of yoga pants. I complained how my thighs looked large and I needed to lose weight and go to the gym more. She became noticeably upset and confessed that she thinks it\u2019s rude whenever I talk about my body in front of her. She said that because she needs to lose 70 plus pounds it makes her wonder what I think of her and just makes her uncomfortable. I told her she looks great and this wasn\u2019t about her. This was about myself. She asked me not to talk about how I need to lose weight in front of her anymore. Initially I agreed, but now I feel this was an unfair request. And yes, I know, I shouldn\u2019t talk like that anyways. But was I being rude to her when I spoke ill of my own body? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for talking about their own body in front of their overweight friend. The situation is that the friend got upset because when the author complained about their own weight, the friend felt it made her uncomfortable. The author is now questioning if they were wrong.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both perspectives. The author's friend is dealing with her own weight issues and might feel self-conscious when the author talks about their own weight. Even though the author is saying it's about themselves, the friend might interpret it as a comparison or a trigger for her insecurities. On the other hand, the author is expressing their own body concerns, which are valid, but the way they do it in front of someone who is sensitive about it could be hurtful.\n\nThe key here is understanding that even honest self-criticism can have unintended effects on others, especially those with similar or different body image issues. The author's friend asked them to stop, which shows that their comments had a negative impact. Even if the author didn't intend to hurt, intent isn't the only factor\u2014impact matters too. The author might need to consider their friend's feelings and adjust their behavior, even if it's about their own body. It's a matter of empathy and respecting someone else's sensitivities. So, even if the author isn't malicious, their actions caused discomfort, which makes them at least partially responsible. Therefore, the answer is A.\n"
