      "text": "\nOkay, so the user is asking if the author of the \"AITA\" post is in the wrong after ghosting a friend who turned them down. Let me start by breaking down the situation.\n\nThe author had a good friendship with someone they've known since spring. They developed feelings and eventually confessed, but the friend didn't reciprocate. The author now feels that the friendship can't go back to normal, even though the friend is trying to maintain it. The author is ignoring texts and avoiding the person, which is considered ghosting. The user says they think the author is in the wrong but want my opinion.\n\nFirst, I need to consider what ghosting means. Ghosting is when someone suddenly stops all communication without explanation. In this case, the friend wants to continue being friends, but the author is avoiding them. The key point here is that the author is choosing to cut off the friend after being rejected, even though the friend is still interested in the friendship.\n\nNow, is the author in the wrong? Well, the friend didn't do anything unethical or cruel. They were nice about the rejection and are still reaching out. The author's issue is that they can't handle the friendship anymore because of their lingering feelings. However, ignoring and avoiding someone after they've been clear about wanting to continue the friendship could be seen as hurtful. It's possible the author could have communicated their feelings more openly, explaining that they need space or that they can't maintain the friendship in its current form. Instead, they chose to ghost, which might make the situation worse for the other person, who may not understand why the author is pulling away.\n\nOn the other hand, people have different coping mechanisms. The author might genuinely feel that being in the friendship is painful. But the responsibility is on them to communicate their feelings to the friend so that both parties can adjust. Ghosting doesn't allow for that mutual adjustment and can leave the other person confused or hurt, even if the rejection was handled well.\n\nThe community's typical response to such situations often leans towards the person who cuts off communication being in the wrong because it's abrupt and lacks communication. The friend is trying to salvage the relationship, while the author isn't engaging. So, even though the author is hurt, the lack of communication makes their actions questionable. Therefore, the answer is A, yes, the author is in the wrong.\n"
