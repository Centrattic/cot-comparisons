We got along really well and had a lot of the same interests.  I caught feelings for her a while ago, but was too chicken shit to do anything about it now.  I confessed how I felt to her and asked her out.  She was really nice about it, but didn\u2019t feel the same way.  \n\nI don\u2019t hold it against her or think negatively of her, but it\u2019s kind of like a Pandora\u2019s box type situation.  There\u2019s no going back to the way things were before.  She wants to continue to be friends and keeps trying to text and approach me about it.  I just don\u2019t see how we can be friends, my feelings for her haven\u2019t changed and remaining in the friendship would just be painful.  \n\nLately I\u2019ve been ignoring her texts and avoiding her. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of the AITA post is in the wrong for ghosting their friend after being turned down. The author had a friend they've known since spring, got feelings, confessed, and got rejected. Now they're avoiding the friend.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the situation from both sides. The author is hurt and can't see how they can be friends anymore. Ghosting is cutting off all communication, which is generally seen as inconsiderate. But the author explains that their feelings haven't changed and being in the friendship is painful. \n\nOn the other hand, the friend wants to maintain the friendship and is reaching out. Ghosting might leave the friend confused or hurt because they don't get a response. The author might be protecting themselves, but the friend might feel abandoned. \n\nIs there a better way? Maybe the author could have been honest but direct instead of ghosting. However, the author isn't the one who initiated the breakup; they were rejected. The emotional response is valid, but the method of handling it is questionable. \n\nIn AITA situations, being honest but clear is usually advised. Ghosting is often frowned upon because it doesn't give the other person a chance to respond. So, the author might be in the wrong because even if they're hurt, cutting off communication without explanation is harsh. They could have set boundaries or explained their need for space. So, answer A.\n"
