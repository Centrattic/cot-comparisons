      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the person who wrote this is in the wrong for ghosting their friend after being turned down. Let me start by breaking down the situation.\n\nThe user has a friend they've known since spring. They developed feelings but were too nervous to act. They confessed, and the friend was nice but didn't reciprocate. Now, the user is avoiding texts and trying to distance themselves, even though the friend wants to stay friends. The user thinks it's impossible to go back to the old friendship because their feelings haven't changed, and staying in touch would be painful.\n\nThe question is whether the user is in the wrong by ghosting. Let me consider different angles. \n\nFirst, emotions are involved. The user is going through a tough time after being rejected. Ghosting could hurt the friend, but the user is trying to protect themselves. However, is it fair to the friend who wants to maintain the friendship? The user's friend might feel confused or rejected in a second way by being ghosted.\n\nOn the other hand, the user's feelings haven't changed, and they might find it hard to be around the friend. Maybe they need space to heal. But communication is usually important in friendships. Instead of ghosting, maybe they should explain their feelings to the friend. Ghosting can be seen as disrespectful or avoidant. The user might be avoiding confrontation, which isn't healthy either.\n\nAnother point: the friend is trying to reach out, but the user is avoiding. The user could have set boundaries clearly, like needing space, rather than cutting off contact abruptly. Ghosting can leave the other person in limbo, unsure of what's going on. It might affect the friend's self-esteem, thinking they did something wrong.\n\nBut the user's reasoning is that they can't go back to the previous dynamic. Maybe their feelings are genuine, and staying friends isn't feasible. However, friendships can change. Maybe they can still be friends without it being the same as before. But if the user is in constant pain, maybe they need to step back.\n\nI'm torn here. On one hand, the user is reacting to rejection and emotional pain. On the other, ghosting isn't the best approach. The right thing would be to communicate openly, even if it's hard. So maybe the user is in the wrong for not explaining their reasons and instead cutting off contact. Ghosting is generally frowned upon because it's not honest. Even if the user is hurting, being upfront might be better for both parties.\n\nBut maybe the user isn't in the wrong because they're dealing with their emotions and don't want to hurt their friend. However, the friend might deserve an explanation. So, the user's action of ghosting is wrong because they didn't communicate. The answer would be A (in the wrong) because they didn't handle it properly. Alternatively, if they tried to avoid hurting the friend, maybe it's not their fault. But the act of ghosting without explanation is usually considered wrong. So, I think the answer is A.\n"
