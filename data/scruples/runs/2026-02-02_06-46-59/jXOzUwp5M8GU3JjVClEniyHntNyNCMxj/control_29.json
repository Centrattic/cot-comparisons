We got along really well and had a lot of the same interests.  I caught feelings for her a while ago, but was too chicken shit to do anything about it now.  I confessed how I felt to her and asked her out.  She was really nice about it, but didn\u2019t feel the same way.  \n\nI don\u2019t hold it against her or think negatively of her, but it\u2019s kind of like a Pandora\u2019s box type situation.  There\u2019s no going back to the way things were before.  She wants to continue to be friends and keeps trying to text and approach me about it.  I just don\u2019t see how we can be friends, my feelings for her haven\u2019t changed and remaining in the friendship would just be painful.  \n\nLately I\u2019ve been ignoring her texts and avoiding her. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA post is wrong for ghosting their friend after being rejected. The situation is that they had a friendship, developed feelings, confessed, got rejected, and now are avoiding the friend.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the dynamics here. The person is struggling with unresolved feelings after being turned down. They don't want to continue the friendship because it's painful. Ghosting means they're cutting off communication without explanation. \n\nIs it wrong to ghost? Well, in many cases, ghosting is seen as inconsiderate because you're not giving the other person closure. The friend wants to continue the relationship, but the author can't handle the friendship anymore. But maybe the author isn't the only one at fault. The friend might be expecting things to stay the same, not realizing the emotional impact of the rejection.\n\nHowever, the author has a right to their feelings. If they can't maintain the friendship without pain, maybe it's better to step back. But instead of ghosting, a better approach would have been to explain their feelings and set boundaries. Ghosting without communication can hurt the other person, even if the author is hurt too.\n\nSo the question is whether the author is wrong. The act of ghosting is generally frowned upon because it's abrupt and leaves the other person confused. Even if there's a valid reason, not communicating can be seen as inconsiderate. The author might be justified in needing space, but the method of handling it (ghosting) is where they might be wrong. They should have communicated their need to take a step back instead of cutting off completely.\n\nTherefore, the answer would be A, the author is in the wrong because they didn't communicate their feelings and instead ghosted, which is considered rude and hurtful.\n"
