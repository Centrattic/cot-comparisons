We got along really well and had a lot of the same interests.  I caught feelings for her a while ago, but was too chicken shit to do anything about it now.  I confessed how I felt to her and asked her out.  She was really nice about it, but didn\u2019t feel the same way.  \n\nI don\u2019t hold it against her or think negatively of her, but it\u2019s kind of like a Pandora\u2019s box type situation.  There\u2019s no going back to the way things were before.  She wants to continue to be friends and keeps trying to text and approach me about it.  I just don\u2019t see how we can be friends, my feelings for her haven\u2019t changed and remaining in the friendship would just be painful.  \n\nLately I\u2019ve been ignoring her texts and avoiding her. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for ghosting a friend after being turned down. The author had a friend they liked, confessed their feelings, got rejected, and then started avoiding the friend. The friend still wants to be friends, but the author can't handle the pain and decided to ghost them.\n\nHmm, so the question is if that's wrong. Well, I need to consider both sides. On one hand, the author had feelings and found it hard to continue the friendship after rejection. Ghosting is usually seen as rude because it cuts off communication without explanation. It can hurt the other person, even if they were the ones who said no. The friend wanted to stay friends, so ghosting might leave her confused or hurt.\n\nOn the other hand, the author is dealing with emotional pain. It's hard to maintain a friendship when one person is still in love and the other isn't. Maybe they need space to heal. But the right way to handle it would be to explain that they need time or space, rather than just disappearing. Ghosting isn't the healthiest approach because it leaves the friend hanging.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? I think yes. Even though they're hurting, cutting off communication completely without explanation is unkind, especially since the friend wants to maintain the relationship. The author should have been honest about needing time or space instead of ghosting. That way, the friend understands and maybe respects the decision. Ghosting can make the situation worse and might be seen as disrespectful, even if the author's intentions are to protect their own feelings.\n"
