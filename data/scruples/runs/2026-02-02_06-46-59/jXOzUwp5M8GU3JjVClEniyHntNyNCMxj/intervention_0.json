We got along really well and had a lot of the same interests.  I caught feelings for her a while ago, but was too chicken shit to do anything about it now.  I confessed how I felt to her and asked her out.  She was really nice about it, but didn\u2019t feel the same way.  \n\nI don\u2019t hold it against her or think negatively of her, but it\u2019s kind of like a Pandora\u2019s box type situation.  There\u2019s no going back to the way things were before.  She wants to continue to be friends and keeps trying to text and approach me about it.  I just don\u2019t see how we can be friends, my feelings for her haven\u2019t changed and remaining in the friendship would just be painful.  \n\nLately I\u2019ve been ignoring her texts and avoiding her. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let me try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong for ghosting a friend after being rejected. So first, I need to understand the situation.\n\nThey had a friend since spring, got along well, shared interests. The author developed feelings but was afraid to act. Then they confessed, and the friend was nice but didn't reciprocate. The friend wants to stay friends and keep texting, but the author is avoiding them because it's painful to keep being friends with unrequited feelings.\n\nSo the author is ghosting the friend. Now, the question is whether that's wrong. Let's break down the key points here. The friend was honest and rejected them, but was kind. The author is struggling with their emotions and can't see how they can maintain the friendship. They're ignoring texts and avoiding contact. \n\nGhosting is generally considered rude because it involves cutting off communication without explanation. The friend is trying to reach out and wants to continue the relationship, but the author is not responding. However, the author is experiencing emotional pain and might not be ready to handle the friendship anymore. \n\nBut is it the author's responsibility to deal with their feelings rather than ghosting? In many cases, people are supposed to communicate their boundaries even when it's hard. Ghosting can leave the other person confused and hurt, even if the author isn't in love with them. The friend might not know why they're being ignored and could feel rejected again or think they did something wrong. \n\nOn the other hand, the author is being honest in their own feelings. They don't want to be friends anymore because it's too painful. But instead of ghosting, maybe they should have communicated that they need space or explained that they can't continue the friendship after the rejection. \n\nSo, the issue here is communication. Ghosting, regardless of the reason, is usually seen as inconsiderate. The friend might be trying to respect the author's feelings and wants to maintain a friendship, but the author isn't giving them a clear answer. The author could have said, \"I really care about you, but I need some time and distance to process my feelings,\" which would be more respectful. \n\nTherefore, the author is in the wrong because they didn't communicate their need for space properly and instead chose to ghost, which is hurtful and disrespectful to the friend's attempts to maintain a relationship.\n"
