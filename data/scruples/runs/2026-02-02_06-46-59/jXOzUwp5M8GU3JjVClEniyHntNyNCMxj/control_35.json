There\u2019s no going back to the way things were before.  She wants to continue to be friends and keeps trying to text and approach me about it.  I just don\u2019t see how we can be friends, my feelings for her haven\u2019t changed and remaining in the friendship would just be painful.  \n\nLately I\u2019ve been ignoring her texts and avoiding her. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so the user is asking if the author of the AITA post is in the wrong for ghosting their friend after being rejected. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the author had a friend they liked since spring. They developed feelings but were too scared to act. Then they confessed, and the friend was kind but didn't reciprocate. The author now feels it's impossible to stay friends because their feelings haven't changed, so they've been ignoring her texts and avoiding her.\n\nHmm. The question is whether the author is in the wrong. Let me consider both sides. On one hand, the friend was clear she doesn't have romantic feelings, and the author is struggling to maintain a friendship after that. It's common for people to feel awkward or hurt after rejection, and maybe they need space. Ghosting might be hurtful, but maybe they're trying to protect themselves from ongoing pain.\n\nOn the other hand, the friend wants to continue being friends, and the author is cutting off communication. Even if the author can't see a way to be friends, maybe they could have communicated that instead of just ghosting. Being honest about their feelings and explaining why they need space might have been better than ignoring her. Ghosting can leave the friend confused and thinking there's something wrong on their part, even if the author isn't in the wrong.\n\nBut the author isn't holding it against the friend and acknowledges they're nice about the rejection. The problem is that the author's feelings make it impossible to stay friends. In that case, maybe the right approach is to be upfront and set boundaries rather than ghost. However, if the author isn't ready to handle the friendship, maybe taking time away is necessary. But is that inconsiderate?\n\nI think the key here is that the author didn't communicate their decision to the friend. Instead of ghosting, they should have explained that they can't handle being friends right now. That way, the friend knows it's not about her and isn't left wondering. So the author might be in the wrong for not communicating their reasons, even if their feelings are valid. Ghosting is generally considered inconsiderate unless there's a valid reason, and in this case, the author could have been honest instead.\n"
