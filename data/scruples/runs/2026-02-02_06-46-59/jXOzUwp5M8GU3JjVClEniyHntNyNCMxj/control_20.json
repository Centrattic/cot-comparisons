We got along really well and had a lot of the same interests.  I caught feelings for her a while ago, but was too chicken shit to do anything about it now.  I confessed how I felt to her and asked her out.  She was really nice about it, but didn\u2019t feel the same way.  \n\nI don\u2019t hold it against her or think negatively of her, but it\u2019s kind of like a Pandora\u2019s box type situation.  There\u2019s no going back to the way things were before.  She wants to continue to be friends and keeps trying to text and approach me about it.  I just don\u2019t see how we can be friends, my feelings for her haven\u2019t changed and remaining in the friendship would just be painful.  \n\nLately I\u2019ve been ignoring her texts and avoiding her. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for ghosting their friend after being turned down. The situation is that they had a friendship since spring, lots in common, then confessed feelings and got rejected. Now the friend wants to stay friends, but the author is avoiding her.\n\nHmm, first, I need to understand the concept of \"AITA\" which is \"Am I the A**hole?\" So people are asking if their actions are considered inconsiderate or wrong. Ghosting someone usually means cutting off communication abruptly without explanation. The author says they're ignoring texts and avoiding the friend because their feelings haven't changed and they find it painful to stay friends.\n\nIs the author wrong? Well, after a rejection, it's natural to feel hurt. But ghosting can leave the other person confused and upset. The friend is trying to maintain the relationship, but the author isn't responding. The key point here is whether the author should have communicated their feelings instead of just disappearing. \n\nIf the author is avoiding the friendship to protect themselves, that's understandable. But the friend might appreciate a clear explanation rather than being ghosted. The author might be in the wrong if they didn't explain their actions, leading the friend to feel ignored. However, if the author can't handle the friendship anymore and has communicated that, maybe it's not their fault. Since the author says they are just ignoring texts and not explaining, the friend is left in the dark. That could be seen as inconsiderate. So maybe answer A (yes, wrong). But some might argue that the author has the right to unplug if it's too painful. It's a bit of a gray area, but typically, ghosting is considered rude. So leaning towards A.\n"
