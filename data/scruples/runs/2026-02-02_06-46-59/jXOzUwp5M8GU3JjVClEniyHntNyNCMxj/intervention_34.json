We got along really well and had a lot of the same interests.  I caught feelings for her a while ago, but was too chicken shit to do anything about it now.  I confessed how I felt to her and asked her out.  She was really nice about it, but didn\u2019t feel the same way.  \n\nI don\u2019t hold it against her or think negatively of her, but it\u2019s kind of like a Pandora\u2019s box type situation.  There\u2019s no going back to the way things were before.  She wants to continue to be friends and keeps trying to text and approach me about it.  I just don\u2019t see how we can be friends, my feelings for her haven\u2019t changed and remaining in the friendship would just be painful.  \n\nLately I\u2019ve been ignoring her texts and avoiding her. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who ghosted their friend after being rejected is in the wrong. The situation is that they had a friendship, confessed their feelings, got rejected, and then decided to ghost the friend to avoid the pain of staying in the friendship.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics of the situation. The person was a friend first, so there's an existing relationship. They confessed their feelings and got rejected, which is tough. Now, the friend wants to continue the friendship, but the person can't handle the emotional pain, so they're ghosting.\n\nIs it wrong to ghost? Well, ghosting usually refers to cutting off communication abruptly without explanation. In this case, the person is ignoring texts and avoiding their friend. The key here is whether the person has a valid reason and if there's a better way to handle it.\n\nThe person's reasoning is that they can't be friends anymore because they still have feelings. But they might be avoiding the discomfort rather than dealing with it. However, cutting off communication without explaining can leave the other person confused and hurt. The friend might feel rejected again or not understand why the person is suddenly distant.\n\nBut on the other hand, if the person truly can't maintain the friendship without pain, maybe they're making a choice for their own well-being. However, the right approach would be to have an honest conversation, explain their feelings, and set boundaries rather than ghosting. Ghosting avoids accountability and can be hurtful regardless of the reason.\n\nSo, the author's action is wrong because they're not communicating, which is a key part of any relationship. They should at least explain why they need space, even if they can't be friends. Ghosting without explanation is inconsiderate, even if the underlying reason is emotional pain.\n"
