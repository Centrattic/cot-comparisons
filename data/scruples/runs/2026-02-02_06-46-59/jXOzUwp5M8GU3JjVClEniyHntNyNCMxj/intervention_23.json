We got along really well and had a lot of the same interests.  I caught feelings for her a while ago, but was too chicken shit to do anything about it now.  I confessed how I felt to her and asked her out.  She was really nice about it, but didn\u2019t feel the same way.  \n\nI don\u2019t hold it against her or think negatively of her, but it\u2019s kind of like a Pandora\u2019s box type situation.  There\u2019s no going back to the way things were before.  She wants to continue to be friends and keeps trying to text and approach me about it.  I just don\u2019t see how we can be friends, my feelings for her haven\u2019t changed and remaining in the friendship would just be painful.  \n\nLately I\u2019ve been ignoring her texts and avoiding her. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is that they had a friend they liked, asked her out, she turned them down, and now they're ghosting her. The author says they can't be friends anymore because it's too painful.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The author had a friendship that they developed feelings for, then confessed, got rejected, and now they're avoiding the friend. The friend still wants to maintain the friendship, but the author can't handle it. \n\nIs the author in the wrong? Well, ghosting is generally seen as inconsiderate. Even if you can't be friends anymore, cutting off communication abruptly without an explanation can be hurtful. The friend is trying to reach out, and the author is ignoring her. That could be seen as being inconsiderate of the other person's feelings. \n\nBut on the other hand, the author is dealing with emotional pain. Maybe they need space to heal. However, the right approach would be to have an honest conversation, explain their feelings, and set boundaries rather than ghosting. Ghosting doesn't give the other person closure and can leave them confused or hurt.\n\nSo the author's action of ghosting might be inconsiderate. They have the right to decide their own emotional well-being, but the way they're handling it\u2014ignoring texts and avoiding\u2014could be seen as wrong. They should communicate their need for space instead of just disappearing. Therefore, the answer might be A (in the wrong) because ghosting is typically viewed as rude, even if the person is struggling with their feelings.\n"
