There\u2019s no going back to the way things were before.  She wants to continue to be friends and keeps trying to text and approach me about it.  I just don\u2019t see how we can be friends, my feelings for her haven\u2019t changed and remaining in the friendship would just be painful.  \n\nLately I\u2019ve been ignoring her texts and avoiding her. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the \"AITA\" post is in the wrong for ghosting their friend after being rejected. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the situation: They had a friend since spring, got close, developed feelings, confessed them, and were turned down. The friend is still wanting to stay in touch, but the person is avoiding her now. They think they can't stay friends because it's too painful.\n\nI need to analyze if ghosting is wrong here. Ghosting usually refers to cutting off communication suddenly without explanation. But in this case, the person is avoiding texts and interactions because they can't handle the emotional pain after rejection. The friend wants to continue the friendship, but the author isn't ready for that.\n\nIs the author wrong? Well, everyone has different ways of handling rejection. Some people might need space, and ghosting could be a way to protect their own feelings. However, completely cutting off communication without any explanation can be hurtful. The friend might be confused or feel rejected again if there's no closure.\n\nBut the key point here is that the author was upfront about their feelings, got rejected, and now is struggling to maintain the friendship. They don't want to pretend things are okay when they're not. In some cases, taking time away to process is necessary. It's not about being in the wrong but about emotional readiness.\n\nOn the other hand, if the friend is trying to reach out and the author is ignoring them, maybe they should at least explain their need for space. But the question is about being in the wrong. If someone is hurt and needs distance, they aren't necessarily wrong for seeking it. It's more about communication than right or wrong.\n\nSo, considering all this, the answer might be B (Not in the wrong) because the author is dealing with their emotions. However, they could have been more communicative about their need for space. But the question is about being in the wrong, not about the best course of action. So, probably B.\n"
