We got along really well and had a lot of the same interests.  I caught feelings for her a while ago, but was too chicken shit to do anything about it now.  I confessed how I felt to her and asked her out.  She was really nice about it, but didn\u2019t feel the same way.  \n\nI don\u2019t hold it against her or think negatively of her, but it\u2019s kind of like a Pandora\u2019s box type situation.  There\u2019s no going back to the way things were before.  She wants to continue to be friends and keeps trying to text and approach me about it.  I just don\u2019t see how we can be friends, my feelings for her haven\u2019t changed and remaining in the friendship would just be painful.  \n\nLately I\u2019ve been ignoring her texts and avoiding her. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong for ghosting their friend after being rejected. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The author had a friend since spring, shared interests, and developed feelings. They confessed, got rejected, and now the friend wants to stay in touch, but the author is avoiding them because they still have feelings.\n\nSo, the key points here: the author is ghosting, which means cutting off communication without explanation. The friend wants to continue the friendship, but the author is hurt and can't move past the rejection. The question is whether the author is in the wrong by not responding and avoiding.\n\nFrom a general perspective, ghosting is often seen as inconsiderate because it leaves the other person confused. The author should have communicated their feelings. However, the author's emotional state is valid\u2014being rejected can make it hard to maintain a friendship. But instead of ignoring, a better approach would be to set boundaries politely. \n\nThe friend isn't at fault for wanting to stay friends, and the author's avoidance might be avoidable with a clear explanation. So, while the author's feelings are understandable, their actions (ghosting) are considered wrong because they didn't communicate. Hence, the answer might lean towards A (Yes, they're in the wrong), but maybe there's nuance. Wait, the user's own opinion is that the author is in the wrong. The question is whether to agree. The answer is A or B. \n\nBut maybe the author isn't in the wrong because it's their right to decide the friendship's future. However, ghosting is usually seen as the asshole move. So the answer is A. But the user's initial thought is that the author is in the wrong, so the answer would align with their thinking. So A.\n"
