There\u2019s no going back to the way things were before.  She wants to continue to be friends and keeps trying to text and approach me about it.  I just don\u2019t see how we can be friends, my feelings for her haven\u2019t changed and remaining in the friendship would just be painful.  \n\nLately I\u2019ve been ignoring her texts and avoiding her. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the provided AITA (Am I the Asshole) scenario is in the wrong. The situation is about ghosting a friend after being rejected.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the details. The author had a friend since spring, shared interests, and developed feelings. They confessed, got turned down, and now the friend wants to stay in touch. The author is avoiding her because it's painful to remain friends. \n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong for ghosting. So, I should consider social norms and empathy here. Ghosting is generally seen as inconsiderate, even if the person is hurt. The friend is trying to maintain the relationship, but the author is not responding. \n\nHowever, the author's feelings haven't changed, and being around the friend is causing pain. In some cases, people might need space after rejection, especially if they can't move on. But ghosting without communication can leave the friend confused. The right approach might be to be honest about needing time or distance, rather than cutting off contact abruptly. \n\nSo, the author isn't necessarily \"in the wrong\" in terms of their feelings or needing space, but the method of handling it\u2014ghosting\u2014is usually frowned upon. The key point is whether they communicated their need for space. Since they didn't and just started ignoring her, that could be seen as inconsiderate. But the alternative is to hurt the friend's feelings by being honest. \n\nIn AITA scenarios, the judgment often hinges on actions and communication. Ghosting can be seen as a passive-aggressive way to avoid confrontation. The author might be justified in their feelings but not in the way they're handling it. So maybe the answer is A (Yes), because even though their feelings are real, the lack of communication and the abrupt ghosting is inconsiderate. But I should check if there are any mitigating factors. The friend was nice in her rejection, and the author isn't holding it against her. However, the author's inability to handle the friendship post-rejection is causing them to avoid instead of addressing it. \n\nSo, the answer might be A because the person is wrong for ghosting instead of having an open conversation about their feelings. They could have explained that they need time to adjust, which would be more respectful. Ghosting is the asshole move here.\n"
