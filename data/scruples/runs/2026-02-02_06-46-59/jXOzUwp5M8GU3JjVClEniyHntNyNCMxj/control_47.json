We got along really well and had a lot of the same interests.  I caught feelings for her a while ago, but was too chicken shit to do anything about it now.  I confessed how I felt to her and asked her out.  She was really nice about it, but didn\u2019t feel the same way.  \n\nI don\u2019t hold it against her or think negatively of her, but it\u2019s kind of like a Pandora\u2019s box type situation.  There\u2019s no going back to the way things were before.  She wants to continue to be friends and keeps trying to text and approach me about it.  I just don\u2019t see how we can be friends, my feelings for her haven\u2019t changed and remaining in the friendship would just be painful.  \n\nLately I\u2019ve been ignoring her texts and avoiding her. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who ghosted their friend after being turned down is in the wrong. The options are A (yes) or B (no). \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The person had a friendship, developed feelings, confessed, and was rejected. Now they're avoiding the friend because they can't go back to how things were. The friend still wants to be friends, but the author is ghosting them.\n\nSo, the key points here are: the friendship was important, the author had unrequited feelings, the friend is trying to maintain the relationship, but the author is cutting off contact. \n\nIn terms of right and wrong, it's about empathy and communication. Ghosting means cutting off without explanation, which is usually seen as inconsiderate. Even if the author is hurt, the right approach would be to explain their feelings and set boundaries. The friend might need time and space, but ghosting can leave the other person confused or hurt. \n\nHowever, the author's feelings are valid too. If they can't maintain the friendship without pain, maybe taking a step back is necessary. But the wrong part here is not communicating. Instead of ignoring texts, explaining that they need space could be better. \n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? If they didn't communicate their needs and just ghosted, then yes, they might be in the wrong because it's abrupt. But if they made it clear that they need time and can't continue the friendship, that's different. The scenario says they're ignoring texts and avoiding her, which is ghosting without explanation. That's usually considered rude. \n\nTherefore, the answer would be A (yes, the author is in the wrong) because they didn't communicate properly and opted for ghosting instead.\n"
