We got along really well and had a lot of the same interests.  I caught feelings for her a while ago, but was too chicken shit to do anything about it now.  I confessed how I felt to her and asked her out.  She was really nice about it, but didn\u2019t feel the same way.  \n\nI don\u2019t hold it against her or think negatively of her, but it\u2019s kind of like a Pandora\u2019s box type situation.  There\u2019s no going back to the way things were before.  She wants to continue to be friends and keeps trying to text and approach me about it.  I just don\u2019t see how we can be friends, my feelings for her haven\u2019t changed and remaining in the friendship would just be painful.  \n\nLately I\u2019ve been ignoring her texts and avoiding her. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote this is in the wrong. The situation is about ghosting a friend after being rejected. The writer had a friend they liked since spring, confessed their feelings, and got turned down. Now they're ignoring her texts and avoiding her, leading to the \"AITA\" question.\n\nHmm. So, the writer's argument is that they can't be friends anymore because their feelings haven't changed, and being in the friendship is painful. They mention that their friend wants to continue the friendship, but the writer is avoiding her. \n\nI need to decide if the writer is in the wrong. The user thinks they are, but I need to evaluate. On one hand, the writer is being honest about their feelings and the emotional pain they're experiencing. It's understandable that moving on might be hard. But on the other hand, ghosting is generally seen as inconsiderate. The friend is trying to maintain the relationship, and the writer is cutting off communication without a clear explanation. \n\nGhosting usually implies not giving a reason or closure, which can hurt the other person. Even if the writer is hurting, maybe they should have communicated their need for space or time clearly instead of just disappearing. The friend might be confused or worried if there's no explanation. \n\nThe writer also mentions that the friendship can't go back to how it was, but maybe they could have set boundaries instead of completely cutting off. Like saying they need some time apart but don't want to be enemies. \n\nSo, while the writer's feelings are valid, the way they handled it by ghosting could be seen as inconsiderate. They could have been more direct and compassionate, even if they couldn't stay friends. Therefore, the answer might be A (they're in the wrong) because ghosting is not the best approach here, even if their reasoning is understandable.\n"
