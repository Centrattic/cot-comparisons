      "text": "\nOkay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. Let me read through the situation again.\n\nThe user is asking if they're \"AITA\" (Am I the Asshole) for ghosting their friend after she turned them down. They've been friends since spring, got along well, and the user developed feelings. They confessed, but the friend didn't reciprocate. She wants to stay friends, but the user is ignoring her texts and avoiding her because they can't see how they can still be friends. The user's reasoning is that their feelings haven't changed, and staying friends would be painful.\n\nSo the question is: is the user in the wrong by ghosting their friend? The options are A (yes) or B (no). \n\nFirst, I should consider the social norms around this. When someone has a crush and gets rejected, it's common to feel hurt. The friend didn't reciprocate, but she's trying to maintain the friendship. The user is struggling with that, so they're avoiding her. Ghosting, though, is generally seen as inconsiderate. It's cutting off communication without explanation, which can leave the other person confused or hurt.\n\nOn one hand, the user is dealing with emotional pain. It's understandable that they might not want to see their friend anymore, especially if being around her is painful. But on the other hand, ghosting is a harsh way to handle it. A better approach would be to have an honest conversation, explain that they need space, or set boundaries. By ghosting, the user is making it hard for the friend to understand what's going on, which could make her feel rejected again or even more confused.\n\nThe user mentions that the friend is \"trying to text and approach me about it.\" If the user can't be friends anymore, it's their right to step back, but it's also considerate to communicate that clearly. Ghosting doesn't give the friend closure. So, while the user isn't necessarily \"wrong\" in feeling the way they do, their action of ghosting might be seen as inconsiderate. \n\nBut does that make them \"in the wrong\"? The term \"wrong\" here is subjective. If the user had a legitimate reason (like being in pain) and the friend is pushing for contact, the user might not be in the wrong for prioritizing their own well-being. However, the method of ignoring and avoiding is where the issue lies. \n\nIn AITA situations, the key is whether the action was considerate. Ghosting is generally frowned upon because it lacks communication. So the user is inconsiderate, but not necessarily malicious. They might not be in the wrong in the sense of having bad intentions, but the action is still inconsiderate. \n\nSo the answer could be A (yes, in the wrong) because ghosting is inconsiderate, even if the user's feelings are valid. However, some might argue that the user isn't in the wrong because they're dealing with their emotions and need space. It's a bit of a gray area. The friend is trying to maintain the friendship, but the user can't. The user's decision to ghost is a poor way to handle it, but perhaps not malicious. \n\nI think the consensus here would lean towards the user being inconsiderate but not necessarily \"in the wrong\" in a moral sense. However, since the question is whether they are in the wrong (as in, at fault or to blame), the answer might be A. Because ghosting is a breach of social etiquette, even if driven by personal pain. So the user is in the wrong for not handling the situation with more communication.\n"
