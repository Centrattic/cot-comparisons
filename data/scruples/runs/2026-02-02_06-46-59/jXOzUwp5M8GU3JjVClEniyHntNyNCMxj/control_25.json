We got along really well and had a lot of the same interests.  I caught feelings for her a while ago, but was too chicken shit to do anything about it now.  I confessed how I felt to her and asked her out.  She was really nice about it, but didn\u2019t feel the same way.  \n\nI don\u2019t hold it against her or think negatively of her, but it\u2019s kind of like a Pandora\u2019s box type situation.  There\u2019s no going back to the way things were before.  She wants to continue to be friends and keeps trying to text and approach me about it.  I just don\u2019t see how we can be friends, my feelings for her haven\u2019t changed and remaining in the friendship would just be painful.  \n\nLately I\u2019ve been ignoring her texts and avoiding her. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for ghosting their friend after being rejected. The situation is that they had a friendship, the author developed feelings, asked her out, she said no, and now he's avoiding her.\n\nHmm. So first, the user wants to know if the author is wrong. The options are A (yes) or B (no). I need to analyze the situation from both sides.\n\nThe author's perspective: They had feelings, confessed, got rejected. They don't want to hold it against her but can't be friends anymore. They're avoiding her to avoid pain. They don't see how they can continue the friendship.\n\nThe friend's perspective: She's trying to maintain the friendship, is nice about the rejection, and is reaching out. The author is ghosting her, which can be hurtful because it's cutting off communication.\n\nGhosting is generally considered rude because it leaves the other person in the dark. Even if the author is hurt, cutting off communication without explanation can be seen as inconsiderate. The friend isn't doing anything wrong by trying to be understanding and wanting to continue the friendship.\n\nHowever, the author's feelings are valid. If they can't see a way to be friends anymore, it's understandable they might need space. But ghosting isn't the healthiest way to handle it. A more mature approach would be to explain their feelings and set boundaries without completely cutting off contact.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? Well, they aren't the one who initiated the romantic interest, so they can't be blamed for that. But ghosting after a rejection might be seen as inconsiderate because the friend is trying to move forward. The author should have communicated their need for space instead of just ignoring her. Therefore, maybe the author is in the wrong. Answer A.\n"
