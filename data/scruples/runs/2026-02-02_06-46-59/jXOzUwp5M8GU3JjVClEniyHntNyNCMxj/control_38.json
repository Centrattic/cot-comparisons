      "text": "\nOkay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong for ghosting their friend after being rejected. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the situation: They've been friends since spring, shared interests. The author developed feelings but was too scared to act. Then they confessed, the friend was nice but didn't reciprocate. The friend wants to stay friends, but the author is finding it hard and is now ignoring texts and avoiding her. The question is whether the author is in the wrong.\n\nHmm. So, the author got rejected, which is tough. They tried to be honest, which is good. The friend is trying to maintain the friendship, but the author can't handle it and is ghosting. Ghosting is generally seen as inconsiderate because you don't communicate. The author's reasoning is that being friends is painful because their feelings haven't changed. \n\nBut is it the author's fault? Well, when you have feelings for someone and they don't reciprocate, it's hard to move on. The author might feel that staying friends is too painful. However, ghosting is a harsh way to handle it. The friend is making an effort to stay in touch, and ignoring them might hurt her feelings. \n\nOn one hand, the author has a right to their emotions and may need space. On the other, cutting off without explanation can be seen as selfish. The key here is communication. If the author can't be friends, they should explain that they need time or space, rather than ghosting. But the question is about whether the author is in the wrong. \n\nIf the author's actions are causing the friend distress without a clear reason, then maybe they are. But if they genuinely can't handle the friendship and are being honest (though through ghosting), it's a bit more nuanced. \n\nI think the main issue is the lack of communication. Ghosting is usually frowned upon. So even if the author is hurt, they should have communicated their feelings instead of just disappearing. Therefore, the author might be in the wrong for not being upfront. But maybe they're not because they're dealing with their emotions. \n\nBut the standard answer to AITA usually considers ghosting as a negative action. So the answer might be A (in the wrong) because they didn't communicate properly. However, if the author is truly unable to be friends and is honest, maybe not. Hmm.\n"
