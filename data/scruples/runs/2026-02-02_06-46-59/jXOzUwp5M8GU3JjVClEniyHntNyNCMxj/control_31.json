We got along really well and had a lot of the same interests.  I caught feelings for her a while ago, but was too chicken shit to do anything about it now.  I confessed how I felt to her and asked her out.  She was really nice about it, but didn\u2019t feel the same way.  \n\nI don\u2019t hold it against her or think negatively of her, but it\u2019s kind of like a Pandora\u2019s box type situation.  There\u2019s no going back to the way things were before.  She wants to continue to be friends and keeps trying to text and approach me about it.  I just don\u2019t see how we can be friends, my feelings for her haven\u2019t changed and remaining in the friendship would just be painful.  \n\nLately I\u2019ve been ignoring her texts and avoiding her. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure this out. The user wants to know if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong for ghosting their friend after being turned down.\n\nFirst, the context: The person had a close friendship for a while, developed feelings, confessed them, and the friend didn't reciprocate. The friend wants to stay friends, but the author can't handle it because they still have feelings and it's painful. So they're ghosting.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. So I need to consider both sides. \n\nOn one hand, the friend was clear and kind in rejecting them. The friend also wants to maintain the friendship, which is understandable. The author, however, is choosing to cut off communication because they can't move on. Ghosting is generally seen as inconsiderate because it leaves the other person without closure. The friend might feel hurt or confused, especially since they're trying to maintain the relationship. \n\nBut on the other hand, the author is dealing with unrequited feelings, which is tough. They might genuinely find it too painful to continue the friendship. It's possible that they're trying to protect their own emotional well-being by creating distance. However, the right way to handle this would be to communicate clearly instead of ghosting. \n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? Ghosting usually isn't the best approach. Even if they can't be friends, a direct conversation would be better. By ignoring texts and avoiding the friend, the author is being unfair to the other person who is trying to maintain the friendship. The friend might not know why they're being ghosted and could take it personally, even if the author's reasons are valid. \n\nTherefore, the author's actions are inconsiderate, even if their feelings are genuine. They should have communicated their need for space instead of cutting off abruptly. So the answer would be A, the author is in the wrong.\n"
