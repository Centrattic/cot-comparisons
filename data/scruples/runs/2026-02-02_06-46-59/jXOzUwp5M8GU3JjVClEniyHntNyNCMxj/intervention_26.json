We got along really well and had a lot of the same interests.  I caught feelings for her a while ago, but was too chicken shit to do anything about it now.  I confessed how I felt to her and asked her out.  She was really nice about it, but didn\u2019t feel the same way.  \n\nI don\u2019t hold it against her or think negatively of her, but it\u2019s kind of like a Pandora\u2019s box type situation.  There\u2019s no going back to the way things were before.  She wants to continue to be friends and keeps trying to text and approach me about it.  I just don\u2019t see how we can be friends, my feelings for her haven\u2019t changed and remaining in the friendship would just be painful.  \n\nLately I\u2019ve been ignoring her texts and avoiding her. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let me try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that they had a friend since spring, got close, and then they confessed their feelings. The friend said no but was nice about it. Now the author is ghosting them, ignoring texts and avoiding her.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethics of ghosting. Ghosting usually means cutting off communication suddenly without explanation. In this case, the author is avoiding the friend because they still have feelings, which is causing them pain. The friend wants to stay friends, but the author can't see how that would work anymore.\n\nOn one hand, the author might be hurting the friend by not responding. Ghosting can be really hurtful, even if the person is trying to protect their own emotions. The friend might feel rejected again, especially since they were already turned down once. They might not understand why the author is now cutting off contact, leading to confusion or more emotional distress.\n\nOn the other hand, the author is dealing with unrequited feelings and finds it painful to maintain the friendship. They might think that maintaining a friendship is impossible now, so the best way to avoid further pain is to distance themselves. They might be trying to protect their own emotional well-being, even if it's harsh on the friend.\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Well, communication is usually better than ghosting. Even if they can't be friends anymore, explaining their need for space could be more considerate. By not communicating, the author leaves the friend in the dark, which can be worse. However, the author's feelings are valid too. They might not be able to handle the friendship anymore.\n\nBut the initial rejection was handled kindly, and the friend is still wanting to maintain the relationship. The author's response of ghosting might be seen as dismissive or hurtful. Maybe there's a middle ground, like explaining that they need time apart because they can't be friends right now. That way, the friend understands and the author isn't just cutting off without reason.\n\nSo, in terms of right and wrong, the author isn't necessarily evil, but their method of handling it is. They could have been more upfront. Ghosting is generally frowned upon, even in these situations. The author might be in the wrong because they didn't communicate their need for space properly, leading to more hurt for the friend.\n"
