      "text": "\nOkay, so I need to figure out whether the author of this AITA post is in the wrong for ghosting their friend after being rejected. Let's start by breaking down the situation.\n\nThe user has a friend they've known since spring. They had a good friendship and shared interests. The user developed feelings but was too shy to act. Eventually, they confessed their feelings and asked the friend out. The friend was nice but didn't reciprocate. Now the user is avoiding the friend and ignoring texts, leading the friend to want to continue the friendship, but the user can't see how they can be friends anymore because of lingering feelings.\n\nFirst, I should consider the dynamics here. The user made a romantic move, was rejected, and then chose to cut off the friend. Ghosting is generally considered rude because it leaves the other person confused and without closure. The friend is trying to maintain the friendship, but the user is avoiding them. \n\nBut the user's reasoning is that being friends would be painful because their feelings haven't changed. Is it fair to expect someone to continue a friendship despite unrequited feelings? That's a tricky part. People have different coping mechanisms. The user might feel that maintaining distance is necessary for their emotional well-being. However, ghosting is a harsh way to do it. \n\nOn the other hand, the friend might feel hurt by the sudden cutoff. The user could have been more direct in explaining that they need space but still want to be respectful. Instead, ignoring texts and avoiding them without communication can be seen as inconsiderate. \n\nSo the key points are: the user's emotional need for space vs. the friend's right to understanding and closure. Ghosting is often frowned upon even if the situation is painful. The user might have been in the wrong for not communicating their need for distance properly. They could have explained that they need time to process and aren't ready for a friendship yet, which would have been more respectful. \n\nBut the user's feelings are real and valid. They might not be \"in the wrong\" morally, but they are acting inconsiderately. The question is whether inconsiderate actions make them at fault. In AITA scenarios, the focus is on the actions and their impact. Ghosting is typically considered a fail, so the answer might lean towards A (the author is in the wrong). However, if the user's actions were a result of emotional distress and they had a legitimate reason, maybe B (not in the wrong) is possible. \n\nBut given that ghosting is generally seen as a poor choice regardless of the reason, the community might side with A. However, some might argue that the user isn't obligated to be friends if it's too painful. But the issue is the method of disengagement. The user should have communicated their feelings and need for space more clearly. So the wrong here is in the ghosting, not the decision to distance themselves. Therefore, the answer is A.\n"
