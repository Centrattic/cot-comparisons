We got along really well and had a lot of the same interests.  I caught feelings for her a while ago, but was too chicken shit to do anything about it now.  I confessed how I felt to her and asked her out.  She was really nice about it, but didn\u2019t feel the same way.  \n\nI don\u2019t hold it against her or think negatively of her, but it\u2019s kind of like a Pandora\u2019s box type situation.  There\u2019s no going back to the way things were before.  She wants to continue to be friends and keeps trying to text and approach me about it.  I just don\u2019t see how we can be friends, my feelings for her haven\u2019t changed and remaining in the friendship would just be painful.  \n\nLately I\u2019ve been ignoring her texts and avoiding her. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote this is in the wrong. The situation is about ghosting a friend after a rejection. The author had a friend they liked, confessed their feelings, got rejected, and now are avoiding the friend.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author had a friendship that turned into a crush. They confessed, got rejected, and now can't be friends anymore because of lingering feelings. They're ignoring texts and avoiding the person. The user thinks the author is in the wrong but wants my opinion.\n\nSo, what's the key here? The author's actions are ghosting after being rejected. The friend wants to continue the friendship, but the author can't handle it. Ghosting is often seen as rude or inconsiderate. But there's a reason here\u2014the author can't reconcile being friends anymore. \n\nIs the author being selfish? Maybe. They might be prioritizing their own feelings over the friend's. The friend is trying to maintain the relationship, but the author is pushing them away without communication. That could be hurtful. However, the author is also dealing with unrequited feelings and emotional pain. \n\nIs there a better way to handle it? Probably. Instead of ghosting, the author could have communicated clearly that they need space or explained their feelings. Ghosting leaves the other person confused and might make them feel rejected again. \n\nBut the question is whether the author is in the wrong. Ghosting is generally frowned upon, even in these situations. However, the author's emotional state is valid. They can't maintain the friendship. So is it their fault? They might be in the wrong for not handling it more compassionately. \n\nAlternatively, maybe they're not in the wrong because they can't force themselves to be friends. People have different coping mechanisms. The friend might not understand, but the author has a right to their feelings. \n\nHmm. The key factors are communication and respect. Ghosting lacks communication. Even if you can't be friends, a respectful goodbye is better. So, maybe the author is in the wrong for ghosting instead of talking. \n\nSo answer A for yes, the author is in the wrong.\n"
