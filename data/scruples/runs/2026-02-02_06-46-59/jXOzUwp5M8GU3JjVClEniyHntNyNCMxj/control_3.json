We got along really well and had a lot of the same interests.  I caught feelings for her a while ago, but was too chicken shit to do anything about it now.  I confessed how I felt to her and asked her out.  She was really nice about it, but didn\u2019t feel the same way.  \n\nI don\u2019t hold it against her or think negatively of her, but it\u2019s kind of like a Pandora\u2019s box type situation.  There\u2019s no going back to the way things were before.  She wants to continue to be friends and keeps trying to text and approach me about it.  I just don\u2019t see how we can be friends, my feelings for her haven\u2019t changed and remaining in the friendship would just be painful.  \n\nLately I\u2019ve been ignoring her texts and avoiding her. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The person asked if they're in the wrong for ghosting their friend after being rejected. They had a good friendship, developed feelings, confessed, got rejected, and now they're avoiding the friend. The friend wants to stay friends, but the author can't handle it and is ghosting.\n\nHmm, the user is asking if the author is at fault. So, first, I need to consider the situation from both sides. The friend turned them down, and the author is struggling to maintain the friendship. They don't want to hold it against her, but their feelings haven't changed, making the friendship painful. They're choosing to ghost instead of confronting the situation.\n\nIs there a right or wrong here? Well, in relationships, when someone has unrequited feelings, it's tough. Maintaining a friendship after rejection can be hard, but cutting off communication entirely without explanation might not be the best approach. However, the author might feel that staying in contact is too painful. On the other hand, the friend is trying to maintain the friendship, and ghosting could hurt her feelings, even if she was the one who rejected the romantic interest.\n\nI need to think about social norms here. Ghosting is generally seen as inconsiderate because it leaves the other person without closure. But in this case, the author's reason is emotional distress. Some might argue that they should've communicated their need for space. But others might say that it's understandable to step back if they can't handle the friendship anymore.\n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong. If the answer is A (yes), then the reasoning would be that ghosting is unfair to the friend who wants to continue the relationship. If it's B (no), then it's because the author is protecting their own emotional well-being and can't force themselves to be friends.\n\nI think it's a bit of a gray area. But since the friend initiated the texts and approached the author, and the author's response is to ignore them, maybe the author is in the wrong for not communicating their feelings. However, the author isn't obligated to stay friends. The real issue is whether ghosting is appropriate. In many cases, people are advised to at least explain if they need space. But if the author is truly unable to continue the friendship, maybe they shouldn't stay in contact. Yet, ignoring someone's attempts to reach out without any explanation can be hurtful. So maybe the author isn't in the wrong because they're dealing with their own emotions, but they could have handled it better. But the question is about being \"in the wrong.\" Since ghosting isn't inherently right or wrong, but often considered rude, maybe the answer is A. However, given the context of unrequited love causing pain, perhaps the answer is B. I'm a bit torn here. Let me check common advice. Usually, experts suggest that if you can't maintain a friendship, it's better to communicate that, but if you can't, then stepping back is okay. But ghosting is typically discouraged. So maybe the answer is A. But the user's situation is complicated. So the answer might be B because they're not obligated to be friends, but their method is poor. But the question is about being in the wrong. If the friend is trying to maintain the friendship and the author just disappears, that's inconsiderate. So perhaps the answer is A. But maybe not. It's a tough call. I think the answer is A because ghosting is generally seen as wrong, even if the reason is emotional pain. So the author is in the wrong for not communicating and cutting off contact without explanation. So answer A.\n"
