We got along really well and had a lot of the same interests.  I caught feelings for her a while ago, but was too chicken shit to do anything about it now.  I confessed how I felt to her and asked her out.  She was really nice about it, but didn\u2019t feel the same way.  \n\nI don\u2019t hold it against her or think negatively of her, but it\u2019s kind of like a Pandora\u2019s box type situation.  There\u2019s no going back to the way things were before.  She wants to continue to be friends and keeps trying to text and approach me about it.  I just don\u2019t see how we can be friends, my feelings for her haven\u2019t changed and remaining in the friendship would just be painful.  \n\nLately I\u2019ve been ignoring her texts and avoiding her. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is that they had a friend they liked, confessed their feelings, got rejected, and then ghosted the friend. The writer explains that they can't go back to being friends because their feelings haven't changed and it's painful.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethics here. The person was upfront about their feelings and got a polite rejection. The friend wants to stay in touch, but the writer is avoiding them. Ghosting is generally considered rude because it cuts off communication abruptly without explanation. Even if the writer is hurt, it's not the other person's fault. \n\nBut there's also the aspect of emotional well-being. The writer feels that staying friends would be painful. Maybe they need space to heal. However, the right approach would be to communicate that need instead of ghosting. Ghosting can leave the other person confused and hurt, even if they were the one who rejected the advances. \n\nThe user's question is whether the author is in the wrong. The options are A (yes) or B (no). I think the key here is whether it's fair to ghost. While the writer's feelings are valid, the method of handling it (ghosting) is inconsiderate. The better approach would be to be honest about needing space, even if it's uncomfortable. So, the answer might be A. But I should also consider if there's a valid reason for ghosting. If the writer truly can't handle the friendship anymore, maybe they're not in the wrong for prioritizing their mental health. However, the act of ghosting is still considered rude regardless of the reason. \n\nAnother angle: the friend wants to maintain the friendship, but the writer can't. The writer should have communicated that instead of cutting off contact. So, the writer is partly at fault for not being honest about their need for space. Therefore, AITA would lean towards the writer being in the wrong. So the answer is A.\n"
