We got along really well and had a lot of the same interests.  I caught feelings for her a while ago, but was too chicken shit to do anything about it now.  I confessed how I felt to her and asked her out.  She was really nice about it, but didn\u2019t feel the same way.  \n\nI don\u2019t hold it against her or think negatively of her, but it\u2019s kind of like a Pandora\u2019s box type situation.  There\u2019s no going back to the way things were before.  She wants to continue to be friends and keeps trying to text and approach me about it.  I just don\u2019t see how we can be friends, my feelings for her haven\u2019t changed and remaining in the friendship would just be painful.  \n\nLately I\u2019ve been ignoring her texts and avoiding her. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, so the user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. Let me break this down. The situation is that the author had a friend they liked, confessed their feelings, got turned down, and now they're ghosting the friend. The friend wants to stay friends, but the author can't handle the pain of being around them anymore.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The author initiated the confession, which is a big step. The friend was nice but didn't reciprocate. The author is struggling with their feelings and is choosing to ghost. Ghosting is generally seen as inconsiderate because it cuts off communication abruptly without explanation, which can leave the other person confused or hurt.\n\nThe author says they don't hold it against their friend and don't think negatively of them, which might show they're trying to handle it maturely. However, ignoring texts and avoiding them without a clear reason could be seen as rude. The friend is making efforts to maintain the friendship, so the author's response might be dismissive. But on the other hand, the author is dealing with emotional pain and might need time or space to process their feelings.\n\nI should also think about whether the author has a right to their feelings. It's valid to feel hurt and need distance. However, ghosting isn't the healthiest way to handle it. A more considerate approach would be to explain the need for space while being respectful. The author's actions might be seen as selfish if they're not communicating their reasons, even if they're struggling.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? They might be if we consider that ghosting without explanation is inconsiderate, especially when the friend is trying to maintain a relationship. However, their emotional struggle is valid. The key here is that they didn't communicate their reasons. If they had explained that they need time to adjust, it might be more understandable. But as it stands, ghosting is typically viewed as a poor choice in such scenarios.\n"
