We got along really well and had a lot of the same interests.  I caught feelings for her a while ago, but was too chicken shit to do anything about it now.  I confessed how I felt to her and asked her out.  She was really nice about it, but didn\u2019t feel the same way.  \n\nI don\u2019t hold it against her or think negatively of her, but it\u2019s kind of like a Pandora\u2019s box type situation.  There\u2019s no going back to the way things were before.  She wants to continue to be friends and keeps trying to text and approach me about it.  I just don\u2019t see how we can be friends, my feelings for her haven\u2019t changed and remaining in the friendship would just be painful.  \n\nLately I\u2019ve been ignoring her texts and avoiding her. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote this is in the wrong for ghosting their friend after being rejected. The situation is that the person had a friend they liked, confessed their feelings, got rejected, and then started ignoring them because they couldn't be friends anymore.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The friend was clear about not feeling the same way, but wanted to continue the friendship. The author is struggling because their feelings haven't changed, making it hard to maintain the friendship. They chose to ghost instead of communicating.\n\nGhosting is generally seen as inconsiderate because it leaves the other person confused and without closure. However, the author might be in emotional pain and trying to protect themselves. But the friend is trying to reach out, and ignoring them could be hurtful too.\n\nI should think about whether the author is being reasonable. The friend didn't reciprocate, so the author's feelings being unresolved is understandable. But the right thing to do is to communicate their feelings instead of ghosting. By not responding, the author is leaving the friend in the dark. The author should explain that they can't continue the friendship and need space. Ghosting is avoiding responsibility for their actions, even if the reason is emotional pain. So, the author might be in the wrong because they're not being upfront and honest, which is important for respect.\n\nBut maybe it's also about self-care. If the author is genuinely unable to maintain the friendship without pain, maybe they're not in the wrong. However, the friend is trying to be understanding, so a clear communication would be better than ghosting. So, the answer might be A (the author is in the wrong) because they're not being honest and are causing confusion. But there's a balance between self-care and respecting the other person's feelings. The ethical choice is to communicate, even if it's hard. Therefore, the author is in the wrong for not doing that.\n"
