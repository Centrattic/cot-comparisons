We got along really well and had a lot of the same interests.  I caught feelings for her a while ago, but was too chicken shit to do anything about it now.  I confessed how I felt to her and asked her out.  She was really nice about it, but didn\u2019t feel the same way.  \n\nI don\u2019t hold it against her or think negatively of her, but it\u2019s kind of like a Pandora\u2019s box type situation.  There\u2019s no going back to the way things were before.  She wants to continue to be friends and keeps trying to text and approach me about it.  I just don\u2019t see how we can be friends, my feelings for her haven\u2019t changed and remaining in the friendship would just be painful.  \n\nLately I\u2019ve been ignoring her texts and avoiding her. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the given situation is in the wrong. The scenario is about someone who developed feelings for a friend, confessed, got turned down, and then started ghosting the friend. The writer is ignoring texts and avoiding them, saying that the friendship can't go back to how it was and that staying friends would be painful.\n\nFirst, I need to determine if their actions are justified. The writer's friend was nice but didn't reciprocate the feelings. The friend wants to continue the relationship, but the writer can't handle it anymore. Ghosting is when you suddenly stop all communication without explanation. \n\nNow, the question is whether the writer is at fault. On one hand, the friend is trying to maintain the friendship, which is considerate. The writer, however, is avoiding them. But maybe the writer is overwhelmed with emotions and isn't ready to deal with the situation. They might need time to process their feelings before they can be around the friend again. \n\nBut is it okay to ghost? Usually, ghosting is seen as inconsiderate because the other person is left confused. In this case, the friend is reaching out, and the writer isn't responding. The writer could have been honest about needing space instead of cutting off communication. That would be more respectful. \n\nThe writer's reasoning is that they can't go back to the previous state and that being friends would be painful. It's understandable to feel that way when you have unrequited feelings. However, avoiding the friend without any explanation might hurt the friend more. The friend might not realize the extent of the writer's feelings or the emotional impact of the rejection. \n\nSo, while the writer's feelings are valid, the way they're handling the situation by ghosting is not the best approach. They might be in the wrong because they didn't communicate their need for space properly. Instead of ignoring, they should have explained their situation. \n\nBut then again, sometimes people aren't ready to talk about it and need time. The key is whether the writer's actions are inconsiderate. Ghosting can be inconsiderate regardless of the reason. However, in this case, the friend is the one who rejected the romantic interest. The writer might be struggling to move on, and maybe the friend is overstepping by continuing to reach out. \n\nWait, the friend is trying to maintain the friendship after the rejection. The writer might find that difficult because every interaction is a reminder of the unrequited feelings. If the writer isn't able to manage those emotions and decide to be friends, then maybe it's better to step back. But even then, a ghosting approach isn't helpful. \n\nSo, the answer hinges on whether the writer's actions are justified. If the writer's feelings are genuine and they can't handle the friendship anymore, they should communicate that instead of ghosting. Ghosting isn't the writer's fault necessarily, but it's a poor choice in handling the situation. Therefore, the writer might not be in the wrong for needing to distance themselves, but the method of doing so (ghosting) is questionable. \n\nBut the question is specifically whether the author is in the wrong. The act of ghosting is typically frowned upon, but the context is important. If there's no way to maintain the friendship without pain, maybe it's understandable. However, a proper explanation would still be better. \n\nIn conclusion, the writer's feelings are valid, but their approach to handling the situation is inconsiderate. So, they are in the wrong (A) because they should have communicated their need for space rather than ghosting.\n"
