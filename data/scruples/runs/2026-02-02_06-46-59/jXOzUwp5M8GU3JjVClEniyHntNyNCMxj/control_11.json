      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the person wrote about confessing feelings to a friend who they've known since last spring. They got along well, shared interests, but when they asked her out, she turned them down. Now, she wants to stay friends and is trying to text and approach them, but the author is ignoring her and avoiding her. The question is whether the author is in the wrong.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author had a friendship and then developed romantic feelings. They confessed, which is a big step. The friend didn't reciprocate but was nice about it. The author is struggling to maintain the friendship because their feelings haven't changed and it's painful for them. They're choosing to ghost her instead of dealing with the friendship anymore.\n\nNow, the possible answers are A (yes, in the wrong) or B (no). To decide, I should think about the dynamics here. Ghosting is generally considered rude because it cuts off communication without explanation. The friend is trying to maintain the relationship as friends, but the author is unresponsive. \n\nHowever, the author might be dealing with emotional pain. If they can't handle being around her as a friend anymore, maybe they have a valid reason. But is it fair to just disappear without telling her? The friend deserves some respect and clarity. Ghosting can leave the other person confused and hurt, even if they said no to a date. \n\nOn the other hand, if the author is genuinely unable to be friends and doesn't want to continue the relationship, they should communicate that clearly. Avoiding the situation by ghosting isn't helping either person move on. The author might not be wrong for feeling this way, but the action of ghosting is. They should have had a conversation to explain their feelings and boundaries, rather than cutting off contact entirely without explanation.\n\nSo, the author's actions (ghosting) are inconsiderate, but their feelings are understandable. The key issue is the lack of communication. Therefore, the author is in the wrong because they're not being honest and respectful to their friend, even if they can't continue the friendship. The answer should be A.\n"
