There\u2019s no going back to the way things were before.  She wants to continue to be friends and keeps trying to text and approach me about it.  I just don\u2019t see how we can be friends, my feelings for her haven\u2019t changed and remaining in the friendship would just be painful.  \n\nLately I\u2019ve been ignoring her texts and avoiding her. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong for ghosting their friend after being rejected. \n\nFirst, I need to break down the situation. The author had a friend since spring, they were close with shared interests. The author developed feelings but didn't act on them until they confessed. The friend was kind but didn't reciprocate. Now, the author is avoiding her texts and trying to distance themselves because they can't go back to being just friends.\n\nSo, the key points here are: the author confessed their feelings, got rejected, and is now cutting off contact. The friend wants to remain friends, but the author can't handle the emotional pain of being in the friendship anymore. \n\nI need to consider if ghosting is justified. Ghosting usually means cutting off communication without explanation, which can be hurtful. However, in this case, the author is struggling with unrequited feelings and feels that maintaining the friendship is painful. They might be doing this to protect their own emotional well-being. \n\nBut is it fair to the friend? The friend was clear about not wanting to end the friendship. The author's actions might leave the friend confused or hurt because there's no closure. However, the author might not be able to handle the friendship anymore because of lingering feelings. \n\nIs the author in the wrong? If the author is being honest about their inability to continue the friendship, even if they're being abrupt, it's more about their own emotional limits. Alternatively, maybe they should have communicated their feelings more clearly instead of ghosting. \n\nIn AITA scenarios, the community often values communication and consideration. Ghosting can be seen as inconsiderate, even if the person has valid reasons. The author could have explained that they need space, which might have been less hurtful than just disappearing. \n\nSo, the answer might hinge on whether the author's actions, while understandable, are considered inconsiderate. If they didn't give a reason, they might be at fault. But if they did communicate their stance, maybe it's not their fault. The post says they're ignoring texts and avoiding her, which sounds like ghosting without explanation. That would be AITA because they're not giving the friend a chance to understand. \n\nTherefore, the answer is A (the author is in the wrong) because ghosting without communication is typically seen as rude, even if the reasons are emotionally difficult.\n"
