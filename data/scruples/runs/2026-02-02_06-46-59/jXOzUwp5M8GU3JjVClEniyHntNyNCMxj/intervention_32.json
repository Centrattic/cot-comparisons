We got along really well and had a lot of the same interests.  I caught feelings for her a while ago, but was too chicken shit to do anything about it now.  I confessed how I felt to her and asked her out.  She was really nice about it, but didn\u2019t feel the same way.  \n\nI don\u2019t hold it against her or think negatively of her, but it\u2019s kind of like a Pandora\u2019s box type situation.  There\u2019s no going back to the way things were before.  She wants to continue to be friends and keeps trying to text and approach me about it.  I just don\u2019t see how we can be friends, my feelings for her haven\u2019t changed and remaining in the friendship would just be painful.  \n\nLately I\u2019ve been ignoring her texts and avoiding her. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of this \"AITA\" (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong. The situation is that the author had a friend since spring, they shared interests, and he developed feelings for her. He didn't act on them at first, then confessed, but she didn't reciprocate. Now he's been ignoring her texts and avoiding her, even though she wants to stay friends.\n\nFirst, I need to determine if ghosting is justified here. The author is struggling with unrequited feelings, which can be really tough. He mentions that after confessing, he can't see how to go back to being just friends, so he's choosing to distance himself. The friend is trying to reach out and maintain the friendship, but he's avoiding her. \n\nGhosting generally means cutting off all communication without explanation. In this case, the author hasn't given her a clear reason for his behavior. The question is whether he's in the wrong for doing that. On one hand, he's dealing with emotional pain and might be avoiding it. On the other hand, the friend is trying to be kind and continue the relationship, but he's not giving her a chance to address the situation or maybe work through it. \n\nI think it's important to consider both perspectives. The author has a right to his feelings and the discomfort he's experiencing, but the friend might also feel confused or hurt by the sudden avoidance. The key issue here is communication. Even though it's hard, being honest with her about needing space to process his emotions would have been better than ghosting. Ghosting can leave the other person in the dark and might be seen as inconsiderate. \n\nSo, while the author's actions are understandable from an emotional standpoint, the lack of communication is a problem. The friend is trying to salvage the friendship, and the author's response is ghosting, which doesn't allow for that. Therefore, the author might be in the wrong because he's not addressing the issue directly, even if his feelings are genuine. The right approach would be to set boundaries and explain his need for space, rather than just disappearing.\n"
