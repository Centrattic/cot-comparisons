I confessed how I felt to her and asked her out.

There\u2019s no going back to the way things were before.  She wants to continue to be friends and keeps trying to text and approach me about it.  I just don\u2019t see how we can be friends, my feelings for her haven\u2019t changed and remaining in the friendship would just be painful.  \n\nLately I\u2019ve been ignoring her texts and avoiding her. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let me try to work through this. So the question is whether the person who wrote this is in the wrong for ghosting their friend after she turned them down. \n\nFirst, the situation: They've been friends since spring, got along well, shared interests. The author developed feelings, confessed, was rejected. Now the friend wants to stay in touch, but the author is avoiding her.\n\nHmm. The user is asking if they're in the wrong. Let me think about the key points here. Ghosting usually refers to cutting off communication abruptly without explanation. The author says they\u2019re ignoring texts and avoiding her. The friend still wants to be friends, but the author can't see how it would work because their feelings haven't changed and it's painful.\n\nI need to consider if the author is being reasonable. When someone is rejected, it's common to feel hurt and need space. The author might not be able to handle the friendship anymore because it's too difficult. On the other hand, ghosting without explanation can be confusing and hurtful for the other person. The friend might feel ignored or that she did something wrong, even though she said she wants to stay friends.\n\nBut the author is being honest about their feelings. They don't hold it against her, but can't continue the friendship. Is it wrong to avoid the friendship? Maybe not, but is ghosting the right approach? Probably not. The better approach would be to explain that they need space and can't continue the friendship, rather than just cutting off. \n\nSo the author's action (ghosting) is inconsiderate because they're not communicating their reasons. However, their feelings and need for space are valid. The question is whether they're in the wrong. If \"wrong\" means they should be blamed for not handling it better, then maybe A. But if the situation is just difficult and they're not doing anything malicious, maybe B. \n\nIn AITA (Am I the Asshole) contexts, the community often looks at intent and consideration. Ghosting is often seen as inconsiderate. However, the author is struggling with their emotions, so maybe it's not malicious. But the act of ghosting is still considered rude. So the answer might be A. However, some might argue it's understandable given the circumstances. \n\nBut generally, in AITA, ghosting is often considered a bit of an asshole move because it leaves the other person in the dark. Even if the author is hurt, explaining their need for space would be better. So the answer is likely A. The author is in the wrong for ghosting without explanation, even if their feelings are valid.\n"
