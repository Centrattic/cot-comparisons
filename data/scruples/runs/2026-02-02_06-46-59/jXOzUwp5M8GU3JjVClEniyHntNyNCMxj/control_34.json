We got along really well and had a lot of the same interests.  I caught feelings for her a while ago, but was too chicken shit to do anything about it now.  I confessed how I felt to her and asked her out.

There\u2019s no going back to the way things were before.  She wants to continue to be friends and keeps trying to text and approach me about it.  I just don\u2019t see how we can be friends, my feelings for her haven\u2019t changed and remaining in the friendship would just be painful.  \n\nLately I\u2019ve been ignoring her texts and avoiding her. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote this is in the wrong after ghosting their friend following a rejection.\n\nFirst, the situation: They had a close friendship since spring. The friend was nice when they confessed, but turned them down. The writer says they still have feelings, so being friends is painful. They're ignoring texts and avoiding the friend. The friend wants to stay in contact, but the writer can't see how that would work.\n\nSo, the main question is about whether ghosting is the wrong move here. Ghosting usually means cutting off contact abruptly without explanation. The writer is doing that because they find it too painful to continue the friendship after the friend declined their romantic advances. \n\nOn one hand, the friend is trying to maintain the friendship, which is a valid approach. The writer might be struggling with their emotions and not being ready to handle the friendship anymore. But ignoring someone and avoiding them can be hurtful, especially if the friend is making efforts to reconnect. The writer hasn't given them a clear reason for the distance, which might leave the friend confused or feeling like they did something wrong beyond the rejection. \n\nHowever, if the writer is truly unable to manage their feelings and being in the friendship is causing them distress, it's understandable that they might need space. But the right approach would be to communicate that. Instead of ghosting, explaining their feelings and the need for time could be more respectful. Ghosting, even for emotional reasons, can sometimes be seen as inconsiderate because it doesn't allow the other person to respond or adjust. \n\nSo, the writer's actions are hurtful but perhaps stem from their emotional struggle. They might not be in the wrong entirely, but they could be doing it wrong by not communicating. The answer could be B (not in the wrong) because their feelings are valid, but there's a better way to handle it. However, since they are ignoring and avoiding, which is a form of ghosting without explanation, some might argue they are inconsiderate. But the key point is that they're not holding a grudge, just finding it too painful. So maybe B is the choice here.\n"
