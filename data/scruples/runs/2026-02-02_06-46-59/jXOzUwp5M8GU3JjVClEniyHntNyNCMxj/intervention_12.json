We got along really well and had a lot of the same interests.  I caught feelings for her a while ago, but was too chicken shit to do anything about it now.  I confessed how I felt to her and asked her out.  She was really nice about it, but didn\u2019t feel the same way.  \n\nI don\u2019t hold it against her or think negatively of her, but it\u2019s kind of like a Pandora\u2019s box type situation.  There\u2019s no going back to the way things were before.  She wants to continue to be friends and keeps trying to text and approach me about it.  I just don\u2019t see how we can be friends, my feelings for her haven\u2019t changed and remaining in the friendship would just be painful.  \n\nLately I\u2019ve been ignoring her texts and avoiding her. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong after ghosting their friend. The situation is that the author had a friend since spring, developed feelings, confessed, but the friend didn't reciprocate. Now the author is avoiding her, even though the friend wants to stay in touch. The user thinks the author is in the wrong, but wants my opinion.\n\nSo, the key points here. The author had a friendship, developed romantic feelings, confessed, got rejected. Then started ghosting the friend who is trying to maintain the friendship. The author's reasoning is that being friends would be too painful because their feelings haven't changed.\n\nI need to determine if the author is in the wrong. Let's break down the ethical aspects. Ghosting is generally seen as a poor way to handle rejection because it can leave the other person confused and hurt. The friend wants to continue the relationship, but the author is avoiding them. The author's actions might be considered inconsiderate because they're not giving the friend a clear explanation. However, the author's feelings are genuine and it's clear they're struggling with the emotional aftermath.\n\nBut even if the author is hurting, is it their responsibility to communicate that instead of cutting off contact? Yes, ideally. Ghosting is a form of emotional avoidance. The friend is making an effort to stay in touch, so the author should at least be honest about their need for space, even if they can't be friends anymore. By not communicating and just ignoring messages, the author is being inconsiderate. So, the author is in the wrong because they're not taking responsibility for their actions and aren't giving the friend closure. Therefore, the answer would be A.\n"
