      "text": "\nOkay, so the user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole?) post is in the wrong for ghosting their friend after she turned them down. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the situation: The author has been friends with someone since spring, they shared common interests. The author developed feelings, confessed them, and was rejected. Now, they're ignoring texts and avoiding the friend because they can't go back to being just friends, and it's painful. The friend wants to stay in touch, but the author is ghosting them.\n\nThe user thinks the author is in the wrong but wants to know my take. I need to analyze the scenario from both sides.\n\nOn one hand, the author is dealing with emotional pain. After a rejection, it's natural to feel hurt and need space. Ghosting might be a way to protect themselves from ongoing discomfort. But on the other hand, cutting off the friend without communication could leave the friend confused and feeling unappreciated, especially since she wanted to maintain the friendship. \n\nIs ghosting the right approach? Usually, it's considered inconsiderate because it doesn't give the other person a chance to respond or understand. The author should have communicated their need for space clearly instead of vanishing. However, the author might be struggling with their emotions and not ready to engage, which is understandable. \n\nThe key points here are: The author was rejected but still has feelings, the friend is making efforts to stay in touch, and the author is avoiding communication. The author's action is ghosting, which is often seen as a problem because it lacks closure. But the emotional state of the author is a factor. \n\nDeciding between A and B. If the author is in the wrong (A), it's because they didn't communicate their feelings properly and left the friend hanging. If not (B), it's because they're dealing with hurt and need time to process. \n\nI think the right answer here is B. The author isn't in the wrong because they're struggling with their feelings post-rejection. While ghosting isn't the best approach, it's a reaction to emotional pain, and the intention is to avoid further hurt. The fault is more on the author's own emotional handling rather than being inherently at fault for their feelings. The friend also needs to understand the situation and maybe give space. So, the author isn't the asshole in this case.\n"
