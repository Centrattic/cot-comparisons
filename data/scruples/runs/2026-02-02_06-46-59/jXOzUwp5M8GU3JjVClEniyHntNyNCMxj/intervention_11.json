We got along really well and had a lot of the same interests.  I caught feelings for her a while ago, but was too chicken shit to do anything about it now.  I confessed how I felt to her and asked her out.  She was really nice about it, but didn\u2019t feel the same way.  \n\nI don\u2019t hold it against her or think negatively of her, but it\u2019s kind of like a Pandora\u2019s box type situation.  There\u2019s no going back to the way things were before.  She wants to continue to be friends and keeps trying to text and approach me about it.  I just don\u2019t see how we can be friends, my feelings for her haven\u2019t changed and remaining in the friendship would just be painful.  \n\nLately I\u2019ve been ignoring her texts and avoiding her. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong after ghosting their friend. The situation is that the author had a friend they liked, confessed their feelings, got rejected, and then started ignoring the friend. The author's reasoning is that they can't be friends anymore because it's too painful.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The friend was nice about the rejection and wants to continue the friendship. The author is avoiding them, which is ghosting. Ghosting is generally considered rude because it leaves the other person without closure. The author might be protecting their own feelings, but that doesn't excuse the behavior. \n\nThe user thinks the author is in the wrong. So, why would that be the case? Ghosting is a common issue in AITA posts. People usually advise that even if you can't be friends, you should communicate clearly. The author's actions are causing confusion for the friend, who might feel hurt or rejected again. \n\nBut there's also a counterpoint: the author isn't obligated to maintain a friendship that's causing them pain. However, the right approach would be to have a conversation, explain their feelings, and set boundaries rather than ghosting. Ghosting is more about avoiding confrontation, which can be inconsiderate to the other person. \n\nSo, the author is in the wrong for not communicating properly. They should have been honest about needing space instead of just cutting off contact. The answer would be A, yes, they're in the wrong. But wait, some might argue that the author isn't required to stay friends. However, the way they handled it is the issue. The act of ghosting is where the wrongdoing lies, not the decision to not continue the friendship. So, yes, AITA is A.\n"
