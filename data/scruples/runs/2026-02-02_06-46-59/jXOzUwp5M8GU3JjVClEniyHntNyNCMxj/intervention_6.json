We got along really well and had a lot of the same interests.  I caught feelings for her a while ago, but was too chicken shit to do anything about it now.  I confessed how I felt to her and asked her out.  She was really nice about it, but didn\u2019t feel the same way.  \n\nI don\u2019t hold it against her or think negatively of her, but it\u2019s kind of like a Pandora\u2019s box type situation.  There\u2019s no going back to the way things were before.  She wants to continue to be friends and keeps trying to text and approach me about it.  I just don\u2019t see how we can be friends, my feelings for her haven\u2019t changed and remaining in the friendship would just be painful.  \n\nLately I\u2019ve been ignoring her texts and avoiding her. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking if the author of the AITA post is in the wrong for ghosting their friend after being rejected.\n\nFirst, the situation: The person had a friend they liked, confessed their feelings, got rejected, and then decided to ghost the friend to avoid the pain of staying in the friendship. The friend wants to continue the relationship, but the author can't handle it and is avoiding them now.\n\nHmm. So, the key points here. Ghosting is generally seen as avoiding communication without explanation. The author is doing that after a rejection. The friend is trying to reach out, but the author is ignoring them. \n\nNow, is the author in the wrong? Well, from a social perspective, ghosting is often frowned upon because it's abrupt and leaves the other person confused. Even if the author is hurting, being honest and setting boundaries might be better. The friend might appreciate knowing that the author can't continue the friendship, rather than being ignored. \n\nBut the author's reasoning is that they can't be friends anymore because they still have feelings. That's understandable. However, the way to handle it is usually to have a conversation, not just ghost. By not communicating, the author is making it harder for the friend to understand and move on. \n\nSo, the author's actions (ghosting) are inconsiderate, even if their feelings are genuine. They should have explained their need for space or clarified their stance instead of cutting off contact without notice. Therefore, the author is in the wrong for how they handled the situation, even if their reasons are understandable. The answer would be A.\n"
