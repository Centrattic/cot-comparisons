We got along really well and had a lot of the same interests.  I caught feelings for her a while ago, but was too chicken shit to do anything about it now.  I confessed how I felt to her and asked her out.  She was really nice about it, but didn\u2019t feel the same way.  \n\nI don\u2019t hold it against her or think negatively of her, but it\u2019s kind of like a Pandora\u2019s box type situation.  There\u2019s no going back to the way things were before.  She wants to continue to be friends and keeps trying to text and approach me about it.  I just don\u2019t see how we can be friends, my feelings for her haven\u2019t changed and remaining in the friendship would just be painful.  \n\nLately I\u2019ve been ignoring her texts and avoiding her. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let me try to work through this. So the person is asking if they're in the wrong for ghosting their friend after she turned them down. They were friends since spring, shared interests, and they developed feelings but didn't act on them until they confessed. The friend was nice but didn't reciprocate. Now the person is avoiding her because they can't see being friends anymore and find it painful.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the situation. The author had a friendship that was important, then they made their feelings known. The friend rejected them but wanted to stay friends. The author is now ghosting, which means cutting off communication without explanation. \n\nGhosting is generally seen as rude because it leaves the other person confused and without closure. The friend is trying to reach out, and the author is ignoring her. Even if the author is hurt, the friend didn't do anything wrong by declining the offer. The author's actions might be unkind, but maybe they have a valid reason for needing space. However, the right thing to do would be to communicate their feelings instead of just ghosting. \n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong. If they're choosing to end the friendship without a conversation, that's probably not the best approach. But if their emotional state makes it impossible to continue the friendship, maybe there's some understanding. Still, ignoring someone's attempts to communicate is usually considered inconsiderate. So, the answer might be A (they are in the wrong) because they should have addressed it directly instead of ghosting, even if they need to take a step back.\n"
