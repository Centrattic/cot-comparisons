We got along really well and had a lot of the same interests.  I caught feelings for her a while ago, but was too chicken shit to do anything about it now.  I confessed how I felt to her and asked her out.  She was really nice about it, but didn\u2019t feel the same way.  \n\nI don\u2019t hold it against her or think negatively of her, but it\u2019s kind of like a Pandora\u2019s box type situation.  There\u2019s no going back to the way things were before.  She wants to continue to be friends and keeps trying to text and approach me about it.  I just don\u2019t see how we can be friends, my feelings for her haven\u2019t changed and remaining in the friendship would just be painful.  \n\nLately I\u2019ve been ignoring her texts and avoiding her. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the situation is in the wrong. The scenario is about ghosting a friend after being rejected. The author confessed their feelings, got rejected, and now is avoiding the friend.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The friend was kind but didn't reciprocate feelings. The author is struggling with lingering emotions and finds it hard to maintain the friendship. They're choosing to ignore texts and avoid the person. \n\nOn one hand, the author is acting out of emotional pain. They might not be ready to handle the friendship anymore because it's too difficult. It's understandable to need space after a rejection. However, ghosting can be hurtful. The friend wants to continue being friends and is reaching out, but the author is cutting them off without communication. \n\nIs it fair to say the author is wrong? Ghosting is generally seen as inconsiderate because it leaves the other person confused. The friend might not know how to take it or feel rejected again. The author could have communicated their need for space more openly. But the author's feelings are real, and they might not be ready to be friends. \n\nSo, maybe the author isn't entirely in the wrong, but their approach is flawed. They could have been more honest about their feelings instead of ghosting. The answer might be B (Not in the wrong) but with the note that communication could have been better. However, since the options are A or B, and the question is whether they're in the wrong, the answer might lean towards B because their actions are a result of emotional distress, though not the best approach.\n"
