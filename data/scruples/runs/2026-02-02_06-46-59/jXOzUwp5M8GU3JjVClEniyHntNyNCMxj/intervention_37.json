We got along really well and had a lot of the same interests.  I caught feelings for her a while ago, but was too chicken shit to do anything about it now.  I confessed how I felt to her and asked her out.  She was really nice about it, but didn\u2019t feel the same way.  \n\nI don\u2019t hold it against her or think negatively of her, but it\u2019s kind of like a Pandora\u2019s box type situation.  There\u2019s no going back to the way things were before.  She wants to continue to be friends and keeps trying to text and approach me about it.  I just don\u2019t see how we can be friends, my feelings for her haven\u2019t changed and remaining in the friendship would just be painful.  \n\nLately I\u2019ve been ignoring her texts and avoiding her. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for ghosting their friend after being turned down.\n\nFirst, the situation: The author had a friend they really liked and eventually confessed their feelings. The friend was nice but didn't reciprocate. Now, the friend wants to continue being friends, but the author is avoiding them because it's painful.\n\nI need to consider different perspectives. On one hand, the author is hurting by unrequited feelings, and maybe they can't handle the friendship anymore. Ghosting might be a way to protect themselves. But on the other hand, ghosting is usually considered rude, especially if the friend is trying to maintain a relationship. The author could have been honest about their feelings, explaining that they can't be friends anymore because it's too painful, instead of just cutting off.\n\nThe question is whether the author is wrong. If the author's actions are causing harm without a clear explanation, that could be seen as wrong. But if the pain is genuine and they can't reconcile, maybe it's understandable. However, communication is key. Ghosting without explaining might leave the friend confused and hurt. So maybe the author should have communicated their need for space instead of ghosting. In that case, the author is in the wrong for not being upfront, even if their feelings are valid.\n"
