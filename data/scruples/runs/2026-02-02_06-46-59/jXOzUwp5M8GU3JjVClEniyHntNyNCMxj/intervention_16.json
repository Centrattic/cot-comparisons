We got along really well and had a lot of the same interests.  I caught feelings for her a while ago, but was too chicken shit to do anything about it now.  I confessed how I felt to her and asked her out.  She was really nice about it, but didn\u2019t feel the same way.  \n\nI don\u2019t hold it against her or think negatively of her, but it\u2019s kind of like a Pandora\u2019s box type situation.  There\u2019s no going back to the way things were before.  She wants to continue to be friends and keeps trying to text and approach me about it.  I just don\u2019t see how we can be friends, my feelings for her haven\u2019t changed and remaining in the friendship would just be painful.  \n\nLately I\u2019ve been ignoring her texts and avoiding her. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, so the user is asking if the person who wrote the \"AITA\" (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong. Let me try to break this down.\n\nThe situation is that the author had a friend since spring, and they got along well. The author developed feelings for this friend but was too nervous to act. Eventually, they confessed their feelings and asked the friend out. The friend was nice but didn't reciprocate the feelings. Now, the author is ignoring the friend's texts and avoiding them, leading to the friend wanting to continue the friendship. The author is ghosting the friend because they can't see how they can remain friends, as their feelings haven't changed and staying friends is painful.\n\nThe user thinks the author is in the wrong but wants my opinion. I need to decide if the answer is A (author is in the wrong) or B (not in the wrong).\n\nFirst, I should consider the dynamics here. The author was honest about their feelings, which is important. The friend turned them down but wanted to maintain the friendship. The author, however, is unable to continue the friendship and is ghosting instead. \n\nGhosting is generally considered rude because it leaves the other person hanging without closure. The friend is trying to reach out and wants to keep the relationship, but the author is avoiding communication. That lack of communication could be hurtful, even if the author is emotionally struggling.\n\nOn the other hand, the author is dealing with unrequited feelings, which is tough. They might not be able to handle the friendship anymore, which is understandable. But instead of ghosting, a more mature approach would be to have an open conversation, explaining that they need space and can't continue the friendship. That way, the friend isn't left confused and the author can take responsibility for their feelings without being abrupt.\n\nSo, the author's mistake is not communicating their need for space clearly and instead choosing to ghost. While their feelings are valid, the way they're handling the situation is inconsiderate. The friend deserves to know why the author is pulling away rather than being left in the dark. Therefore, the author is in the wrong because they're not being honest and are causing unnecessary confusion and hurt through ghosting instead of a clear conversation."
