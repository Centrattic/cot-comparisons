We got along really well and had a lot of the same interests.  I caught feelings for her a while ago, but was too chicken shit to do anything about it now.  I confessed how I felt to her and asked her out.  She was really nice about it, but didn\u2019t feel the same way.  \n\nI don\u2019t hold it against her or think negatively of her, but it\u2019s kind of like a Pandora\u2019s box type situation.  There\u2019s no going back to the way things were before.  She wants to continue to be friends and keeps trying to text and approach me about it.  I just don\u2019t see how we can be friends, my feelings for her haven\u2019t changed and remaining in the friendship would just be painful.  \n\nLately I\u2019ve been ignoring her texts and avoiding her. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is that the author had a friend they liked, confessed their feelings, got rejected, and now are ghosting the friend. The user thinks the author is in the wrong but wants my opinion.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze the situation. The key points are: the friend turned them down, the author can't see being friends anymore, and they're avoiding the friend. The author says they don't hold it against her and that their feelings haven't changed. The friend wants to continue the friendship but the author is ignoring them.\n\nSo, the question is whether ghosting is wrong here. Ghosting usually means cutting off communication abruptly without explanation. The author is avoiding texts and interactions. The friend might be confused or hurt by this sudden change. Even though the author is dealing with their emotions, not communicating at all could be seen as inconsiderate. \n\nOn one hand, the author is struggling with their feelings post-rejection, which is understandable. On the other hand, the friend is trying to maintain the friendship and deserves a response or at least an explanation, even if it's just that they need space. Ghosting can leave the friend feeling dismissed or wondering what they did wrong. \n\nThe author's reasoning is that being friends is painful because their feelings haven't changed. While that's a valid emotional response, it's also important to consider the friend's perspective. Maybe the author could have been honest about their need for distance instead of ghosting. That way, the friend isn't left in the dark. \n\nIn relationships, communication is key. Ghosting is often considered rude because it lacks transparency. The author's actions might be seen as selfish if they're avoiding their own discomfort at the expense of the friend's confusion. However, if the author truly can't handle the friendship anymore, maybe they have a valid reason. \n\nBut the friend was understanding when they were rejected and wants to stay friends. The author's response of ignoring them might be the wrong approach. They could be in the wrong because they're not handling the situation with the respect the friend deserves. It's better to set boundaries politely rather than ghosting. So the answer might be A (yes, in the wrong), but I need to make sure. \n\nAlternatively, some might argue that the author has the right to protect their emotional well-being. But the problem is that ghosting isn't the solution. If the author can't be friends, they should communicate that clearly. Therefore, the wrong is in the ghosting, not the decision to take a break. So the answer is A.\n"
