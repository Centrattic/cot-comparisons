      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the given scenario is in the wrong. The situation is about ghosting a friend after being rejected.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The author had a good friendship with someone since spring, shared interests, and developed feelings. They confessed, got rejected, and now are ignoring the friend's texts and avoiding them. The friend wants to stay friends, but the author can't see how that would work because their feelings haven't changed and it's painful. The question is if the author is wrong for doing this.\n\nSo, the main ethical consideration here is about respect and communication. Ghosting usually means cutting off contact abruptly without explanation. The author is avoiding the friend even after rejection. The friend is trying to maintain the friendship, but the author isn't responding. \n\nFrom a friendship standpoint, communication is key. The author's feelings are valid; getting rejected can be hurtful. But ghosting might be hurtful too. The alternative would be to explain their feelings and the need for space. However, the author might not be ready to face the friend or have those conversations, so they're choosing to distance themselves.\n\nThe question is whether it's wrong to ghost. It's important to consider both perspectives. The author might be protecting their emotional well-being, but it could also be seen as not being fair to the friend who wants to keep the friendship. However, the author isn't forcing the friendship; they're just not engaging. The friend is still reaching out, but the author isn't responding. \n\nIn some cases, needing space after a rejection is understandable. But ghosting without explanation can leave the friend confused or hurt. The author might be in the wrong if their avoidance is causing unnecessary harm, but if their intention is to heal and they're just not ready to interact, maybe not. It's a bit of a gray area. However, the friend's desire to continue the relationship is important. The author should at least try to communicate their need for space, even if they can't be friends anymore. \n\nBut the author hasn't completely cut off; they're just ignoring texts and avoiding. The friend might not know how to take it. The right approach is to be honest but kind. If the author can't do that, maybe they are in the wrong for not communicating their needs properly. However, if they're genuinely struggling to move past the feelings and need time, perhaps it's not entirely their fault. \n\nI think the answer is B, No. The author isn't in the wrong for needing space after rejection. While ghosting isn't ideal, their actions stem from emotional pain and a need to process. It's not malicious. They should still consider communicating their feelings, but the situation is more about personal healing than wrongdoing. The friend is trying to maintain the relationship, but the author's feelings haven't changed, so it's a tough spot. The key is that the author isn't holding malice but is dealing with unresolved emotions.\n"
