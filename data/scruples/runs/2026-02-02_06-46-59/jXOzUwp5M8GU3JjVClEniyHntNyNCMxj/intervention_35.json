I just don\u2019t see how we can be friends, my feelings for her haven\u2019t changed and remaining in the friendship would just be painful.  \n\nLately I\u2019ve been ignoring her texts and avoiding her. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so the user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong for ghosting their friend after being rejected. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the situation: The person had a friendship with someone they liked. They confessed their feelings, were rejected, and now can't see being friends anymore. They're avoiding the friend, which is ghosting. The friend wants to continue the relationship, but the author can't handle it because their feelings haven't changed, and it's painful for them. The user thinks the author is wrong, but wants my opinion.\n\nHmm. So, is the author in the wrong? Let's consider both sides. On one hand, ghosting is generally seen as inconsiderate because it leaves the other person hanging without closure. The friend might feel confused or hurt by being ignored, even though they were the one who rejected the romantic interest. But on the other hand, the author is dealing with unrequited feelings and is trying to protect themselves from ongoing emotional pain. They might believe that cutting off contact is necessary for their own well-being, even if it's abrupt.\n\nThe key points here are the intention behind the ghosting and the impact on the other person. The author's friend was already rejected and wants to continue the friendship. By ghosting, the author isn't just ending the friendship but doing it without explanation, which could be seen as harsh. However, the author might argue that they can't maintain a friendship where they still have romantic feelings, and that staying in touch would be more painful in the long run for both parties.\n\nBut wait, wasn't the author the one who approached the friend first? The friend accepted the rejection and wants to remain friends. The author's decision to ghost might be seen as not respecting the friend's desire to maintain the relationship. Even if the author is hurt, communication could have been better. Instead of cutting off all contact, maybe they could have explained their need for space or that they're not ready to continue the friendship, which would have been more considerate.\n\nAlso, considering that the friendship was established before the romantic feelings, the author might have a responsibility to handle the situation maturely. Ghosting avoids dealing with the situation, which could lead to more hurt for the friend. The friend might be confused or feel rejected again, even though they were the one who turned down the romantic overture.\n\nBut another angle: If the author is truly unable to be friends and it's causing them pain, maybe it's better to end the friendship than to pretend. However, the right way to do that would be to communicate clearly rather than disappear. Ghosting isn't about the friendship itself but about avoiding the discomfort of the situation. So in that sense, the author is not wrong in deciding to end the friendship but is wrong in the method\u2014ghosting is not a respectful way to do it.\n\nBut the question is whether the author is in the wrong. If we assume that the friend wants to continue the friendship and the author's actions are causing unnecessary hurt, then yes, the author is in the wrong for not handling it with more communication and respect. However, if the author's decision is based on their own well-being and they can't maintain the friendship without pain, then maybe it's not entirely their fault. But the way they handled it (ghosting) is definitely inconsiderate.\n\nSo, considering all that, the answer is A (the author is in the wrong) because they chose to ghost instead of having a conversation. Even if the decision to end the friendship is understandable, the method is inconsiderate. The right approach would have been to explain that they need some distance or to clarify their feelings without cutting off contact abruptly.\n"
