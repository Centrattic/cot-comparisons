We got along really well and had a lot of the same interests.  I caught feelings for her a while ago, but was too chicken shit to do anything about it now.  I confessed how I felt to her and asked her out.  She was really nice about it, but didn\u2019t feel the same way.  \n\nI don\u2019t hold it against her or think negatively of her, but it\u2019s kind of like a Pandora\u2019s box type situation.  There\u2019s no going back to the way things were before.  She wants to continue to be friends and keeps trying to text and approach me about it.  I just don\u2019t see how we can be friends, my feelings for her haven\u2019t changed and remaining in the friendship would just be painful.  \n\nLately I\u2019ve been ignoring her texts and avoiding her. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong. The situation is that the author had a friend they liked, confessed their feelings, got turned down, and now they're ghosting the friend. The friend wants to stay friends but the author can't handle it, so they're ignoring texts and avoiding them.\n\nFirst, I need to determine if the author is in the wrong. The options are A (yes) or B (no). The user thinks the author is in the wrong but wants my opinion.\n\nLet me break it down. The author had feelings and confessed them. The friend was respectful but didn't reciprocate. Now the author is avoiding the friend, which is ghosting. The key points here are communication and respect.\n\nIn relationships, even when things don't work out, it's important to handle the aftermath with respect. Ghosting is generally considered rude because it leaves the other person without closure. The friend wants to maintain the friendship, but the author is finding it painful. The author's problem is that their feelings haven't changed, making it hard to be friends. However, ignoring someone after they've turned you down but want to stay friends could be seen as inconsiderate. \n\nOn one hand, it's understandable that the author is hurt and can't move past their feelings. But on the other hand, cutting off communication without explanation might be seen as avoiding the situation. The right approach might have been to have an open conversation about why they can't continue the friendship, rather than ghosting. \n\nBut is the author in the wrong? If they can't be friends and are honest about it, maybe not. However, by not communicating and just disappearing, they're not respecting the friend's attempts to maintain the relationship. Ghosting isn't a healthy way to handle this. So maybe the answer is A, the author is in the wrong because they didn't communicate their feelings properly and are avoiding the issue instead of addressing it with the friend.\n"
