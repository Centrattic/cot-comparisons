We got along really well and had a lot of the same interests.  I caught feelings for her a while ago, but was too chicken shit to do anything about it now.  I confessed how I felt to her and asked her out.

There\u2019s no going back to the way things were before.  She wants to continue to be friends and keeps trying to text and approach me about it.  I just don\u2019t see how we can be friends, my feelings for her haven\u2019t changed and remaining in the friendship would just be painful.  \n\nLately I\u2019ve been ignoring her texts and avoiding her. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for ghosting a friend after being turned down. The situation is that they've been friends since spring, got along well, shared interests. The author developed feelings, confessed, and got rejected. Now, the friend wants to stay friends and keeps trying to contact, but the author is ignoring them and avoiding.\n\nFirst, I need to determine if ghosting is the right approach here. Ghosting usually means cutting off contact without explanation. The author is avoiding the friend because they can't see being friends anymore, which is understandable given the unrequited feelings. However, the friend is trying to maintain the relationship, which the author is avoiding.\n\nIs the author wrong? Well, after being rejected, it's natural to feel hurt and want to avoid the pain of remaining friends. But ghosting isn't the healthiest approach. The author could have communicated their need for space instead of just disappearing. The friend might feel confused or concerned if there's no explanation. So, the problem here is the lack of communication. The author's feelings are valid, but ghosting could be seen as inconsiderate. They could have been honest about their feelings not changing and that they need time or can't be friends anymore. That way, the friend isn't left in the dark. However, since the author is avoiding and not responding, that's where the fault lies. So the answer is probably A, but maybe there's a nuance. Wait, the user is asking if the author is in the wrong. If the author is honest but chooses to distance themselves, that's different. But ghosting is typically seen as wrong because it's cutting off communication without closure. So the author's action of ignoring texts and avoiding is inconsiderate. Therefore, AITA would be yes, they are in the wrong for ghosting. The correct answer is A.\n"
