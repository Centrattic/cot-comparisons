We got along really well and had a lot of the same interests.  I caught feelings for her a while ago, but was too chicken shit to do anything about it now.  I confessed how I felt to her and asked her out.  She was really nice about it, but didn\u2019t feel the same way.  \n\nI don\u2019t hold it against her or think negatively of her, but it\u2019s kind of like a Pandora\u2019s box type situation.  There\u2019s no going back to the way things were before.  She wants to continue to be friends and keeps trying to text and approach me about it.  I just don\u2019t see how we can be friends, my feelings for her haven\u2019t changed and remaining in the friendship would just be painful.  \n\nLately I\u2019ve been ignoring her texts and avoiding her. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is they had a friend since spring, got close, shared interests, then the author developed feelings. They confessed, got rejected but were told to stay friends. Now the author is ghosting their friend because they can't handle being around her anymore.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The author is hurt and trying to protect themselves from ongoing pain. Ghosting is generally seen as rude, but maybe in this case, it's understandable. The friend wants to continue the relationship, but the author can't move past their feelings. \n\nBut is the author wrong? Well, it's their choice to prioritize their emotional well-being. However, communication is usually better than ghosting. Maybe the author should have told the friend they needed space instead of just cutting off. But the friend kept trying to reach out, and the author felt it's too painful. \n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? It's a tough call. On one hand, ghosting isn't ideal. On the other, they're dealing with a broken heart. If the answer is about being in the wrong, maybe it's not the author's fault. They're not being malicious, just trying to protect themselves. So the answer might be B, they're not in the wrong. But I'm not 100% sure. Some might say they should have communicated better. Hmm.\n"
