      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA question is in the wrong for ghosting a friend after being rejected. The story says the person had a friend since spring, they were close, and the author developed feelings. They confessed, got rejected, and now they're avoiding the friend.\n\nFirst, I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong. The main points are: the author liked the friend, asked them out, got turned down, and then ghosted them. The friend wants to stay in touch, but the author can't handle the pain of friendship anymore and is avoiding communication.\n\nSo, from an emotional perspective, when someone confesses feelings and gets rejected, it's natural to feel hurt. The friend was kind but didn't reciprocate. The author is struggling to maintain the friendship because their feelings haven't changed. Ghosting is a way to distance themselves from the pain.\n\nBut is it wrong to ghost? Well, in social norms, being abrupt and cutting off communication without explanation can be seen as rude. The friend is reaching out and trying to maintain the relationship, which the author is ignoring. The author might not be in the wrong because they're dealing with their emotions, but they could be doing it in a hurtful way. However, some might argue that even if it's painful, being a ghost without explanation is inconsiderate. The author could have set boundaries or communicated that they can't continue the friendship but still be respectful. \n\nOn the other hand, the author isn't pretending to be inconsiderate. They're being honest with themselves and their feelings. They don't blame the friend, just feel the friendship can't continue. So maybe they're not wrong because they're acting based on their emotional needs, even if the method is harsh. It's a tough situation where both parties might have valid feelings. The key is whether the author had a right to make that choice, even if it's abrupt. \n\nI think the answer leans towards B (not in the wrong) because the author is making a choice based on their emotional well-being. However, some might say they should have handled it better. But in AITA terms, the author is not necessarily in the wrong for prioritizing their own feelings and ending the friendship to avoid ongoing pain. They didn't act out of malice but out of personal need.\n"
