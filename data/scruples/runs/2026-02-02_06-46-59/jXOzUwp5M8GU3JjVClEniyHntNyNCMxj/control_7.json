We got along really well and had a lot of the same interests.  I caught feelings for her a while ago, but was too chicken shit to do anything about it now.  I confessed how I felt to her and asked her out.  She was really nice about it, but didn\u2019t feel the same way.  \n\nI don\u2019t hold it against her or think negatively of her, but it\u2019s kind of like a Pandora\u2019s box type situation.  There\u2019s no going back to the way things were before.  She wants to continue to be friends and keeps trying to text and approach me about it.  I just don\u2019t see how we can be friends, my feelings for her haven\u2019t changed and remaining in the friendship would just be painful.  \n\nLately I\u2019ve been ignoring her texts and avoiding her. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of the \"AITA\" (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong for ghosting their friend after being rejected. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The author had a friend they've known since spring, got close, shared interests, then developed feelings. They confessed, but the friend didn't reciprocate. The author now feels that being friends is painful, so they've been ignoring texts and avoiding her, leading to the ghosting.\n\nThe user wants to know if the author is at fault. The options are A (yes) or B (no). \n\nSo, considering the details: the author was rejected, which is tough. They tried to move on but found it hard. Ghosting is generally seen as inconsiderate because it leaves the other person confused and hurt. The friend wants to maintain the friendship, but the author can't handle it. \n\nIs the author wrong for ghosting? Well, ghosting can be seen as a way to avoid confrontation, but in this case, the author is dealing with emotional pain. However, ignoring someone after rejection without clear communication might be hurtful. The friend is trying to reach out, so not responding could make the situation worse. \n\nAlternatively, the author might need space, but cutting off without explanation is the issue. Maybe the right approach would be to communicate their feelings honestly, even if they can't stay friends. But since they chose to ignore texts, that's where the problem lies. \n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? They might not be entirely wrong because they're struggling with their feelings, but the method of handling it (ghosting) is problematic. The answer would likely be A (yes) because ghosting is considered rude, even if the feelings are genuine. However, some might argue that they have the right to step back if they can't handle the friendship anymore. \n\nBut generally, in these situations, the expectation is to communicate, even if it's hard. So the answer is A.\n"
