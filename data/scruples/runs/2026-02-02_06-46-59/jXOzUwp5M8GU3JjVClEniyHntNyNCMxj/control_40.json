      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who ghosted their friend after being rejected is in the wrong. The situation is that they had a friend since spring, they liked her, confessed their feelings, she said no, and now they're ghosting her because they can't be friends anymore.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze the situation. Ghosting is generally considered rude because it leaves the other person without closure. But here, the person is dealing with unrequited feelings. They might be struggling emotionally. The friend wants to continue the friendship, but the author can't handle it because their feelings haven't changed. \n\nIs the author wrong? Well, the friend was clear she didn't have feelings. The author is trying to avoid ongoing pain. But by ghosting, they're not communicating their feelings. Maybe they should have had an honest conversation instead of cutting off abruptly. However, sometimes people can't handle rejection and need space. It's a bit of a grey area. \n\nIn AITA (Am I the Asshole) scenarios, the community often looks at communication and intentions. The author's intention is to protect their own feelings, but the method is ghosting. The friend is trying to maintain the friendship, which complicates things. The author might be wrong for not communicating their need for space. But they're also dealing with genuine emotional pain. \n\nHmm. I think the key point is that ghosting is usually the wrong approach because it lacks communication. The right thing would be to explain their feelings and set boundaries. So maybe the author is in the wrong. But I'm not 100% sure. Alternatively, if the author is truly unable to be friends and can't handle the situation, perhaps it's understandable but still not the best approach. \n\nI think the answer is A (Yes, the author is in the wrong) because ghosting isn't a healthy way to handle the situation. They should have communicated their feelings clearly instead of avoiding her, even if they can't continue the friendship.\n"
