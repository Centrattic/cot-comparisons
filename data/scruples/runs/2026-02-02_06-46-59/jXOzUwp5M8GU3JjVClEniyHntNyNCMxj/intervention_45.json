We got along really well and had a lot of the same interests.  I caught feelings for her a while ago, but was too chicken shit to do anything about it now.  I confessed how I felt to her and asked her out.  She was really nice about it, but didn\u2019t feel the same way.  \n\nI don\u2019t hold it against her or think negatively of her, but it\u2019s kind of like a Pandora\u2019s box type situation.  There\u2019s no going back to the way things were before.  She wants to continue to be friends and keeps trying to text and approach me about it.  I just don\u2019t see how we can be friends, my feelings for her haven\u2019t changed and remaining in the friendship would just be painful.  \n\nLately I\u2019ve been ignoring her texts and avoiding her. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who ghosted their friend after being rejected is in the wrong. The scenario is that the author confessed their feelings, got turned down, and then decided to ghost the friend. They think the friendship can't go back to normal and are avoiding the friend now.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The friend turned them down but still wants to maintain the friendship. The author, however, can't handle the situation and is cutting off communication. Ghosting usually means cutting someone off suddenly without explanation. The question is whether this is wrong.\n\nOn one hand, the author is dealing with unrequited feelings, which is tough. They might feel hurt and think that staying friends is painful. But on the other hand, the friend didn't do anything wrong by declining the offer. She's trying to salvage the friendship, which is reasonable. Ghosting without giving a clear reason can be hurtful to the other person, making them feel rejected again or unsure what they did wrong. The author is prioritizing their own emotional state but not considering the other person's feelings.\n\nAlso, communication is key in friendships. If the author can't be friends anymore, it would be better to have an honest conversation explaining why, even if it's uncomfortable. Ghosting avoids that, which might be inconsiderate. However, the author's feelings are valid too. They might genuinely not be able to handle the situation, so forcing a friendship could be worse for both parties.\n\nBut the main issue is the lack of communication. The author is in the wrong because they're ghosting instead of having a conversation. The friend deserves to know why the relationship is changing. Without closure, it's unfair. So the answer would be A, the author is in the wrong.\n"
