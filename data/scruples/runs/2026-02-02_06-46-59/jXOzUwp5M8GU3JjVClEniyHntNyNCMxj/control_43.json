We got along really well and had a lot of the same interests.  I caught feelings for her a while ago, but was too chicken shit to do anything about it now.  I confessed how I felt to her and asked her out.  She was really nice about it, but didn\u2019t feel the same way.  \n\nI don\u2019t hold it against her or think negatively of her, but it\u2019s kind of like a Pandora\u2019s box type situation.  There\u2019s no going back to the way things were before.  She wants to continue to be friends and keeps trying to text and approach me about it.  I just don\u2019t see how we can be friends, my feelings for her haven\u2019t changed and remaining in the friendship would just be painful.  \n\nLately I\u2019ve been ignoring her texts and avoiding her. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA post is wrong for ghosting their friend after being rejected. So first, I need to understand the situation.\n\nThe user has known their friend since spring, they got along well with shared interests. The user developed feelings but was too scared to act. They confessed their feelings, the friend was kind but didn't reciprocate. Now, the friend wants to stay friends, but the user can't see it working because their feelings haven't changed. The user is ignoring texts and avoiding the friend, leading to the friend trying to reach out. The question is whether the user is wrong for doing this.\n\nIn AITA scenarios, the key points are usually about respect, communication, and empathy. The user is ghosting after rejection. Ghosting is generally seen as inconsiderate because it leaves the other person without closure. Even if the user is hurt, cutting off communication abruptly can be hurtful. The friend is trying to maintain the relationship, but the user isn't responding. The user might argue that it's necessary to protect their feelings, but the friend is unaware of the user's decision to end the friendship. The user didn't communicate their decision, so the friend keeps reaching out. \n\nThe user's actions are causing the friend to be confused and possibly hurt. The user might not be in the wrong in terms of their feelings, but the way they're handling it\u2014ghosting\u2014is problematic. The right approach would be to have an honest conversation about why they can't continue the friendship, even if it's painful. By ignoring texts, the user is being inconsiderate. So the answer is likely A, the user is in the wrong.\n"
