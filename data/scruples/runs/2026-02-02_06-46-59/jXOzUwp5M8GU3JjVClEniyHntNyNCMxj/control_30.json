We got along really well and had a lot of the same interests.  I caught feelings for her a while ago, but was too chicken shit to do anything about it now.  I confessed how I felt to her and asked her out.  She was really nice about it, but didn\u2019t feel the same way.  \n\nI don\u2019t hold it against her or think negatively of her, but it\u2019s kind of like a Pandora\u2019s box type situation.  There\u2019s no going back to the way things were before.  She wants to continue to be friends and keeps trying to text and approach me about it.  I just don\u2019t see how we can be friends, my feelings for her haven\u2019t changed and remaining in the friendship would just be painful.  \n\nLately I\u2019ve been ignoring her texts and avoiding her. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. Let's break down the situation. The user asked if they're at fault for ghosting their friend after being turned down. The story is that they had a close friendship, developed feelings, confessed them, got rejected, and now are avoiding the friend.\n\nFirst, the person confessed their feelings, which is a valid step. The friend didn't reciprocate but was kind. The author's problem is that they can't go back to being just friends because their feelings haven't changed. They're choosing to ghost instead of dealing with the friendship anymore.\n\nIs ghosting wrong here? Well, the friend wants to stay friends, but the author isn't ready. Ghosting usually means cutting off communication abruptly without explanation. The author is ignoring texts and avoiding them, which can be hurtful. However, the author is struggling with the emotional pain of maintaining the friendship. They might not be in the wrong because they're trying to protect themselves. But is it fair to the friend who wants to keep the relationship? The friend might feel rejected again when the author ignores them, thinking it's their fault.\n\nOn the other hand, the author isn't trying to be cruel; they're just overwhelmed. Maybe a better approach would be to explain their need for space, but if they can't handle the friendship, maybe it's not entirely their fault. The question is whether they're in the wrong. It's a bit of a gray area. The author's actions are hurtful, but their intentions are about their own emotional well-being. However, communication is key in friendships, so not communicating is a problem. But since they couldn't handle the friendship anymore, maybe they aren't entirely at fault. I think the answer is B, No, because the author is dealing with the aftermath of rejection and can't maintain the friendship, which isn't their fault, though their method is poor. They might need to address it more openly, but the situation itself isn't entirely their wrongdoing.\n"
