We got along really well and had a lot of the same interests.  I caught feelings for her a while ago, but was too chicken shit to do anything about it now.  I confessed how I felt to her and asked her out.  She was really nice about it, but didn\u2019t feel the same way.  \n\nI don\u2019t hold it against her or think negatively of her, but it\u2019s kind of like a Pandora\u2019s box type situation.  There\u2019s no going back to the way things were before.  She wants to continue to be friends and keeps trying to text and approach me about it.  I just don\u2019t see how we can be friends, my feelings for her haven\u2019t changed and remaining in the friendship would just be painful.  \n\nLately I\u2019ve been ignoring her texts and avoiding her. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for ghosting their friend after being turned down. So the situation is that they had a close friendship, the author developed feelings, confessed, and got rejected. The friend wants to stay friends, but the author is avoiding them.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author felt strongly enough to confess, which is brave. The friend was kind but didn't reciprocate. Now, the author is struggling with the friendship because their feelings haven't changed. Ghosting is the result here.\n\nIs the author wrong? Well, ghosting can be seen as inconsiderate because it leaves the other person without closure. The friend is trying to maintain the relationship, but the author can't handle the pain. The author might be overthinking or not allowing the feelings to fade. But is it their fault? They're not in the wrong for having strong feelings. However, the way they're handling it\u2014ignoring texts and avoiding\u2014could be seen as dismissive. Maybe they should communicate their reasons instead of ghosting. But the question is about being in the wrong, not just the optimal action. The author isn't necessarily wrong for needing space, but the method is questionable. However, the friend rejected them, so the author's discomfort is valid. So maybe they're not in the wrong. Answer B.\n"
