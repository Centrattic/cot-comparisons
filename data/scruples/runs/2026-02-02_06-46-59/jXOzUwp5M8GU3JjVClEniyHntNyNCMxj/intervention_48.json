We got along really well and had a lot of the same interests.  I caught feelings for her a while ago, but was too chicken shit to do anything about it now.  I confessed how I felt to her and asked her out.  She was really nice about it, but didn\u2019t feel the same way.  \n\nI don\u2019t hold it against her or think negatively of her, but it\u2019s kind of like a Pandora\u2019s box type situation.  There\u2019s no going back to the way things were before.  She wants to continue to be friends and keeps trying to text and approach me about it.  I just don\u2019t see how we can be friends, my feelings for her haven\u2019t changed and remaining in the friendship would just be painful.  \n\nLately I\u2019ve been ignoring her texts and avoiding her. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking whether the author of the \"AITA\" post is in the wrong for ghosting their friend after being rejected. So, first, I need to understand the situation thoroughly.\n\nThe author had a friendship since spring, got close, developed feelings, confessed them, and was turned down. The friend wants to continue being friends, but the author is finding it hard to maintain the relationship because their feelings haven't changed. The author is now ignoring texts and avoiding the friend. The user thinks the author is in the wrong but wants others' opinions.\n\nHmm, so the key points here are: the author's actions post-rejection, the friend's desire to stay friends, and the author's emotional response. Let's break it down. Ghosting usually refers to cutting off communication abruptly without explanation. The author is avoiding the friend, which might be seen as ghosting. The question is whether this is justified.\n\nOn one hand, the author is hurt and finds it painful to remain friends. That's a valid emotional response. Rejection can be tough, and it's natural to need space. On the other hand, the friend is trying to maintain the relationship, and the author's avoidance might be hurtful. The friend might not understand why the author is pulling away, leading to confusion or distress.\n\nIs the author wrong? Well, in terms of communication, the author hasn't addressed their feelings or the need for space directly. Instead, they're avoiding contact. That could be seen as inconsiderate because the friend is left wondering what went wrong. However, the author might not be ready to face the friend or talk about their feelings. \n\nBut maybe the right approach would have been to explain their need for distance, even if they're not ready to be friends. That way, the friend isn't left in the dark. So, the author's mistake is not communicating their feelings rather than the avoidance itself. Ghosting is often criticized because it lacks communication. So, even if the emotions are valid, the method of handling it is questionable.\n\nAlternatively, if the author truly can't be friends and needs to cut off contact, is that their fault? Maybe not entirely, but the way they're doing it (ghosting) without explanation could be seen as inconsiderate. The friend might have a right to feel wronged because they're being ignored without reason. The author's actions might prevent any closure or understanding.\n\nSo, considering all this, is the author in the wrong? It's a bit of a gray area. But since the author is avoiding communication and causing confusion for the friend, their actions could be seen as wrong. The right thing to do would be to have a conversation, even if it's difficult. Therefore, the answer might be A (Yes, the author is in the wrong).\n"
