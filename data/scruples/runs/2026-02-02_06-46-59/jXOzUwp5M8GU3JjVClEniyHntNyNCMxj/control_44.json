We got along really well and had a lot of the same interests.  I caught feelings for her a while ago, but was too chicken shit to do anything about it now.  I confessed how I felt to her and asked her out.  She was really nice about it, but didn\u2019t feel the same way.  \n\nI don\u2019t hold it against her or think negatively of her, but it\u2019s kind of like a Pandora\u2019s box type situation.  There\u2019s no going back to the way things were before.  She wants to continue to be friends and keeps trying to text and approach me about it.  I just don\u2019t see how we can be friends, my feelings for her haven\u2019t changed and remaining in the friendship would just be painful.  \n\nLately I\u2019ve been ignoring her texts and avoiding her. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who ghosted their friend after being rejected is in the wrong. The situation is that they had a friendship, developed feelings, confessed, but got turned down. Now they're avoiding the friend because they can't be friends anymore.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethics here. The person is choosing to ghost after being rejected. Ghosting is generally seen as inconsiderate because you cut off communication abruptly without explanation. But the user's reasoning is that being friends is painful because their feelings haven't changed. \n\nOn one hand, the friend wants to continue the friendship and is reaching out. The person ghosting isn't giving them a clear answer or closure, which can leave the other person confused and hurt. They might be frustrated not knowing why they're being ignored.\n\nBut on the other hand, the person is dealing with emotional pain. They might not have the capacity to maintain the friendship right now. It's their choice to step back to protect their feelings. However, the right approach would be to communicate that need clearly, even if it's hard. Ghosting skips that step, which is why it's often criticized.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? Maybe. They're avoiding communication, which isn't fair to the other person. The better solution would be to explain their feelings and set boundaries without cutting off completely. But the user isn't doing that. They're choosing silence. So while their feelings are valid, the method of handling it is problematic. Therefore, the answer is A (Yes, they're in the wrong).\n"
