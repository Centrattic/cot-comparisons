We got along really well and had a lot of the same interests.  I caught feelings for her a while ago, but was too chicken shit to do anything about it now.  I confessed how I felt to her and asked her out.

There\u2019s no going back to the way things were before.  She wants to continue to be friends and keeps trying to text and approach me about it.  I just don\u2019t see how we can be friends, my feelings for her haven\u2019t changed and remaining in the friendship would just be painful.  \n\nLately I\u2019ve been ignoring her texts and avoiding her. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the given situation is in the wrong. The options are A (yes) or B (no). \n\nSo the author is asking \"Am I the a**hole for ghosting my friend after she turned me down?\" The situation is that they had a good friendship since spring, they developed feelings, confessed to their friend, who was nice but didn't reciprocate. The friend wants to stay friends and keeps reaching out, but the author is avoiding her because they still have feelings and it's painful. \n\nFirst, I need to determine if ghosting here is wrong. Ghosting usually refers to cutting off all communication abruptly without explanation. The author says they're ignoring texts and avoiding her. The key is whether this is justified.\n\nThe person was rejected, which is tough. They feel that being around her is painful now because their feelings haven't changed. The friend wants to continue the friendship. The author is choosing to not respond, which is ghosting. \n\nIs the author in the wrong? Well, from a friendship standpoint, not respecting the other person's desire to stay friends could be an issue. But the author's reasoning is about their own emotional pain. It's a personal choice, but it might be considered selfish or inconsiderate. \n\nHowever, sometimes people need space after rejection. The friend initiated the approach, but the author isn't ready. The problem is the lack of communication. If the author is avoiding her without telling her why, that can be hurtful. But if they had already explained their feelings and the friend is being persistent, maybe the author is in a tough spot. \n\nIn many cases, being honest about needing space is better than ghosting. But since the author is already rejected and tried to explain their feelings, maybe they have the right to step back. The question is about right/wrong. If the friend is trying to maintain friendship, but the author can't handle it, is the author wrong for prioritizing their emotional well-being? \n\nI think it's a matter of perspective. If the author didn't give any closure and just disappeared, that could be seen as inconsiderate. However, if they tried to process their emotions and needed time to avoid the pain, maybe they're not in the wrong. The friend might want to move on, but the author is struggling. \n\nSo considering all that, the answer might be B (No, the author is not in the wrong) because they're handling their emotions by stepping back, even though ghosting isn't ideal. It's a personal decision based on their own well-being. But some might argue that being honest is better, so maybe A. \n\nI need to decide. In similar situations, people often say that while ghosting is rude, it's understandable if the person is dealing with hurt. So the author isn't necessarily in the wrong, but could be advised to communicate. The question is about being in the wrong, not the best approach. \n\nTherefore, the answer is B.\n"
