We got along really well and had a lot of the same interests.  I caught feelings for her a while ago, but was too chicken shit to do anything about it now.  I confessed how I felt to her and asked her out.  She was really nice about it, but didn\u2019t feel the same way.  \n\nI don\u2019t hold it against her or think negatively of her, but it\u2019s kind of like a Pandora\u2019s box type situation.  There\u2019s no going back to the way things were before.  She wants to continue to be friends and keeps trying to text and approach me about it.  I just don\u2019t see how we can be friends, my feelings for her haven\u2019t changed and remaining in the friendship would just be painful.  \n\nLately I\u2019ve been ignoring her texts and avoiding her. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user wants to know if the person who ghosted their friend after being rejected is in the wrong. The situation is that the author had a friend they liked, confessed their feelings, got turned down, and then started ignoring the friend. The options are A (yes, wrong) or B (no, not wrong).\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author had a friendship, developed feelings, confessed, and the friend said no. Now they're avoiding the friend because they can't be friends anymore. The friend wants to continue the friendship, but the author can't handle it.\n\nIs ghosting the right move here? Ghosting usually means cutting off communication abruptly without explanation. The author says they're ignoring texts and avoiding the friend. The friend is trying to maintain the relationship, but the author is struggling with the change in dynamic.\n\nFrom a social standpoint, it's common to feel hurt after rejection. The author might not be ready to be friends again. But ghosting without explaining can be hurtful. The friend might not understand why they're being ignored, leading to confusion and possible resentment. However, the author's reasoning is that maintaining the friendship is painful. \n\nIs it fair to expect them to continue the friendship despite unrequited feelings? Maybe not. But instead of ghosting, communicating their need for space could be a better approach. The author might be justified in needing distance, but cutting off without explanation isn't the healthiest way. \n\nOn the other hand, if the friend had communicated their feelings properly, maybe the situation could be managed. The author could have said they need time or can't be friends anymore. Ghosting avoids that conversation but might leave the friend in the dark. \n\nSo, whether the author is in the wrong depends on intent and communication. If they're being honest about their inability to be friends and explaining it, even if it's painful for both, they aren't wrong. But if they're ghosting without any explanation, that's unkind. The original post mentions they're ignoring texts and avoiding, but doesn't say if they explained why. The friend is trying to reach out, so not responding without a reason could be seen as inconsiderate.\n\nBut the author's reasoning is that there's no going back to how it was. Maybe they're not ready to handle the friendship anymore. However, the friend might have different expectations. It's a bit of a gray area. \n\nIn many cases, people who are rejected might struggle with the friendship and need time. The author might be doing this to protect themselves. But the friend deserves an explanation rather than being ghosted. So, maybe the author is in the wrong for not communicating their feelings properly instead of just cutting off. But if they can't handle the friendship anymore, maybe it's not their fault. \n\nHmm. I think the key point is communication. The author should have explained their feelings instead of ghosting. So, they are in the wrong for not being honest with their friend about why they're pulling away. Therefore, the answer is A.\n"
