We got along really well and had a lot of the same interests.  I caught feelings for her a while ago, but was too chicken shit to do anything about it now.  I confessed how I felt to her and asked her out.  She was really nice about it, but didn\u2019t feel the same way.  \n\nI don\u2019t hold it against her or think negatively of her, but it\u2019s kind of like a Pandora\u2019s box type situation.  There\u2019s no going back to the way things were before.  She wants to continue to be friends and keeps trying to text and approach me about it.  I just don\u2019t see how we can be friends, my feelings for her haven\u2019t changed and remaining in the friendship would just be painful.  \n\nLately I\u2019ve been ignoring her texts and avoiding her. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of an \"Am I the Asshole\" (AITA) post is in the wrong for ghosting a friend after being rejected. The situation is that the author had a friend they really liked, confessed their feelings, got turned down, and then started ignoring the friend to avoid the pain of continuing the friendship. The friend wants to stay friends, but the author can't see how that would work.\n\nHmm. The user thinks the author is in the wrong, but they want to know if that's accurate. I need to decide between A (yes, in the wrong) or B (no, not in the wrong). \n\nFirst, I should consider the context. The author had strong feelings and was honest about them. They were rejected but still want to be friends. The friend is trying to maintain the relationship, but the author is avoiding them because they can't get over their feelings. \n\nGhosting usually refers to suddenly cutting off all communication without explanation. In this case, the author is ignoring texts and avoiding the friend. The question is whether this is justified. \n\nOn one hand, the author is struggling with unrequited feelings and is finding it painful to continue the friendship. They might not be ready to be friends again. On the other hand, the friend is trying to respect their previous relationship and wants to maintain the friendship, even though the romantic aspect isn't mutual. \n\nIs the author in the wrong for not responding? Well, they have a right to their feelings. However, ghosting without any communication can be hurtful. The friend might be confused or feel ignored. The author could have been more upfront about their feelings and the need for space, rather than just cutting off contact. \n\nBut if the author is emotionally unable to maintain the friendship, maybe it's better to distance themselves to avoid further pain. However, not communicating at all is considered ghosting, which is generally seen as inconsiderate. \n\nI think the key here is the lack of communication. Instead of ignoring the friend's attempts, the author could have explained their feelings and the need for some space. That would be more respectful. Ghosting, even for a valid reason, can be seen as inconsiderate because it leaves the other person in the dark. \n\nSo maybe the answer is A, the author is in the wrong because they could have communicated their feelings rather than ghosting. However, some might argue that they have a right to distance themselves if the friendship is too painful. \n\nBut in the AITA community, the general consensus is that ghosting is usually considered the asshole move, regardless of the reason. People often appreciate being informed why they're being distanced. Therefore, the author might be in the wrong for not being honest and instead choosing to ignore the friend's attempts to reconnect.\n"
