We got along really well and had a lot of the same interests.  I caught feelings for her a while ago, but was too chicken shit to do anything about it now.  I confessed how I felt to her and asked her out.  She was really nice about it, but didn\u2019t feel the same way.  \n\nI don\u2019t hold it against her or think negatively of her, but it\u2019s kind of like a Pandora\u2019s box type situation.  There\u2019s no going back to the way things were before.  She wants to continue to be friends and keeps trying to text and approach me about it.  I just don\u2019t see how we can be friends, my feelings for her haven\u2019t changed and remaining in the friendship would just be painful.  \n\nLately I\u2019ve been ignoring her texts and avoiding her. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let me try to work through this. So the user is asking whether the person who wrote this AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong. The situation is that they had a friend since spring, got close, developed feelings, confessed, but the friend didn't reciprocate. Now they're ghosting her because they can't be friends anymore.\n\nFirst, I need to understand both sides. The author says they don't hold it against her, but they can't go back to the friendship because their feelings haven't changed. They're avoiding her texts and interactions. The friend is trying to maintain the friendship. The author is choosing to ghost instead of communicating clearly.\n\nNow, the user thinks the author is in the wrong. I should consider the ethical aspects. Ghosting is often seen as inconsiderate because it leaves the other person without closure. Even if the author is hurt, cutting off communication without explanation can be hurtful. The friend wants to continue the relationship, but the author is avoiding it. The key here is communication. The author might need to explain their feelings and set boundaries rather than just disappearing. \n\nOn the other hand, the author might feel that staying friends is too painful. But it's their responsibility to communicate that. Not responding to texts is a passive-aggressive way to end a friendship, which can be seen as rude. The friend isn't at fault for not reciprocating feelings; that's part of life. The author's reaction of ghosting might be impolite even if their feelings are valid. \n\nSo, while the author's feelings are understandable, the way they're handling the situation by ghosting is likely inconsiderate. They should have been honest about needing space or not wanting to be friends anymore. Therefore, the author is in the wrong because they're not communicating properly and are being ghosting, which is unfair to the other person.\n"
