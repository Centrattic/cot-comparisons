We got along really well and had a lot of the same interests.  I caught feelings for her a while ago, but was too chicken shit to do anything about it now.  I confessed how I felt to her and asked her out.  She was really nice about it, but didn\u2019t feel the same way.  \n\nI don\u2019t hold it against her or think negatively of her, but it\u2019s kind of like a Pandora\u2019s box type situation.  There\u2019s no going back to the way things were before.  She wants to continue to be friends and keeps trying to text and approach me about it.  I just don\u2019t see how we can be friends, my feelings for her haven\u2019t changed and remaining in the friendship would just be painful.  \n\nLately I\u2019ve been ignoring her texts and avoiding her. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong for ghosting their friend after being turned down. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The writer had a friend they liked, confessed their feelings, got rejected, and now is avoiding the friend. The friend wants to stay friends, but the writer can't handle it and is ghosting them.\n\nSo, the question is whether the writer is wrong. The options are A (yes) or B (no). \n\nHmm. Well, when someone has a crush and gets rejected, it's natural to feel hurt. But the writer is choosing to ghost, which means cutting off communication completely. The friend is trying to maintain the friendship, but the writer isn't responding. \n\nIs the writer being reasonable? Maybe they need time to process their feelings. However, ghosting can be hurtful because it leaves the other person confused and might make them feel dismissed. The writer's friend probably wants to keep things amicable, but the writer is making it difficult by not communicating. \n\nOn the other hand, the writer might genuinely not be able to handle the friendship anymore without feeling pain. It's possible that staying friends isn't healthy for them right now. But instead of just ghosting, maybe they should have communicated their need for space. \n\nSo, is the writer at fault? If they didn't explain their actions, that could be the issue. But if they're struggling to move past their feelings, maybe it's understandable. However, ignoring someone who's trying to reach out can be seen as inconsiderate. \n\nI think the key here is that the writer didn't give a clear reason for their behavior. Ghosting is usually considered rude because it lacks communication. The friend deserves some explanation, even if they don't get the desired outcome. By not responding, the writer is making it hard for the friend to understand or adjust. \n\nTherefore, the writer is partially at fault because they didn't communicate their feelings or intentions. But maybe they're also dealing with genuine emotional pain. The answer isn't entirely clear, but leaning towards A (they are in the wrong) because ghosting is generally seen as inappropriate in such situations.\n"
