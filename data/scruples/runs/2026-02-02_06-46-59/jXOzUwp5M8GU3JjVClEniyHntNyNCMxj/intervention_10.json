We got along really well and had a lot of the same interests.  I caught feelings for her a while ago, but was too chicken shit to do anything about it now.  I confessed how I felt to her and asked her out.  She was really nice about it, but didn\u2019t feel the same way.  \n\nI don\u2019t hold it against her or think negatively of her, but it\u2019s kind of like a Pandora\u2019s box type situation.  There\u2019s no going back to the way things were before.  She wants to continue to be friends and keeps trying to text and approach me about it.  I just don\u2019t see how we can be friends, my feelings for her haven\u2019t changed and remaining in the friendship would just be painful.  \n\nLately I\u2019ve been ignoring her texts and avoiding her. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA post is in the wrong for ghosting their friend after being turned down. The friend didn't reciprocate feelings but still wants to stay friends, but the author is avoiding her.\n\nHmm, first, the author had a friendship and developed feelings. They finally confessed, and the friend was nice but didn't feel the same. The author's reasoning is that they can't go back to being friends because their feelings are still there, so they're ghosting to avoid the pain. \n\nI need to consider both sides. On one hand, the author is acting out of their own emotional well-being, thinking that distance is necessary. On the other, ghosting can be seen as inconsiderate. The friend is trying to maintain the relationship as a friendship, but the author is choosing to ignore her attempts. \n\nIs ghosting the right approach here? Usually, ghosting is when you disappear without explanation, which can leave the other person confused and hurt. The author's action is cutting off communication, which might be a way to handle the situation, but maybe it's not the most considerate. They mentioned they don't hold anything against her and just can't handle the pain, but not explaining their reasons could make the friend feel rejected or unimportant. \n\nHowever, the author also has the right to prioritize their own mental health. If being around the friend is too painful and they can't maintain the friendship without it affecting them, maybe it's a necessary step. But the problem is that they didn't communicate this. Ghosting in this case might be hurtful because the friend was trying to salvage the friendship. \n\nSo, maybe the author is in the wrong because they didn't have an open conversation to explain their feelings and decision. Instead of just ignoring, they could have set boundaries or been honest about needing space. That way, the friend would understand and maybe respect the choice. But if the author truly can't handle the friendship and communication would be too difficult, perhaps it's not entirely their fault. \n\nBut I think the key point here is the lack of communication. Even if it's hard, it's better to tell someone you're ending the friendship to avoid leaving them hanging. The friend might not have realized the extent of the pain, and the author's approach could be seen as avoiding the necessary conversation. So, the answer might be A, they are in the wrong for not communicating their decision properly.\n"
