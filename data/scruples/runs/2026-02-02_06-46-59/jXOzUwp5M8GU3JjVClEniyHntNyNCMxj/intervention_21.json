We got along really well and had a lot of the same interests.  I caught feelings for her a while ago, but was too chicken shit to do anything about it now.  I confessed how I felt to her and asked her out.  She was really nice about it, but didn\u2019t feel the same way.  \n\nI don\u2019t hold it against her or think negatively of her, but it\u2019s kind of like a Pandora\u2019s box type situation.  There\u2019s no going back to the way things were before.  She wants to continue to be friends and keeps trying to text and approach me about it.  I just don\u2019t see how we can be friends, my feelings for her haven\u2019t changed and remaining in the friendship would just be painful.  \n\nLately I\u2019ve been ignoring her texts and avoiding her. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The person is asking if the author is in the wrong for ghosting their friend after being turned down. The situation is that they had a friendship where they had mutual interests, then they confessed their feelings, got rejected, and now they're avoiding the friend.\n\nHmm. First, I need to consider the dynamics here. The author had a friend they liked, confessed, and the friend didn't reciprocate. The friend wants to continue the friendship, but the author can't handle being around them because their feelings haven't changed. So they've been ignoring texts and avoiding her.\n\nIs the author wrong? Well, when someone is rejected, it's natural to feel hurt and need space. But ghosting can be seen as inconsiderate. The friend is trying to maintain the relationship, which is normal after a rejection. The author might be avoiding pain, but cutting off communication abruptly can hurt the other person too. \n\nOn the other hand, the author has the right to their feelings and need space. Maybe they're not ready to be friends again. However, the right approach would be to communicate clearly rather than ghosting. Ghosting leaves the other person confused and can be rude. So maybe the author is in the wrong because they didn't explain their need for space, even if the situation is uncomfortable. \n\nBut some might argue that the author isn't obligated to be friends and that their feelings are valid. However, the act of ghosting is generally considered a no-closure approach, which is why many people think it's inconsiderate regardless of the reason. So probably, the answer would be A, yes, they're in the wrong because they should be honest about their need for space instead of ignoring her. But maybe some would say B, no, because they have the right to protect their feelings.\n"
