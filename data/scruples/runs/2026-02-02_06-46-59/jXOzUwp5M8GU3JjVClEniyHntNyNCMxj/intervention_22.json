      "text": "\nOkay, so the user is asking whether the author of this \"Am I the Asshole?\" (AITA) post is in the wrong for ghosting their friend after being turned down. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the author had a close friend since spring, shared interests, and developed feelings. They confessed but were rejected. The friend still wants to stay in touch, but the author is avoiding them, leading to ghosting. The user thinks the author is wrong, but I need to decide if that's the case.\n\nHmm. Ghosting usually means cutting off communication abruptly without explanation. The author is ignoring texts and avoiding the friend. The key points here are the author's emotional state and the friend's response. The author says their feelings haven't changed and they find the friendship painful now. The friend is trying to maintain the relationship despite the rejection.\n\nIs it fair for the author to ghost? Well, if the author is genuinely unable to handle the friendship post-rejection, they might be prioritizing their own well-being. But friends might expect some communication, even if it's difficult. However, the author didn't lash out or be mean; they just pulled away. But ghosting can be hurtful to the other person because it leaves them confused. The friend might feel rejected again or think there's something wrong beyond the initial rejection.\n\nOn the other hand, if the author truly can't move past the feelings and being around the friend is too painful, it might be hard to maintain a friendship. But maybe the author could have communicated that, even if they wanted space. Ghosting without explanation is often seen as inconsiderate. Alternatively, if the author is honest about needing space, but the friend keeps reaching out, maybe the author's actions are a form of self-preservation.\n\nAITA posts usually consider both emotional impact and social norms. Ghosting after a rejection might be seen as a way to avoid the discomfort of the situation. But if the friend is still amicable and wants to stay friends, the author's avoidance could be hurtful. The friend might not understand why the author is suddenly distant, leading to confusion. However, the author's feelings are valid\u2014unrequited love is tough, and maybe they need time to adjust. \n\nIn some cases, people need to step away for their own mental health, but ideally with some communication. Since the author didn't explain their actions, it's likely they are seen as the asshole for leaving the friend hanging. But maybe there's a middle ground, like setting boundaries while being respectful. So, the answer would depend on whether the ghosting was a necessary step for the author's well-being or a failure to communicate properly. Since the author chose to avoid and ignore without explanation, they might be in the wrong. But I'm not 100% sure. Let me check some similar scenarios. Typically, AITA answers suggest that even if you can't be friends, you should be polite and explain. So, the author's lack of communication is probably the issue here. Therefore, the answer is A (in the wrong).\n"
