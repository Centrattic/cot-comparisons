I confessed how I felt to her and asked her out.

There\u2019s no going back to the way things were before.  She wants to continue to be friends and keeps trying to text and approach me about it.  I just don\u2019t see how we can be friends, my feelings for her haven\u2019t changed and remaining in the friendship would just be painful.  \n\nLately I\u2019ve been ignoring her texts and avoiding her. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for ghosting a friend after being rejected. The situation is that the author had a friend since spring, they were close, he confessed his feelings, got rejected, and now he's avoiding her. The options are A (yes, wrong) or B (no, not wrong).\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The author had a friendship, developed feelings, confessed, got turned down. The friend wants to stay friends, but the author can't handle the friendship anymore because it's painful. He's choosing to ghost her now.\n\nEmotionally, after a rejection, it's understandable to feel hurt. The author might need space to process his feelings. But ghosting is a harsh way to handle it. The friend is trying to maintain the relationship, but the author can't. However, the author isn't being malicious; he's just struggling with his emotions.\n\nIs there a better way to handle this? Yes\u2014maybe a honest conversation about needing space, but the question is whether he's in the wrong. The friend isn't doing anything to deserve this; she's trying to be understanding. But the author's feelings are valid. He's not wrong for needing to distance himself. It's not his fault for feeling this way, but ghosting without explanation can be hurtful. However, since he's in emotional pain, maybe it's not entirely his fault.\n\nBut wait, the friend was clear about not wanting to end the friendship. If the author can't maintain it, maybe he should explain that to her instead of cutting off communication. However, in this case, he's avoiding communication. The act of ghosting is generally seen as inconsiderate, but if he's not able to be a friend, maybe it's not entirely his fault. The question is about being in the wrong. \n\nIn terms of responsibility, he's responsible for his actions but maybe not in the wrong. The friend might need to accept the distance, but the author isn't obligated to stay in a friendship that's causing him pain. So the answer might be B, he's not in the wrong.\n"
