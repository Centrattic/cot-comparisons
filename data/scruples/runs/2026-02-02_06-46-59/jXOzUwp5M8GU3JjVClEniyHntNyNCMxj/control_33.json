We got along really well and had a lot of the same interests.  I caught feelings for her a while ago, but was too chicken shit to do anything about it now.  I confessed how I felt to her and asked her out.  She was really nice about it, but didn\u2019t feel the same way.  \n\nI don\u2019t hold it against her or think negatively of her, but it\u2019s kind of like a Pandora\u2019s box type situation.  There\u2019s no going back to the way things were before.  She wants to continue to be friends and keeps trying to text and approach me about it.  I just don\u2019t see how we can be friends, my feelings for her haven\u2019t changed and remaining in the friendship would just be painful.  \n\nLately I\u2019ve been ignoring her texts and avoiding her. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who ghosted their friend after being rejected is in the wrong. So first, I need to understand the situation. The person had a friend they knew since spring, got close, developed feelings, confessed them, and was rejected. They feel like they can't go back to being just friends, so they've been ignoring the friend's texts and avoiding them\u2014basically ghosting.\n\nThe question is whether they're in the wrong. The options are A (yes) or B (no). Let me think about the factors here. Ghosting is generally frowned upon because it's abrupt and can be hurtful. But the person here is dealing with emotional pain. They tried to move on but found it difficult. The friend wants to maintain the friendship, but the author can't handle it.\n\nIs there a right or wrong here? Well, the author's actions are causing distress to the friend who wants to stay in touch. However, the author is also trying to protect themselves emotionally. But ghosting is a poor way to handle it. Maybe they could have communicated that they need space without cutting off completely. \n\nThe friend was understanding about the rejection, so maybe the author could have explained their feelings again, that being friends is too painful. But by ghosting, they're not giving the friend closure. The friend might feel confused or rejected again. However, the author's experience is valid too. They might not be in the wrong because they're dealing with their own emotions, but their method is questionable. \n\nIn terms of responsibility, the author chose to ghost instead of having a conversation. That's a problem. Even if they can't continue the friendship, being respectful and explaining their need for space would be better. So maybe the answer is A, they are in the wrong because they didn't communicate properly, even if their feelings are understandable.\n"
