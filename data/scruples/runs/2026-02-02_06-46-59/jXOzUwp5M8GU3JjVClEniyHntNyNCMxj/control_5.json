We got along really well and had a lot of the same interests.  I caught feelings for her a while ago, but was too chicken shit to do anything about it now.  I confessed how I felt to her and asked her out.  She was really nice about it, but didn\u2019t feel the same way.  \n\nI don\u2019t hold it against her or think negatively of her, but it\u2019s kind of like a Pandora\u2019s box type situation.  There\u2019s no going back to the way things were before.  She wants to continue to be friends and keeps trying to text and approach me about it.  I just don\u2019t see how we can be friends, my feelings for her haven\u2019t changed and remaining in the friendship would just be painful.  \n\nLately I\u2019ve been ignoring her texts and avoiding her. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for ghosting their friend after being rejected. The situation is that they had a friendship, developed feelings, asked her out, got rejected, and now are avoiding her. The author says they can't be friends anymore because it's painful.\n\nHmm, first, emotions are involved here. When someone confesses their feelings and gets rejected, it's understandable they might feel hurt. The friend wants to stay friends, but the author can't handle the pain of being close without reciprocated feelings. Ghosting is usually considered rude because it's abrupt and leaves the other person confused. But in this case, the author is explaining that they can't continue the friendship. However, instead of ghosting, maybe they should communicate their feelings more clearly. They mentioned they don't hold anything against her, but the friendship is now painful. So maybe it's okay to step back, but ghosting isn't the best approach. The friend might appreciate an honest conversation even if it's uncomfortable. So the author isn't necessarily in the wrong, but their method of handling it is. But the question is about whether they're in the wrong for ghosting. Ghosting is generally seen as inconsiderate, so maybe they are in the wrong. But their reasoning is valid. It's a tricky situation. I think the answer could be B (not in the wrong) because they have a genuine reason, but others might say A because ghosting is rude. Need to decide based on the context. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong. The key is that they tried to communicate but couldn't continue, so maybe they're justified. But ghosting is still harsh. However, if they can't be friends, maybe it's better to cut off contact. But the right way would be to explain their feelings. So maybe they should have communicated instead of ghosting. Therefore, they might be in the wrong for not being honest. But the question is about the action (ghosting) not the method. It's a bit of a gray area. I think the answer is B (not in the wrong) because their feelings are valid, but the approach is questionable. But the community might have different opinions. However, since the user is asking if the author is in the wrong, considering the situation, the answer is B.\n"
