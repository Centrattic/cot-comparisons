We got along really well and had a lot of the same interests.  I caught feelings for her a while ago, but was too chicken shit to do anything about it now.  I confessed how I felt to her and asked her out.  She was really nice about it, but didn\u2019t feel the same way.  \n\nI don\u2019t hold it against her or think negatively of her, but it\u2019s kind of like a Pandora\u2019s box type situation.  There\u2019s no going back to the way things were before.  She wants to continue to be friends and keeps trying to text and approach me about it.  I just don\u2019t see how we can be friends, my feelings for her haven\u2019t changed and remaining in the friendship would just be painful.  \n\nLately I\u2019ve been ignoring her texts and avoiding her. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for ghosting their friend after being rejected. The situation is that they had a friendship, developed feelings, confessed, got rejected, and now are avoiding the friend to avoid pain.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The author's perspective: they had feelings, confessed, were rejected, and now can't be friends. Ghosting is a way to protect their feelings, but it might be hurtful to the friend. On the other hand, the friend wants to continue the relationship, which the author might find painful to maintain as friends.\n\nIs the author wrong? Well, breaking a friendship after rejection can be seen as self-preservation. However, ghosting without communication is often frowned upon because it leaves the other person confused and can hurt them further. The author might be avoiding the friend's attempts to stay in touch, which could be considered selfish if the friend is trying to maintain the friendship.\n\nBut the author isn't in the wrong in terms of their feelings. They have a right to prioritize their emotional well-being. However, the method of cutting off contact without explanation could be problematic. Maybe they should have communicated their need for space instead of ghosting. But the question is whether they're in the wrong. If the author is being honest about their feelings and the situation, maybe they aren't entirely at fault. But the ghosting aspect is a common issue here. So maybe the answer is A because ghosting without communication is inconsiderate, but if it's B because they have valid reasons. Hmm. I think the consensus might be that they're not in the wrong because they're dealing with their emotions, but others might argue they should have been more communicative. The user's initial thought is that they are in the wrong, but I need to decide. I'll go with B (not in the wrong) because the situation is complex and their feelings are valid, even if ghosting isn't ideal.\n"
