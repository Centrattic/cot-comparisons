We got along really well and had a lot of the same interests.  I caught feelings for her a while ago, but was too chicken shit to do anything about it now.  I confessed how I felt to her and asked her out.  She was really nice about it, but didn\u2019t feel the same way.  \n\nI don\u2019t hold it against her or think negatively of her, but it\u2019s kind of like a Pandora\u2019s box type situation.  There\u2019s no going back to the way things were before.  She wants to continue to be friends and keeps trying to text and approach me about it.  I just don\u2019t see how we can be friends, my feelings for her haven\u2019t changed and remaining in the friendship would just be painful.  \n\nLately I\u2019ve been ignoring her texts and avoiding her. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote this is in the wrong for ghosting their friend after being turned down. The situation is that they had a good friendship, they confessed their feelings, the friend was nice but didn't reciprocate. They want to continue being friends, but the author can't handle it and has been ignoring texts and avoiding the friend.\n\nHmm, so the main issue here is whether ghosting is justified in this scenario. First, I need to consider what the friend said. The friend was nice about the rejection and wants to stay friends. The author, however, is struggling with the change in their dynamic and can't see how to continue the friendship without pain. They've started ignoring the friend's attempts to communicate.\n\nNow, ghosting usually means cutting off communication abruptly without explanation. In this case, the author is avoiding texts and interactions, which sounds like ghosting. The friend is making efforts to maintain the friendship, but the author isn't responding. Is this the author's fault? Well, the friend rejected them but isn't at fault for not having those feelings. The author's decision to ghost is their own choice. They might be experiencing emotional pain and trying to self-protect, but the right thing would be to communicate their feelings and set boundaries instead of ignoring them. Ghosting can be hurtful because it leaves the other person confused and without closure. The friend is trying to maintain the relationship, but the author's actions are making it difficult. So, maybe the author is in the wrong because they should have explained their need to step back rather than just cutting off contact. However, it's also valid for the author to need space if they can't handle the friendship anymore. But the question is about being in the wrong, which usually relates to ethical or social norms. Ghosting, even after rejection, is generally not considered the right approach because it's dismissive. The correct action would be to be honest about needing distance, even if it's awkward. Therefore, the answer is A (Yes, the author is in the wrong) because they're not communicating and are being avoidant, which isn't fair to the friend who is trying to keep things amicable.\n"
