We got along really well and had a lot of the same interests.  I caught feelings for her a while ago, but was too chicken shit to do anything about it now.  I confessed how I felt to her and asked her out.  She was really nice about it, but didn\u2019t feel the same way.  \n\nI don\u2019t hold it against her or think negatively of her, but it\u2019s kind of like a Pandora\u2019s box type situation.  There\u2019s no going back to the way things were before.  She wants to continue to be friends and keeps trying to text and approach me about it.  I just don\u2019t see how we can be friends, my feelings for her haven\u2019t changed and remaining in the friendship would just be painful.  \n\nLately I\u2019ve been ignoring her texts and avoiding her. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the \"AITA\" post is in the wrong for ghosting their friend after being rejected. The situation is that they had a friendship, developed feelings, confessed, got rejected, and now are avoiding the friend. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The friend turned them down, and the person is struggling to maintain the friendship because their feelings haven't changed. They feel that remaining friends would be painful.\n\nGhosting usually refers to cutting off communication suddenly without explanation. In this case, the person is avoiding texts and interactions, which could be seen as ghosting. The friend wants to stay friends, but the author isn't responding.\n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong. From a relationship advice perspective, it's important to consider both emotional honesty and communication. The author is avoiding the friend, which might be hurtful. However, they're also dealing with unrequited feelings, which is tough.\n\nIs there a better approach? Maybe setting boundaries and being honest about why the friendship isn't working for them. But the author hasn't communicated this, just ignored the friend. That could be seen as inconsiderate because the friend might be confused or hurt by the sudden cutoff.\n\nBut the author isn't in a relationship; they were just friends. The friend rejected them, and the author can't handle the friendship anymore. It's valid to need space, but the method matters. Ignoring them without explanation might be seen as wrong because it leaves the friend in the dark. The author should probably explain their feelings and set boundaries to be respectful.\n\nSo, the answer would be A (yes, in the wrong) because they're not communicating their feelings and are ghosting instead of being honest. Even if their feelings are valid, the way they're handling it could hurt the friend. They should communicate their need for space rather than just avoiding the person.\n"
