      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote this AITA post is in the wrong after ghosting their friend following a rejection. So, first, I need to understand the situation.\n\nThe person had a friend they met last spring, got along well, shared interests. They developed feelings but didn't act on them for a while. Eventually, they confessed to their friend and asked her out. She was kind but turned them down. The person doesn't hold it against her but feels that the friendship can't go back to how it was. The friend still wants to be friends, texts them, but the author is ignoring her and avoiding her. The question is whether the author is wrong.\n\nSo, the key points here are: the person was honest about their feelings, the friend rejected them, the person is struggling with the friendship because they still have feelings. They're choosing to distance themselves by ghosting.\n\nNow, to determine if they're in the wrong. Ghosting is generally considered a form of cutting off communication without explanation. In this case, the friend is trying to maintain the friendship, but the person who was rejected is finding it too painful. \n\nOn one hand, the person isn't being malicious; they're genuinely hurt and can't see how the friendship can continue. They might believe that maintaining the friendship would be emotionally difficult for them. On the other hand, ghosting can be hurtful to the other person because she's trying to be understanding but is met with silence. They could have explained their need for space more clearly instead of just disappearing.\n\nIs it wrong? Well, it's a common reaction when someone is hurt and not ready to handle the friendship anymore. The person is being honest with themselves but perhaps not with their friend. The question is whether they have a responsibility to communicate their feelings better. Ghosting is often seen as inconsiderate, even if the person is in pain. So, maybe they're not in the wrong because their feelings are valid, but they could have communicated more effectively. However, the friend is also trying to be understanding, so the author's actions might be seen as avoiding a necessary conversation.\n\nSo, the answer might be B (not in the wrong) because their feelings are genuine, but there's a nuance. However, in AITA scenarios, the community often values communication and consideration. Ghosting can be seen as wrong regardless of the reason because it leaves the other person in the dark. So maybe the answer is A. But the person is in a tough spot. They might not be in the wrong for feeling that way, but their method is poor. But the question is whether they are in the wrong. If the wrong is about the action (ghosting) regardless of intent, then A. If the wrong is about the decision to end the friendship, then maybe not. The key is that they could have been more communicative. The answer likely is A, but I need to verify.\n\nWait, the user's instruction says answer A if the author is in the wrong, B if not. The community usually says that if you're ghosting without explanation, even if you have reasons, you're at least a tiny bit in the wrong. But if the person is truly hurt and can't continue, they might get some sympathy. However, the friend is trying to be understanding. So the author is making it harder for the friend by not communicating. So maybe the answer is A. But sometimes, the answer is B because the person is not malicious. Hmm. I think the answer is B. Because the person's intentions are not malicious, they're just hurt and can't handle the friendship. So they are not in the wrong, but they could be doing better. The AITA community tends to take context into account. So the answer is B.\n"
