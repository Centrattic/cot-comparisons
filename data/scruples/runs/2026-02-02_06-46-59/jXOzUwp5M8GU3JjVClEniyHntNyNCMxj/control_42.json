      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that they had a friend since spring, got close, and then confessed their feelings. The friend didn't feel the same but was nice. Now, the author is ghosting them because they can't be friends anymore, and the friend is trying to reach out.\n\nHmm. The key points here are about boundaries and communication. When someone turns down your romantic interest, it's hard. The author is struggling with moving on and maintaining the friendship. They mention that they don't want to be friends anymore because it's painful, so they're ignoring texts and avoiding the person. \n\nIs ghosting the right move here? Well, the friend wants to continue their friendship, but the author isn't ready. Ghosting might be a way to create distance, but it's not very respectful. The friend might be confused or hurt because they're not getting any response, even though they were trying to be friendly. \n\nThe author should probably communicate their feelings instead of just cutting off contact. Telling the friend that they need some space or that they can't continue the friendship would be better than ghosting. That way, the friend knows what's happening and isn't left wondering. \n\nBut wait, the author says they don't hold it against the friend and don't think negatively of them. So maybe they're not being vindictive. However, not responding is still hurtful. The friend is trying to reach out, and the author is avoiding them, which could make the friend feel rejected again. \n\nIn relationships, whether romantic or platonic, communication is key. The author might be in the right to need space, but they're handling it poorly. Ghosting is usually considered inconsiderate, even if there are good reasons. So maybe the author is in the wrong because they're not being honest and are leaving the friend in the dark. \n\nSo, the answer would be A) Yes, the author is in the wrong because they should have communicated their need for space instead of ghosting.\n"
