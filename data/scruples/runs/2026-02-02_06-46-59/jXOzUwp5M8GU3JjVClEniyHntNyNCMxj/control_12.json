      "text": "\nOkay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong for ghosting their friend after being rejected. Let me start by breaking down the situation. The user had a friend they knew since spring, and they developed feelings. They confessed, but the friend didn't reciprocate. Now, the friend wants to stay in touch, but the user is avoiding them, leading to ghosting.\n\nFirst, I should consider the concept of ghosting. Ghosting is when someone stops communicating with another person abruptly without explanation or closure. In this case, the user is ignoring texts and avoiding the friend. The question is whether this is justified or if the user is in the wrong.\n\nThe user's reasoning is that their feelings haven't changed, and being friends would be painful. They can't go back to how things were. The friend, on the other hand, wants to continue the friendship. The user is choosing to distance themselves to avoid ongoing emotional pain. \n\nNow, thinking about boundaries and communication. When someone has unrequited feelings, it's challenging. The user has the right to set boundaries to protect their emotional well-being. However, ghosting can be hurtful because it leaves the other person without closure. The friend might be confused or feel rejected again if the user just stops responding.\n\nBut is the user in the wrong? Well, they are not being dishonest. They're not pretending to be interested in the friendship when they aren't. However, the method of handling it\u2014ignoring texts and avoiding\u2014might not be the best approach. A more mature way would be to have an honest conversation, explaining that they can't continue the friendship because of lingering feelings and need time to heal. That way, the friend isn't left in the dark.\n\nSo, the user isn't necessarily in the wrong for wanting space, but the way they're handling it (ghosting) could be problematic. Ghosting is generally frowned upon because it's abrupt and lacks communication. However, the user's situation is understandable given the emotional pain. The key issue is whether the user is responsible for their actions and the potential impact on the friend. \n\nIn these kinds of cases, people often argue that while the user is not wrong for needing space, the lack of communication is where the wrongdoing happens. The author could be seen as avoiding the discomfort of having a difficult conversation, which is a valid critique. But considering the emotional stakes, there's empathy for their decision too.\n\nSo, the answer might depend on whether the focus is on the user's right to set boundaries or the method of communication. Since the question is whether the author is in the wrong, and given that ghosting is typically considered inconsiderate, the answer might lean towards A (they are in the wrong). However, there's also an argument that they're not wrong for needing to step back. \n\nBut in AITA (Am I the Asshole) contexts, the community often emphasizes communication and closure. Even if someone can't continue a friendship, being ghosted is seen as inconsiderate. So the user is in the wrong for not communicating their reasons, even if their feelings are valid. Therefore, the answer is A.\n"
