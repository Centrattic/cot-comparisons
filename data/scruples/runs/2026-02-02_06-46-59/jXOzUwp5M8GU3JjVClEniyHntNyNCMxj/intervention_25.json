We got along really well and had a lot of the same interests.  I caught feelings for her a while ago, but was too chicken shit to do anything about it now.  I confessed how I felt to her and asked her out.  She was really nice about it, but didn\u2019t feel the same way.  \n\nI don\u2019t hold it against her or think negatively of her, but it\u2019s kind of like a Pandora\u2019s box type situation.  There\u2019s no going back to the way things were before.  She wants to continue to be friends and keeps trying to text and approach me about it.  I just don\u2019t see how we can be friends, my feelings for her haven\u2019t changed and remaining in the friendship would just be painful.  \n\nLately I\u2019ve been ignoring her texts and avoiding her. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, so the user is asking if the author of this situation is in the wrong. Let me read through it again carefully.\n\nThe author has a friend they've known since last spring. They got along well and shared interests. The author developed feelings but was too scared to act on them. Eventually, they confessed, and the friend was nice but didn't reciprocate. Now, the author is ignoring her texts and avoiding her because they can't see being friends anymore, finding it painful. The friend still wants to maintain the friendship.\n\nThe user thinks the author is in the wrong but wants my opinion. Let me break this down. First, the author had a friendship, then developed romantic feelings. They didn't act on them for a while, but when they did, the friend turned them down. The author is struggling to go back to the way things were and is avoiding the friend. \n\nIs avoiding a friend after being rejected romantic feelings considered wrong? Well, in relationships, whether romantic or platonic, communication is key. The author is not responding to messages or avoiding the friend, which could be seen as ghosting. Ghosting is generally when you cut off contact without explanation, which can be hurtful. However, the author's reason is that they can't be friends anymore because of unreciprocated feelings. \n\nBut the friend is still interested in maintaining the friendship. The author might be in a tough spot, but is it their fault? If they can't handle the friendship anymore, maybe they should have been honest earlier instead of just ghosting. Ghosting can leave the other person confused and wondering why the connection was lost. The author's feelings not changing is understandable, but mutual respect and communication are important. \n\nOn one hand, the author is being honest about their inability to continue the friendship, which is valid. But they're not communicating that clearly, instead choosing to ignore messages. That lack of communication might be the issue. So, maybe the author is in the wrong for not having a direct conversation and instead ghosting. \n\nAlternatively, if the author truly can't be around the friend without feeling pain, maybe it's a personal struggle, but still, ghosting without explanation is unkind. The friend deserves to know the reason, even if it's hard. \n\nSo, considering all this, I think the answer is A (yes, the author is in the wrong) because ghosting isn't the best way to handle this. They should communicate their feelings and the reason why they need space, even if it's uncomfortable. Ignoring messages and avoiding her without explanation could be seen as inconsiderate, even if their feelings haven't changed.\n"
