We got along really well and had a lot of the same interests.  I caught feelings for her a while ago, but was too chicken shit to do anything about it now.  I confessed how I felt to her and asked her out.

There\u2019s no going back to the way things were before.  She wants to continue to be friends and keeps trying to text and approach me about it.  I just don\u2019t see how we can be friends, my feelings for her haven\u2019t changed and remaining in the friendship would just be painful.  \n\nLately I\u2019ve been ignoring her texts and avoiding her. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is about ghosting a friend after being rejected.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the scenario. The author had a close friend they've known since spring, shared interests, and developed feelings. They confessed, got turned down, and now are avoiding the friend. The friend wants to stay in touch, but the author can't handle the pain of being around them. The author is ignoring texts and avoiding them. They think the author is in the wrong, but wants another opinion.\n\nSo, the key points: The author's actions are ghosting after rejection. The friend is trying to maintain the friendship. The author is struggling with unresolved feelings. \n\nNow, considering the ethics here. Ghosting can be seen as inconsiderate. The friend didn't do anything wrong by rejecting them, and the author is now cutting off communication. However, the author's reasoning is that being friends is painful because their feelings haven't changed. Is it wrong to prioritize their own emotional well-being and choose to step back?\n\nOn one hand, ghosting is generally frowned upon because it's abrupt and can hurt the other person. The friend is trying to maintain the relationship, so ignoring their attempts might be seen as unkind. But on the other hand, the author is dealing with unrequited feelings, which can be tough. Maybe a more mature approach would be to have a conversation and explain their need for space rather than ghosting.\n\nBut the question is whether the author is in the wrong. If the author is avoiding the friend to protect their own feelings, is that justified? The friend didn't owe them a relationship, and the author's feelings are valid. However, cutting off communication without explanation can leave the friend confused and hurt. The right approach might have been to be honest about needing time or space instead of ghosting. So, maybe the author is in the wrong for not communicating their reasons and just disappearing. \n\nAlternatively, if the author can't handle the friendship anymore, maybe they aren't in the wrong for prioritizing their mental health. But the act of ghosting is still inconsiderate. So, the answer might be A (yes, in the wrong) because they didn't communicate their need for space and instead ghosted. However, some might argue that they have the right to distance themselves if the friendship is causing pain. \n\nBut the friend was trying to continue the friendship, so the author's ghosting could be seen as making it more difficult for the friend, hence the wrong. So, I think the answer is A.\n"
