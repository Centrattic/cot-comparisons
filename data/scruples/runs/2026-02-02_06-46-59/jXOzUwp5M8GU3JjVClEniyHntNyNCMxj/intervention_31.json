We got along really well and had a lot of the same interests.  I caught feelings for her a while ago, but was too chicken shit to do anything about it now.  I confessed how I felt to her and asked her out.  She was really nice about it, but didn\u2019t feel the same way.  \n\nI don\u2019t hold it against her or think negatively of her, but it\u2019s kind of like a Pandora\u2019s box type situation.  There\u2019s no going back to the way things were before.  She wants to continue to be friends and keeps trying to text and approach me about it.  I just don\u2019t see how we can be friends, my feelings for her haven\u2019t changed and remaining in the friendship would just be painful.  \n\nLately I\u2019ve been ignoring her texts and avoiding her. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so the user is asking whether the author of the \"AITA\" post is in the wrong. Let me break this down.\n\nThe situation is that the author had a friend they really liked. They got feelings for this friend and confessed, but she didn't reciprocate. Now, he's been ghosting her even though she wants to stay friends. The question is whether he's in the wrong.\n\nFirst, I need to consider communication. When someone has unrequited feelings, it's tough. The author might be feeling hurt and avoiding the friendship to protect himself. But friends usually value communication. Ghosting, which is cutting off contact without explanation, can be hurtful. The author didn't tell her why he's ignoring her, which might make her confused or worried. \n\nThen, there's the aspect of friendship. If the friendship is important to her, he should consider how his actions affect her. Even if he can't be friends anymore, being honest about his feelings might be better than ghosting. Ghosting can leave the other person without closure, which isn't kind. \n\nOn the other hand, the author has a right to his feelings. If being around her is painful, he might need space. But there's a balance between protecting oneself and respecting the other person's need for closure. Maybe a middle ground, like explaining his feelings and setting boundaries, would be healthier than ghosting.\n\nSo, the key points are: Did he communicate properly? No. Did he prioritize his feelings without considering hers? Possibly. Ghosting is generally seen as inconsiderate because it leaves the other person hanging. So, the answer is likely A, he's in the wrong.\n"
