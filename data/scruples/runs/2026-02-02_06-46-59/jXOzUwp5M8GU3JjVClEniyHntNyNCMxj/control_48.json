We got along really well and had a lot of the same interests.  I caught feelings for her a while ago, but was too chicken shit to do anything about it now.  I confessed how I felt to her and asked her out.

There\u2019s no going back to the way things were before.  She wants to continue to be friends and keeps trying to text and approach me about it.  I just don\u2019t see how we can be friends, my feelings for her haven\u2019t changed and remaining in the friendship would just be painful.  \n\nLately I\u2019ve been ignoring her texts and avoiding her. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who ghosted their friend after being rejected is in the wrong. The situation is that they had a friendship, confessed their feelings, got turned down, and now can't handle being friends anymore, so they're ghosting.\n\nFirst, the key points here: the friend was nice but didn't reciprocate the feelings. The author can't see how the friendship can continue because their feelings are still there, leading them to avoid the friend. The question is whether this ghosting is wrong.\n\nI need to consider the context. Ghosting is generally seen as inconsiderate, but this is after a rejection. The author is struggling with their emotions and can't manage the friendship anymore. They don't hold the friend's rejection against her, but they can't handle the pain of staying friends. \n\nIs it wrong to prioritize their own emotional well-being? Maybe not. But ghosting without communication can be hurtful. However, the alternative is staying in a friendship that's causing ongoing pain. The author might need time to process, but cutting off communication abruptly can leave the other person confused.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? It's complicated. They might not be outright wrong because they're dealing with their emotions, but maybe they should have communicated their need for space instead of ghosting. However, the answer options are A for yes (wrong) and B for no (not wrong). The community might see it as the author not being wrong because they're acting on their feelings, even if the method is poor. Alternatively, others might argue that ghosting is inconsiderate regardless.\n\nI think the answer leans towards B (not wrong) because the author is struggling with unrequited feelings and can't maintain the friendship. They're not being malicious, just unable to handle the situation. However, the better approach would be to explain their feelings instead of ghosting, but the question is about being in the wrong, not about the best action. So maybe B is the right answer here.\n"
