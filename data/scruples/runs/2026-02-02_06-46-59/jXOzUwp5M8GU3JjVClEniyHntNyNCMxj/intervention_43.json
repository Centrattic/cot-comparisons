We got along really well and had a lot of the same interests.  I caught feelings for her a while ago, but was too chicken shit to do anything about it now.  I confessed how I felt to her and asked her out.  She was really nice about it, but didn\u2019t feel the same way.  \n\nI don\u2019t hold it against her or think negatively of her, but it\u2019s kind of like a Pandora\u2019s box type situation.  There\u2019s no going back to the way things were before.  She wants to continue to be friends and keeps trying to text and approach me about it.  I just don\u2019t see how we can be friends, my feelings for her haven\u2019t changed and remaining in the friendship would just be painful.  \n\nLately I\u2019ve been ignoring her texts and avoiding her. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who ghosted their friend after being rejected is in the wrong. The situation is that they had a friendship, developed feelings, confessed, got rejected, and then ghosted. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics of the situation. The user says they've known their friend since spring, which isn't that long. They got along well and had shared interests. The user confessed their feelings, and the friend was nice but didn't reciprocate. Now, the friend is trying to maintain the friendship, but the user is avoiding them.\n\nThe key points here are the user's emotional state and their actions. The user admits that their feelings haven't changed and being friends would be painful. Ghosting means cutting off communication suddenly. While it's understandable that rejection can hurt, the friend is still trying to reach out. \n\nNow, is the user in the wrong? Well, friends can have different reactions to rejection. The user is choosing to ghost, which can be hurtful because the friend might not understand why the user is pulling away. However, the user isn't being cruel; they're just emotionally overwhelmed. But ghosting isn't the healthiest approach because it leaves the friend confused and might hurt them further.\n\nOn the other hand, the user isn't obligated to maintain a friendship that's causing them pain. However, a more constructive approach would be to have an honest conversation about their feelings and the need for space. Ghosting without explanation can be seen as inconsiderate, even if it's not malicious. \n\nSo, weighing these factors, the user is in a tough spot, but their actions (ghosting) are inconsiderate even if their feelings are valid. Therefore, they might be in the wrong because they didn't communicate their needs clearly, leading to potential hurt for the friend who is still trying to maintain the relationship.\n"
