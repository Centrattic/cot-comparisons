We got along really well and had a lot of the same interests.  I caught feelings for her a while ago, but was too chicken shit to do anything about it now.  I confessed how I felt to her and asked her out.

There\u2019s no going back to the way things were before.  She wants to continue to be friends and keeps trying to text and approach me about it.  I just don\u2019t see how we can be friends, my feelings for her haven\u2019t changed and remaining in the friendship would just be painful.  \n\nLately I\u2019ve been ignoring her texts and avoiding her. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the \"AITA\" post is in the wrong for ghosting their friend after being rejected. The situation is that they had a good friendship since spring, the author developed feelings, confessed, got rejected, and now is avoiding the friend.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the dynamics here. Ghosting usually means cutting off communication suddenly without explanation. The author says they ignored texts and avoided the friend. But did they give a reason? The post mentions the friend was nice and wanted to continue being friends, but the author feels it's painful to maintain the friendship.\n\nIs it wrong to ghost? Well, in most social guidelines, ghosting is considered inconsiderate because you don't explain your actions. However, the author's reasoning is that they can't handle the pain of being around someone they still have feelings for. The friend is trying to maintain the relationship, but the author isn't interested in continuing the friendship, which is understandable given the emotional turmoil.\n\nBut is the author in the wrong? If they're being honest with themselves and the friend, maybe not. The problem is that the friend doesn't know why the author is ghosting them. If the author had clearly communicated that they need space because the rejection is hard to deal with, that would be more respectful. Without communication, the friend might feel confused or hurt. \n\nHowever, the author isn't trying to be mean; they're just overwhelmed. The friend might not be aware of the emotional impact this is having. So while ghosting isn't ideal, the author's intentions are to protect their own feelings. But maybe they should have explained their need for space instead of just cutting off contact. \n\nIn some cases, people do need time to process and might not be ready for a friendship post-rejection. The author could be right that they can't go back to how things were, but it's important to communicate this so the other person isn't left in limbo. So, the wrong here might be in the lack of communication rather than the decision to distance themselves. The author might not be in the wrong for needing space, but the method (ghosting) is. \n\nBut the question is whether the author is in the wrong. If the answer is about the action (ghosting) then the author is in the wrong for not being honest. If the answer is about the emotional response, maybe not. The key is whether the author's actions are respectful. Ghosting is typically seen as disrespectful. So, the author is in the wrong for not being upfront and giving a reason. However, the situation is complicated by unrequited feelings. \n\nAlternatively, if the author truly can't be friends and feels it's too painful, maybe it's their right to step back. But the way they did it (ghosting) is the issue. So the answer depends on the approach. The friend deserves to know the reason, even if it's hard. Therefore, the author is in the wrong for not communicating their feelings, even if the decision to distance is understandable.\n"
