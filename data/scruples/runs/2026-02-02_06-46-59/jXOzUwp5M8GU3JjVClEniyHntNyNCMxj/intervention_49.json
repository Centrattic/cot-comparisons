We got along really well and had a lot of the same interests.  I caught feelings for her a while ago, but was too chicken shit to do anything about it now.  I confessed how I felt to her and asked her out.  She was really nice about it, but didn\u2019t feel the same way.  \n\nI don\u2019t hold it against her or think negatively of her, but it\u2019s kind of like a Pandora\u2019s box type situation.  There\u2019s no going back to the way things were before.  She wants to continue to be friends and keeps trying to text and approach me about it.  I just don\u2019t see how we can be friends, my feelings for her haven\u2019t changed and remaining in the friendship would just be painful.  \n\nLately I\u2019ve been ignoring her texts and avoiding her. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong for ghosting their friend after being rejected. The friend was someone they've known since spring, they had a good friendship, then the author confessed their feelings and got rejected. Now they're ignoring texts and avoiding the friend.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the situation from both sides. The author is upset because they can't go back to the way things were and find the friendship painful. Ghosting is generally seen as inconsiderate because it leaves the other person confused and without closure. The friend, on the other hand, is trying to maintain the friendship and is hurt by the sudden silence.\n\nThe author might feel that staying friends is too painful, which is understandable. But instead of ghosting, maybe they should have communicated their need for space. Ghosting can make the friend feel like they did something wrong, even if they didn't. The author's actions might come across as cruel, even if their intent was to protect themselves emotionally.\n\nHowever, the author isn't holding a grudge and still has positive feelings towards the friend. The problem is the method of handling the situation. So while the author's feelings are valid, the way they handled it (ghosting) is inconsiderate. So the answer would be A (Yes, in the wrong) because they didn't communicate properly and left the friend hanging.\n"
