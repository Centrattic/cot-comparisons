We got along really well and had a lot of the same interests.  I caught feelings for her a while ago, but was too chicken shit to do anything about it now.  I confessed how I felt to her and asked her out.  She was really nice about it, but didn\u2019t feel the same way.  \n\nI don\u2019t hold it against her or think negatively of her, but it\u2019s kind of like a Pandora\u2019s box type situation.  There\u2019s no going back to the way things were before.  She wants to continue to be friends and keeps trying to text and approach me about it.  I just don\u2019t see how we can be friends, my feelings for her haven\u2019t changed and remaining in the friendship would just be painful.  \n\nLately I\u2019ve been ignoring her texts and avoiding her. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the post is in the wrong for ghosting their friend after being turned down. The scenario is that they had a good friendship since spring, developed feelings, confessed them, and the friend was nice but didn't reciprocate. Now the author is ignoring her texts and avoiding her because they can't see being friends anymore.\n\nFirst, I need to determine if ghosting is justified here. The author isn't angry or resentful but is struggling with the emotional pain of continuing the friendship. The friend is trying to maintain the relationship, but the author is avoiding it. Is the author being unreasonable?\n\nGhosting usually refers to cutting off communication suddenly and without explanation. In this case, the author is avoiding the friend because they can't handle the pain of an unrequited relationship. They might be prioritizing their own emotional well-being. However, some people might argue that ghosting is inconsiderate, regardless of the reason. The friend is trying to stay in touch, so not responding could be seen as hurtful, even if the author isn't in the wrong for the feelings.\n\nBut according to the post, the author isn't holding a grudge. The issue is that their feelings haven't changed, making the friendship painful. So, the author isn't necessarily being inconsiderate but is making a personal choice based on their emotional state. \n\nOn the other hand, the friend might feel confused or rejected by the sudden silence. The author could have been more open about their lingering feelings instead of ghosting. However, the author might not want to pressure the friend or make things awkward.\n\nIs there a right or wrong here? The author's actions are causing distress, but their motivation is self-preservation. Ghosting is generally frowned upon, but the context matters. If the author can't maintain the friendship without pain, maybe it's understandable. But not communicating is still hurtful. \n\nI think the answer depends on whether the author's choice is about the friend's actions or their own inability to cope. Since the friend is trying to be kind and wants to stay friends, the author's ghosting might not be justified. They could have set boundaries or been honest about needing space without ghosting. So, the author is in the wrong because ghosting is a common issue even if the feelings are real. A better approach would be to communicate their need for space to their friend, even if they can't continue the friendship.\n"
