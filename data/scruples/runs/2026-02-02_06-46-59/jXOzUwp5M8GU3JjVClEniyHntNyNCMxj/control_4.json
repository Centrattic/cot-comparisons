There\u2019s no going back to the way things were before.  She wants to continue to be friends and keeps trying to text and approach me about it.  I just don\u2019t see how we can be friends, my feelings for her haven\u2019t changed and remaining in the friendship would just be painful.  \n\nLately I\u2019ve been ignoring her texts and avoiding her. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that the person had a friend they really connected with, same interests, and they developed feelings for her. They confessed, and she turned them down but was nice about it. Now, the author is ghosting her, ignoring texts and avoiding her because they feel like the friendship can't go back to how it was before. The friend wants to continue the friendship, but the author is struggling with the pain of unrequited feelings.\n\nHmm. First, I need to consider both sides. The author's reasoning is that being friends is painful now because their feelings haven't changed. They might be giving her space because they don't want to keep pretending everything's fine. But on the other hand, the friend is trying to reach out and maintain the relationship. Ghosting might be seen as harsh because it could leave the friend confused or hurt, even if she doesn't have romantic feelings. \n\nIs the author wrong for not wanting to be friends anymore? Well, after a romantic confession is rejected, it's natural for the dynamic to change. If the author can't see the friendship working because they're still in love, maybe they are protecting their own emotional state. But there's a difference between not wanting to be in a romantic relationship and not being able to maintain a friendship. The friend might value the friendship and not understand why the author is pulling away. \n\nGhosting is generally frowned upon because it's abrupt and doesn't allow for closure. The author could be handling this by being honest but kind. If they're not willing to accept her friendship without romantic feelings, maybe they should explain that they need time or can't be friends anymore. But just cutting off without explanation might be inconsiderate. \n\nSo the author's intention is clear, but the method is ghosting. The question is whether that's wrong. If the friend is being persistent and the author is avoiding communication, it could be seen as the author's fault for not addressing the issue properly. But if the author is genuinely too hurt to continue the friendship, maybe they're not in the wrong. \n\nI think it's a bit of both, but the main issue is the ghosting. Even if the author is right about not being able to be friends, the lack of communication is unkind. The right approach would be to talk openly, not just disappear. So maybe the author is in the wrong for ghosting, even if their feelings are valid. Answer A?\n"
