      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who ghosted their friend after being rejected is in the wrong. The situation is that they had a friendship, developed feelings, confessed, got rejected but in a kind way. Now the friend wants to stay friends, but the author is avoiding them. The user wants to know if the author is at fault.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author had a close friend, developed feelings, and took a chance by confessing. The friend didn't reciprocate but was understanding. The author now finds it hard to maintain the friendship due to lingering feelings and chooses to ghost them. Ghosting is generally considered rude because it's abrupt and leaves the other person without closure. However, the author's reasoning is that being friends is painful because their feelings haven't changed. \n\nIs the author wrong? Well, it's a tough spot. On one hand, avoiding communication without explaining can hurt the friend. The friend might be trying to salvage the friendship, not realizing the emotional toll it's taking on the author. But the author's feelings are valid too. They might be protecting themselves from further hurt. However, the right approach would be to communicate honestly, even if it's uncomfortable. Ghosting avoids that conversation, which can leave the other person confused. \n\nSo the author isn't necessarily in the wrong for having those feelings or choosing to distance themselves, but the way they handled it (ghosting) without explanation is where the issue lies. But the question is whether they are in the wrong. Since the user is asking for a yes or no, I need to decide if the answer is A or B. The answer is more nuanced. The author's actions (ghosting) are inconsiderate, but their feelings are understandable. However, the act of ghosting is generally seen as wrong because it's not respectful to the other person. So maybe the answer is A (they're in the wrong) because they didn't communicate properly, even if their feelings are valid. Alternatively, B (not in the wrong) because their emotional state justifies their actions. \n\nHmm. In typical AITA contexts, ghosting is often seen as a red flag. The friend tried to maintain the relationship, and the author didn't give them a proper explanation. So the author is in the wrong for not being honest and communicative, even if their feelings are real. So answer A.\n"
