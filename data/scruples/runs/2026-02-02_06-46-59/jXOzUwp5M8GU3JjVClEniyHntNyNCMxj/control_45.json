We got along really well and had a lot of the same interests.  I caught feelings for her a while ago, but was too chicken shit to do anything about it now.  I confessed how I felt to her and asked her out.

There\u2019s no going back to the way things were before.  She wants to continue to be friends and keeps trying to text and approach me about it.  I just don\u2019t see how we can be friends, my feelings for her haven\u2019t changed and remaining in the friendship would just be painful.  \n\nLately I\u2019ve been ignoring her texts and avoiding her. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so the user is asking if the person who wrote the \"AITA\" post is in the wrong for ghosting their friend after being rejected. Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, the situation: The user had a friend they liked for a while. They confessed their feelings, and the friend was nice but didn't reciprocate. The user now wants to avoid the friend because it's painful and has been ghosting them. The friend wants to stay in touch, but the user can't see how they can be friends anymore.\n\nHmm, the user is ghosting, which is cutting off communication without explanation. Ghosting is generally seen as inconsiderate because it leaves the other person confused or hurt. The friend tried to reach out, and the user ignored them. That seems harsh.\n\nBut the user's reasoning is that being around the friend is painful because their feelings haven't changed. They don't want to pretend to be friends if they can't move past their feelings. That makes sense emotionally. It's hard to maintain a friendship when one person is still in love with the other.\n\nOn the other hand, the friend didn't ask for a relationship and might feel blindsided by the sudden ghosting. Even though they were rejected, they want to continue the friendship. The user's avoidance might be hurting the friend, even if the user isn't intentionally trying to harm them.\n\nIs the user in the wrong? Well, ghosting is usually frowned upon because it's a lack of communication. Instead of ghosting, the user could have honestly explained that they need space or can't move past their feelings, giving the friend a chance to understand and maybe adjust. Ghosting makes it harder for the friend to process the situation.\n\nHowever, the user's emotional state is valid. It's tough to stay friends after a one-sided crush. The user isn't being malicious; they're just struggling with their emotions. But the method they chose to handle it (ghosting) is the problem. They should have had a conversation instead of cutting off contact abruptly.\n\nSo, the user isn't necessarily \"in the wrong\" in terms of their feelings, but their actions (ghosting) are considered wrong because they didn't communicate openly. The right approach would be to explain their feelings and set boundaries without disappearing.\n"
