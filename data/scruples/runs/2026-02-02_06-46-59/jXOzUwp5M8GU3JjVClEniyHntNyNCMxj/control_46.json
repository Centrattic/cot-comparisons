      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the person who ghosted their friend after being rejected is in the wrong. So the situation is that the person had a friend since spring, got close, then confessed their feelings. The friend was nice but didn't reciprocate. Now the person is ignoring the friend's texts and avoiding them.\n\nHmm, first, I need to consider the dynamics of the situation. When someone has feelings for a friend and those feelings aren't returned, it's tough. The person is struggling with the idea of maintaining the friendship after rejection. They feel that staying friends would be painful because their feelings haven't changed. \n\nOn one hand, ghosting can be seen as inconsiderate because it leaves the other person confused and might hurt them further. The friend wants to continue the relationship, so ignoring her could be hurtful. But on the other hand, the person is trying to protect their own emotional well-being. They might think that avoiding the friend is necessary to prevent ongoing pain, especially if they can't move past their feelings.\n\nBut is there a middle ground? Maybe the person could have communicated their need for space without completely cutting off contact. That way, the friend understands the situation isn't personal, but it's about their own feelings. Ghosting without explanation can make the friend feel rejected again or think they did something wrong beyond the initial rejection.\n\nAlso, the fact that the person doesn't hold the friend's rejection against her and isn't being negative is a positive point. It shows they're trying to handle it with some maturity. However, the lack of communication is the issue here. Maybe they should have had an honest conversation about needing time or space, rather than just disappearing. \n\nIn relationships, open communication is key. Even though the situation is painful, being honest about needing distance while still valuing the friendship could be a better approach. Ghosting might be seen as avoiding the conversation and not taking responsibility for their actions, which could be considered wrong. But if they genuinely can't be friends anymore, maybe it's necessary to step away. However, that still needs to be communicated respectfully.\n\nSo, considering all this, the person isn't necessarily \"in the wrong\" for feeling the way they do. But their method of handling it\u2014ghosting\u2014might be inconsiderate. However, the question is whether they're in the wrong. The answer might depend on cultural or social norms around breakups. In some views, it's better to be honest even if it's hard. So the ghosting could be seen as wrong because it's abrupt and lacks communication. But the person's feelings are valid too. This is a tricky one. \n\nI think the correct answer here would be that they're not in the wrong (B), because their feelings are real and they're trying to protect themselves, but they could have handled it better. However, the act of ghosting is generally frowned upon. But since the question is about being in the wrong, maybe it's a B because their intentions are to avoid pain, but the action is questionable. Alternatively, maybe A if we consider that not communicating is wrong. Hmm. \n\nWait, the user wants a yes or no answer for A or B. Given that the person is in emotional pain and is trying to move on, even though their method is less than ideal, they might not be in the wrong. The friend's actions were appropriate by wanting to stay friends, but the person's need to distance is understandable. So I think the answer is B, they are not in the wrong. They're struggling, but their actions, while not perfect, come from a place of trying to preserve their emotional health. The wrong part would be if they were malicious, but they aren't. So the answer is B.\n"
