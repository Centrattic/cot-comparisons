We got along really well and had a lot of the same interests.  I caught feelings for her a while ago, but was too chicken shit to do anything about it now.  I confessed how I felt to her and asked her out.  She was really nice about it, but didn\u2019t feel the same way.  \n\nI don\u2019t hold it against her or think negatively of her, but it\u2019s kind of like a Pandora\u2019s box type situation.  There\u2019s no going back to the way things were before.  She wants to continue to be friends and keeps trying to text and approach me about it.  I just don\u2019t see how we can be friends, my feelings for her haven\u2019t changed and remaining in the friendship would just be painful.  \n\nLately I\u2019ve been ignoring her texts and avoiding her. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for ghosting their friend after being turned down. The situation is that the friend didn't feel the same way, and the author can't go back to being just friends, so they started ignoring her.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The author had feelings, confessed, and was rejected. That's tough. They tried to stay friends, but it's causing them pain. Ghosting is usually seen as inconsiderate, but maybe the author is protecting their feelings. However, it's important to think about the friend's perspective too. She tried to maintain the friendship, so being ghosted could hurt her even more.\n\nBut wait, the author says they don't hold it against her and don't think negatively. They just can't handle the situation. Maybe they should have communicated their feelings instead of ghosting. Ghosting is often considered rude because it leaves the other person confused. Even if it's hard, having an honest conversation about why they need space might be better than just cutting off contact without explanation.\n\nSo, while the author's feelings are valid, the action of ghosting without communication might be the wrong approach. It's possible they're not in the wrong entirely, but maybe they could have handled it more considerately. However, the question is whether they're in the wrong. If we assume that ghosting is generally bad, then A (yes) would be the answer. But if we take into account the emotional difficulty and the fact that they were honest about their feelings beforehand, maybe B (no) is possible.\n\nHmm. The key points are: the author was rejected, tried to stay friends, but found it painful. They didn't communicate their decision to take a break but just ignored texts. Ghosting is usually considered inconsiderate. So maybe the answer is A, they are in the wrong because they didn't communicate their reasons. However, some might argue it's understandable given the pain. But the act of ghosting is typically frowned upon regardless of reasons. So leaning towards A.\n"
