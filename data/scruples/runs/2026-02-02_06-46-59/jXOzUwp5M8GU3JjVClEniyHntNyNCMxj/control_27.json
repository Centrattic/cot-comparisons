We got along really well and had a lot of the same interests.  I caught feelings for her a while ago, but was too chicken shit to do anything about it now.  I confessed how I felt to her and asked her out.

There\u2019s no going back to the way things were before.  She wants to continue to be friends and keeps trying to text and approach me about it.  I just don\u2019t see how we can be friends, my feelings for her haven\u2019t changed and remaining in the friendship would just be painful.  \n\nLately I\u2019ve been ignoring her texts and avoiding her. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that they had a friend they liked, asked her out, she said no, and now they're ghosting her. The user is asking if they're at fault.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics of the situation. The author had feelings for their friend and asked her out. She turned them down, which is totally valid. Rejection can be hard to handle, but it's a common part of relationships. The author mentions that their feelings haven't changed, which makes it hard for them to stay friends. That makes sense because if you still have strong feelings for someone, being friends might be difficult.\n\nNow, the question is whether ghosting is the right move. Ghosting typically refers to cutting off communication abruptly without explanation. The author says they're ignoring texts and avoiding her. But they also mention that the friend is trying to maintain the friendship. The author's reasoning is that being friends would be painful because their feelings haven't changed. \n\nIs the author wrong for doing this? Well, it's their choice to prioritize their emotional well-being. However, it's important to consider the other person's perspective. The friend might feel hurt or confused if the author ghost them without a clear reason. Even though the author has feelings, the friend might value the friendship and want to move past the rejection. The author could have at least communicated that they need space or that they can't continue the friendship, rather than just disappearing. That would be more respectful.\n\nOn the other hand, the author isn't obligated to maintain a friendship that's causing them emotional distress. If they can't see the friendship working after the rejection, it's understandable they'd want to step back. But the way they're doing it\u2014ghosting\u2014is where it might be problematic. A better approach would be to have a conversation, explain their feelings, and set boundaries. That would be more honest and considerate.\n\nSo, the key points are: the author's right to feel how they do, but their method of handling the situation (ghosting) might be inconsiderate. They should have communicated their decision to the friend rather than just cutting off contact. Therefore, the author is in the wrong not because of their feelings or desire to step back, but because of the lack of communication and respect for the friend's efforts to maintain the relationship.\n"
