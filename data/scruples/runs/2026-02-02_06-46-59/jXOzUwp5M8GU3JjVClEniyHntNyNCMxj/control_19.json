We got along really well and had a lot of the same interests.  I caught feelings for her a while ago, but was too chicken shit to do anything about it now.  I confessed how I felt to her and asked her out.  She was really nice about it, but didn\u2019t feel the same way.  \n\nI don\u2019t hold it against her or think negatively of her, but it\u2019s kind of like a Pandora\u2019s box type situation.  There\u2019s no going back to the way things were before.  She wants to continue to be friends and keeps trying to text and approach me about it.  I just don\u2019t see how we can be friends, my feelings for her haven\u2019t changed and remaining in the friendship would just be painful.  \n\nLately I\u2019ve been ignoring her texts and avoiding her. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong. The scenario is that they had a friend they liked, asked her out, she said no, and now they're ghosting her.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the key points. The author had a friend since spring, developed feelings, confessed them, and got rejected. The friend wants to stay friends, but the author can't handle it and is avoiding her. The user is asking if this makes the author the asshole.\n\nSo, the question is about whether ghosting is justified in this situation. From a social standpoint, when someone is rejected, it's common to feel hurt and find it hard to maintain the same friendship. However, cutting off suddenly without communication can be seen as inconsiderate, even if the person is hurt. \n\nBut here, the author says they don't hold it against her and aren't being negative, but just can't be friends anymore. Ghosting is usually considered rude because it leaves the other person confused and without closure. However, if the author is truly struggling emotionally, maybe their actions are a coping mechanism.\n\nBut is that a valid excuse? The friend is trying to maintain the friendship, which shows she's considerate. The author's approach of ignoring texts and avoiding might be hurtful to her. Maybe the right thing would be to have an honest conversation about why the friendship is difficult, even if they can't continue it. \n\nSo, the author is in a tough spot emotionally, but choosing to ghost without explanation could be seen as the wrong move. It's about empathy and considering the other person's feelings. Even if the author is hurting, the friend deserves some communication rather than being ghosted. Therefore, the author might be in the wrong for not handling it more openly instead of cutting off suddenly.\n"
