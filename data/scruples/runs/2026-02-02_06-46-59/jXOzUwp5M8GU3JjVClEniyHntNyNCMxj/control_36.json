      "text": "\nOkay, let me try to figure this out. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for ghosting their friend after being turned down. The situation is that they had a good friendship since spring, they had mutual interests, and they recently confessed their feelings. The friend was nice but didn't reciprocate, and now the author is avoiding her texts and hanging out.\n\nHmm, the author is struggling with the emotional pain of the rejection. They mention that their feelings haven't changed and staying friends would be painful. Ghosting means they're not responding at all. The friend wants to continue the friendship, but the author can't see how that's possible. \n\nI need to consider if ghosting is the right approach here. In relationships, whether romantic or platonic, communication is key. The author is avoiding the friend, which might make the friend feel confused or hurt. Even though the author is hurt, cutting off suddenly without explanation can be seen as inconsiderate. The friend didn't do anything wrong, just rejected their advances. \n\nBut the author also says they don't hold it against her and don't think negatively. So maybe they just need space. However, ghosting isn't the best way to handle it. It's better to explain the situation, even if they don't want to be friends anymore. That way, both parties can understand and move on. \n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? They might not be \"wrong\" in feeling the way they do, but the act of ghosting without communication is likely the issue. Not responding and avoiding could be hurtful. The right approach would be to tell the friend they need space, even if they can't continue the friendship. Therefore, the answer might be A (yes, in the wrong) because they're not communicating and are ghosting. But maybe B (not in the wrong) if it's about personal feelings and needing time to heal. \n\nWait, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. Ghosting is often frowned upon because it leaves the other person in the dark. The friend is trying to reach out and maintain friendship, but the author isn't responding. Even if the author can't handle being friends anymore, they should at least let the friend know. So, the author is inconsiderate in their approach. Hence, answer A.\n"
