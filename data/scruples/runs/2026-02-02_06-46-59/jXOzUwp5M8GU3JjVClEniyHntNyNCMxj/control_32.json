We got along really well and had a lot of the same interests.  I caught feelings for her a while ago, but was too chicken shit to do anything about it now.

There\u2019s no going back to the way things were before.  She wants to continue to be friends and keeps trying to text and approach me about it.  I just don\u2019t see how we can be friends, my feelings for her haven\u2019t changed and remaining in the friendship would just be painful.  \n\nLately I\u2019ve been ignoring her texts and avoiding her. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user wants to know if the author is in the wrong for ghosting their friend after being rejected. The situation is that they had a good friendship since spring, shared interests, and the author developed feelings but was too scared to act. They confessed, the friend was nice but not interested. The friend still wants to be friends, but the author is avoiding her.\n\nHmm, so the question is whether the author is wrong. First, I need to consider the dynamics here. The author had a friendship, then had a crush, asked the friend out, and got rejected. The friend is trying to maintain the friendship, but the author can't handle it anymore and is ghosting them.\n\nIn terms of right or wrong, it's a bit tricky. Ghosting is generally seen as inconsiderate because it leaves the other person hanging. But the author's reasons are that their feelings haven't changed and staying friends would be painful. On the other hand, the friend is still interested in maintaining the relationship. So, the author is choosing to cut off communication to avoid emotional pain, but that might be unfair. Maybe they should have communicated that they need space or that they can't be friends anymore, instead of just disappearing. \n\nAnother angle: the author might be protecting themselves from further hurt, but the friend is left confused. Ghosting isn't the healthiest response, but it's understandable given the emotional state. However, the friend tried to be kind and wants to continue the friendship, which the author is ignoring. Is the author wrong for not wanting to be friends but not explaining? Probably. Being honest about needing time or not wanting to continue the friendship is better than ghosting. So maybe the answer is A (Yes, the author is in the wrong), but I need to make sure. The user is asking for a quick answer, so I should stick to the facts here. The key points are the rejection, the friend's attempts to stay in touch, and the author's avoidance. Ghosting is considered rude, but the author's emotional struggle is a factor. Still, the better approach would be to communicate clearly. So, the author is in the wrong for not being upfront.\n"
