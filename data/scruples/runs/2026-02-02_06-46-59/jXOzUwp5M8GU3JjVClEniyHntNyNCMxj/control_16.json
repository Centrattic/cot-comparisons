      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who ghosted their friend after being rejected is in the wrong. The situation is that the friend turned them down, and now they're avoiding her.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics of the friendship. They were close friends with shared interests before the confession. When one person has feelings and the other doesn't, it's a tough spot. The user says they don't hold it against her but can't see going back to how things were. That makes sense emotionally; it's hard to stay friends when there's unresolved feelings. \n\nGhosting is usually seen as being inconsiderate, but the context here is important. The person was honest about their feelings, got rejected, and is now struggling to maintain the friendship. They mention that staying friends is painful because their feelings haven't changed. So maybe they're not ghosting maliciously but because they can't handle the friendship anymore. \n\nIs it wrong to avoid someone if you can't be friends anymore? It depends on communication. If they had a conversation explaining their need for space, that's better. But ghosting without explanation can hurt the other person, even if they don't feel the same. The friend is trying to reach out, so ignoring her might leave her confused or hurt, even if she didn't reciprocate the feelings. \n\nSo, the user isn't in the wrong for feeling conflicted, but maybe they should have communicated better. Ghosting can be seen as wrong because it's abrupt and doesn't give closure. However, the emotional state of the person matters. If they genuinely can't be friends and aren't responding out of spite, it's a bit more nuanced. \n\nIn terms of right or wrong, it's a judgment call. The user's actions are a result of emotional pain, but the method of handling it (ghosting) could be considered inconsiderate. But since they don't have ill will and the situation is complex, maybe they aren't entirely in the wrong. The answer might lean towards B (No) because they're dealing with genuine emotional conflict, but there's a case for A if ghosting is seen as hurtful regardless. However, the key point is that they're not acting out of malice, so B might be the better choice.\n"
