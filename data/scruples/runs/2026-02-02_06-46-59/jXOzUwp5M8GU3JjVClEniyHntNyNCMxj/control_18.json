We got along really well and had a lot of the same interests.  I caught feelings for her a while ago, but was too chicken shit to do anything about it now.  I confessed how I felt to her and asked her out.

There\u2019s no going back to the way things were before.  She wants to continue to be friends and keeps trying to text and approach me about it.  I just don\u2019t see how we can be friends, my feelings for her haven\u2019t changed and remaining in the friendship would just be painful.  \n\nLately I\u2019ve been ignoring her texts and avoiding her. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user wants to know if the author is in the wrong for ghosting a friend after being rejected. The situation is that they've been friends since spring, had mutual interests, confessed their feelings, and got turned down. Now they're avoiding the friend.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethics of ghosting. Ghosting is generally considered rude because you cut off communication without an explanation. The friend in this case tried to stay in touch and continue the friendship, but the author is ignoring her. \n\nBut the author's reasoning is that being friends now is painful because their feelings haven't changed. So, they might be struggling with emotional discomfort. However, the friend is making an effort, and the author isn't responding. That could be seen as not respecting the friend's attempt to maintain a relationship, even if it's platonic now.\n\nOn the other hand, if the author can't handle the friendship anymore and it's causing them distress, maybe they have a valid reason. But ghosting is usually not the best approach because it leaves the other person confused and hurt. The author could have been honest about needing space, which would be more respectful.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? Well, they didn't act out of malice but because of their feelings. However, ignoring someone's attempts to communicate is still wrong regardless of the reason. There's a better way to handle this, like explaining their need for distance without being abrupt. Therefore, the answer might be A (yes, in the wrong), but I should check if there's nuance. The friend was nice in rejecting them, but the author's behavior is now causing pain on the other end. They should have communicated their feelings instead of ghosting. So, A makes sense here.\n"
