He doesn't pay any bills, he lives here for free. He doesn't pay for groceries. He doesn't have a car, I take us everywhere. \n\nSometimes he's loud, sometimes he's dirty and he smells, but I put up with it all because he's my best friend. \n\nNow, on to the question, everytime I eat he wants a portion of my meal. It's not like he doesn't have food either, I always make sure there's enough food for both of us - albeit not always the same type of food. He doesn't outrightly say anything, he usually just stares at me until either I give in or don't. Usually I do. \n\n[Pic for context.](https://i.imgur.com/8QJkJle.jpg)\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

The scenario is about a best friend living with them for free, not paying bills or groceries, and expecting to share the author's food. The author sometimes gives in to the friend's silent pressure but is asking if they're at fault.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The friend doesn't pay for anything, so that's a significant factor. The author is covering all expenses, including groceries, but the friend isn't contributing. The friend then wants a portion of the author's meals, using a stare to pressure them. The author is trying to maintain the friendship despite the friend's other issues like being loud and messy.\n\nThe main question is whether the author is in the wrong for not sharing their food. From a fairness standpoint, if the friend isn't paying for groceries, they might not have the same right to expect food from the author. The author is already making sure there's enough food for both, even if not the same type. The friend's use of passive-aggressive tactics (staring) to get food could be seen as manipulative.\n\nHowever, the author is in a friendship where they've chosen to be accommodating in many ways. The friend's behavior might be a result of their circumstances, but that doesn't necessarily make the author's choice to not share wrong. Boundaries are important, even in friendships. The author isn't obligated to share their personal meal if they haven't agreed to that arrangement. \n\nI should also consider that the friend isn't outright asking, which could make the author feel guilty. But the author isn't at fault for setting boundaries. The friend's lack of contribution to the household responsibilities might mean they should be more independent. The author is maintaining the friendship despite the friend's shortcomings, but they aren't required to share their own meals. So the answer would lean towards B, the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
