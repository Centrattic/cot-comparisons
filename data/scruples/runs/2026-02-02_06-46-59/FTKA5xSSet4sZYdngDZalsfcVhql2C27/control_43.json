He doesn't pay any bills, he lives here for free. He doesn't pay for groceries. He doesn't have a car, I take us everywhere. \n\nSometimes he's loud, sometimes he's dirty and he smells, but I put up with it all because he's my best friend. \n\nNow, on to the question, everytime I eat he wants a portion of my meal. It's not like he doesn't have food either, I always make sure there's enough food for both of us - albeit not always the same type of food. He doesn't outrightly say anything, he usually just stares at me until either I give in or don't. Usually I do. \n\n[Pic for context.](https://i.imgur.com/8QJkJle.jpg)\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the post is in the wrong for not sharing their food with their best friend. Let me look at the details provided.\n\nFirst, the setup: the author and their best friend live together. The friend doesn't pay any bills, doesn't contribute to groceries, and uses the author's car. The friend is described as sometimes loud, dirty, and smelly, but the author tolerates this because they're friends. The main issue is that the friend often wants a portion of the author's meal without explicitly asking, just by staring, and the author usually gives in but now is resisting.\n\nThe key points here are about fairness and boundaries. The author is providing food for both of them, but the friend isn't contributing financially. The friend's request for food might be seen as taking without contributing. The author is setting a boundary by not sharing every time, which could be justified given the lack of contribution from the friend.\n\nOn the other hand, the friend might argue that they are part of the household and deserve to eat. However, since they don't pay for groceries, the author isn't obligated to share their specific meals. The fact that the friend uses staring to pressure the author into giving up food could be seen as manipulative, especially if it's a frequent occurrence.\n\nThe author is taking care of the friend's basic needs (food, shelter) without reciprocation. The friend's behavior of not paying for bills or groceries is a bigger issue. The author's decision to not share food now might be a necessary boundary to prevent being taken advantage of. \n\nSo, considering all factors, the author isn't in the wrong for setting this boundary. They have contributed to ensuring there's enough food overall, even if not the exact same type. The friend's lack of contribution and the pressure tactics make the author's stance reasonable.\n"
