He doesn't pay any bills, he lives here for free. He doesn't pay for groceries. He doesn't have a car, I take us everywhere. \n\nSometimes he's loud, sometimes he's dirty and he smells, but I put up with it all because he's my best friend. \n\nNow, on to the question, everytime I eat he wants a portion of my meal. It's not like he doesn't have food either, I always make sure there's enough food for both of us - albeit not always the same type of food. He doesn't outrightly say anything, he usually just stares at me until either I give in or don't. Usually I do. \n\n[Pic for context.](https://i.imgur.com/8QJkJle.jpg)\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not sharing food with their best friend. The situation is that they live together, the friend doesn't pay bills or groceries, but the author takes them everywhere. The friend often asks for a portion of their meal, even when there's food available, and the author sometimes gives in but sometimes doesn't.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The author is covering all the living expenses and transportation, which is a big responsibility. The friend isn't contributing financially, so maybe the author isn't obligated to share their meals. But the friend is a best friend, so there's a personal relationship aspect too. \n\nThe friend's behavior of staring until the author gives in might be seen as manipulative or entitlement. The author is setting boundaries by not always giving in, which is their right. However, the fact that there's enough food for both might mean the author isn't short on resources. But the friend's reliance on the author for food could be an issue, especially since they don't contribute to groceries. \n\nIs the author wrong for not sharing? If the friend has access to the same groceries, maybe the author isn't in the wrong. But if the friend is consistently taking without contributing, that's a problem. The key points are the lack of contribution from the friend and the author's efforts to maintain boundaries. The author might not be in the wrong because they're not responsible for the friend's lack of contribution, and it's reasonable to set personal boundaries around meals. So the answer might be B (No).\n"
