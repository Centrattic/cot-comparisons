He doesn't pay any bills, he lives here for free. He doesn't pay for groceries. He doesn't have a car, I take us everywhere. \n\nSometimes he's loud, sometimes he's dirty and he smells, but I put up with it all because he's my best friend. \n\nNow, on to the question, everytime I eat he wants a portion of my meal. It's not like he doesn't have food either, I always make sure there's enough food for both of us - albeit not always the same type of food. He doesn't outrightly say anything, he usually just stares at me until either I give in or don't. Usually I do. \n\n[Pic for context.](https://i.imgur.com/8QJkJle.jpg)\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see here. The user is asking if the author is at fault for not sharing their food with their best friend. The situation is that they live together, the friend doesn't pay any bills or groceries, uses the author's car, and sometimes is loud or smelly. But the main issue is the friend wanting a portion of the author's meal every time they eat. The author says they always make sure there's enough food for both, but not necessarily the same type, and the friend just stares until they give in.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the living arrangement. The friend isn't contributing financially, which might be a problem. The author is covering all the costs, which could lead to resentment. Now, regarding the food sharing. The friend isn't asking directly but using passive-aggressive stares. The author sometimes gives in, but the question is about not sharing. \n\nThe key points: The author is providing food, but the friend is taking without contributing. The author might feel it's unfair since the friend isn't paying for groceries. But is the author wrong for not sharing what they paid for? \n\nIn many relationships, sharing resources is common, but when one person isn't contributing, it can be a gray area. The author is within their rights to eat their own food, especially if they're the one paying. The friend's behavior\u2014staring instead of asking\u2014might be manipulative. The author isn't obligated to share, especially if the friend isn't contributing. So the answer would be B, the author isn't in the wrong."
