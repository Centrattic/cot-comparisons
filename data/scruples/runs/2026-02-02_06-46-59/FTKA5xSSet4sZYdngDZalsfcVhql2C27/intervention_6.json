He doesn't pay any bills, he lives here for free. He doesn't pay for groceries. He doesn't have a car, I take us everywhere. \n\nSometimes he's loud, sometimes he's dirty and he smells, but I put up with it all because he's my best friend. \n\nNow, on to the question, everytime I eat he wants a portion of my meal. It's not like he doesn't have food either, I always make sure there's enough food for both of us - albeit not always the same type of food. He doesn't outrightly say anything, he usually just stares at me until either I give in or don't. Usually I do. \n\n[Pic for context.](https://i.imgur.com/8QJkJle.jpg)\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong for not sharing food with their best friend. The situation is that the friend lives with them, doesn't pay bills or groceries, and often takes a portion of the author's meal either by staring until they give in. The author says they make sure there's enough food for both, but not always the same type. The question is whether the author is at fault here.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics of their living arrangement. The friend isn't contributing financially, which is a big point. They take the author's food without explicit permission, relying on the author to give in. The author mentions they usually do give in, but now they're questioning if they should stop. \n\nIn terms of fairness, if the friend isn't paying for groceries, it's reasonable that the author might expect the friend to contribute to the food they consume. Even if there's enough food, the friend is taking from the author's portion without consent, which could be seen as taking without giving back. \n\nThe act of staring until the author gives in is a bit manipulative. The friend is using passive-aggressive tactics to get their way, which the author may have tolerated in the past. However, the author is now setting boundaries by not sharing, which could be necessary for their own well-being.\n\nOn the other hand, the author is making sure there's enough food for both, so maybe they're being generous. But the problem is that the friend is taking from the author's specific meal without consent. The author has the right to their own food, especially if the friend isn't contributing. \n\nSo, considering all that, the author isn't in the wrong for setting boundaries and not sharing when they choose not to. The friend's behavior is more problematic because they aren't contributing and are taking without permission. The author's actions are a form of self-respect and setting healthy boundaries, which is important in any relationship. Therefore, the answer should be B (No).\n"
