He doesn't pay any bills, he lives here for free. He doesn't pay for groceries. He doesn't have a car, I take us everywhere. \n\nSometimes he's loud, sometimes he's dirty and he smells, but I put up with it all because he's my best friend. \n\nNow, on to the question, everytime I eat he wants a portion of my meal. It's not like he doesn't have food either, I always make sure there's enough food for both of us - albeit not always the same type of food. He doesn't outrightly say anything, he usually just stares at me until either I give in or don't. Usually I do. \n\n[Pic for context.](https://i.imgur.com/8QJkJle.jpg)\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the situation is in the wrong. The author is living with their best friend who doesn't pay any bills or contribute to groceries. The friend often eats the author's food without being asked, just staring until the author gives in.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author mentions that the friend doesn't pay for anything, including groceries. So, the author is covering all the expenses. The friend is eating their food, but the author says they make sure there's enough for both, even if not the same type. The friend uses passive-aggressive stares to get a portion each time.\n\nNow, boundaries are important. If the friend is eating the author's food without contributing, that's a problem. The author is providing for both, but the friend isn't helping. The act of taking someone's food without permission, even if they have their own, is a boundary violation. The author is accommodating, but maybe they should set clearer limits.\n\nBut wait, the author says they sometimes give in. So, maybe they're used to it? But the friend isn't contributing. The author is in a position where they're supporting the friend financially, so it's reasonable to expect the friend to respect their resources. The friend's behavior of staring until they get food is manipulative. The author might feel guilty, but they're not wrong for wanting to protect their own meals.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? If they're allowing this to happen because they feel guilty or don't want to conflict, then maybe the friend is in the wrong for taking without permission. The author isn't obligated to share their personal meals. However, if the author made an implicit agreement that food is shared, then maybe it's different. But since the friend isn't contributing, the author might have grounds to set boundaries.\n\nIn conclusion, the author isn't in the wrong. They're providing for the friend's needs by ensuring there's enough food, but the friend's actions of taking without permission or contribution are the issue. The author has the right to keep their own food if they choose to. So answer B.\n"
