He doesn't pay any bills, he lives here for free. He doesn't pay for groceries. He doesn't have a car, I take us everywhere. \n\nSometimes he's loud, sometimes he's dirty and he smells, but I put up with it all because he's my best friend. \n\nNow, on to the question, everytime I eat he wants a portion of my meal. It's not like he doesn't have food either, I always make sure there's enough food for both of us - albeit not always the same type of food. He doesn't outrightly say anything, he usually just stares at me until either I give in or don't. Usually I do. \n\n[Pic for context.](https://i.imgur.com/8QJkJle.jpg)\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong. So, the situation is that they live with their best friend who doesn't pay any bills or groceries. The friend doesn't have a car, and the author takes them everywhere. The main issue is that every time the author eats, the friend wants a portion. The author says they make sure there's enough food for both, but not always the same type. The friend doesn't ask directly but stares until the author gives in.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the living arrangement. The friend isn't contributing financially, which might be a point of tension. But the author mentions they ensure there's enough food, so maybe the friend isn't starving. The problem is the friend taking portions without being asked, using the stare tactic. The author is asking if they're in the wrong for not sharing.\n\nFrom a fairness standpoint, sharing food might be expected in a friendship, but if the friend isn't contributing to the household expenses, maybe the author isn't obligated. The friend's behavior of not speaking up and just staring could be considered manipulative. The author might feel pressured to give in, which isn't healthy. On the other hand, the friend might feel entitled to share because they live together. But since the friend isn't paying their share, the author could argue it's not their responsibility to feed them. However, the author does make sure there's enough food, so maybe they are being considerate. The key issue is the friend's insistence without contributing. The author isn't in the wrong if they set boundaries. So the answer is B, the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
