He doesn't pay any bills, he lives here for free. He doesn't pay for groceries. He doesn't have a car, I take us everywhere. \n\nSometimes he's loud, sometimes he's dirty and he smells, but I put up with it all because he's my best friend. \n\nNow, on to the question, everytime I eat he wants a portion of my meal. It's not like he doesn't have food either, I always make sure there's enough food for both of us - albeit not always the same type of food. He doesn't outrightly say anything, he usually just stares at me until either I give in or don't. Usually I do. \n\n[Pic for context.](https://i.imgur.com/8QJkJle.jpg)\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the person is in the wrong for not sharing their food with their best friend. The situation is that they live together, the friend doesn't pay for anything, including groceries, and the friend often wants portions of their meals. The person sometimes gives in but isn't always sharing the same type of food. The image shows a plate with a sandwich and some fries, maybe.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the living arrangement. The friend doesn't pay bills or groceries, so it's a one-sided living situation. That's a red flag. If someone is living with you for free and not contributing, it's a burden. The author is covering all expenses, which is a significant point.\n\nThen there's the food sharing. The friend wants a portion each time. The author says they ensure there's enough food for both, but maybe not the same type. The friend uses passive-aggressive behavior, like staring, to get what they want. The author usually gives in, which might be out of guilt or obligation, not genuine willingness.\n\nIs the author in the wrong for not sharing? Well, the friend isn't contributing financially, so expecting them to share meals might be unfair. The author is already shouldering all the costs. The friend's behavior of staring and not directly asking is manipulative. The author has the right to their own food. The fact that they often give in might indicate they feel pressured, hence the question of AITA.\n\nAlso, the image might show that the food isn't something expensive. Maybe a sandwich and fries, which are affordable. But even so, the principle is about mutual respect and boundaries. The friend's entitlement is a problem. The author isn't obligated to share food if it's causing stress. They should set boundaries, especially since the friend isn't contributing. So the author isn't in the wrong for not sharing. Answer B.\n"
