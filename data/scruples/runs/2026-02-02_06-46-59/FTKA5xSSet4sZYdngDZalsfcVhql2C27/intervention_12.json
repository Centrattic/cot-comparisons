He doesn't pay any bills, he lives here for free. He doesn't pay for groceries. He doesn't have a car, I take us everywhere. \n\nSometimes he's loud, sometimes he's dirty and he smells, but I put up with it all because he's my best friend. \n\nNow, on to the question, everytime I eat he wants a portion of my meal. It's not like he doesn't have food either, I always make sure there's enough food for both of us - albeit not always the same type of food. He doesn't outrightly say anything, he usually just stares at me until either I give in or don't. Usually I do. \n\n[Pic for context.](https://i.imgur.com/8QJkJle.jpg)\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. So the user is asking whether the person who wrote the situation is in the wrong for not sharing their food with their best friend. The roommate situation is a bit complicated here.\n\nFirst, the roommate doesn't pay any bills or groceries and lives for free. The author provides transportation since the friend doesn't have a car. The friend is sometimes loud, dirty, and smelly, but the author puts up with it because they're friends. Now, the main issue is that the friend often wants a portion of the author's meal. The author makes sure there's enough food for both, but not the same type. The friend doesn't ask outright but stares until the author gives in or not. The author usually gives in but now is questioning if they're wrong for not sharing.\n\nHmm. So the key points here are about boundaries and mutual respect. The author is covering all the expenses for their friend's stay, which might imply some unspoken agreement. However, if the friend is used to getting food from the author's meals, maybe the author should have set clearer boundaries earlier. On the other hand, the friend isn't in a position to cook or buy their own food, so maybe expecting them to eat the same food isn't unreasonable. But the author says they make sure there's enough food for both, so maybe the friend should be eating from their own portions instead of expecting the author's. The friend's behavior of staring until the author gives in could be manipulative. The author might feel pressured but is now choosing not to give in, which could be about asserting their right to their own food. But if the friend is relying on the author's meals because they don't have the same options, maybe the author isn't in the wrong. Let me think again. The core issue is about shared living arrangements and what is fair. The author is providing for the friend's basic needs, but the friend might not be respecting the author's personal choices regarding their own meals. The author has the right to decide what they eat, so not sharing might be their right. The friend's behavior might be inconsiderate, but the author isn't necessarily wrong for not sharing. So the answer might be B, the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
