He doesn't pay any bills, he lives here for free. He doesn't pay for groceries. He doesn't have a car, I take us everywhere. \n\nSometimes he's loud, sometimes he's dirty and he smells, but I put up with it all because he's my best friend. \n\nNow, on to the question, everytime I eat he wants a portion of my meal. It's not like he doesn't have food either, I always make sure there's enough food for both of us - albeit not always the same type of food. He doesn't outrightly say anything, he usually just stares at me until either I give in or don't. Usually I do. \n\n[Pic for context.](https://i.imgur.com/8QJkJle.jpg)\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not sharing their food with their best friend who lives with them. The friend doesn't pay bills or contribute to groceries, but the author makes sure there's enough food for both, even if it's not the same type. The friend wants a portion of the author's meal, and the author sometimes gives in but not always.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author and their friend live together. The friend isn't contributing financially. The author is covering all bills and groceries. The friend is asking to share the author's specific meal, not just take from the available food. The author says there's enough food for both, but maybe not the same type. \n\nSo, the main issue is whether the friend has a right to the author's specific meal. The friend is being loud and dirty, but the author puts up with it. The friend is asking for a portion, not stealing. The author feels pressured by the friend's stares.\n\nIf the author is making enough food for both, but maybe different types, then the friend should have their own food. However, the friend is asking to share the same meal. The author might be in a position where they're not obligated to share their specific meal, especially if they paid for it. On the other hand, since they live together and the friend isn't contributing, there might be an expectation of sharing. But the problem is the friend doesn't pay for groceries, so the author is footing the bill. \n\nThe author might be in the right if they're not required to share their individual portions, especially if the friend has their own food. But if the friend is left without food when the author cooks, that's different. However, the author says there's always enough for both, even if different. So maybe the friend should have their own food, and the author isn't obligated to share. \n\nAlso, the friend's behavior of staring until the author gives in is manipulative. The author might be in the right to set boundaries. So the answer is B, the author is not in the wrong. They don't have to share their specific meal if they're already providing enough food for both. The friend should have their own, and the author can say no without guilt.\n"
