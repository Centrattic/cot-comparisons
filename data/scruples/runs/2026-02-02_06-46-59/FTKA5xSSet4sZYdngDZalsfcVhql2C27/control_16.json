He doesn't pay any bills, he lives here for free. He doesn't pay for groceries. He doesn't have a car, I take us everywhere. \n\nSometimes he's loud, sometimes he's dirty and he smells, but I put up with it all because he's my best friend. \n\nNow, on to the question, everytime I eat he wants a portion of my meal. It's not like he doesn't have food either, I always make sure there's enough food for both of us - albeit not always the same type of food. He doesn't outrightly say anything, he usually just stares at me until either I give in or don't. Usually I do. \n\n[Pic for context.](https://i.imgur.com/8QJkJle.jpg)\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is at fault for not sharing food with their best friend. The situation is that they live together, the friend doesn't pay for anything, including groceries, and the friend often asks for a portion of the author's meal. The author sometimes gives in, but not always, and the friend doesn't pay for any of it.\n\nFirst, the key points here are the living arrangement and financial responsibilities. The friend is living for free and not contributing to bills or groceries. The author is handling all the costs. Then, the friend is requesting food portions, which the author is now resisting. The author is questioning if they're in the wrong for not sharing.\n\nFrom a fairness standpoint, if someone is living with you and not contributing to the household expenses, including groceries, it's reasonable for the person providing to set boundaries. The friend's expectation to receive food might be based on the assumption that they are contributing, which they aren't. The author is covering all costs and might be feeling that their own meals are being taken by the friend without reciprocation. The fact that the friend uses a passive-aggressive tactic (staring until the author gives in) adds to the dynamic where the friend is not respecting the author's autonomy over their food.\n\nHowever, the friendship aspect complicates things. The author is putting up with the friend's other issues (noise, messiness) because of the friendship. But when it comes to food, which is a personal choice, the author is asserting their right to not share. The friend's behavior of not paying for anything and then expecting food might be seen as taking advantage of the situation.\n\nIn terms of right or wrong, it's important to consider mutual respect and contribution. Since the friend isn't contributing financially, the author isn't obligated to share their food. The author's decision to not share is a boundary, which is reasonable given the circumstances. The friend's behavior is more about taking without giving back, which makes the author's stance justified. Therefore, the answer would be that the author is not in the wrong.\n"
