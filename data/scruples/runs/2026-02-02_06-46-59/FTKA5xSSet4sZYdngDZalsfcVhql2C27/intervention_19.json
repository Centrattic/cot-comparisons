He doesn't pay any bills, he lives here for free. He doesn't pay for groceries. He doesn't have a car, I take us everywhere. \n\nSometimes he's loud, sometimes he's dirty and he smells, but I put up with it all because he's my best friend. \n\nNow, on to the question, everytime I eat he wants a portion of my meal. It's not like he doesn't have food either, I always make sure there's enough food for both of us - albeit not always the same type of food. He doesn't outrightly say anything, he usually just stares at me until either I give in or don't. Usually I do. \n\n[Pic for context.](https://i.imgur.com/8QJkJle.jpg)\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not sharing food with their best friend. The situation is that they live together, the friend doesn't pay any bills or groceries, uses the author's car, and sometimes is loud or dirty. The main issue is the friend wanting a portion of the author's meal every time they eat, even though there's enough food for both, just not the same type. The author usually gives in but now is questioning if they're wrong for not sharing.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the living arrangement. The friend isn't contributing financially, which might already be a point of contention. The author is covering all expenses, so maybe they feel entitled to their own meals. On the other hand, the friend is relying on the author for food, which could imply some expectation of sharing. However, the friend isn't asking politely; they just stare until the author gives in. That passive-aggressive behavior is problematic.\n\nThe author mentions making sure there's enough food for both, but different types. So maybe they're not exactly sharing the same meal, but the friend still expects a portion. The author might be justifying not sharing because they've already ensured there's food available. The friend's actions of staring and not outrightly saying anything could be seen as manipulative. \n\nFrom a fairness standpoint, if the friend isn't contributing, expecting them to have their own meals might be reasonable. The author isn't obligated to share their personal meal portions, especially if they're paying for it. However, since they live together and the friend isn't contributing, the author might be overstepping by not sharing if that's part of the living arrangement. But the friend's behavior is also an issue here.\n\nI think the key points are the lack of financial contribution from the friend and the passive-aggressive approach to food sharing. The author might not be in the wrong if they're setting boundaries, especially since they're the one covering all costs. However, the dynamic of their friendship could affect this. If the author has always been the one to give in, maybe they need to communicate their boundaries better. But the question is about whether the author is in the wrong now for not sharing. Given that the friend is not contributing and the author ensures there's food available, the author might not be in the wrong. The friend's unreasonable behavior is more the issue here.\n"
