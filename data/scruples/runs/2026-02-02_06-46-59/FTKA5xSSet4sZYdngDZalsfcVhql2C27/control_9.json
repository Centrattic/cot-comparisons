He doesn't pay any bills, he lives here for free. He doesn't pay for groceries. He doesn't have a car, I take us everywhere. \n\nSometimes he's loud, sometimes he's dirty and he smells, but I put up with it all because he's my best friend. \n\nNow, on to the question, everytime I eat he wants a portion of my meal. It's not like he doesn't have food either, I always make sure there's enough food for both of us - albeit not always the same type of food. He doesn't outrightly say anything, he usually just stares at me until either I give in or don't. Usually I do. \n\n[Pic for context.](https://i.imgur.com/8QJkJle.jpg)\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong for not sharing food with their best friend. The situation is that they live together, the friend doesn't pay bills or groceries, and uses their car. The friend often asks for a portion of their meal, sometimes through staring, and the author gives in but now is questioning if they're in the wrong for not sharing.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the living arrangement. The friend isn't contributing financially, which is a big factor. The author covers all expenses, which might create an imbalance. However, sharing food can be a social norm, but it's not a legal obligation. The friend's behavior of staring until they get food might be seen as manipulative or taking advantage. The author is setting a boundary by not sharing, which could be justified given the lack of financial contribution. On the other hand, they are friends, so there might be expectations of generosity. But since the friend isn't contributing, the author's stance could be reasonable. The key points are mutual respect and fairness. If the author feels pressured and the friend isn't contributing, the author isn't in the wrong for setting that boundary. So the answer is B.\n"
