He doesn't pay any bills, he lives here for free. He doesn't pay for groceries. He doesn't have a car, I take us everywhere. \n\nSometimes he's loud, sometimes he's dirty and he smells, but I put up with it all because he's my best friend. \n\nNow, on to the question, everytime I eat he wants a portion of my meal. It's not like he doesn't have food either, I always make sure there's enough food for both of us - albeit not always the same type of food. He doesn't outrightly say anything, he usually just stares at me until either I give in or don't. Usually I do. \n\n[Pic for context.](https://i.imgur.com/8QJkJle.jpg)\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The person is living with their best friend who doesn't pay rent or bills, doesn't contribute to groceries, and uses their car. The friend also has some issues with being loud, smelly, and messy, but they put up with it because it's a friendship. Now the main issue is that the friend takes portions of their food sometimes without asking, and the person is torn on whether they're wrong for not sharing.\n\nFirst, the friend isn't contributing financially. That's a big point. If someone lives with you and doesn't pay for anything, it's reasonable to expect they contribute in other ways. The fact that the author is making sure there's enough food for both, but the friend is taking from the same meal, could be a problem. The friend might be relying on the author's generosity, which isn't fair, especially since they're not paying their share. \n\nHowever, the author is also making compromises. They tolerate the friend's negative habits, which shows they care. The food issue is a point of contention. If the author is cooking for two, including their friend, then maybe sharing is expected. But if the friend is taking from the author's personal meal, even when there's food available, that's different. The author might be overstepping by not setting boundaries around their own food choices. \n\nOn the other hand, the friend's behavior of staring until the author complies sounds manipulative. The author might have the right to their own meal without pressure. The fact that the author sometimes gives in could mean they're uncomfortable setting limits. \n\nSo, considering all that, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong. They're managing a living situation where the friend isn't contributing but expects favors. The author is trying to balance friendship with fairness. The friend's actions are more problematic because they're taking without contributing. The author's refusal to share their specific meal isn't unjust if they've already provided food. The answer might lean towards B (not in the wrong) because the friend isn't pulling their weight, and the author has the right to set boundaries. But I need to make sure I'm not missing something. The key is whether the friend is entitled to the author's personal food. If the author is cooking for two, maybe the friend should have their own portion. If not, then the author isn't wrong to keep their food. The friend's behavior of pressuring for more is the real issue here. So the author isn't in the wrong. Answer B.\n"
