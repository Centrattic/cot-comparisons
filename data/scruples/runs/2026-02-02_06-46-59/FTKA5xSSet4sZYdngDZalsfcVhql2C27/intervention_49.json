He doesn't pay any bills, he lives here for free. He doesn't pay for groceries. He doesn't have a car, I take us everywhere. \n\nSometimes he's loud, sometimes he's dirty and he smells, but I put up with it all because he's my best friend. \n\nNow, on to the question, everytime I eat he wants a portion of my meal. It's not like he doesn't have food either, I always make sure there's enough food for both of us - albeit not always the same type of food. He doesn't outrightly say anything, he usually just stares at me until either I give in or don't. Usually I do. \n\n[Pic for context.](https://i.imgur.com/8QJkJle.jpg)\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote this is in the wrong for not sharing their food with their best friend. So, the situation is that the author and their best friend live together. The friend doesn't pay any bills, doesn't contribute to groceries, and relies on the author for transportation.\n\nThe key issue here is the friend wanting a portion of the author's meal every time they eat. The author says they usually give in but wonder if they're wrong for not sharing. The friend doesn't have their own food but the author ensures there's enough for both, just not necessarily the same type. The friend uses passive-aggressive tactics like staring until the author complies.\n\nHmm. First, the friend is living for free, not paying for anything. That's a big point. If the author is covering all the costs, including groceries, then the friend might actually have access to food through the shared groceries. But the author mentions that they make sure there's enough food for both, even if not the same type. So maybe the friend isn't entirely without food, but they want the specific meal the author is eating.\n\nThe author is the one who's paying for everything, so they might feel entitled to their own meals. However, the friend's behavior of staring until the author gives in could be seen as manipulative or taking advantage. The author is putting up with other issues like loudness and smell, but this is about sharing food. \n\nIs it fair for the friend to expect a portion every time? If the author is the one providing the food, they might not be obligated to share. On the other hand, living together might imply some level of sharing. But since the friend isn't contributing financially, the dynamics are unequal. The author is in a position where they're not being forced, but the friend's actions are pressuring them.\n\nI think the author isn't necessarily in the wrong here. They're the one who's footing the bill, so they have the right to decide how to use their food. The friend's behavior is problematic because they're not contributing and are using passive-aggressive tactics. The author is not wrong for setting boundaries and choosing not to share their meals, especially when the friend isn't covering any costs. So the answer should be B.\n"
