He doesn't pay any bills, he lives here for free. He doesn't pay for groceries. He doesn't have a car, I take us everywhere. \n\nSometimes he's loud, sometimes he's dirty and he smells, but I put up with it all because he's my best friend. \n\nNow, on to the question, everytime I eat he wants a portion of my meal. It's not like he doesn't have food either, I always make sure there's enough food for both of us - albeit not always the same type of food. He doesn't outrightly say anything, he usually just stares at me until either I give in or don't. Usually I do. \n\n[Pic for context.](https://i.imgur.com/8QJkJle.jpg)\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the post is in the wrong for not sharing food with their best friend. The situation is that the friend lives with them but doesn't pay any bills or groceries, uses their car, and is sometimes loud and messy. The friend wants a portion of their meals every time they eat, but the author is refusing.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author is making sure there's enough food for both, just not the same type. So they might prepare two different meals. The friend doesn't have their own money for food, but the author is covering that. The friend also doesn't have a car, so the author is taking them places. That seems like the author is doing a lot for the friend.\n\nThe friend's request for food is non-verbal, just staring. The author usually gives in but now is refusing. The question is whether the author is wrong for not sharing. \n\nFrom a fairness standpoint, if the friend isn't contributing financially, maybe the author isn't obligated to share their meals. Even though they're friends, sharing food can be a personal choice. The author might feel that they're being taken advantage of, especially since the friend isn't contributing to the household. The friend's behavior of staring until they get what they want could be seen as manipulative.\n\nBut on the other hand, the author mentions they put up with other issues because it's a friendship. Maybe the expectation there is mutual respect, which includes sharing food when it's available. However, the author is setting boundaries now by not giving in every time. \n\nI think the key here is that the friend is not contributing to their own food, but the author is already providing enough for both. If the meals are separate, then the author isn't actually not sharing; they're just preparing different meals. The friend's insistence might be overstepping, but the author is asserting their right to not share their specific meal. \n\nSo, the author isn't in the wrong because they are setting boundaries and the friend isn't contributing. The answer should be B.\n"
