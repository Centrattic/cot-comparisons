He doesn't pay any bills, he lives here for free. He doesn't pay for groceries. He doesn't have a car, I take us everywhere. \n\nSometimes he's loud, sometimes he's dirty and he smells, but I put up with it all because he's my best friend. \n\nNow, on to the question, everytime I eat he wants a portion of my meal. It's not like he doesn't have food either, I always make sure there's enough food for both of us - albeit not always the same type of food. He doesn't outrightly say anything, he usually just stares at me until either I give in or don't. Usually I do. \n\n[Pic for context.](https://i.imgur.com/8QJkJle.jpg)\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person in the scenario is in the wrong for not sharing their food with their best friend. The friend lives with them but doesn't pay bills or groceries. The author mentions that they take the friend everywhere because he doesn't have a car. The issue is that the friend wants a portion of their meal each time, and the author sometimes gives in but is now questioning if they're wrong for not sharing.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the living arrangement. The friend isn't contributing financially, which is a red flag. If someone lives with you and doesn't pay for anything, including groceries, it's reasonable to expect they take care of their own food. The author says they make sure there's enough food for both, but not necessarily the same type. So maybe they buy different meals but ensure there's food available. However, the friend is taking from the author's specific meal, not just the shared groceries. \n\nThe friend's approach\u2014staring until the author complies\u2014seems manipulative. That's a form of passive-aggressive behavior. If the friend has food available, as the author says, then taking from the author's meal when they prepare something specific might be crossing a line. The author might feel that their personal choices are being disregarded. \n\nOn the other hand, living together often involves some compromise. If the author has been sharing before, suddenly stopping could cause tension. But the key here is the friend's lack of contribution. If the author is the one providing everything, including food, then expecting the friend to handle their own meals makes sense. The friend's behavior of taking without asking could be seen as entitlement. \n\nAlso, the photo context might show the meal, but since I can't see it, I'll rely on the text. The author's frustration is valid because they're shouldering all responsibilities. The friend's actions might be a way to get attention or food without contributing. \n\nSo, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong. They're setting boundaries after being taken advantage of. The friend's lack of contribution and the manipulative tactics suggest that the author is justified in not sharing their meal. Therefore, the answer is B (the author is not in the wrong).\n"
