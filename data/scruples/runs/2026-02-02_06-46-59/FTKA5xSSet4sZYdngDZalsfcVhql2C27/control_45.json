He doesn't pay any bills, he lives here for free. He doesn't pay for groceries. He doesn't have a car, I take us everywhere. \n\nSometimes he's loud, sometimes he's dirty and he smells, but I put up with it all because he's my best friend. \n\nNow, on to the question, everytime I eat he wants a portion of my meal. It's not like he doesn't have food either, I always make sure there's enough food for both of us - albeit not always the same type of food. He doesn't outrightly say anything, he usually just stares at me until either I give in or don't. Usually I do. \n\n[Pic for context.](https://i.imgur.com/8QJkJle.jpg)\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is that the author and their best friend live together. The friend doesn't pay any bills or groceries, and the author handles all expenses. The friend also doesn't have a car, so the author takes them everywhere. Despite some issues like noise and cleanliness, the author stays friends with them. Now, the main issue is that whenever the author eats, the friend wants a portion of their meal. The friend doesn't have their own food, but the author makes sure there's enough, though not necessarily the same type. The friend stares until the author gives in, which they usually do. The author is asking if they're in the wrong for not sharing.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The friend is not contributing financially in any way. The author covers all bills, groceries, and transportation. That's a lot to take on, especially for a friend. Now, the friend is asking for food portions, but the author isn't obligated to share their specific meals. The friend might not have their own food, but the author ensures there's enough food. However, the friend's behavior\u2014staring until the author gives in\u2014seems pressuring. \n\nIs sharing food a given in a living arrangement? Well, if someone is living with you and you're making sure there's enough food, maybe they have their own meals. But if the author is cooking a meal they made for themselves, the friend's expectation to get a portion could be seen as taking advantage. The author isn't required to share if they don't want to, especially since the friend isn't contributing. However, the fact that the friend is in a difficult situation (no car, no financial help) might make it a bit more complex. \n\nBut the author is already covering all the costs. It's their home, and they're making sure there's food. The friend's request might be reasonable in a different context, but since the friend isn't contributing anything, maybe it's unfair to expect the author to share their specific meals. The friend's behavior of pressuring the author with stares is a bit manipulative. The author's right to their own meals is important. They might be within their rights to say no. So, the author isn't in the wrong for not sharing, especially since they're already providing enough food for both. The friend's lack of contributions and the pressure to share might mean the author is justified in setting boundaries.\n"
