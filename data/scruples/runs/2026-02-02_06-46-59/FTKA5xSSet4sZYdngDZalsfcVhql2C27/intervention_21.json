He doesn't pay any bills, he lives here for free. He doesn't pay for groceries. He doesn't have a car, I take us everywhere. \n\nSometimes he's loud, sometimes he's dirty and he smells, but I put up with it all because he's my best friend. \n\nNow, on to the question, everytime I eat he wants a portion of my meal. It's not like he doesn't have food either, I always make sure there's enough food for both of us - albeit not always the same type of food. He doesn't outrightly say anything, he usually just stares at me until either I give in or don't. Usually I do. \n\n[Pic for context.](https://i.imgur.com/8QJkJle.jpg)\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for not sharing food with their best friend who lives with them. The friend doesn't pay any bills or contribute to groceries, uses the author's car, and occasionally is loud, dirty, or smelly. The main issue is the friend wanting a portion of the author's meal each time they eat, and the author usually gives in but now is resisting.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author is providing for the friend's basic needs, like food, even though the friend doesn't contribute financially. The friend's behavior of staring until the author gives in could be seen as manipulative or taking advantage. The author is trying to set boundaries by not sharing, which is their right. \n\nHowever, the friend is their best friend, so there might be an expectation of generosity and sharing. But the friend isn't contributing in return, which complicates things. The key here is whether the author is obligated to share their food when they've already ensured there's enough for both. If the author is cooking for themselves and the friend isn't contributing, it's reasonable for the author to decide not to share. The friend's lack of contribution to bills and groceries might justify the author not feeling the need to share every meal. \n\nOn the other hand, friends often share resources, but this is a living arrangement where the friend isn't paying for anything. The author is taking on financial and personal responsibilities. The friend's habit of expecting food without contribution could be a boundary issue. The author's decision to stop sharing might be necessary to maintain their own well-being and fairness. \n\nSo, considering the friend's lack of contribution and the author's efforts to manage the situation while respecting the friendship, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong for setting boundaries. The friend's behavior might be the issue here. Therefore, the answer would be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
