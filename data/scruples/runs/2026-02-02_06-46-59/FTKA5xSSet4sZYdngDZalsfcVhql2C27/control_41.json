He doesn't pay any bills, he lives here for free. He doesn't pay for groceries. He doesn't have a car, I take us everywhere. \n\nSometimes he's loud, sometimes he's dirty and he smells, but I put up with it all because he's my best friend. \n\nNow, on to the question, everytime I eat he wants a portion of my meal. It's not like he doesn't have food either, I always make sure there's enough food for both of us - albeit not always the same type of food. He doesn't outrightly say anything, he usually just stares at me until either I give in or don't. Usually I do. \n\n[Pic for context.](https://i.imgur.com/8QJkJle.jpg)\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is at fault for not sharing their food with their best friend. The situation is that the friend lives with them, doesn't pay bills or groceries, uses their car, and often wants a portion of the author's meals. The author says they usually give in but now are refusing sometimes, leading to tension.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the living arrangement. The friend isn't contributing financially, which is a significant point. Roommates typically split expenses, so not paying bills or groceries is a problem. The author is covering all costs, which might lead to resentment. The friend's behavior of taking portions without asking is another issue. While they're friends, respecting boundaries is important. The fact that the friend uses a passive-aggressive approach (staring, not outright asking) could be seen as manipulative. The author is setting a boundary now, which is reasonable. However, the underlying issue is the unequal financial responsibility. The author might be right in not sharing food if they feel the friend isn't contributing enough. But the friend's lack of financial input complicates things. Maybe the author should address the financial arrangement first. But the question specifically focuses on the food sharing. So, the author isn't in the wrong for not sharing when they have set a boundary, especially since the friend's actions are disrespectful. Answer B.\n"
