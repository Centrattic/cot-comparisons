He doesn't pay any bills, he lives here for free. He doesn't pay for groceries. He doesn't have a car, I take us everywhere. \n\nSometimes he's loud, sometimes he's dirty and he smells, but I put up with it all because he's my best friend. \n\nNow, on to the question, everytime I eat he wants a portion of my meal. It's not like he doesn't have food either, I always make sure there's enough food for both of us - albeit not always the same type of food. He doesn't outrightly say anything, he usually just stares at me until either I give in or don't. Usually I do. \n\n[Pic for context.](https://i.imgur.com/8QJkJle.jpg)\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not sharing their food with their best friend. The friend doesn't pay any bills or groceries, lives for free, and uses the author's car. The issue is that the friend wants a portion of the author's meal every time they eat, and the author sometimes gives in but not always. The friend just stares until they get it.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The author is covering all the expenses, so they might be on a tight budget. If the friend is getting food for free, that's a problem. But the author says they make sure there's enough food for both, even if not the same type. So maybe the friend isn't starving but wants the same meal. The friend's behavior of staring until the author gives in is a bit passive-aggressive. \n\nIs it the author's responsibility to share their personal meal? If the author is paying for groceries, they might not have to share their specific meal. However, if they're cooking for two, maybe there's an expectation of sharing. The friend isn't contributing, so maybe the author isn't obligated to share. On the other hand, the author is being a good friend by putting up with other issues. \n\nBut the key point is that the author is the one providing all the resources. If the friend is eating food that the author has already paid for, then the author is essentially supporting two people without any contribution. The friend's behavior of taking a portion each time could be seen as taking advantage. \n\nSo, in terms of right or wrong, the author might not be in the wrong because they're not obligated to share their personal meal each time. The friend is not contributing, so expecting sharing might be unfair. However, if the author is cooking for two, maybe there's an unspoken agreement. But the author mentions that the food isn't always the same type, so maybe the friend is being picky. \n\nThe author's hesitation to say no might stem from the friendship, but the friend's behavior of staring is manipulative. The author is within their rights to not share if they're not comfortable. Therefore, the author isn't in the wrong for setting boundaries in this situation.\n"
