He doesn't pay any bills, he lives here for free. He doesn't pay for groceries. He doesn't have a car, I take us everywhere. \n\nSometimes he's loud, sometimes he's dirty and he smells, but I put up with it all because he's my best friend. \n\nNow, on to the question, everytime I eat he wants a portion of my meal. It's not like he doesn't have food either, I always make sure there's enough food for both of us - albeit not always the same type of food. He doesn't outrightly say anything, he usually just stares at me until either I give in or don't. Usually I do. \n\n[Pic for context.](https://i.imgur.com/8QJkJle.jpg)\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not sharing their food with their best friend. The scenario involves two friends living together where the friend doesn't pay bills or groceries, relies on the author for transportation, and sometimes is loud or unclean. However, the main issue is the friend wanting a portion of the author's meal each time they eat.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the living arrangement. The friend isn't contributing financially, which might already be a point of tension. The author is covering all expenses, so maybe the friend's expectation to share food adds to that. The author mentions they ensure there's enough food for both, but not necessarily the same type. The friend uses passive aggression (staring) to get the author to share, and the author usually gives in.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author is wrong for not sharing. From a fairness standpoint, if the author is providing enough food for both, maybe the friend should prepare their own meals. However, the friend isn't contributing to the household costs, which complicates things. The author might feel they're being taken advantage of, especially if the friend isn't pulling their weight in other areas. But is it wrong to set boundaries around personal meals?\n\nThe author's responsibility here is to their own well-being. If they're uncomfortable sharing every meal, they have a right to say no. The friend's behavior of staring could be manipulative, which the author is starting to resist. The fact that the author usually gives in might indicate they feel pressured, so standing their ground isn't wrong. The friend's lack of contribution to household expenses might justify the author not feeling obligated to share their personal food. \n\nOn the other hand, some might argue that since they're roommates, sharing resources is expected. But the friend isn't contributing, so the balance is off. The author isn't in the wrong for setting boundaries, especially after accommodating so much else. The answer is likely B (No), the author isn't in the wrong."
