He doesn't pay any bills, he lives here for free. He doesn't pay for groceries. He doesn't have a car, I take us everywhere. \n\nSometimes he's loud, sometimes he's dirty and he smells, but I put up with it all because he's my best friend. \n\nNow, on to the question, everytime I eat he wants a portion of my meal. It's not like he doesn't have food either, I always make sure there's enough food for both of us - albeit not always the same type of food. He doesn't outrightly say anything, he usually just stares at me until either I give in or don't. Usually I do. \n\n[Pic for context.](https://i.imgur.com/8QJkJle.jpg)\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person described is in the wrong for not sharing food with their best friend. The situation is that the friend lives with them, doesn't pay bills or groceries, and uses their car. The friend often asks for a portion of their meal, sometimes just staring until the author gives in. They mention they ensure there's enough food but not always the same type.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics. The friend isn't contributing financially, which might affect the expectation of sharing. The author is providing for the friend's basic needs, but the friend still wants to take from their meals. The author is setting boundaries by not sharing sometimes, which the friend pressures them to break.\n\nThe key points here are consent and mutual agreement. If the arrangement was that the author would cover the friend's expenses in exchange for living there, then the friend might be overstepping by demanding food portions. However, since the friend is a close friend, there's also the aspect of personal space and personal choices. The author has the right to decide what they eat, especially if they're cooking for themselves. The friend's behavior of staring until they comply is a form of pressure, which isn't healthy.\n\nOn the other hand, the author is already providing food, so maybe there's an expectation of sharing. But the author isn't required to share their specific meal portions. The friend might need to contribute more or manage their own meals. The author isn't wrong for setting boundaries here. The friend's lack of contribution to the household adds to the justification for the author not sharing.\n\nSo, considering all that, the author isn't in the wrong. They have the right to their own meals and can choose not to share, especially when the friend isn't contributing to the household. The friend needs to respect the author's boundaries.\n"
