He doesn't pay any bills, he lives here for free. He doesn't pay for groceries. He doesn't have a car, I take us everywhere. \n\nSometimes he's loud, sometimes he's dirty and he smells, but I put up with it all because he's my best friend. \n\nNow, on to the question, everytime I eat he wants a portion of my meal. It's not like he doesn't have food either, I always make sure there's enough food for both of us - albeit not always the same type of food. He doesn't outrightly say anything, he usually just stares at me until either I give in or don't. Usually I do. \n\n[Pic for context.](https://i.imgur.com/8QJkJle.jpg)\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not sharing food with their best friend. The friend lives there for free, doesn't pay bills or groceries, and uses the author's car. The friend wants a portion of the author's meal every time they eat, staring until the author gives in. The author is making sure there's enough food for both, but not necessarily the same type.\n\nHmm, so the key points here are the living arrangement and the expectations of sharing. The friend isn't contributing financially, which might be a factor. The author is covering all expenses, so maybe the friend isn't supposed to take the author's food. The friend's behavior of staring and expecting a share without asking might be pushy. The author is setting boundaries by not sharing sometimes, which could be seen as reasonable since they're the ones paying. But the friend is a best friend, so there might be an expectation of generosity. However, the author isn't obligated to share if it's their own meal. Also, the fact that the author ensures there's enough food for both might mean they're already providing, so the friend's request for the same type is maybe unreasonable. The friend's actions of not paying and then expecting food could be unfair. So the answer might be B, the author isn't in the wrong because they're covering costs and setting boundaries. But I need to make sure there's no other angle. Maybe the friend thinks they're entitled because they're a friend? But the author isn't required to share their personal meals. Yeah, I think B is correct here.\n"
