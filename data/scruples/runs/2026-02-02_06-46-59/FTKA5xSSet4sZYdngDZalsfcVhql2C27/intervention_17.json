He doesn't pay any bills, he lives here for free. He doesn't pay for groceries. He doesn't have a car, I take us everywhere. \n\nSometimes he's loud, sometimes he's dirty and he smells, but I put up with it all because he's my best friend. \n\nNow, on to the question, everytime I eat he wants a portion of my meal. It's not like he doesn't have food either, I always make sure there's enough food for both of us - albeit not always the same type of food. He doesn't outrightly say anything, he usually just stares at me until either I give in or don't. Usually I do. \n\n[Pic for context.](https://i.imgur.com/8QJkJle.jpg)\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong for not sharing their food with their best friend. The situation is that the friend lives with them, doesn't pay bills or groceries, relies on them for transportation, and often takes portions of the author's meals without being asked.\n\nFirst, the key points here are about boundaries in a shared living arrangement. The author mentions that their friend doesn't contribute financially, which is a significant factor. When someone lives with you and doesn't pay for their share of expenses, it's reasonable to expect some level of consideration for the host's resources. The fact that the friend is taking food without being offered raises questions about respect for personal space and property.\n\nThe friend's behavior of staring until the author gives in seems manipulative. The author is consistently giving in, which might be out of a desire to maintain the friendship despite the friend's other issues (like being loud, dirty, etc.). However, the author is trying to set a boundary by not sharing food, which is their right. If the friend is taking without being asked, it's a violation of that boundary.\n\nAnother angle is the concept of mutual respect in a friendship. Even though the friend is a best friend, that doesn't negate the need for boundaries. The author is making an effort to provide food for both, but the friend's actions might be seen as taking advantage of the situation. The author's refusal could be a way to assert their own needs and stop the friend from taking without contributing.\n\nHowever, there's also the consideration of the friendship aspect. Sometimes friends do things for each other without expecting payment, but when it becomes one-sided, especially in a living arrangement, it can be draining. The author might feel they're being taken advantage of, which is valid. The friend's behavior of not paying bills and groceries, plus the food taking, creates an imbalance that the author is trying to correct by not sharing.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the author isn't in the wrong for setting a boundary around their food. They have the right to decide how their resources are used, especially when the friend isn't contributing. The friend's actions are the issue here, not the author's response. Therefore, the answer should be B (No), the author is not in the wrong.\n"
