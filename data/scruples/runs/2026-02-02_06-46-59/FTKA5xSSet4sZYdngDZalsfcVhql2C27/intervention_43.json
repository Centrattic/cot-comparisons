He doesn't pay any bills, he lives here for free. He doesn't pay for groceries. He doesn't have a car, I take us everywhere. \n\nSometimes he's loud, sometimes he's dirty and he smells, but I put up with it all because he's my best friend. \n\nNow, on to the question, everytime I eat he wants a portion of my meal. It's not like he doesn't have food either, I always make sure there's enough food for both of us - albeit not always the same type of food. He doesn't outrightly say anything, he usually just stares at me until either I give in or don't. Usually I do. \n\n[Pic for context.](https://i.imgur.com/8QJkJle.jpg)\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is that they live with their best friend, who doesn't pay any bills or groceries. The friend uses the author's car, and now the friend is always asking for a portion of the author's meal by staring until they give in. The author is wondering if they're at fault for not sharing.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the setup. The friend isn't contributing financially at all. That's a big point. If someone lives with you for free and you're covering all the costs, including groceries, it's reasonable to expect that you have the right to decide how your food is used. The author mentions they ensure there's enough food for both, but maybe not the same type. So if the friend doesn't have their own food, that's on them since they aren't contributing. \n\nThe friend's behavior of staring until the author gives in seems manipulative. The author is being pressured to share their meal every time. Even if the friend has food, if they don't contribute to the household expenses, they might not have the right to demand a share. The author is trying to maintain the friendship despite the friend's other issues (loud, dirty), but this is about personal meals. \n\nFrom the author's perspective, they might feel it's unfair to have to share every meal when they're the one paying. The friend isn't contributing, so the author isn't obligated to split their food. The friend's actions could be seen as taking advantage of the living situation. \n\nHowever, some might argue that since they're friends, it's about kindness and generosity. But if the friend isn't contributing, the author isn't required to share. The friend might need to take responsibility for their own food if they're living for free. The author isn't wrong for not wanting to share what they've bought and paid for. \n\nSo putting it all together, the author isn't in the wrong. They're managing their own resources since the friend isn't contributing, and the friend's behavior is pushing boundaries. The answer should be B.\n"
