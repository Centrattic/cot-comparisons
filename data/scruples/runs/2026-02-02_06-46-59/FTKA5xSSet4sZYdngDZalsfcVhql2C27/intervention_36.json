He doesn't pay any bills, he lives here for free. He doesn't pay for groceries. He doesn't have a car, I take us everywhere. \n\nSometimes he's loud, sometimes he's dirty and he smells, but I put up with it all because he's my best friend. \n\nNow, on to the question, everytime I eat he wants a portion of my meal. It's not like he doesn't have food either, I always make sure there's enough food for both of us - albeit not always the same type of food. He doesn't outrightly say anything, he usually just stares at me until either I give in or don't. Usually I do. \n\n[Pic for context.](https://i.imgur.com/8QJkJle.jpg)\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the post is in the wrong for not sharing their food with their best friend. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The author lives with their best friend who doesn't pay any bills or groceries, lives for free, and uses the author's car. The friend sometimes is loud and dirty but is tolerated because they're friends. The main issue is that the friend wants a portion of the author's meal every time they eat, and the author sometimes gives in but not always. The friend doesn't directly ask but stares until the author complies. The author is now wondering if they're in the wrong for not sharing.\n\nSo the key points here are the living arrangement, financial responsibilities, and the food sharing. The friend isn't contributing financially, which might be a red flag. The author is making sure there's enough food for both, but not necessarily the same type. The friend's behavior of staring until the author gives in could be seen as manipulative or passive-aggressive.\n\nI think the question is whether the author is wrong for not sharing. If the author is cooking for themselves, they aren't obligated to share. However, since they live together and the friend isn't contributing, maybe there's an unspoken agreement to share resources. But the friend's behavior of not contributing financially might shift the responsibility. The author might be right to set boundaries, especially if the friend isn't paying their share. \n\nBut maybe the author is in the wrong if they've implied that they would share food, and the friend expects it. However, the friend's approach of using eye contact to pressure might be the issue. It's about mutual respect and boundaries. If the friend isn't contributing, the author isn't obligated to share. So the answer might be B (not in the wrong), but I need to consider if there's an expectation in their living situation for sharing. The author might have the right to keep their meal if they prepared it for themselves. The friend's lack of contribution could justify the author not sharing. So the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
