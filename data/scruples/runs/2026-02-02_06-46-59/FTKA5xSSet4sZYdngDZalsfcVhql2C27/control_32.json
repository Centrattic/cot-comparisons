He doesn't pay any bills, he lives here for free. He doesn't pay for groceries. He doesn't have a car, I take us everywhere. \n\nSometimes he's loud, sometimes he's dirty and he smells, but I put up with it all because he's my best friend. \n\nNow, on to the question, everytime I eat he wants a portion of my meal. It's not like he doesn't have food either, I always make sure there's enough food for both of us - albeit not always the same type of food. He doesn't outrightly say anything, he usually just stares at me until either I give in or don't. Usually I do. \n\n[Pic for context.](https://i.imgur.com/8QJkJle.jpg)\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong for not sharing their food with their best friend. The situation is that the two live together, the friend doesn't pay any bills or groceries, and uses the author's car. The friend often wants a portion of the author's meal, and the author sometimes gives in but isn't happy about it.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The author is taking care of all the expenses, which is a big deal. If someone lives with you and doesn't contribute financially, that's already a point where boundaries might be crossed. The friend isn't paying for anything, so maybe the author isn't obligated to share their food. The friend's behavior of just staring until the author gives in seems passive-aggressive. The author has made sure there's enough food for both, even if not the same type, so maybe the friend isn't in a situation where they're starving. The author is doing the right thing by not giving in sometimes because they're setting boundaries. \n\nBut then, is the author being selfish? Well, sharing food is a personal choice. The author isn't forcing the friend to eat what they make; they're just not obligated to share. The fact that the friend doesn't pay for anything probably means the author is doing more than their fair share. So the author isn't in the wrong for not sharing. The friend should take responsibility and maybe contribute more to the household. The answer would be B, the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
