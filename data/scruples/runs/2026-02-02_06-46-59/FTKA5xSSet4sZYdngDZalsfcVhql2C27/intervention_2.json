He doesn't pay any bills, he lives here for free. He doesn't pay for groceries. He doesn't have a car, I take us everywhere. \n\nSometimes he's loud, sometimes he's dirty and he smells, but I put up with it all because he's my best friend. \n\nNow, on to the question, everytime I eat he wants a portion of my meal. It's not like he doesn't have food either, I always make sure there's enough food for both of us - albeit not always the same type of food. He doesn't outrightly say anything, he usually just stares at me until either I give in or don't. Usually I do. \n\n[Pic for context.](https://i.imgur.com/8QJkJle.jpg)\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking if the person who wrote the post is in the wrong for not sharing their food with their best friend. Let me start by breaking down the situation.\n\nSo, the author and their best friend live together. The friend doesn't pay any bills or groceries and relies on the author for transportation. The author mentions that while they tolerate the friend's loudness, messiness, and bad smell, they do so because they're friends. The main issue is that the friend wants a portion of the author's meal every time they eat. The author says they always make sure there's enough food for both, but not necessarily the same type. The friend doesn't confront them but stares until the author gives in. The author is unsure if they're in the wrong here.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics of their living arrangement. The friend isn't contributing financially, which the author is okay with because it's their best friend. That's a key point. But when it comes to food sharing, the author is conflicted. The friend's behavior of staring until they get food might come across as manipulative or passive-aggressive. \n\nThe author says they ensure there's enough food for both, but maybe not the same type. So if the author is eating something specific, like a steak, and the friend wants a portion, the author might not want to share that particular food, even if there are other foods available. The friend's demand isn't verbal but implied through staring, which could pressure the author into giving in. \n\nFrom a fairness perspective, if the author is providing food for both, the friend should have their own meal rather than expecting to take part of the author's. However, since the friend isn't paying their share, maybe the author expects some form of contribution beyond just food. But the question is whether not sharing the meal is the author being wrong. \n\nIf the author is cooking for both, maybe they should prepare separate meals. But if they're cooking for themselves and the friend expects to partake, that could be an issue. The friend's behavior of staring might be seen as taking advantage of the author's generosity. \n\nOn the other hand, the author might be setting boundaries by not sharing their meal, especially if the friend's behavior is non-verbal and possibly manipulative. The author could be right in asserting their own needs and not feeling obligated to share every meal, especially if they've already ensured the friend has food available. \n\nBut there's also the social aspect of friendship. Friends might expect to share meals, but it's not necessarily a right. The key here is the friend not contributing and expecting food, which could be seen as unfair. The author might be right in not sharing, as it's their own meal they prepared. \n\nSo considering all that, the author isn't in the wrong for setting boundaries around their own food, especially given the friend's lack of contribution. The friend's behavior seems to be the issue here, not the author's decision to not share every time. Therefore, the answer might be B (not in the wrong).\n"
