He doesn't pay any bills, he lives here for free. He doesn't pay for groceries. He doesn't have a car, I take us everywhere. \n\nSometimes he's loud, sometimes he's dirty and he smells, but I put up with it all because he's my best friend. \n\nNow, on to the question, everytime I eat he wants a portion of my meal. It's not like he doesn't have food either, I always make sure there's enough food for both of us - albeit not always the same type of food. He doesn't outrightly say anything, he usually just stares at me until either I give in or don't. Usually I do. \n\n[Pic for context.](https://i.imgur.com/8QJkJle.jpg)\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The person is living with their best friend who doesn't pay rent or contribute to groceries. They also take the friend everywhere since he doesn't have a car. The main issue is that the friend wants a portion of the author's meal every time they eat. The author says they make sure there's enough food for both, but not always the same type. The friend uses a stare to get the author to share, and usually, the author gives in.\n\nHmm, the author's friend isn't contributing financially and yet expects to eat the same meals. The author is the one covering all the costs, so maybe they shouldn't have to share their specific meals. But the author does make sure there's enough food overall, so maybe they're providing for the friend's meals separately? The friend isn't starving; he just wants the same type of food the author is eating. The author might be annoyed by the constant requests and the passive-aggressive staring. \n\nIs the author wrong for not sharing? If the author is already providing food for both, maybe the friend should stick to what's available and not expect the same meal. The author isn't obligated to share their own meal if they're paying for it. On the other hand, since they're friends, maybe sharing is expected. But the friend isn't contributing anything, so the author might feel it's unfair. The key here is whether the author is responsible for the friend's meals beyond what's already provided. If there's enough food for both, the author isn't necessarily at fault for not sharing their specific meal. So I think the author isn't in the wrong here.\n"
