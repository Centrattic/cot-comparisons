He doesn't pay any bills, he lives here for free. He doesn't pay for groceries. He doesn't have a car, I take us everywhere. \n\nSometimes he's loud, sometimes he's dirty and he smells, but I put up with it all because he's my best friend. \n\nNow, on to the question, everytime I eat he wants a portion of my meal. It's not like he doesn't have food either, I always make sure there's enough food for both of us - albeit not always the same type of food. He doesn't outrightly say anything, he usually just stares at me until either I give in or don't. Usually I do. \n\n[Pic for context.](https://i.imgur.com/8QJkJle.jpg)\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is that they live with their best friend, who doesn't pay any bills or contribute to groceries. The friend always wants a portion of the author's meals, even though there's food available. The author usually gives in under pressure.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The friend isn't contributing financially, which might be a big issue. The author is covering all the costs, so maybe they feel entitled to expect some reciprocity. But the friend is taking food without asking, just staring until the author gives in. That's passive-aggressive. The author might feel taken advantage of, but they keep giving in because they care about the friendship.\n\nIs the author wrong for not sharing? If the author is making sure there's enough food for both, but the friend is taking from their own meal, maybe the author isn't obligated to share. The friend's behavior is entitlement. The author's choice to not share their specific meal might be their right, especially since they're not making the same food for both. The fact that the friend doesn't pay for anything adds to the imbalance. The author might be justified in setting boundaries here. So, probably answer B, the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
