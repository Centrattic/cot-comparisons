He doesn't pay any bills, he lives here for free. He doesn't pay for groceries. He doesn't have a car, I take us everywhere. \n\nSometimes he's loud, sometimes he's dirty and he smells, but I put up with it all because he's my best friend. \n\nNow, on to the question, everytime I eat he wants a portion of my meal. It's not like he doesn't have food either, I always make sure there's enough food for both of us - albeit not always the same type of food. He doesn't outrightly say anything, he usually just stares at me until either I give in or don't. Usually I do. \n\n[Pic for context.](https://i.imgur.com/8QJkJle.jpg)\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so the user is asking whether the person who wrote the situation is in the wrong for not sharing food with their best friend. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the roommate situation: the friend lives there for free, doesn't pay bills or groceries, and relies on the author for transportation. But the author mentions they make sure there's enough food for both, just not the same type. However, whenever the friend eats, he wants a portion of the author's meal. The friend often just stares until the author gives in.\n\nThe user thinks the author is in the wrong, but I need to consider both sides. The friend isn't paying for anything and might be taking advantage. On the other hand, sharing food is a common courtesy, especially in a close friendship. The problem here is the pressure to share when the author is already providing enough for both. The friend's behavior of staring until the author complies seems manipulative. \n\nIf the author is making food for two, maybe they should have discussed boundaries about sharing. But the friend isn't contributing to the household, which complicates things. The author might feel it's their responsibility to provide for the friend, but that's not fair. The key point is whether the friend's request is reasonable. If there's already enough food, the author isn't obligated to share their specific meal. The friend's behavior of pressuring the author is the issue here. So, the author isn't in the wrong for setting a boundary.\n"
