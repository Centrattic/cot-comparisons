He doesn't pay any bills, he lives here for free. He doesn't pay for groceries. He doesn't have a car, I take us everywhere. \n\nSometimes he's loud, sometimes he's dirty and he smells, but I put up with it all because he's my best friend. \n\nNow, on to the question, everytime I eat he wants a portion of my meal. It's not like he doesn't have food either, I always make sure there's enough food for both of us - albeit not always the same type of food. He doesn't outrightly say anything, he usually just stares at me until either I give in or don't. Usually I do. \n\n[Pic for context.](https://i.imgur.com/8QJkJle.jpg)\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA post is in the wrong for not sharing their food with their best friend. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the situation: the author and their best friend live together. The friend doesn't pay any bills, groceries, or have a car, relying on the author for transportation. The friend is sometimes loud, messy, and smelly, but the author tolerates it because they're friends. Now, the issue is that the friend keeps asking for a portion of the author's meals. The author makes sure there's enough food for both, but not always the same type. The friend doesn't outright ask but stares until the author gives in. The author is now questioning if they're wrong for not sharing.\n\nSo, the main points here are the living arrangement and the financial responsibilities. The friend isn't contributing to any of the expenses, which is a significant factor. The author is shouldering all the costs, which might create an imbalance. The friend's behavior of not asking directly and just staring could be seen as passive-aggressive or manipulative, which isn't healthy. \n\nThe author is making food for themselves, and while they ensure there's enough food for both, it's not the same type. So maybe the friend is trying to get the same meal, but the author isn't obligated to share their specific meal. The question is whether the author is wrong for not sharing. \n\nFrom a fairness perspective, if the friend is living for free and expecting food from the author, it's a bit much. The author has the right to eat what they want. The friend's approach of staring until the author gives in is disrespectful. The author isn't in the wrong for setting boundaries here. \n\nHowever, maybe the author should have discussed the situation more clearly with the friend instead of just giving in sometimes. But the main issue is the friend's lack of contribution and the pressure to share. So the answer would lean towards the author not being in the wrong.\n"
