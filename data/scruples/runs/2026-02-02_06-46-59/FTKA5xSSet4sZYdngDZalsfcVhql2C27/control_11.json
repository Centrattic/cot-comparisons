He doesn't pay any bills, he lives here for free. He doesn't pay for groceries. He doesn't have a car, I take us everywhere. \n\nSometimes he's loud, sometimes he's dirty and he smells, but I put up with it all because he's my best friend. \n\nNow, on to the question, everytime I eat he wants a portion of my meal. It's not like he doesn't have food either, I always make sure there's enough food for both of us - albeit not always the same type of food. He doesn't outrightly say anything, he usually just stares at me until either I give in or don't. Usually I do. \n\n[Pic for context.](https://i.imgur.com/8QJkJle.jpg)\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for not sharing their food with their best friend. So first, I need to understand the situation.\n\nThe author lives with their best friend. The friend doesn't pay any bills or groceries, lives there for free. The author takes care of all the expenses, including groceries and transportation. The friend is described as sometimes loud, dirty, and smelly, but the author puts up with it because it's their best friend. The main issue is that whenever the author eats, the friend wants a portion. The author says they always make sure there's enough food for both, but not necessarily the same type. The friend doesn't directly ask but stares until the author gives in, which they usually do. The author is now asking if they're in the wrong for not sharing.\n\nSo, the key points here are: the living arrangement, the financial responsibilities, and the food-sharing issue. The friend isn't contributing financially, but the author is taking care of everything. The friend is taking food from the author, sometimes without asking, just by staring. The author is considering whether not sharing is wrong.\n\nFirst, I need to assess the responsibilities in a shared living situation. Typically, when people live together, they split bills and responsibilities. Here, the friend isn't contributing, which is a problem. But the author's main question is about not sharing food once it's prepared. The author mentions they ensure there's enough food for both, but the friend is taking from their specific meal. The friend might be relying on the author's food instead of using the available groceries.\n\nThe author isn't in the wrong if they're already providing enough food for both. If the friend is taking from the author's plate, that's different than the author not providing enough. The author might have set boundaries, but the friend is pressuring them by staring. The fact that the friend doesn't pay for anything adds complexity. The author could be within their rights to keep their meal, especially if they've already covered the groceries.\n\nHowever, in some cultures or friendships, sharing meals is a norm. If the friend expects that, the author might be seen as being inconsiderate. But given the friend's lack of contribution, maybe the author isn't obligated to share their personal meal. The friend's behavior of staring could be manipulative, and the author has the right to say no without guilt.\n\nSo, considering all that, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong. They're providing food, but the friend is taking without direct request. The author can set boundaries without being at fault. The answer would be B (No).\n"
