He doesn't pay any bills, he lives here for free. He doesn't pay for groceries. He doesn't have a car, I take us everywhere. \n\nSometimes he's loud, sometimes he's dirty and he smells, but I put up with it all because he's my best friend. \n\nNow, on to the question, everytime I eat he wants a portion of my meal. It's not like he doesn't have food either, I always make sure there's enough food for both of us - albeit not always the same type of food. He doesn't outrightly say anything, he usually just stares at me until either I give in or don't. Usually I do. \n\n[Pic for context.](https://i.imgur.com/8QJkJle.jpg)\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for not sharing food with their best friend. The situation is that they live together, the friend doesn't pay any bills or groceries, and the friend often wants a portion of the author's meal. The author says they make sure there's enough food for both, but not always the same type. The friend uses a passive-aggressive stare to get the author to share.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The friend isn't contributing to the household expenses. The author is covering all costs, including groceries, and even driving the friend around. So, the financial responsibility is entirely on the author. Now, the food sharing part: the author is making meals, but the friend is expecting a portion. The author is sometimes giving in, but not always. The friend isn't outrightly asking but uses a stare.\n\nIs the author obligated to share their specific meal? If the author is buying groceries and ensuring there's enough food for both, maybe the friend can take from the available food without taking the author's specific portion. The author mentions \"albeit not always the same type of food,\" which suggests that there's food available, but maybe not the exact same dishes. The friend's approach is passive-aggressive, which is inconsiderate.\n\nFrom a fairness perspective, the author is covering all costs and should have the right to their own meal. The friend's behavior is taking advantage of the author's generosity. The author isn't in the wrong for setting boundaries. However, some might argue that friends should share, but since the friend isn't contributing, the author isn't required to share their specific food. The key here is mutual respect and the existing imbalance in responsibilities. The author is not obligated to share their own meal, especially when the friend is not contributing. So, the answer would be B (No).\n"
