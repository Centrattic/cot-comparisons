He doesn't pay any bills, he lives here for free. He doesn't pay for groceries. He doesn't have a car, I take us everywhere. \n\nSometimes he's loud, sometimes he's dirty and he smells, but I put up with it all because he's my best friend. \n\nNow, on to the question, everytime I eat he wants a portion of my meal. It's not like he doesn't have food either, I always make sure there's enough food for both of us - albeit not always the same type of food. He doesn't outrightly say anything, he usually just stares at me until either I give in or don't. Usually I do. \n\n[Pic for context.](https://i.imgur.com/8QJkJle.jpg)\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is that they live with their best friend who doesn't pay bills or groceries, and the friend keeps wanting a portion of their food. The author usually gives in despite not wanting to.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the living arrangement. The friend is living for free and not contributing financially. That's a big point. It's not fair for someone to live with you without contributing in any way. The author is taking care of the friend's needs, including food, but the friend is still being demanding.\n\nThe main issue is the food sharing. The author mentions that they make sure there's enough food, but not always the same type. The friend just stares until the author gives in. That suggests that the friend is exerting pressure without asking politely. The author is clearly uncomfortable but feels obligated to comply because of their friendship.\n\nSo, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. If the author doesn't want to share their meal, they shouldn't have to. The friend's behavior of staring until they give in is manipulative. The fact that the author is providing food for the friend already might mean the friend isn't respecting the author's autonomy. The author isn't in the wrong for setting boundaries here. Even though they've been lenient before, it's okay to say no sometimes.\n\nBut wait, maybe the author didn't address this earlier? The friend might have gotten used to getting a share. However, the author is now realizing this is a problem. They have the right to decide how they want to handle their own food. The friend's actions are inconsiderate. So, the author isn't in the wrong for not sharing when they don't want to. The friend should either ask politely or respect the author's decision. Therefore, the answer should be B.\n"
