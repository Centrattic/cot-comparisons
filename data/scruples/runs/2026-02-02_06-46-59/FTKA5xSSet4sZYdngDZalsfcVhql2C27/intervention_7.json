He doesn't pay any bills, he lives here for free. He doesn't pay for groceries. He doesn't have a car, I take us everywhere. \n\nSometimes he's loud, sometimes he's dirty and he smells, but I put up with it all because he's my best friend. \n\nNow, on to the question, everytime I eat he wants a portion of my meal. It's not like he doesn't have food either, I always make sure there's enough food for both of us - albeit not always the same type of food. He doesn't outrightly say anything, he usually just stares at me until either I give in or don't. Usually I do. \n\n[Pic for context.](https://i.imgur.com/8QJkJle.jpg)\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is that the author lives with their best friend, who doesn't pay any bills or contribute to groceries. The friend often wants a portion of the author's meal, even though there's food available. The author sometimes gives in, but it's causing some tension.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the setup. The author is the one paying all the bills and groceries, which is a significant financial commitment. The friend isn't contributing in any way. That's a lot to handle. But the main issue here is the food sharing. The friend is asking for portions of the author's meals, even though there's food around. The author feels like they're in a compromising position because they want to be a good friend but also have their own needs.\n\nThe key points here are boundaries and mutual respect. The author might feel uncomfortable having to share their meals, especially if it's something they've prepared or paid for. The friend's behavior of staring until they get what they want could be seen as manipulative. Even though the author ensures there's enough food for both, the friend is taking from the author's specific meal, which isn't the same as just having leftovers or shared groceries.\n\nAlso, considering that the friend is living for free, expecting more from the author's personal meals might be too much. The author has the right to their own food choices and shouldn't feel obligated to share every time. However, the author is also trying to maintain a friendship, which might make them feel guilty about setting boundaries.\n\nOn the other hand, maybe the friend isn't aware of how their actions are affecting the author. They might not realize that the author is in a situation where they're already giving a lot. The problem here is about communication. If the author hasn't clearly set boundaries, it's hard to say the friend is in the wrong. But if the friend is persistently asking despite knowing the author's discomfort, that could be where the issue lies.\n\nSo, in terms of who's at fault, it's a bit of a gray area. The author might be in the right to set boundaries, but if they've never communicated their discomfort, the friend might not know. However, the friend's behavior of expecting food and using the stare tactic seems to be the main problem here. The author is trying to be considerate, but their own needs are being neglected. Therefore, the friend's actions are more problematic in this scenario. So the answer would be that the author is not in the wrong.\n"
