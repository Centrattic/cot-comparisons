He doesn't pay any bills, he lives here for free. He doesn't pay for groceries. He doesn't have a car, I take us everywhere. \n\nSometimes he's loud, sometimes he's dirty and he smells, but I put up with it all because he's my best friend. \n\nNow, on to the question, everytime I eat he wants a portion of my meal. It's not like he doesn't have food either, I always make sure there's enough food for both of us - albeit not always the same type of food. He doesn't outrightly say anything, he usually just stares at me until either I give in or don't. Usually I do. \n\n[Pic for context.](https://i.imgur.com/8QJkJle.jpg)\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that the author and their best friend live together. The friend doesn't pay any bills or groceries, uses the author's car, and sometimes is loud or smelly. But the main issue is about sharing food. The friend takes a portion of the author's meal, even though there's enough food for both, just not the same type. The author gives in most of the time.\n\nFirst, I need to consider boundaries in a roommate situation. Even though they're best friends, roommates typically have to respect each other's personal space and possessions. Sharing food isn't a given unless it's part of an agreement. The fact that the friend doesn't contribute financially might make the situation more unequal. The author is covering all the costs, so maybe they have a right to set boundaries about their own meals.\n\nAlso, the friend's method of taking food\u2014staring until the author gives in\u2014sounds like manipulation. That's not respectful. The author might feel pressured to share even when they don't want to. The key here is whether the author is responsible for the friend's behavior. The author isn't obligated to share their food if it's causing discomfort. They're trying to be considerate by ensuring there's enough food, but the friend is overstepping by taking from their personal meal without being asked.\n\nOn the other hand, the friend might feel entitled because they're living there for free and the author is already covering their expenses. But that's a separate issue. The author's right to their own food isn't negated by other arrangements. The main question is about the food sharing specifically. The author isn't in the wrong for not sharing if they set that boundary. They've been accommodating, but they can also say no without guilt. So the answer is B, the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
