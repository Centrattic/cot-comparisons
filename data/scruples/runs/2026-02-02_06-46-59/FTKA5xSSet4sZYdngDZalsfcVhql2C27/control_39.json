He doesn't pay any bills, he lives here for free. He doesn't pay for groceries. He doesn't have a car, I take us everywhere. \n\nSometimes he's loud, sometimes he's dirty and he smells, but I put up with it all because he's my best friend. \n\nNow, on to the question, everytime I eat he wants a portion of my meal. It's not like he doesn't have food either, I always make sure there's enough food for both of us - albeit not always the same type of food. He doesn't outrightly say anything, he usually just stares at me until either I give in or don't. Usually I do. \n\n[Pic for context.](https://i.imgur.com/8QJkJle.jpg)\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for not sharing food with their best friend. The situation is that they live together, the friend doesn't pay rent or contribute to bills, doesn't pay for groceries, and relies on the author for transportation. The friend often takes a portion of the author's meal without directly asking, and the author usually gives in but is now considering not sharing.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The friend isn't contributing financially, which is a big factor. The author covers all expenses, which is a significant responsibility. The friend's behavior of taking food without asking could be seen as taking advantage. Even if the author has made sure there's enough food, the friend's entitlement to the same type of food might not be justified if they aren't contributing equally. \n\nAlso, the friend's actions\u2014staring until the author gives in\u2014suggest a lack of respect for the author's autonomy over their own meals. Boundaries are important in any living situation. The author might feel that their personal choices about food are being overstepped. While they've put up with other issues like noise and cleanliness, the food sharing is a different matter because it's a personal choice that affects the author's resources and comfort.\n\nHowever, the author might feel guilty because the friend is their best friend, making it hard to set boundaries. But that doesn't mean the author is wrong for wanting to maintain personal boundaries. The key points are the lack of contribution from the friend and the author's right to control their own meals. Since the friend isn't contributing, the author isn't obligated to share their food, especially when it's affecting their own comfort. Therefore, the author isn't in the wrong for not sharing if they choose to set that boundary.\n"
