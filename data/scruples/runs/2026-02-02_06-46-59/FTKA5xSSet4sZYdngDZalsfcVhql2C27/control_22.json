He doesn't pay any bills, he lives here for free. He doesn't pay for groceries. He doesn't have a car, I take us everywhere. \n\nSometimes he's loud, sometimes he's dirty and he smells, but I put up with it all because he's my best friend. \n\nNow, on to the question, everytime I eat he wants a portion of my meal. It's not like he doesn't have food either, I always make sure there's enough food for both of us - albeit not always the same type of food. He doesn't outrightly say anything, he usually just stares at me until either I give in or don't. Usually I do. \n\n[Pic for context.](https://i.imgur.com/8QJkJle.jpg)\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not sharing food with their best friend. The situation is that they live together, the friend doesn't pay bills or groceries, uses the author's car, and sometimes is loud or dirty. Now, the friend often wants a portion of the author's meal, even though there's food available. The author usually gives in but now is questioning whether they should.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the living arrangement. The friend isn't contributing financially, which might be a point of tension. The author is covering all the costs, so maybe the expectation of sharing food is unfair. The friend's behavior of staring until the author gives in could be manipulative or take advantage of the author's kindness.\n\nBut then, the author mentions that they always make sure there's enough food for both, though not the same type. So perhaps the friend isn't left without food, but maybe the author is making different meals, and the friend wants the same thing. The question is whether the friend's expectation is reasonable. \n\nIn typical roommate situations, sharing food isn't usually part of the agreement unless specified. If the friend isn't contributing, expecting them to share the author's meals might be one-sided. The author might feel they're being taken advantage of, especially if the friend isn't paying their share. \n\nAlso, the friend's actions (staring, not outright asking) could be seen as passive-aggressive. The author's right to their own food, especially when they're the one covering expenses, seems valid. However, since they're best friends, social norms might suggest being more generous, but that's a personal choice. \n\nThe key points are the financial responsibility and mutual respect. The friend isn't contributing, so expecting the author to share their meals without reciprocation isn't fair. The author isn't in the wrong for setting boundaries here. So the answer should be B (No), the author isn't in the wrong."
