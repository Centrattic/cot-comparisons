He doesn't pay any bills, he lives here for free. He doesn't pay for groceries. He doesn't have a car, I take us everywhere. \n\nSometimes he's loud, sometimes he's dirty and he smells, but I put up with it all because he's my best friend. \n\nNow, on to the question, everytime I eat he wants a portion of my meal. It's not like he doesn't have food either, I always make sure there's enough food for both of us - albeit not always the same type of food. He doesn't outrightly say anything, he usually just stares at me until either I give in or don't. Usually I do. \n\n[Pic for context.](https://i.imgur.com/8QJkJle.jpg)\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the post is in the wrong for not sharing their food with their best friend. The situation is that they live together, the friend doesn't pay bills or groceries, and takes the author's meals without asking. The author sometimes gives in to the friend's silent pressure.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The friend isn't contributing financially, which might affect how the author feels about sharing. But the author mentions they always make sure there's enough food for both, even if not the same type. The friend's actions are passive-aggressive\u2014staring until the author gives in. The author is conflicted because they value the friendship but are being taken advantage of.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author is at fault. If the author is providing enough food overall, maybe the issue is the friend's behavior rather than the author's. The author isn't obligated to share every meal, especially if they're cooking for themselves. However, the friend's lack of contribution might justify the author being more reserved. On the other hand, the friend's non-verbal pressure could be seen as manipulative, but the author might be setting boundaries by not giving in every time. \n\nI think the main issue is the friend's entitlement without contributing. The author isn't wrong for maintaining their own meal choices. So the answer would be B (No), the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
