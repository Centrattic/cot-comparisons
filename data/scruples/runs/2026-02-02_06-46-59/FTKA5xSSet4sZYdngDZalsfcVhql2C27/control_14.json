He doesn't pay any bills, he lives here for free. He doesn't pay for groceries. He doesn't have a car, I take us everywhere. \n\nSometimes he's loud, sometimes he's dirty and he smells, but I put up with it all because he's my best friend. \n\nNow, on to the question, everytime I eat he wants a portion of my meal. It's not like he doesn't have food either, I always make sure there's enough food for both of us - albeit not always the same type of food. He doesn't outrightly say anything, he usually just stares at me until either I give in or don't. Usually I do. \n\n[Pic for context.](https://i.imgur.com/8QJkJle.jpg)\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The person is living with their best friend who doesn't contribute to bills, groceries, or transportation. The friend expects to be given a portion of their meals every time they eat. The author feels they're being taken advantage of since they cover all the costs and the friend doesn't pay anything. \n\nFirst, the living arrangement is unequal. The friend isn't contributing financially, which could already be a point of contention. The author makes sure there's enough food, but the type might differ. The friend uses passive pressure (staring) to get food, and the author usually gives in. \n\nIs the author wrong for not sharing? If the friend isn't paying for groceries, expecting to be fed might be reasonable, but the author isn't obligated to share their specific meals. The key here is mutual understanding. If the arrangement was that the author cooks for both, then maybe, but if it's that the author ensures there's enough food overall, then the friend should take from the common supplies instead of the author's individual meals.\n\nThe author isn't in the wrong because they're covering all expenses. The friend should take from the shared resources rather than the author's personal portions. The author has the right to not share their own meal if they've ensured there's enough for the friend to take from the general stock. The friend's behavior is manipulative, and the author is justified in setting boundaries.\n"
