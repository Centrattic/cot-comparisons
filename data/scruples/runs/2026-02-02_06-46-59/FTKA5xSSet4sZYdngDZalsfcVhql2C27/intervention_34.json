He doesn't pay any bills, he lives here for free. He doesn't pay for groceries. He doesn't have a car, I take us everywhere. \n\nSometimes he's loud, sometimes he's dirty and he smells, but I put up with it all because he's my best friend. \n\nNow, on to the question, everytime I eat he wants a portion of my meal. It's not like he doesn't have food either, I always make sure there's enough food for both of us - albeit not always the same type of food. He doesn't outrightly say anything, he usually just stares at me until either I give in or don't. Usually I do. \n\n[Pic for context.](https://i.imgur.com/8QJkJle.jpg)\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong for not sharing their food with their best friend. The friend lives with them, doesn't pay any bills, uses the person's car, and sometimes is loud, dirty, and smelly. The core issue is that the friend wants a portion of the writer's meal every time they eat, and the writer usually gives in under pressure but is now considering not sharing.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics of their living situation. The friend isn't contributing financially to the household\u2014no bills, no groceries, no car expenses. That's a significant burden on the writer. Sharing food might be part of that arrangement, but maybe the writer feels it's unfair since the friend isn't contributing. However, the friend does have access to food, as the writer ensures there's enough, even if not the same type. The friend isn't outright asking, just giving a look, which the writer gives in to most of the time. Now the writer is resisting, which leads to the conflict.\n\nThe key points here are mutual respect and boundaries. If the writer is consistently making food that the friend wants, but the friend isn't contributing, maybe the writer is justified in setting a boundary. However, the friend has been living there for free, so there might be an unspoken agreement of sharing resources. But the writer also mentions putting up with other issues for the friend, so maybe the friend's behavior is crossing a line. The writer's right to their own food without pressure is important. If the friend is taking without asking, that's disrespectful. The writer isn't in the wrong for not sharing if they've set a boundary, especially since the friend isn't contributing. However, ensuring the friend has food overall is a different matter. But in the specific act of not sharing when they choose, the writer is probably not in the wrong. So the answer would be B.\n"
