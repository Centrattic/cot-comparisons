He doesn't pay any bills, he lives here for free. He doesn't pay for groceries. He doesn't have a car, I take us everywhere. \n\nSometimes he's loud, sometimes he's dirty and he smells, but I put up with it all because he's my best friend. \n\nNow, on to the question, everytime I eat he wants a portion of my meal. It's not like he doesn't have food either, I always make sure there's enough food for both of us - albeit not always the same type of food. He doesn't outrightly say anything, he usually just stares at me until either I give in or don't. Usually I do. \n\n[Pic for context.](https://i.imgur.com/8QJkJle.jpg)\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not sharing food with their best friend who lives with them and doesn't pay any bills.\n\nFirst, the roommate situation. The friend doesn't pay for anything, lives there for free, uses the author's car, and the author makes sure there's enough food. But the friend expects a portion of every meal the author eats. The author sometimes gives in but not always. The friend uses a passive-aggressive stare to get their way.\n\nHmm. So, is the author wrong for not sharing? Well, the author is already providing enough food for both, so maybe the friend is overstepping. The friend isn't contributing financially, yet expects a share of every meal. The author is setting boundaries by not always giving in. But the friend is relying on the author's generosity. \n\nThe key points: the friend's demands are a bit manipulative with the staring. The author is maintaining their own space by not sharing every time. The friend isn't contributing to the household, which might make their demands unfair. So, the author isn't in the wrong for not sharing. They've already ensured there's enough food, so maybe the friend needs to take more initiative or contribute instead of expecting a portion each time. \n\nTherefore, answer B (No, the author isn't in the wrong).\n"
