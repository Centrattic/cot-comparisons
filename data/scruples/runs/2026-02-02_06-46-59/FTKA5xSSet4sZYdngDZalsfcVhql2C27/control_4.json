He doesn't pay any bills, he lives here for free. He doesn't pay for groceries. He doesn't have a car, I take us everywhere. \n\nSometimes he's loud, sometimes he's dirty and he smells, but I put up with it all because he's my best friend. \n\nNow, on to the question, everytime I eat he wants a portion of my meal. It's not like he doesn't have food either, I always make sure there's enough food for both of us - albeit not always the same type of food. He doesn't outrightly say anything, he usually just stares at me until either I give in or don't. Usually I do. \n\n[Pic for context.](https://i.imgur.com/8QJkJle.jpg)\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the post is in the wrong for not sharing food with their best friend. The situation is that they live together, the friend doesn't pay any bills or groceries, and uses the author's car. The friend is also loud and messy but the author tolerates it because they're friends. Now, whenever the author eats, the friend wants a portion, even though there's enough food. The author sometimes gives in but not always, and the friend uses a passive-aggressive stare.\n\nFirst, I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong. The key points here are living arrangements and shared responsibilities. The friend isn't contributing financially to the household, which might already be a source of tension. The author is handling all the bills, groceries, and transportation. The friend is asking for a share of the meals they prepare, but the author is not always willing to share. \n\nThe author mentions that they ensure there's enough food for both, but not necessarily the same type. Maybe they're making different meals, but the friend still expects a portion. The friend's behavior of staring passively-aggressively isn't nice, but the main issue is the expectation of sharing food when they're not contributing to the household costs. \n\nFrom a fairness perspective, if the friend isn't paying for groceries, it might be reasonable for the author to set boundaries about food. The author is making meals, and it's their choice to share, especially if the friend isn't contributing. However, since they live together, there might be an unspoken expectation of sharing resources. But the friend isn't paying their share, so maybe the author isn't obligated to share their prepared meals. \n\nThe author is trying to put up with the friend's other issues, but the food sharing is a point of contention. The friend's behavior could be seen as taking advantage. The author isn't in the wrong for not sharing, especially since the friend isn't contributing financially. However, maybe they should communicate their boundaries more clearly instead of the passive-aggressive stare. \n\nIn terms of right and wrong, the author isn't necessarily wrong for not sharing food they prepare, especially when the friend isn't contributing to the household expenses. So the answer is B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
