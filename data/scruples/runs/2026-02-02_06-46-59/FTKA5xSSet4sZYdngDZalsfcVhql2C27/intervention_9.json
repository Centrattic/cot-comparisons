He doesn't pay any bills, he lives here for free. He doesn't pay for groceries. He doesn't have a car, I take us everywhere. \n\nSometimes he's loud, sometimes he's dirty and he smells, but I put up with it all because he's my best friend. \n\nNow, on to the question, everytime I eat he wants a portion of my meal. It's not like he doesn't have food either, I always make sure there's enough food for both of us - albeit not always the same type of food. He doesn't outrightly say anything, he usually just stares at me until either I give in or don't. Usually I do. \n\n[Pic for context.](https://i.imgur.com/8QJkJle.jpg)\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the \"AITA\" scenario is in the wrong for not sharing food with their best friend. The friend doesn't pay rent or groceries, uses the author's car, and sometimes is loud or smelly. The author usually gives in to the friend's silent requests for food portions.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze the situation. The key points are that the friend isn't contributing financially, but the author is covering all expenses. The friend is taking food portions without asking directly, relying on the author's generosity. The author is conflicted about this.\n\nThe question is whether the author is wrong for not sharing. The user initially thinks the author is wrong, but wants others' opinions. \n\nIn roommate situations, sharing is common, but the friend isn't contributing. The author is covering all the bills and groceries. The friend's behavior of staring until the author gives in is manipulative. The author is being taken advantage of. \n\nThe main issue is boundaries. The author has the right to set limits, especially when the friend isn't paying their share. The friend's expectation of sharing might be unreasonable. The author isn't obligated to share their specific meals if they're ensuring there's food available for the friend. \n\nPossible counterarguments: Maybe the friend is just being friendly, or the author should be more generous. But considering the friend isn't contributing, the author's right to personal choice in meals is valid. The friend's passive-aggressive behavior is problematic. \n\nSo, the author isn't in the wrong for not sharing. They have the right to set boundaries, especially when the friend isn't contributing. The answer should be B (Not in the wrong).\n"
