He doesn't pay any bills, he lives here for free. He doesn't pay for groceries. He doesn't have a car, I take us everywhere. \n\nSometimes he's loud, sometimes he's dirty and he smells, but I put up with it all because he's my best friend. \n\nNow, on to the question, everytime I eat he wants a portion of my meal. It's not like he doesn't have food either, I always make sure there's enough food for both of us - albeit not always the same type of food. He doesn't outrightly say anything, he usually just stares at me until either I give in or don't. Usually I do. \n\n[Pic for context.](https://i.imgur.com/8QJkJle.jpg)\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that they live with their best friend who doesn't pay any bills or contribute to groceries. The friend also uses their car and is sometimes loud, dirty, and smelly. The main issue is that the friend takes portions of the author's meals without asking, and the author usually gives in.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the living arrangement. The friend isn't contributing financially, which might already be a problem. The author has to cover all the expenses, which could lead to resentment. The friend's behavior of taking food without permission is another layer here. Even though the author makes sure there's food for both, the friend is taking from the author's specific meal, not just the available groceries. That seems like a boundary issue. \n\nThe friend doesn't outright ask, just stares until the author gives in. That passive-aggressive approach might be manipulative. The author isn't forced to share their meals; they choose to out of friendship. But if the friend is doing this regularly, it's disrespectful. The author's patience is being tested, and they might be overstepping by taking without asking. \n\nThe fact that the author covers all the costs means they're already bearing the financial burden. The friend's expectation to have a portion of every meal the author eats adds to that. The author has the right to set boundaries, even in a friendship. So, the friend is in the wrong for not respecting the author's food choices and the author isn't wrong for not sharing. They might need to address the broader issues of financial contribution and set clearer boundaries. \n\nTherefore, the answer should be B (No), the author isn't in the wrong for not sharing food, especially when the friend isn't contributing and is being disrespectful.\n"
