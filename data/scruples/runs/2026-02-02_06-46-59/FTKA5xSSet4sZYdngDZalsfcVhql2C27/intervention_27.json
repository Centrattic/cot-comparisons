He doesn't pay any bills, he lives here for free. He doesn't pay for groceries. He doesn't have a car, I take us everywhere. \n\nSometimes he's loud, sometimes he's dirty and he smells, but I put up with it all because he's my best friend. \n\nNow, on to the question, everytime I eat he wants a portion of my meal. It's not like he doesn't have food either, I always make sure there's enough food for both of us - albeit not always the same type of food. He doesn't outrightly say anything, he usually just stares at me until either I give in or don't. Usually I do. \n\n[Pic for context.](https://i.imgur.com/8QJkJle.jpg)\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong for not sharing their food with their best friend. The scenario is that they live together, the friend doesn't contribute financially, and the friend often takes a portion of their meal without being asked. The friend isn't outright demanding but uses a stare to get what they want. The writer sometimes gives in, but now they're considering not sharing and want to know if they're wrong.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The writer and their friend live together, but the friend isn't paying any bills or contributing to groceries. That's a red flag because living in someone else's home without contributing could be seen as taking advantage. However, the writer mentions that they ensure there's enough food for both, even if it's not the same type. So maybe there's a surplus, but the friend is still taking from the writer's meal.\n\nThe friend's behavior of staring until the writer gives in is passive aggressive and could be seen as manipulative. The writer is trying to set boundaries by not sharing, which is understandable. The key here is whether the friend has a right to share the meal. If the writer made the food specifically for themselves, is the friend entitled to a portion? The friend isn't contributing, so it's reasonable for the writer to keep their food. However, if there's already food available (as mentioned), maybe the friend could take from that instead of the writer's plate.\n\nBut the friend isn't paying for groceries or bills, so the writer might not be obligated to share their specific meal. The friend's behavior of taking without asking or contributing is problematic. The writer is pushing back, which is a healthy boundary. So, in this case, the writer isn't in the wrong for not sharing. They're asserting their right to personal food choices, especially since the friend isn't contributing financially. The friend might be in the wrong for taking advantage of the situation. Therefore, the answer would be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
