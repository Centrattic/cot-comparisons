He doesn't pay any bills, he lives here for free. He doesn't pay for groceries. He doesn't have a car, I take us everywhere. \n\nSometimes he's loud, sometimes he's dirty and he smells, but I put up with it all because he's my best friend. \n\nNow, on to the question, everytime I eat he wants a portion of my meal. It's not like he doesn't have food either, I always make sure there's enough food for both of us - albeit not always the same type of food. He doesn't outrightly say anything, he usually just stares at me until either I give in or don't. Usually I do. \n\n[Pic for context.](https://i.imgur.com/8QJkJle.jpg)\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the situation is in the wrong. The scenario is that they live with their best friend who doesn't pay bills, doesn't contribute to groceries, and often takes portions of their food without being asked. The author says they usually give in to their friend's unspoken request, but they're wondering if they should stop sharing.\n\nFirst, I need to assess the dynamics here. The friend is living for free, which already sets up a power imbalance. The writer is the one handling all the responsibilities\u2014paying bills, groceries, transportation. The friend isn't contributing financially, which is a big deal. Now, when it comes to food, the friend is taking portions from the author's meals, even though there's enough food available. The author mentions that the friend doesn't outrightly ask but uses silent pressure (staring) until they comply.\n\nThe key points here are consent and boundaries. The author isn't being forced, but they feel obligated to share due to the friend's unspoken demands. The friend's behavior of staring until they get what they want is manipulative. The author might feel guilty or don't want to upset their friend, especially since they've put up with other issues like being loud or dirty. However, the author isn't in the wrong for not sharing. They have the right to set boundaries, especially since they're the one providing the resources. The friend's actions are more inconsiderate and taking advantage of the situation. The author shouldn't have to constantly give in to someone who isn't contributing equally to shared living expenses. So, the answer would be B (No, the author isn't in the wrong).\n"
