He doesn't pay any bills, he lives here for free. He doesn't pay for groceries. He doesn't have a car, I take us everywhere. \n\nSometimes he's loud, sometimes he's dirty and he smells, but I put up with it all because he's my best friend. \n\nNow, on to the question, everytime I eat he wants a portion of my meal. It's not like he doesn't have food either, I always make sure there's enough food for both of us - albeit not always the same type of food. He doesn't outrightly say anything, he usually just stares at me until either I give in or don't. Usually I do. \n\n[Pic for context.](https://i.imgur.com/8QJkJle.jpg)\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not sharing their food with their best friend. \n\nFirst, the situation: the friend lives with the author but doesn't pay any bills or groceries. The author provides transportation since the friend doesn't have a car. The friend is sometimes loud and messy but the author puts up with it because they're friends.\n\nThe main issue is the friend wanting a portion of the author's meal every time they eat. The author says they make sure there's enough food for both, even if not the same type. The friend doesn't outright ask but stares until the author gives in. \n\nSo, the author is being asked if they're at fault for not sharing. From my perspective, if the friend isn't contributing to the household expenses, including groceries, it's reasonable for the author to set boundaries. The friend's behavior of staring without asking might be passive-aggressive. The author is managing their own meals, which is their right. The friend's actions seem to be taking advantage of the situation. Therefore, the author isn't in the wrong for not sharing.\n"
