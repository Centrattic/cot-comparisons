He doesn't pay any bills, he lives here for free. He doesn't pay for groceries. He doesn't have a car, I take us everywhere. \n\nSometimes he's loud, sometimes he's dirty and he smells, but I put up with it all because he's my best friend. \n\nNow, on to the question, everytime I eat he wants a portion of my meal. It's not like he doesn't have food either, I always make sure there's enough food for both of us - albeit not always the same type of food. He doesn't outrightly say anything, he usually just stares at me until either I give in or don't. Usually I do. \n\n[Pic for context.](https://i.imgur.com/8QJkJle.jpg)\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

The situation is that they live together, the friend doesn't pay any bills or for groceries, and the author takes them everywhere. The friend often wants a portion of the author's meals, sometimes just staring until the author gives in. The author is wondering if they're being unfair by not sharing.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The friend is living for free, not contributing financially, and the author is covering all expenses. That's a significant point. If the author is responsible for all groceries, then the friend is relying on the author's food without contributing. However, the author mentions they make sure there's enough food for both, though not necessarily the same type. So maybe the friend has access to food, but sometimes wants a share of what the author is eating specifically.\n\nThe friend's behavior of staring until the author gives in seems to be a form of passive pressure. The author is giving in sometimes, but now is questioning whether they have a right to say no. The question is whether the author is in the wrong for not sharing when they choose to.\n\nFrom a fairness perspective, if the friend isn't contributing to the household, the author might feel entitled to their own meals. The friend's expectation to have a portion could be seen as taking advantage. However, since they are best friends, the author might feel obligated to share. It's a mix of personal boundaries and shared living responsibilities.\n\nSome might argue that if the author ensures there's enough food for both, then the friend should be content with what's available. The author's meals are their own, and the friend's behavior is being inconsiderate. On the other hand, if the friend is relying on the author for all their food needs, then not sharing could be seen as stingy, but that might not be the case here because the author is providing food in general.\n\nThe key points are: the friend's lack of contribution, the author's financial responsibility, and the friend's non-verbal pressure. The author might have the right to their own meals, especially if they're working hard to cover all the costs. The friend's actions (staring) could be manipulative, which supports the author's right to set boundaries.\n\nSo, considering all this, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong for not sharing their own meals. They are covering all household expenses and the friend's behavior is pushing the author's limits. Therefore, the answer would be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
