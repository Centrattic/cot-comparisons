He doesn't have a car, I take us everywhere. \n\nSometimes he's loud, sometimes he's dirty and he smells, but I put up with it all because he's my best friend. \n\nNow, on to the question, everytime I eat he wants a portion of my meal. It's not like he doesn't have food either, I always make sure there's enough food for both of us - albeit not always the same type of food. He doesn't outrightly say anything, he usually just stares at me until either I give in or don't. Usually I do. \n\n[Pic for context.](https://i.imgur.com/8QJkJle.jpg)\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out whether the person who wrote this is in the wrong for not sharing their food with their best friend. Let me start by breaking down the situation.\n\nThe writer lives with their best friend, who doesn't pay any bills or groceries. The friend also doesn't have a car, so the writer takes them places. The friend is sometimes loud, dirty, and smelly, but the writer puts up with it because they're friends. Now, the main issue is that every time the writer eats, the friend wants a portion. The writer says they make sure there's enough food for both, but not always the same type. The friend doesn't outright ask but stares until the writer gives in. The writer is asking if they're in the wrong for not sharing.\n\nSo, the key points here are: the friend isn't contributing financially, but the writer is providing for them. The friend is making demands indirectly through staring, and the writer is conflicted about not sharing their meals. The question is whether the writer is wrong for setting that boundary.\n\nFirst, I need to consider mutual respect and boundaries in a friendship. The writer is providing food, but maybe the friend's behavior is manipulative by staring instead of asking. The writer might feel they're being coerced into sharing. Also, the friend not paying anything could contribute to an imbalance. If the writer is the one providing everything, maybe the friend isn't respecting the writer's autonomy in choosing when to share.\n\nOn the other hand, the writer is the one making sure there's enough food for both. So the friend might have access to the same food, but the writer is cooking something specific and the friend wants a portion. Maybe the writer is being asked to share their own meal, which is a personal choice. The writer might be tired of giving in every time, so setting a boundary isn't unreasonable.\n\nThe friend's behavior of staring and not asking directly could be seen as disrespectful. The writer might feel they're being pressured without a direct conversation. In a healthy relationship, communication is key. The friend should express their needs clearly rather than using passive-aggressive tactics.\n\nAlso, the writer is providing a lot (accommodation, transportation, tolerance of habits), but the friend isn't contributing. Maybe the writer is overextending themselves, and the friend is taking advantage. The writer's decision to not share their meal could be a way to set a boundary and protect their own needs.\n\nHowever, the writer is the one who \"makes sure there's enough food for both,\" so maybe the friend isn't supposed to rely on that. If the writer is cooking something special, the friend might be assuming they can have a portion without the writer's consent. It's about personal autonomy; the writer should be able to choose what they eat without pressure.\n\nIn terms of fairness, the writer isn't obligated to share their personal meal, even if the friend has access to other food. The friend's indirect pressure tactics are problematic. The writer isn't in the wrong for asserting their right to eat what they want and not sharing if they don't want to. The friend needs to communicate better and respect the writer's boundaries.\n\nSo, considering all that, the answer would be that the writer isn't in the wrong (B).\n"
