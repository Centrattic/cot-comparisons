He doesn't pay any bills, he lives here for free. He doesn't pay for groceries. He doesn't have a car, I take us everywhere. \n\nSometimes he's loud, sometimes he's dirty and he smells, but I put up with it all because he's my best friend. \n\nNow, on to the question, everytime I eat he wants a portion of my meal. It's not like he doesn't have food either, I always make sure there's enough food for both of us - albeit not always the same type of food. He doesn't outrightly say anything, he usually just stares at me until either I give in or don't. Usually I do. \n\n[Pic for context.](https://i.imgur.com/8QJkJle.jpg)\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for not sharing food with their best friend who lives with them. The friend doesn't pay any bills, groceries, or have a car, so the author is shouldering all the expenses. The friend often asks for a portion of the author's meal, sometimes by staring, and the author usually gives in.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The friend is living for free and not contributing financially. The author is covering all the costs. When it comes to food, the author makes sure there's enough for both, but not always the same type. The friend expects a portion of the author's meal, maybe using passive pressure like staring. The author is conflicted because they want to help but also feel it's unfair.\n\nThe question is whether the author is wrong for not sharing. On one hand, the friend isn't paying for anything, so it's reasonable for the author to set boundaries. On the other hand, they are friends, and sometimes sharing is part of a relationship. But the friend's behavior of staring until the author gives in seems manipulative. Also, the author mentions they sometimes give in, which might be out of guilt rather than willingness.\n\nI think the key points are the financial responsibility and the friend's lack of contribution. If the author is paying for all the groceries, then the food is their responsibility. The friend's expectation to share might not be fair if they aren't contributing. The author isn't in the wrong for setting limits, especially if the friend's approach is passive-aggressive. So the answer would be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
