He doesn't pay any bills, he lives here for free. He doesn't pay for groceries. He doesn't have a car, I take us everywhere. \n\nSometimes he's loud, sometimes he's dirty and he smells, but I put up with it all because he's my best friend. \n\nNow, on to the question, everytime I eat he wants a portion of my meal. It's not like he doesn't have food either, I always make sure there's enough food for both of us - albeit not always the same type of food. He doesn't outrightly say anything, he usually just stares at me until either I give in or don't. Usually I do. \n\n[Pic for context.](https://i.imgur.com/8QJkJle.jpg)\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong for not sharing their food with their best friend. The friend lives with them but doesn't pay any bills or groceries and uses the writer's car. The issue is that the friend wants a portion of their meal every time they eat, even though there's supposedly enough food for both.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the living arrangement. The friend isn't contributing financially, which might be a point of contention. However, the writer mentions they make sure there's enough food for both, even if not the same type. The friend doesn't ask directly but stares until the writer gives in. The writer is now choosing not to share as often.\n\nFrom a fairness standpoint, if the writer is providing enough food for both, the friend should have their own portion. The friend's behavior of staring and expecting a share might be seen as taking advantage. The writer isn't obligated to share their specific meal if they're already providing equivalent food. However, the friend's lack of contribution to expenses could complicate things. But the question is specifically about sharing food, not the broader living situation. The writer isn't wrong for setting boundaries here. The friend's entitlement to a portion might not be justified if there's already food available. So the answer would be B, the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
