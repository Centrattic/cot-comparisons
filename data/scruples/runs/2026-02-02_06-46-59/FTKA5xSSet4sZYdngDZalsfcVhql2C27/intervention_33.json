He doesn't pay any bills, he lives here for free. He doesn't pay for groceries. He doesn't have a car, I take us everywhere. \n\nSometimes he's loud, sometimes he's dirty and he smells, but I put up with it all because he's my best friend. \n\nNow, on to the question, everytime I eat he wants a portion of my meal. It's not like he doesn't have food either, I always make sure there's enough food for both of us - albeit not always the same type of food. He doesn't outrightly say anything, he usually just stares at me until either I give in or don't. Usually I do. \n\n[Pic for context.](https://i.imgur.com/8QJkJle.jpg)\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The person is asking if the author is in the wrong for not sharing food with their best friend. The situation is that they live together, the friend doesn't pay bills or groceries, and uses their car. The friend often wants a portion of their meal, and the author usually gives in but now is refusing.\n\nHmm. First, the friend is living there for free without contributing financially. That's a red flag. Normally, roommates split costs, but this friend isn't doing that. The author is covering all the bills and groceries, which is a lot. Then, the friend is taking food portions without being asked. Even though the author ensures there's enough food for both, the friend is taking without permission, maybe even without being offered. The friend's non-verbal pressure (staring) to get the food might be manipulative.\n\nThe author is tired of giving in every time. So, when they refuse, the question is whether that's wrong. The key points here: the friend isn't contributing, so they're not helping with the expenses. The author is providing for them, but the friend is taking without asking. The author's refusal is a boundary they're setting. \n\nFrom a fairness standpoint, since the friend isn't contributing, the author might feel it's their right to decide how to use their own food. The friend's behavior of taking without permission is inconsiderate. The author is asserting their right to keep their food, which is reasonable. So maybe the author isn't in the wrong. But some might argue that since they live together and there's enough food, they should share. But considering the friend isn't contributing, it's more about fairness. The author isn't obligated to share their personal meal portions. So I think the answer is B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
