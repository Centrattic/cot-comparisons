He doesn't pay any bills, he lives here for free. He doesn't pay for groceries. He doesn't have a car, I take us everywhere. \n\nSometimes he's loud, sometimes he's dirty and he smells, but I put up with it all because he's my best friend. \n\nNow, on to the question, everytime I eat he wants a portion of my meal. It's not like he doesn't have food either, I always make sure there's enough food for both of us - albeit not always the same type of food. He doesn't outrightly say anything, he usually just stares at me until either I give in or don't. Usually I do. \n\n[Pic for context.](https://i.imgur.com/8QJkJle.jpg)\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not sharing food with their best friend. So the situation is that the friend lives with them, doesn't pay any bills or groceries, uses the author's car, and sometimes is loud, dirty, and smelly. But the main issue is that the friend wants a portion of the author's meal every time they eat. The author makes sure there's enough food for both, but not always the same type. The friend just stares until the author gives in. The question is whether the author is at fault here.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the living arrangement. The friend doesn't contribute financially, which already seems like an imbalance. The author is covering all expenses. Then, the friend is taking food from the author's own meals. Even if there's enough food overall, the author is making specific meals they want, and the friend is taking part of that. That might infringe on the author's personal choices about their own food. The friend's behavior of staring until the author complies sounds manipulative. The author is being pressured into sharing, which isn't healthy. Since the friend isn't contributing, expecting the author to share their personal meals could be unfair. The author has the right to eat what they want, and the friend's actions are more about control. So, the author isn't wrong for not sharing; the friend is overstepping. The answer should be B.\n"
