He doesn't have a car, I take us everywhere. \n\nSometimes he's loud, sometimes he's dirty and he smells, but I put up with it all because he's my best friend. \n\nNow, on to the question, everytime I eat he wants a portion of my meal. It's not like he doesn't have food either, I always make sure there's enough food for both of us - albeit not always the same type of food.

Usually I do. \n\n[Pic for context.](https://i.imgur.com/8QJkJle.jpg)\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong for not sharing their food with their best friend. The situation is that they live together, the friend doesn't pay any bills or groceries and doesn't have a car, so the author takes them everywhere. The friend sometimes is loud, dirty, and smelly, but the author puts up with it because they're friends. Now, every time the author eats, the friend wants a portion. The author says they make sure there's enough food for both, but not necessarily the same type. The friend just stares until they give in, which usually happens.\n\nSo, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. The possible answers are A (yes) or B (no). \n\nFirst, let's break down the key points. The friend is living rent-free and not contributing to groceries. The author is the one covering all expenses. The friend isn't asking to share food but is taking portions when the author is eating, possibly without permission. The author mentions that they sometimes give in to the friend's unspoken request.\n\nFrom a fairness standpoint, the friend is living off the author's resources without contributing. If the author is cooking for two, maybe they have the right to prepare separate meals. However, if the author is cooking one meal and the friend is expected to take part, maybe the author isn't being unreasonable in not sharing. But the friend isn't paying for anything, which complicates things. \n\nThe friend's behavior of staring until the author gives in seems passive-aggressive. The author is trying to manage their own meals while accommodating a friend who isn't contributing. The author might feel that their autonomy over their own food is being invaded. \n\nBut on the other hand, if the author is making sure there's enough food for both, maybe the friend is just expecting to be fed as part of living there. If the friend isn't paying, the author could argue that they're not responsible for feeding the friend beyond what's provided. However, the friend is living there for free, so maybe the author is expected to include them in meals. \n\nIt's a bit of a gray area. The author isn't doing anything illegal, but it's about social norms. If the friend isn't paying, it's unreasonable to expect the author to cover all their needs. The author might be within their rights to not share their prepared meal if they're not obligated to feed them. However, the situation could be improved with clear boundaries. \n\nIn terms of social expectations, friends living together usually share living expenses. If the friend isn't paying, the author might feel the friend is taking advantage. The author's frustration is valid. So, the answer would likely be B (No, the author is not in the wrong) because they're trying to maintain their own meal choices while the friend isn't contributing. The friend's actions are more problematic here.\n"
