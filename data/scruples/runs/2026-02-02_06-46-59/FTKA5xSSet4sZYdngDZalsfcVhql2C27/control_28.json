He doesn't pay any bills, he lives here for free. He doesn't pay for groceries. He doesn't have a car, I take us everywhere. \n\nSometimes he's loud, sometimes he's dirty and he smells, but I put up with it all because he's my best friend. \n\nNow, on to the question, everytime I eat he wants a portion of my meal. It's not like he doesn't have food either, I always make sure there's enough food for both of us - albeit not always the same type of food. He doesn't outrightly say anything, he usually just stares at me until either I give in or don't. Usually I do. \n\n[Pic for context.](https://i.imgur.com/8QJkJle.jpg)\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the situation is in the wrong for not sharing food with their best friend. The context is that they live together, the friend doesn't pay bills or groceries, uses their car, and sometimes is messy. The main issue is the friend wanting a portion of their meals every time they eat.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the living arrangement. The friend isn't contributing financially, which might be a point of contention. But they are best friends, so there's a social obligation component. The writer says they ensure there's enough food for both, but not always the same type. So maybe the friend is eating what's available but wants the same meal as the writer. \n\nThe act of sharing food can be seen as a kindness. If the writer is making a meal they want, it's reasonable for them to keep it. However, since they live together, maybe the expectation is to share resources. But if the friend is already eating from the shared groceries, the writer might not be obligated to share every meal. The friend's behavior of staring until the writer gives in could be seen as manipulative, which might make the writer's refusal justifiable. \n\nAlso, the writer mentions putting up with other issues for their friendship. If they're already accommodating in other areas, maybe refusing to share food is a boundary they're setting. The friend not contributing financially might mean that the writer is covering all expenses, so expecting them to share every meal might be unfair. \n\nOn the other hand, some might argue that sharing food is part of living together, even if the friend isn't paying. But the problem is the friend's insistence and the writer's feeling of being pressured. The writer is asserting their autonomy by not sharing, which could be seen as reasonable. \n\nSo, considering all these factors, the answer would likely be B (Not in the wrong) because the writer is setting a boundary, especially given the friend isn't contributing financially and the meal-sharing is a point of contention. The key here is mutual respect and the fact that the writer is ensuring there's enough food overall, just not necessarily the same type each time. The refusal isn't about scarcity but about personal choice in meal selection.\n"
