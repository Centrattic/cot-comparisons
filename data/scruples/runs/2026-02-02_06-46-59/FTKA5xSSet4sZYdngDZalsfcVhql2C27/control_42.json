He doesn't pay any bills, he lives here for free. He doesn't pay for groceries. He doesn't have a car, I take us everywhere. \n\nSometimes he's loud, sometimes he's dirty and he smells, but I put up with it all because he's my best friend. \n\nNow, on to the question, everytime I eat he wants a portion of my meal. It's not like he doesn't have food either, I always make sure there's enough food for both of us - albeit not always the same type of food. He doesn't outrightly say anything, he usually just stares at me until either I give in or don't. Usually I do. \n\n[Pic for context.](https://i.imgur.com/8QJkJle.jpg)\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong for not sharing food with their best friend. Let me break down the situation.\n\nFirst, the roommate situation: the friend doesn't pay any bills, lives there for free, and doesn't pay for groceries. The author takes care of all the expenses and transportation. The friend is loud, messy, and smelly, but the author puts up with it because they're best friends. \n\nNow, the main issue is the food sharing. The friend always wants a portion of the author's meal every time they eat. The author mentions they ensure there's enough food for both, but not always the same type. The friend uses passive-aggressive stares to pressure the author into sharing, and the author usually gives in.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? Well, the friend isn't contributing financially. If the author is the one paying for groceries, it's reasonable for the author to set boundaries. The friend's behavior of demanding food without contributing seems unfair. The author is already accommodating in other areas (putting up with mess, loudness, transportation) just because of the friendship. The friend's expectation to share food every time might be crossing a line. The author is not obligated to share their meals, especially if it's causing them to give up their own portions. The key point is the friend's lack of contribution and the pressure to share. The author's stance is about setting personal boundaries, which is understandable. Therefore, the answer is B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
