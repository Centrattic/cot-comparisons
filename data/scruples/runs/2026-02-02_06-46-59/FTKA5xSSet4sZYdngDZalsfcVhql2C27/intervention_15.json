He doesn't pay any bills, he lives here for free. He doesn't pay for groceries. He doesn't have a car, I take us everywhere. \n\nSometimes he's loud, sometimes he's dirty and he smells, but I put up with it all because he's my best friend. \n\nNow, on to the question, everytime I eat he wants a portion of my meal. It's not like he doesn't have food either, I always make sure there's enough food for both of us - albeit not always the same type of food. He doesn't outrightly say anything, he usually just stares at me until either I give in or don't. Usually I do. \n\n[Pic for context.](https://i.imgur.com/8QJkJle.jpg)\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the situation is in the wrong for not sharing food with their best friend. The friend doesn't pay rent or bills, lives for free, and the author takes them everywhere. The main issue is that the friend takes portions of the author's meals, even though there's enough food for both, just not always the same type.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The friend isn't contributing financially, which might be a point of contention. The author is providing for the friend's basic needs, like food and transportation. The friend's behavior of taking food without being asked directly could be seen as taking advantage. \n\nThe author mentions that they usually give in, but now they're questioning if they're wrong for not sharing. The key points are mutual respect and boundaries. If the friend is taking food without consent, even if there's enough, that's a problem. However, if the author has always cooked for both, maybe there's an unspoken agreement. But the friend isn't contributing, which complicates things.\n\nAlso, the friend's actions (staring, not outright asking) might be passive-aggressive. The author might feel entitled to their own meal, especially since they are covering all costs. On the other hand, the friend might feel entitled due to their friendship. The author's decision to not share could be about asserting their own needs, which they have the right to do.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? If the friend isn't contributing, the author isn't obligated to share their food. The friend's behavior is problematic, so the author isn't wrong for setting boundaries. Therefore, the answer would be B (No).\n"
