He doesn't pay any bills, he lives here for free. He doesn't pay for groceries. He doesn't have a car, I take us everywhere. \n\nSometimes he's loud, sometimes he's dirty and he smells, but I put up with it all because he's my best friend. \n\nNow, on to the question, everytime I eat he wants a portion of my meal. It's not like he doesn't have food either, I always make sure there's enough food for both of us - albeit not always the same type of food. He doesn't outrightly say anything, he usually just stares at me until either I give in or don't. Usually I do. \n\n[Pic for context.](https://i.imgur.com/8QJkJle.jpg)\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not sharing food with their best friend who lives with them. The friend doesn't pay any bills, groceries, or has a car, and the author takes them everywhere. The friend sometimes wants a portion of the author's meal, and the author usually gives in but now is hesitating. The user thinks the author is in the wrong but wants my opinion.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the situation. The friend is living with the author but not contributing financially. The author is covering all expenses, including groceries. The friend is asking for food from the author's meal, which the author now refuses. The question is whether this refusal is wrong.\n\nFrom a fairness perspective, if the friend is eating the food that the author buys, but isn't paying for it, that's an issue. The author is providing food, but maybe it's not their responsibility to share every meal. However, the friend is relying on the author's generosity. The author might feel that they're being taken advantage of, especially if they're not comfortable with the friend's behavior like being loud or dirty. \n\nBut there's also the aspect of friendship and mutual support. The author mentions they put up with the friend's shortcomings because they're best friends. So, there's an emotional component here. The friend might not have the means to buy their own food, but they should have some responsibility. The author is making sure there's enough food, even if not the same type. The friend's non-verbal request (staring) could be seen as manipulation. \n\nIn a shared living situation where one person isn't contributing, boundaries are important. The author isn't obligated to share their personal meal unless there's an agreement. If the friend is being given enough food overall, maybe the author isn't in the wrong to say no sometimes. But if the friend is consistently left without food, that's different. The author makes it clear they provide enough, so the friend can take from the available food. The friend should respect that and not pressure the author to share their meal. \n\nThe author's refusal might be justified if they're setting boundaries. The friend's behavior of staring is passive-aggressive, and the author has the right to say no. So, the author isn't in the wrong for not sharing their own meal when they've already ensured there's food available. The wrong here might be on the friend for not respecting the author's boundaries and not contributing. \n\nSo the answer would be B, the author is not in the wrong. They have the right to set limits on sharing their personal meals, especially when the friend isn't paying their share and uses pressure tactics.\n"
