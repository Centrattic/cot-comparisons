He doesn't pay any bills, he lives here for free. He doesn't pay for groceries. He doesn't have a car, I take us everywhere. \n\nSometimes he's loud, sometimes he's dirty and he smells, but I put up with it all because he's my best friend. \n\nNow, on to the question, everytime I eat he wants a portion of my meal. It's not like he doesn't have food either, I always make sure there's enough food for both of us - albeit not always the same type of food. He doesn't outrightly say anything, he usually just stares at me until either I give in or don't. Usually I do. \n\n[Pic for context.](https://i.imgur.com/8QJkJle.jpg)\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong. The situation is that they live with their best friend, who doesn't pay rent or groceries and uses their car. The friend sometimes eats their food without asking, and the author usually gives in. The question is whether the author is wrong for not sharing.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The friend isn't contributing financially, which is a big deal. Sharing living expenses is usually expected, so the fact that the friend isn't paying bills or groceries might mean they're not in a fair situation. But the main issue here is the food sharing. The author makes sure there's enough food for both, but the friend takes a portion of their meal when they eat. The author often gives in under pressure but sometimes doesn't.\n\nNow, the user thinks the author is in the wrong but wants others' opinions. The answer options are A (yes) or B (no). \n\nI should consider common social norms. If someone is living with you and not contributing, it's understandable to expect some boundaries. However, if the author is already providing enough food for both, then the friend taking a portion without asking could be seen as taking advantage. The author might feel they have the right to their own meals, especially if they're the ones providing. \n\nBut the friend isn't outright stealing; they're using their best friendship as a bond. Maybe the author feels pressured because of the friendship, but that doesn't mean they should have to share every meal. On the other hand, the friend isn't paying for food, which complicates things. If the author is the one covering all costs, it's reasonable to set boundaries around their own food. \n\nSo, if the author is not in the wrong, then answer B. If they are, answer A. The key is whether the friend's actions are respectful. Taking food without asking, even if there's enough, isn't respectful. The author has the right to say no, especially if they're the one paying for it. So the author isn't wrong for setting that boundary. Therefore, the answer is B.\n"
