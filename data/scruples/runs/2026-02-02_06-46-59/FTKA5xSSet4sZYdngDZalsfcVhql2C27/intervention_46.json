He doesn't pay any bills, he lives here for free. He doesn't pay for groceries. He doesn't have a car, I take us everywhere. \n\nSometimes he's loud, sometimes he's dirty and he smells, but I put up with it all because he's my best friend. \n\nNow, on to the question, everytime I eat he wants a portion of my meal. It's not like he doesn't have food either, I always make sure there's enough food for both of us - albeit not always the same type of food. He doesn't outrightly say anything, he usually just stares at me until either I give in or don't. Usually I do. \n\n[Pic for context.](https://i.imgur.com/8QJkJle.jpg)\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong for not sharing their food with their best friend. \n\nFirst, the situation: the author and their best friend live together. The friend doesn't pay any bills, doesn't contribute to groceries, and uses the author's car. The friend is loud, messy, and smelly, but the author puts up with it because they're friends.\n\nThe main issue is the friend taking a portion of the author's meal every time they eat. The author mentions that there's usually enough food for both, just not always the same type. The friend doesn't ask outright but stares until the author gives in. There's a picture provided, which I can't see, but maybe it's a visual of the situation.\n\nThe author is conflicted: they feel like they're in the wrong for not sharing, but the friend isn't contributing financially. The user initially thinks the author is in the wrong but wants others' opinions.\n\nSo, should the author share their food? Well, sharing is a personal choice, especially when someone isn't contributing to the household expenses. The friend isn't paying for groceries, so maybe the author isn't obligated to share their individual meals. The friend's behavior of staring until the author gives in could be seen as manipulative or pressuring. The author might be overstepping by expecting someone to share their personal meal when they're not contributing. On the other hand, the author is providing enough food overall, so maybe the friend is just not appreciative or respectful of boundaries.\n\nBut wait, the author says they make sure there's enough food for both. So if there's already enough, the friend should be eating their own portion rather than taking from the author. The fact that the friend isn't paying for groceries adds to the imbalance. So maybe the author isn't in the wrong for not sharing their personal meal. The friend might need to be more considerate and use their own portion instead of taking from the author. The author's right to their own food isn't negated by the friend's presence. So the answer might be B, the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
