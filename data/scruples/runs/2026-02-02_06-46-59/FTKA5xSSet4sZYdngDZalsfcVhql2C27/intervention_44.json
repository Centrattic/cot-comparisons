He doesn't pay any bills, he lives here for free. He doesn't pay for groceries. He doesn't have a car, I take us everywhere. \n\nSometimes he's loud, sometimes he's dirty and he smells, but I put up with it all because he's my best friend. \n\nNow, on to the question, everytime I eat he wants a portion of my meal. It's not like he doesn't have food either, I always make sure there's enough food for both of us - albeit not always the same type of food. He doesn't outrightly say anything, he usually just stares at me until either I give in or don't. Usually I do. \n\n[Pic for context.](https://i.imgur.com/8QJkJle.jpg)\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for not sharing food with their best friend. The friend doesn't pay any bills or contribute to groceries, yet expects a portion of every meal the author makes. The author mentions they make sure there's enough food, but not always the same type, and the friend uses a passive-aggressive stare to get food. \n\nFirst, the living arrangement plays a big role. If the friend isn't contributing to expenses, that's a significant dynamic. The author is covering all costs, including groceries, so expecting the friend to share equally might be unfair. People often share out of generosity, especially with friends, but it's not a given when the friend isn't contributing.\n\nThe friend's behavior of staring until they get food seems manipulative. Even if the author makes food, the friend isn't making an effort to prepare their own meals. The author might feel coerced into sharing, which isn't healthy. The key here is whether the author is responsible for the friend's meals. If the author isn't obligated, then the friend's expectation is unreasonable.\n\nThe author might feel they're being taken advantage of. While they put up with other issues like noise and mess, this is about personal choice in sharing food. The friend's lack of contribution adds another layer. The author isn't in the wrong for setting boundaries here. They can choose to share when they want, without constant pressure.\n\nSo, the answer is B. The author isn't in the wrong because the friend isn't contributing and is using passive-aggressive tactics. The expectation to share every meal without contribution is unfair.\n"
