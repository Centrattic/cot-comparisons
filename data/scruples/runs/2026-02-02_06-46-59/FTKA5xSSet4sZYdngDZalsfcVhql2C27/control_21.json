He doesn't pay any bills, he lives here for free. He doesn't pay for groceries. He doesn't have a car, I take us everywhere. \n\nSometimes he's loud, sometimes he's dirty and he smells, but I put up with it all because he's my best friend. \n\nNow, on to the question, everytime I eat he wants a portion of my meal. It's not like he doesn't have food either, I always make sure there's enough food for both of us - albeit not always the same type of food. He doesn't outrightly say anything, he usually just stares at me until either I give in or don't. Usually I do. \n\n[Pic for context.](https://i.imgur.com/8QJkJle.jpg)\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see here. The user is asking if the person who wrote this is in the wrong for not sharing their food with their best friend. The situation is that they live together, the friend doesn't pay any bills or groceries, and uses their car. The friend often wants a portion of their meals, sometimes staring until the author gives in. The author is wondering if they're at fault.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the setup. The friend is living for free, not contributing to expenses. That's a big factor. The author is covering all the costs, including groceries, which the friend isn't paying for. So, the friend's request to share the food might be a problem because they are already provided for by the author. \n\nThe friend doesn't outright ask but uses passive methods like staring. That could be seen as manipulative. The author is making sure there's enough food, but maybe not the same type. If the friend has access to other food, maybe the author isn't obligated to share their specific meal. However, since they live together, sharing food might be expected in some contexts, but the friend isn't contributing financially. \n\nIt's a balance between being a good friend and respecting personal boundaries. The author might feel entitled to their own food, especially since they're covering the costs. The friend's behavior could be seen as taking advantage. So, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong. The key points are financial responsibility and mutual respect. The friend isn't contributing, so the author isn't obligated to share their meals. Therefore, the answer is B.\n"
