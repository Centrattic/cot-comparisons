He doesn't pay any bills, he lives here for free. He doesn't pay for groceries. He doesn't have a car, I take us everywhere. \n\nSometimes he's loud, sometimes he's dirty and he smells, but I put up with it all because he's my best friend. \n\nNow, on to the question, everytime I eat he wants a portion of my meal. It's not like he doesn't have food either, I always make sure there's enough food for both of us - albeit not always the same type of food. He doesn't outrightly say anything, he usually just stares at me until either I give in or don't. Usually I do. \n\n[Pic for context.](https://i.imgur.com/8QJkJle.jpg)\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, so the user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not sharing their food with their best friend. Let me try to break this down.\n\nFirst, the situation: They live together, the friend doesn't pay bills or groceries, uses the author's car, and sometimes is loud or smelly. The main issue is that the friend wants a portion of the author's meal every time they eat. The author usually gives in but now is questioning if they're wrong for not always sharing.\n\nHmm, the key points here are about fairness and boundaries. The friend isn't contributing financially, so maybe the author feels they're covering all costs. If the author is making sure there's enough food in general, maybe the friend could eat from that instead of taking from the author's meals. But the friend is being passive-aggressive with staring until the author complies.\n\nI think the author isn't wrong because they're not obligated to share their personal meal. The friend's behavior of not paying for anything and expecting food might be unfair. The author is setting boundaries by sometimes not giving in. The friend's approach of staring is manipulative. So the answer should be B (No, the author isn't in the wrong). They have the right to keep their own food, especially when the friend isn't contributing. But maybe I should check if there's an implicit agreement about sharing. Since the author mentions they ensure there's enough food for both, maybe the friend should rely on that instead of taking from the author's plate. Yeah, I think B is correct here."
