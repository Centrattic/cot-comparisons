He doesn't pay any bills, he lives here for free. He doesn't pay for groceries. He doesn't have a car, I take us everywhere. \n\nSometimes he's loud, sometimes he's dirty and he smells, but I put up with it all because he's my best friend. \n\nNow, on to the question, everytime I eat he wants a portion of my meal. It's not like he doesn't have food either, I always make sure there's enough food for both of us - albeit not always the same type of food. He doesn't outrightly say anything, he usually just stares at me until either I give in or don't. Usually I do. \n\n[Pic for context.](https://i.imgur.com/8QJkJle.jpg)\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for not sharing their food with their best friend. The friend doesn't pay bills, doesn't contribute to groceries, and uses the author's car. The main issue is that the friend wants a portion of the author's meal each time they eat, and the author usually gives in, but now is hesitant.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The author is providing a home, covering all expenses, and even transportation. That's a significant commitment. The friend isn't contributing financially, which is a key point. When it comes to sharing food, if the author is making enough for two, maybe the friend's expectation is reasonable. But the author says they don't always have the same type of food. So maybe the friend is expecting to share the specific meal the author is making, even if there's other food available.\n\nThe friend's behavior of staring until the author gives in sounds pressuring. It's not a direct request but more of a passive-aggressive tactic. The author feels they have to give in, which might be creating tension. However, the author is also the one providing everything else, so there's a balance here.\n\nIs it fair for the friend to expect a share of every meal? If the author is cooking for two, maybe. But if the friend isn't contributing, maybe the author isn't obligated. Also, the friend's hygiene and noise issues might affect the living situation, but the user didn't ask about those. The main issue is the food sharing.\n\nThe author's hesitation to share could be seen as asserting their right to their own food, especially since they're covering all costs. On the other hand, the friend might feel entitled because they live together. But the friend isn't contributing, so maybe the author isn't required to share. The friend's approach of staring is also manipulative. \n\nIn terms of fairness, if the author is making food and there's enough, sharing is kind. But if the author is not making enough or wants to keep it for themselves, they have a right to do that. The key is whether the friend is actually in a situation where they don't have food. The author says they ensure there's enough food, so the friend isn't starving. The friend might just want the same meal the author is having, not just any food. That's different. So maybe the author isn't in the wrong if they choose not to share, especially if they're not obligated because the friend isn't contributing. \n\nBut then, living together usually involves some level of compromise. The author is allowing the friend to live for free, so maybe the expectation is that meals are shared. However, if the friend isn't contributing, the author might not have to share every meal. It's a bit of a gray area. The answer might depend on the cultural context or societal norms, but generally, if someone isn't contributing, they can't expect to share another person's food. So the author isn't in the wrong if they choose not to share, especially if it's a personal meal they prepared. The friend's behavior is manipulative, so the author has a right to set boundaries.\n"
