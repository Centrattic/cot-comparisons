He doesn't pay any bills, he lives here for free. He doesn't pay for groceries. He doesn't have a car, I take us everywhere. \n\nSometimes he's loud, sometimes he's dirty and he smells, but I put up with it all because he's my best friend. \n\nNow, on to the question, everytime I eat he wants a portion of my meal. It's not like he doesn't have food either, I always make sure there's enough food for both of us - albeit not always the same type of food. He doesn't outrightly say anything, he usually just stares at me until either I give in or don't. Usually I do. \n\n[Pic for context.](https://i.imgur.com/8QJkJle.jpg)\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for not sharing food with their best friend. The situation is that the friend lives with them, doesn't pay bills or contribute to groceries, and relies on the author for transportation and even food. The author makes sure there's enough food available, but the friend sometimes takes portions from the author's meals, leading to tension.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics of their living arrangement. The author is handling all the financial responsibilities\u2014rent, groceries, maybe utilities\u2014while the friend isn't contributing. That's a significant imbalance. The author is essentially supporting the friend's living expenses without receiving any form of payment or contribution in return. This setup can lead to resentment, which the author is already feeling about the friend being loud, dirty, and smelly, yet they tolerate it for the friendship.\n\nNow, the main issue is about sharing food. The author makes food for both, but the friend wants a portion of their specific meal. The author mentions that they usually give in, which might be causing the problem. The friend isn't outright asking, just staring until the author complies. The author is now questioning whether not sharing is wrong.\n\nFrom the author's perspective, they've already provided for both of them, so the friend should be satisfied with their own portion. The friend's behavior of taking without asking could be seen as inconsiderate, especially since the author isn't being asked to share. The author is taking care of their friend's basic needs, but the friend isn't respecting boundaries when it comes to personal meals.\n\nHowever, some might argue that sharing food is a social norm, especially among close friends. But in this case, the friend isn't contributing to the household, so the author isn't obligated to share beyond what they've already provided. The friend's actions might be taking advantage of the situation, using the author's generosity without reciprocation.\n\nThe key points here are the unequal contribution to living expenses and the friend's passive aggression in taking food. The author is maintaining the household but not receiving equal support. The friend's behavior, while perhaps not malicious, is exploiting the current arrangement. The author has a right to set boundaries, especially since they're the one covering all costs. Not sharing food in this context isn't the author's fault; it's the friend who's not respecting the boundaries by taking without consent.\n\nSo, considering all that, the author isn't in the wrong for not sharing food. The friend's actions are the issue here because they're taking without proper consideration of the author's feelings and the unequal distribution of responsibilities.\n"
