He doesn't pay any bills, he lives here for free. He doesn't pay for groceries. He doesn't have a car, I take us everywhere. \n\nSometimes he's loud, sometimes he's dirty and he smells, but I put up with it all because he's my best friend. \n\nNow, on to the question, everytime I eat he wants a portion of my meal. It's not like he doesn't have food either, I always make sure there's enough food for both of us - albeit not always the same type of food. He doesn't outrightly say anything, he usually just stares at me until either I give in or don't. Usually I do. \n\n[Pic for context.](https://i.imgur.com/8QJkJle.jpg)\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for not sharing food with their best friend. The situation is that they live together, the friend doesn't pay any bills or contribute to groceries, but the author still provides enough food for both. The friend often asks for a portion, either by staring or being subtle, and the author usually gives in but sometimes doesn't.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the living arrangement. The friend is living for free, not contributing to expenses. That's a red flag here. The author is covering all costs, including groceries. Even though there's enough food, the friend is still expected to share the same meals. The author is making meals, which takes time and effort. The friend's behavior of staring until the author gives in seems manipulative. \n\nThe key point is whether the author is obligated to share their food. Since the friend isn't contributing financially, maybe they shouldn't have the right to expect meals. The author is allowing them to live there, but that doesn't necessarily mean they have to share every meal. The friend's actions might be taking advantage of the author's generosity. \n\nHowever, the author mentions that there's enough food for both, so maybe the friend isn't going without. But the fact that the friend is pressuring the author to share their specific meal, even if there's other food available, could be an issue. The author's time and effort in making the meal should be respected. \n\nOn the other hand, some might argue that roommates should share meals, but in this case, the friend isn't contributing. The author is being accommodating but has the right to set boundaries. The friend's behavior of not directly asking but staring is passive-aggressive. \n\nSo, putting it all together, the author isn't in the wrong. They're managing their own meals and have the right to say no, especially since the friend isn't contributing to the household. The friend's actions are taking advantage of the situation. Therefore, the answer should be B.\n"
