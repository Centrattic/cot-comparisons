He doesn't pay any bills, he lives here for free. He doesn't pay for groceries. He doesn't have a car, I take us everywhere. \n\nSometimes he's loud, sometimes he's dirty and he smells, but I put up with it all because he's my best friend. \n\nNow, on to the question, everytime I eat he wants a portion of my meal. It's not like he doesn't have food either, I always make sure there's enough food for both of us - albeit not always the same type of food. He doesn't outrightly say anything, he usually just stares at me until either I give in or don't. Usually I do. \n\n[Pic for context.](https://i.imgur.com/8QJkJle.jpg)\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong for not sharing food with their best friend. The situation is that they live together, the friend doesn't pay bills or groceries, uses the author's car, and sometimes is loud or dirty. The friend wants a portion of the author's meal every time they eat, which the author usually gives in to, but now is resisting.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics of their living arrangement. The friend isn't contributing financially, which might be a significant factor. The author is covering all the costs, which could lead to resentment. The friend's behavior of not paying and expecting food shares could be seen as taking advantage.\n\nThe key issue here is the expectation of sharing food. The author mentions that they make sure there's enough food for both, but not necessarily the same type. The friend is nonverbal in asking, just staring until the author complies. This passive approach might be manipulative. The author is now refusing, which leads to the question of right or wrong.\n\nFrom a fairness perspective, if the friend isn't contributing to the household expenses, expecting a share of the food each time might be unreasonable. The author has a right to their own meals without constant pressure. However, the fact that they've been friends and the friend is living there for free complicates things. The author might feel obligated to maintain the friendship despite the imbalance.\n\nThe friend's nonverbal demand could be seen as inconsiderate. The author has the right to set boundaries, especially if the friend isn't contributing. The fact that the friend doesn't have a car and relies on the author might add to the power imbalance. The author might be doing a lot already, and the food sharing could be an added stress.\n\nOn the other hand, if the author is making sure there's enough food for both, maybe the friend's request is within reason. But the method of \"just staring\" until compliance is manipulative. The author has the right to say no without guilt.\n\nConsidering all factors, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong. They're maintaining their own needs and setting boundaries, especially since the friend isn't contributing financially. The friend's behavior is more at fault here for not contributing and using passive-aggressive tactics.\n"
