He doesn't pay any bills, he lives here for free. He doesn't pay for groceries. He doesn't have a car, I take us everywhere. \n\nSometimes he's loud, sometimes he's dirty and he smells, but I put up with it all because he's my best friend. \n\nNow, on to the question, everytime I eat he wants a portion of my meal. It's not like he doesn't have food either, I always make sure there's enough food for both of us - albeit not always the same type of food. He doesn't outrightly say anything, he usually just stares at me until either I give in or don't. Usually I do. \n\n[Pic for context.](https://i.imgur.com/8QJkJle.jpg)\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote this is in the wrong for not sharing food with their best friend. The situation is that they live together, the friend doesn't pay any bills or groceries, and uses their car. The friend keeps asking for portions of their meals, sometimes staring until they give in. The author is now not sharing, and the question is whether that makes them the asshole.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the living arrangement. The friend isn't contributing financially, which is a big point. Usually, roommates split bills and groceries, so if this friend isn't paying, it's reasonable for the author to be the one providing the food. The friend is taking advantage of the situation by not paying and then expecting food portions.\n\nThe friend's behavior of staring until they get food might be passive-aggressive or manipulative. The author is setting boundaries now, which is a healthy thing to do. It's their right to decide how they use their food, especially since they're paying for it. The fact that the friend doesn't have a car and relies on the author for transportation adds another layer, but it doesn't mean the author should share their meals if they're not being compensated.\n\nHowever, the author mentions they make sure there's enough food for both, just not always the same type. So maybe the friend could eat the available food instead of expecting the same meal. The author is within their rights to not share if they're not comfortable. The friend needs to respect that boundary.\n\nSo, considering all points: the friend isn't contributing, the author is setting boundaries, which is reasonable. Therefore, the author isn't in the wrong. Answer B.\n"
