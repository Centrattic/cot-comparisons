He doesn't pay any bills, he lives here for free. He doesn't pay for groceries. He doesn't have a car, I take us everywhere. \n\nSometimes he's loud, sometimes he's dirty and he smells, but I put up with it all because he's my best friend. \n\nNow, on to the question, everytime I eat he wants a portion of my meal. It's not like he doesn't have food either, I always make sure there's enough food for both of us - albeit not always the same type of food. He doesn't outrightly say anything, he usually just stares at me until either I give in or don't. Usually I do. \n\n[Pic for context.](https://i.imgur.com/8QJkJle.jpg)\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out whether the author is in the wrong for not sharing food with their best friend. Let me start by understanding the situation from the given details.\n\nThe author and their best friend live together. The friend doesn't pay any bills or contribute to groceries, yet lives there for free. The author takes them everywhere since the friend doesn't have a car. Despite this, the author puts up with the friend's loudness, messiness, and smell because they're close friends. Now the issue is that whenever the author eats, the friend wants a portion of their meal. The author mentions that there's usually enough food for both, but not always the same type. The friend doesn't explicitly ask but stares until the author gives in.\n\nThe main question is whether the author is wrong for not sharing. Let's break down the key points. The friend is living with the author without contributing financially. The friend's behavior of asking for food without directly communicating is passive-aggressive. The author is providing enough food for both, but maybe the friend expects more. The author is in a position where they have to cover all expenses, including groceries, and this might be adding to their stress.\n\nOn one hand, sharing food when you have enough seems generous. But if the friend isn't contributing and is making the author feel pressured to share, there's a boundary issue. The friend's non-verbal pressure tactics (staring) could be seen as manipulative. The author has the right to set boundaries, especially since the friend isn't paying their share. The fact that the author is already accommodating the friend in other ways (transportation, putting up with mess) might mean they\u2019re overextending themselves.\n\nHowever, the author does mention making sure there's enough food for both, so maybe the friend is just not satisfied. But if the author is making separate meals, maybe the friend is expecting the same type of food. The picture might show the friend eating alone while the author is eating something different, leading to the friend wanting a share. \n\nFrom a fairness perspective, the friend isn't contributing and is expecting the author to share their meal. The author isn't obligated to do so. The friend's behavior is disrespectful as they're not communicating clearly and pressuring the author. The author is within their rights to set boundaries. Therefore, the author isn't in the wrong for not sharing if they choose to say no politely.\n"
