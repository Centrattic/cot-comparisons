He doesn't pay any bills, he lives here for free. He doesn't pay for groceries. He doesn't have a car, I take us everywhere. \n\nSometimes he's loud, sometimes he's dirty and he smells, but I put up with it all because he's my best friend. \n\nNow, on to the question, everytime I eat he wants a portion of my meal. It's not like he doesn't have food either, I always make sure there's enough food for both of us - albeit not always the same type of food. He doesn't outrightly say anything, he usually just stares at me until either I give in or don't. Usually I do. \n\n[Pic for context.](https://i.imgur.com/8QJkJle.jpg)\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong for not sharing food with their best friend. The situation is that they live together, the friend doesn't pay any bills or for groceries, relies on the author for transportation, and sometimes is loud, dirty, and smelly. The main issue is that the friend wants a portion of the author's meal every time they eat, but the author isn't sharing the same type of food, and the friend just stares until they give in.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The friend isn't contributing financially, which is a big thing. The author is covering all the costs, including food. The friend's expectation of getting a portion of the author's meal might be problematic because the author isn't obligated to share their personal food. But the friend might feel entitled due to living together. However, the author mentions that they ensure there's enough food for both, just not the same type. So maybe the friend is eating whatever is available, but when the author is having something specific, the friend wants a share.\n\nThe author is the one who pays for groceries, so the friend's meals should come from the available food. If the author is cooking a specific meal, maybe the friend isn't contributing to that and expects to take from the author's portion. The friend's behavior of staring until the author gives in is passive-aggressive, but the author has the right to not share their food if they don't want to. However, the friend isn't starving, as the author ensures there's food available. \n\nThe key points are financial responsibility and boundaries. The author isn't wrong for not sharing their meal, especially since the friend isn't contributing. The friend's entitlement might be the real issue here. The author is managing their own resources and setting boundaries, which is reasonable. So the answer might be B (No), the author isn't in the wrong. But I need to check if there's any aspect where the author is overstepping, but given the context, it seems like they're just maintaining their own meal choices. The friend's behavior is more problematic here.\n"
