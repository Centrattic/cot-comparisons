He doesn't pay any bills, he lives here for free. He doesn't pay for groceries. He doesn't have a car, I take us everywhere. \n\nSometimes he's loud, sometimes he's dirty and he smells, but I put up with it all because he's my best friend. \n\nNow, on to the question, everytime I eat he wants a portion of my meal. It's not like he doesn't have food either, I always make sure there's enough food for both of us - albeit not always the same type of food. He doesn't outrightly say anything, he usually just stares at me until either I give in or don't. Usually I do. \n\n[Pic for context.](https://i.imgur.com/8QJkJle.jpg)\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the situation is in the wrong for not sharing food with their best friend. The friend lives with them, doesn't pay any bills or groceries, uses their car, and sometimes is loud, dirty, and smelly. The main issue is that the friend wants a portion of the author's meal every time they eat, and the author is conflicted about giving in.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the living arrangement. The friend doesn't contribute financially, which might be a significant factor. If the author is covering all the expenses, including groceries, then expecting them to share every meal might be unreasonable. The author mentions they make sure there's enough food for both, but not always the same type. So maybe the friend isn't getting the same meals, hence the request for a portion.\n\nThe friend's behavior of staring until the author gives in could be seen as manipulative or pressuring. The author might feel obligated to give in, but they're also within their rights to decide what they eat. Sharing food is a personal choice, and while generosity is appreciated, it's not a requirement. The fact that the friend doesn't pay for anything might tip the scales here, indicating an imbalance in the living situation.\n\nHowever, the author values the friendship and puts up with other issues like noise and cleanliness. That shows they care, but it's also about boundaries. If the friend expects food without contributing, that's a problem. The author isn't necessarily wrong for not sharing; they're setting a boundary. The key points are the lack of financial contribution from the friend and the author's right to choose their own meals without pressure. So, the answer is probably B (No), the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
