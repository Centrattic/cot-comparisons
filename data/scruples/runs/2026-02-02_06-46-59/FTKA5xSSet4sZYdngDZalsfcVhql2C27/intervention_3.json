He doesn't pay any bills, he lives here for free. He doesn't pay for groceries. He doesn't have a car, I take us everywhere. \n\nSometimes he's loud, sometimes he's dirty and he smells, but I put up with it all because he's my best friend. \n\nNow, on to the question, everytime I eat he wants a portion of my meal. It's not like he doesn't have food either, I always make sure there's enough food for both of us - albeit not always the same type of food. He doesn't outrightly say anything, he usually just stares at me until either I give in or don't. Usually I do. \n\n[Pic for context.](https://i.imgur.com/8QJkJle.jpg)\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person (who's sharing food with their best friend) is in the wrong. The situation is that they live together, the friend doesn't pay bills or groceries, uses their car, and now takes portions from the author's meals. The author feels they're not in the wrong, but the friend just stares until they give in.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the elements here. The key points are the living arrangement, financial contributions, and the food-sharing issue. The author is the one covering all the expenses, which is a big factor. The friend is taking food without contributing, even though there's enough for both but not the same type. The author sometimes gives in because of the stare.\n\nNow, the question is about whether the author is in the wrong. The user initially thinks the author is wrong, but the friend isn't contributing. The author is making sure there's enough food, but the friend is taking from their own meal. So, if the author is cooking for both, maybe they should share. But if the author is making their own meal and the friend is taking from it without being asked, that's different. The picture might show the friend taking a portion, but since I can't see the image, I have to rely on the description.\n\nThe author is in a position where they're covering all the costs, so their food is their own. The friend's behavior of taking without asking and using a stare to pressure them is controlling and maybe even a bit manipulative. The author has the right to not share their meal if they're not comfortable. The friend's actions could be seen as entitled. So, the author isn't in the wrong for not sharing when it's their own meal. They can choose to share if they want, but they shouldn't have to if they don't. The friend should be responsible for their own food, especially since they don't contribute financially. So the answer would be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
