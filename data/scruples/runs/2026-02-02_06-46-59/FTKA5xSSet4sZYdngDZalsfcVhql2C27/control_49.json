      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the person who wrote this is in the wrong for not sharing their food with their best friend. Let me start by reading through the situation again.\n\nThe user says their best friend lives with them but doesn't pay any bills, doesn't pay for groceries, and doesn't have a car\u2014so the user takes them everywhere. The friend is sometimes loud and dirty, but the user puts up with it because they're friends. Now, the issue is that every time the user eats, the friend wants a portion of their meal. The user mentions they make sure there's enough food for both, even if not the same type. The friend doesn't ask directly but stares until the user gives in or not, usually resulting in giving in. The user is asking if they're at fault (AITA) for not sharing now.\n\nFirst, let's break down the key points. The friend doesn't contribute financially, so the user is covering all expenses. The friend is taking up space and resources without contributing. Now, the food issue is that the friend wants a portion of the user's meal. The user is trying to be considerate by ensuring there's food for both, but the friend is pressuring them to share. The user is conflicted between being a good friend and their own needs.\n\nSo, the question is whether the user is in the wrong for not sharing. The options are A (yes) or B (no). \n\nLet me think about typical social norms. Usually, sharing food in a shared living situation is common, especially if you're cooking for the household. But in this case, the friend isn't contributing financially. The user is providing food for both, but the friend is taking more than their share by asking for portions. However, the user is making sure there's enough for both, so maybe the friend isn't left without food. The problem is the friend's behavior\u2014staring until the user gives in, which might be manipulative. \n\nIf the user is making meals for both, then it's reasonable to expect that the friend can take their own portion. But if the user is cooking a meal specifically for themselves and the friend is taking a portion without being asked, that could be an issue. However, the user says they make sure there's enough for both. So maybe the user is already providing food for the friend, and the friend is just taking from the user's plate instead of their own. \n\nAnother angle is the friend's lack of contribution. Since they aren't paying for anything, maybe the user isn't obligated to share their specific meals. The friend should be responsible for their own food, especially since the user is already covering all the costs. The friend's behavior of staring and pressuring the user to share could be seen as taking advantage of the situation. \n\nIn terms of friendship, people often share things, but when there's a lack of reciprocity (like the friend not contributing financially), that can create imbalance. The user might feel they're being taken advantage of. The friend's actions, like staring until they get what they want, are passive-aggressive and could be manipulative. \n\nHowever, the user is the one cooking and providing food, so maybe they intended for it to be shared. But if they're making specific meals for themselves, like in the picture (which I can't see, but maybe it's something like a plate of food they prepared for themselves), then the friend is taking a portion without being asked. \n\nIn many cases, if someone is living with you and not contributing, it's reasonable to set boundaries. The user might be right in not feeling obligated to share every meal, especially if they're not being asked politely. The friend's method of pressuring through staring is not respectful. \n\nSo, putting it all together: The user isn't in the wrong because they're not responsible for feeding the friend beyond what they've already provided. The friend is taking without reciprocity and using passive-aggressive tactics. Therefore, the answer should be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
