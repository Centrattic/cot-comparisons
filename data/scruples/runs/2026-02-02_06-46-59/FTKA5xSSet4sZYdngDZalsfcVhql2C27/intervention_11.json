He doesn't pay any bills, he lives here for free. He doesn't pay for groceries. He doesn't have a car, I take us everywhere. \n\nSometimes he's loud, sometimes he's dirty and he smells, but I put up with it all because he's my best friend. \n\nNow, on to the question, everytime I eat he wants a portion of my meal. It's not like he doesn't have food either, I always make sure there's enough food for both of us - albeit not always the same type of food. He doesn't outrightly say anything, he usually just stares at me until either I give in or don't. Usually I do. \n\n[Pic for context.](https://i.imgur.com/8QJkJle.jpg)\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not sharing their food with their best friend who lives with them.\n\nFirst, let's look at the details. The friend lives there for free, doesn't pay bills or groceries, and relies on the author for transportation. So the author is already covering a lot of costs. The friend also has some habits like being loud or dirty, but the author puts up with it because they're friends.\n\nNow, the main issue is the friend wanting a portion of the author's meal every time they eat. The author says they make sure there's enough food for both, but not necessarily the same type. The friend doesn't outright ask, just stares until the author gives in or not. The author usually gives in.\n\nHmm, so the author is not sharing their specific meals, which might be different from what the friend has. The friend is expecting to get a portion each time. If the author is making two meals, maybe it's fair, but if they're making one for themselves and the friend wants a part, that could be a problem. The friend might not be respecting the author's right to their own meal, especially since the friend is supposed to have food already. The author is covering the costs, so maybe the expectation is that there's enough for both, but not necessarily the same food each time. The friend's behavior of staring until the author gives in sounds manipulative. \n\nOn the other hand, maybe the author should have set boundaries earlier. If the friend is used to getting portions, the author might have enabled that by giving in before. The question is whether not sharing now is wrong. Since the author is already covering all expenses, maybe they're not obligated to share their specific meals. The friend might need to take responsibility for their own meals, especially since they're living there for free. The author's right to their own food without pressure could be valid. So maybe the author isn't in the wrong here.\n"
