He doesn't pay any bills, he lives here for free. He doesn't pay for groceries. He doesn't have a car, I take us everywhere. \n\nSometimes he's loud, sometimes he's dirty and he smells, but I put up with it all because he's my best friend. \n\nNow, on to the question, everytime I eat he wants a portion of my meal. It's not like he doesn't have food either, I always make sure there's enough food for both of us - albeit not always the same type of food. He doesn't outrightly say anything, he usually just stares at me until either I give in or don't. Usually I do. \n\n[Pic for context.](https://i.imgur.com/8QJkJle.jpg)\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for not sharing food with their best friend. The situation is that they live together, the friend doesn't pay any bills or groceries, uses the author's car, and sometimes is loud or dirty. However, the friend often wants a portion of the author's meal and stares until they give in.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The author is providing shelter, transportation, and groceries for free. That's a significant contribution. If the author is making sure there's enough food for both, maybe not the same type, but sufficient, then the friend is not left without food. The issue is the friend wanting a portion of the author's specific meal each time. \n\nSharing meals can be a social norm, but it's also about personal boundaries. The author might feel that their own meals are their own choice, especially if they prepared them. The friend not paying for anything might mean they should be more considerate of the author's resources. However, the friend is using the author's generosity in other ways (free stay, groceries, transportation), so expecting some level of shared food might be part of the unspoken agreement.\n\nBut the author is setting boundaries by not always giving in. The friend's behavior of staring until they give in could be seen as manipulative. The author has the right to choose whether to share their prepared meals. Since the author is already covering all the costs, they might not be in the wrong for not sharing every time, especially if the friend isn't contributing. However, the friend's actions might be part of the problem here. \n\nSo the key points are: the author is providing everything, the friend isn't contributing, and the friend's insistence on getting food from the author's meals. The author's refusal isn't necessarily wrong because they've already made sure there's food available. The friend's expectations might be unreasonable given the lack of contribution. Therefore, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
