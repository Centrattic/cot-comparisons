He doesn't pay any bills, he lives here for free. He doesn't pay for groceries. He doesn't have a car, I take us everywhere. \n\nSometimes he's loud, sometimes he's dirty and he smells, but I put up with it all because he's my best friend. \n\nNow, on to the question, everytime I eat he wants a portion of my meal. It's not like he doesn't have food either, I always make sure there's enough food for both of us - albeit not always the same type of food. He doesn't outrightly say anything, he usually just stares at me until either I give in or don't. Usually I do. \n\n[Pic for context.](https://i.imgur.com/8QJkJle.jpg)\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person in the situation is in the wrong for not sharing food with their best friend. The friend doesn't pay bills or groceries, lives for free, and the author is the one handling all the expenses and transportation. Now, every time the author eats, the friend wants a portion. The author sometimes gives in, but isn't sure if they're wrong for not always sharing.\n\nHmm. First, I need to consider the dynamics here. The friend isn't contributing financially at all. That's a big point. If the author is covering all the costs, including groceries, then the friend isn't paying their share. So the author is the one providing the food. If the food is already available for both, but the friend is taking from the author's plate, that might be a boundary issue. \n\nThe friend's behavior of staring until the author gives in sounds manipulative. The author is being pressured into sharing even when they might not want to. Also, the friend doesn't have the same financial responsibility, so maybe they should be taking from the common food supplies rather than the author's personal meal. \n\nBut wait, if the author ensures there's enough food for both, then maybe the friend isn't going hungry. But if the author is making specific meals that the friend isn't helping pay for, the friend has no right to take from the author's portion. The author's meals might be their own choice of food, and the friend is overstepping by expecting a share. \n\nOn the other hand, the author has been putting up with other issues like noise and dirt, which might make them feel obligated to share. But that doesn't mean they have to. The key here is that the friend isn't contributing, so the author isn't obligated to share their personal meals. The friend's request is more about convenience than fairness. \n\nSo, if the author is making sure there's enough food for both in the household, the friend should take from the common pool instead of the author's individual portions. The author has the right to their own food choices without being forced to share. Therefore, the author isn't in the wrong for not sharing when they choose not to. The friend's behavior is the issue here, not the author's decision to set boundaries.\n"
