He doesn't pay any bills, he lives here for free. He doesn't pay for groceries. He doesn't have a car, I take us everywhere. \n\nSometimes he's loud, sometimes he's dirty and he smells, but I put up with it all because he's my best friend. \n\nNow, on to the question, everytime I eat he wants a portion of my meal. It's not like he doesn't have food either, I always make sure there's enough food for both of us - albeit not always the same type of food. He doesn't outrightly say anything, he usually just stares at me until either I give in or don't. Usually I do. \n\n[Pic for context.](https://i.imgur.com/8QJkJle.jpg)\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not sharing their food with their best friend. The situation is that the friend lives with them, doesn't pay rent or groceries, uses the author's car, and sometimes is loud or messy. The main issue is the friend wanting a portion of the author's meals.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the living arrangement. The friend doesn't contribute financially, which might create an imbalance. The author mentions they make sure there's enough food for both, but not always the same type. The friend seems to pressure them into sharing through staring, and the author usually gives in.\n\nNow, the question is about whether the author is at fault for not sharing. The friend's expectation to get a portion every time could be seen as unreasonable, especially since they don't contribute. But the author does provide enough food, just different types. However, the friend's behavior of staring until the author gives in might be manipulative or disrespectful.\n\nOn one hand, the author is providing food, so maybe they're not obligated to share their specific meal. On the other hand, living together can imply some level of shared resources. But if the friend isn't contributing, the author might feel it's unfair to always have to share their meals. The key here is the friend's insistence and the lack of contribution. The author might not be in the wrong if they're setting boundaries. So, the answer would be B (Not in the wrong).\n"
