He doesn't have a car, I take us everywhere. \n\nSometimes he's loud, sometimes he's dirty and he smells, but I put up with it all because he's my best friend. \n\nNow, on to the question, everytime I eat he wants a portion of my meal. It's not like he doesn't have food either, I always make sure there's enough food for both of us - albeit not always the same type of food. He doesn't outrightly say anything, he usually just stares at me until either I give in or don't. Usually I do. \n\n[Pic for context.](https://i.imgur.com/8QJkJle.jpg)\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of the AITA post is in the wrong for not sharing food with their best friend. So, first, I need to break down the situation.\n\nThe author and their best friend live together. The friend doesn't pay any bills or groceries, doesn't have a car, and relies on the author for transportation. The friend is sometimes loud, dirty, and smelly, but the author tolerates it because they're friends. The main issue is that the friend wants a portion of the author's meal every time they eat. The author says they make sure there's enough food for both, but not necessarily the same type. The friend doesn't directly ask but stares until the author gives in, which they usually do.\n\nNow, the user thinks the author is in the wrong but wants to know others' opinions. The question is whether the author is wrong. The options are A (yes) or B (no). \n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The friend isn't contributing to expenses, which is a big red flag. Living with someone without contributing to shared costs can be a problem. But the author is providing food, so maybe they're making up for the lack of financial contribution by ensuring there's enough food. However, the friend's behavior of taking portions without asking directly might be seen as disrespectful. \n\nThe author might feel that their personal meals are being taken without consent. Even if there's food available, it's about personal choice regarding what they eat. The friend's staring and passive-aggressive tactics could be manipulative. \n\nOn the other hand, the author might be enabling the friend's behavior by giving in. If the friend isn't contributing, maybe the author is being taken advantage of. But the author also seems to care about the friendship, which complicates things.\n\nLegally or ethically, is there an obligation to share personal meals? Probably not. It's a personal choice. The friend's actions might be inconsiderate. The author has the right to eat what they want unless they agreed otherwise. However, the friend's lack of contribution to the household adds another layer. The author is shouldering all responsibilities, which might lead to resentment.\n\nBut the question is specifically about sharing food. If the author is making separate meals and the friend is taking from them, that's a personal boundary issue. The author isn't wrong for not sharing if they don't want to. The friend's behavior is more to blame here. However, the context of the friend not contributing might lead some to think the author is in a tough spot, but the actual issue is about the food sharing.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the author might not be in the wrong because they have the right to their own meals. The friend's actions are more problematic. Therefore, the answer would be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
