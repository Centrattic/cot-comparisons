He doesn't pay any bills, he lives here for free. He doesn't pay for groceries. He doesn't have a car, I take us everywhere. \n\nSometimes he's loud, sometimes he's dirty and he smells, but I put up with it all because he's my best friend. \n\nNow, on to the question, everytime I eat he wants a portion of my meal. It's not like he doesn't have food either, I always make sure there's enough food for both of us - albeit not always the same type of food. He doesn't outrightly say anything, he usually just stares at me until either I give in or don't. Usually I do. \n\n[Pic for context.](https://i.imgur.com/8QJkJle.jpg)\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not sharing food with their best friend who lives with them. The friend doesn't pay any bills or groceries, uses the author's car, and sometimes is loud or smelly. But the main issue is the friend wanting a portion of the author's meal every time they eat.\n\nThe author says they make sure there's enough food for both, even if not the same type. The friend doesn't outright ask but stares until the author gives in. The question is whether the author is wrong for not sharing.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the living arrangement. The friend is staying for free, not contributing to expenses. That's a significant point. Normally, if someone is living with you and contributing, sharing might be different. But here, the friend isn't paying anything, so the author is covering all costs.\n\nThen, the food issue. The author is making meals, but the friend expects a portion. The author says they ensure there's enough food, so maybe they're cooking separate meals but the friend wants the same type. The friend's approach is passive-aggressive, just staring instead of asking. The author gives in sometimes, but now is choosing not to, so the question is if that's wrong.\n\nI think the key is the friend's lack of contribution. The author is taking care of all the expenses, including groceries. So the friend shouldn't have an automatic right to the author's food. The author is not obligated to share their specific meals unless they choose to. The friend's expectation might be unreasonable given that they don't contribute. So the author isn't in the wrong for prioritizing their own food when they've already provided enough for two.\n\nAlso, the friend's behavior of staring instead of asking directly is problematic. The author has the right to set boundaries, especially when the friend isn't contributing. So the answer would be B (No, the author isn't in the wrong).\n"
