He doesn't pay any bills, he lives here for free. He doesn't pay for groceries. He doesn't have a car, I take us everywhere. \n\nSometimes he's loud, sometimes he's dirty and he smells, but I put up with it all because he's my best friend. \n\nNow, on to the question, everytime I eat he wants a portion of my meal. It's not like he doesn't have food either, I always make sure there's enough food for both of us - albeit not always the same type of food. He doesn't outrightly say anything, he usually just stares at me until either I give in or don't. Usually I do. \n\n[Pic for context.](https://i.imgur.com/8QJkJle.jpg)\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong for not sharing food with their best friend. The situation involves roommates who live together, but one doesn't pay any bills or groceries. The friend lives there for free and uses the host's car. The main issue is the friend wanting a portion of the author's meal every time they eat, even though there's enough food for both, just not always the same type.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics of their living arrangement. The friend isn't contributing financially, which already sets up a potential imbalance. The author is covering all expenses, which might mean they're already shouldering the burden. Now, when it comes to sharing food, the friend's behavior of staring until the author gives in sounds like manipulation. The author is tired of giving in and is questioning if they're wrong for setting a boundary.\n\nThe key points here are consent and boundaries. The author isn't obligated to share their food, especially since they're the one paying for it. The friend's request isn't a polite ask but more of a passive-aggressive tactic. The author's right to their own food should be respected. Additionally, the friend's lack of financial contribution might be a bigger issue that's not addressed here, but the immediate question is about sharing meals. So, the author isn't in the wrong for not sharing when they choose not to. They're setting a boundary, which is necessary in any healthy relationship. The answer should be B, they're not in the wrong.\n"
