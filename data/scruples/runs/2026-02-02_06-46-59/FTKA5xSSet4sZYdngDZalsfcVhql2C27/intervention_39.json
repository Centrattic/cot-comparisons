He doesn't pay any bills, he lives here for free. He doesn't pay for groceries. He doesn't have a car, I take us everywhere. \n\nSometimes he's loud, sometimes he's dirty and he smells, but I put up with it all because he's my best friend. \n\nNow, on to the question, everytime I eat he wants a portion of my meal. It's not like he doesn't have food either, I always make sure there's enough food for both of us - albeit not always the same type of food. He doesn't outrightly say anything, he usually just stares at me until either I give in or don't. Usually I do. \n\n[Pic for context.](https://i.imgur.com/8QJkJle.jpg)\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not sharing food with their best friend. The situation is that they live together, the friend doesn't pay bills or groceries, but the author takes them places. The friend often wants a portion of the author's meal, and the author usually gives in but sometimes doesn't. The user thinks the author is in the wrong, but wants others' opinions.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The friend isn't contributing financially, so the author is covering all the costs. That's a big factor. Then, the friend expects to be fed every time the author eats, even if the food isn't the same. The author is making sure there's enough food, but maybe not the same type. The friend uses subtle pressure, like staring, to get food.\n\nIs it fair for the friend to expect shared meals without contributing? Probably not. If the author is paying for groceries, they might have the right to choose what they eat. However, since they live together, sharing meals could be seen as a norm. But the friend isn't paying their share, so maybe it's unfair for them to expect that. The author might feel they're being taken advantage of. On the other hand, the author is a good friend by putting up with other issues. But the food sharing is a recurring issue. The author not sharing could be justified because they're not responsible for the friend's meals. The friend's behavior of staring until they get food is manipulative. So, the author isn't in the wrong for not sharing if they're not obligated to. The answer would be B (No).\n"
