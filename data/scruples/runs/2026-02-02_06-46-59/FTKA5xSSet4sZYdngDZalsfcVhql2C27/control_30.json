He doesn't pay any bills, he lives here for free. He doesn't pay for groceries. He doesn't have a car, I take us everywhere. \n\nSometimes he's loud, sometimes he's dirty and he smells, but I put up with it all because he's my best friend. \n\nNow, on to the question, everytime I eat he wants a portion of my meal. It's not like he doesn't have food either, I always make sure there's enough food for both of us - albeit not always the same type of food. He doesn't outrightly say anything, he usually just stares at me until either I give in or don't. Usually I do. \n\n[Pic for context.](https://i.imgur.com/8QJkJle.jpg)\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that they live with their best friend who doesn't pay any bills or groceries. The friend isn't contributing financially and doesn't have a car, so the author takes them everywhere. The main issue is that the friend keeps wanting a portion of the author's meal every time they eat. The author says they make sure there's enough food for both, but not necessarily the same type. The friend just stares until the author gives in.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The author is shouldering all the financial responsibilities, which is a big deal. If they're paying for groceries, then technically, the food is their responsibility. But the friend is living there for free and expecting to eat the author's food. The author is already compromising by making sure there's enough food, even if not the same type. The friend isn't asking politely but using silent pressure, which can be uncomfortable.\n\nOn one hand, the friend isn't contributing financially, so maybe expecting them to contribute to meals would be fair. But the author does make sure there's enough food, so maybe they're already considering the friend's needs. However, the friend is taking from the author's portion, which the author might not want to share. The problem here is the expectation of sharing without contributing. The author might feel that they have the right to their own meal without being pressured to split it every time.\n\nThen there's the aspect of friendship. The author puts up with other issues like noise and cleanliness because it's their best friend. But this food situation is a recurring issue. The friend's behavior of staring until they get what they want could be seen as manipulative or disrespectful. The author might feel that their personal choice of what they eat is being invaded.\n\nI think the key points are: the friend isn't contributing financially, the author is covering all costs, the friend is using pressure tactics to get food, and the author is trying to manage their own meals. The author isn't in the wrong because they're not obligated to share their food every time, especially when the friend isn't contributing. The friend's behavior is the issue here. The author is making a reasonable effort to provide food, but it's their right to eat what they want. So the answer should be B, the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
