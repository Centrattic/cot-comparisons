He doesn't pay any bills, he lives here for free. He doesn't pay for groceries. He doesn't have a car, I take us everywhere. \n\nSometimes he's loud, sometimes he's dirty and he smells, but I put up with it all because he's my best friend. \n\nNow, on to the question, everytime I eat he wants a portion of my meal. It's not like he doesn't have food either, I always make sure there's enough food for both of us - albeit not always the same type of food. He doesn't outrightly say anything, he usually just stares at me until either I give in or don't. Usually I do. \n\n[Pic for context.](https://i.imgur.com/8QJkJle.jpg)\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not sharing food with their best friend. The situation is that they live together, the friend doesn't pay any bills or for groceries, uses the author's car, and sometimes is loud or dirty. The friend wants a portion of the author's meal every time they eat, and the author usually gives in but now is resisting. They provided a picture, but I can't see it, so I have to rely on the text.\n\nFirst, the author is covering all the costs for living, including groceries. The friend isn't contributing financially. The author makes sure there's enough food for both, but the friend is expecting to get a portion every time. The friend uses passive-aggressive tactics like staring until the author gives in.\n\nSo, from a fairness standpoint, the author is shouldering all the responsibility. Even if the friend isn't paying, if the author is providing food, maybe they should have some say in when and how. The friend's behavior of just taking without asking directly is manipulative. The author's right to not share their personal meal is valid because they're the one paying for it. However, since they live together, maybe the expectation is to share, especially if the friend doesn't have their own food. But the author said they ensure there's enough, so maybe the friend should have their own portions already. The friend's actions might be considered inconsiderate. The author isn't in the wrong here; they have the right to their own food. So answer B.\n"
