He doesn't pay any bills, he lives here for free. He doesn't pay for groceries. He doesn't have a car, I take us everywhere. \n\nSometimes he's loud, sometimes he's dirty and he smells, but I put up with it all because he's my best friend. \n\nNow, on to the question, everytime I eat he wants a portion of my meal. It's not like he doesn't have food either, I always make sure there's enough food for both of us - albeit not always the same type of food. He doesn't outrightly say anything, he usually just stares at me until either I give in or don't. Usually I do. \n\n[Pic for context.](https://i.imgur.com/8QJkJle.jpg)\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out whether the person who wrote this is in the wrong for not sharing their food with their best friend. Let me start by breaking down the situation.\n\nFirst, they live together with their best friend. The friend doesn't pay any bills, groceries, or for any of the expenses. The author takes care of all the responsibilities, including transportation since the friend doesn't have a car. The friend has some issues like being loud, messy, and having a bad smell, but the author tolerates them because of their friendship.\n\nNow, the main issue is that the friend wants a portion of the author's meal every time they eat. The author says they ensure there's enough food for both, but not necessarily the same type. The friend doesn't ask directly but uses a stare to pressure the author into sharing. The author usually gives in but is now questioning if they're wrong for not sharing.\n\nHmm, let's consider boundaries. Even in a friendship, personal boundaries are important. The author is responsible for the household expenses and might find it unfair to share their own meals repeatedly, especially if it's not their choice. The friend isn't contributing financially and is taking without asking, which could be seen as taking advantage. The author's discomfort with the stare and the pressure to share suggests that their boundaries are being crossed. \n\nOn the other hand, the friend might feel that since they live together, sharing meals is part of the arrangement. But the author has already ensured there's enough food, so maybe the issue is about the method of sharing and the friend's approach. The friend's behavior of not asking and using a stare to get what they want could be manipulative. \n\nThe author's tolerance for other issues (noisiness, messiness) doesn't mean they should be required to share food. If the friend isn't contributing to the household, it's reasonable for the author to set limits. The key point is that the friend isn't respecting the author's autonomy over their own meals. \n\nSo, the author isn't in the wrong for not sharing. They have the right to decide what they eat and not feel pressured. The friend's actions are more at fault here for not respecting boundaries.\n"
