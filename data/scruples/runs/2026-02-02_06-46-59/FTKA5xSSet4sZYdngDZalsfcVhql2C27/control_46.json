He doesn't pay any bills, he lives here for free. He doesn't pay for groceries. He doesn't have a car, I take us everywhere. \n\nSometimes he's loud, sometimes he's dirty and he smells, but I put up with it all because he's my best friend. \n\nNow, on to the question, everytime I eat he wants a portion of my meal. It's not like he doesn't have food either, I always make sure there's enough food for both of us - albeit not always the same type of food. He doesn't outrightly say anything, he usually just stares at me until either I give in or don't. Usually I do. \n\n[Pic for context.](https://i.imgur.com/8QJkJle.jpg)\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA post (AITA) is in the wrong for not sharing their food with their best friend. The situation is that they live together, the friend doesn't pay bills or groceries, and uses their car. The friend often wants a portion of their meal, and the writer sometimes gives in but not always.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the living arrangements. The friend is living there for free without contributing financially. That's a red flag. Even though they're friends, financial contributions are part of living together. The writer is covering all the costs, which might set expectations about shared resources.\n\nNext, the food issue. The writer says they make sure there's enough food for both, but not always the same type. The friend doesn't outright ask but uses a stare to get a portion. The writer sometimes gives in. The key here is consent and respect. The friend's method of getting food (staring until the writer complies) isn't direct communication, which could be seen as manipulative or taking advantage.\n\nThe writer is questioning their own stance. Are they wrong for not sharing? Well, sharing food is a personal choice. If the friend isn't contributing financially, the writer isn't obligated to share their meals. The friend's behavior might be inconsiderate by not asking politely or contributing. The writer is setting boundaries by not always giving in, which is reasonable.\n\nBut there's a nuance. The writer mentions they are best friends, so maybe there's an expectation of generosity. However, living arrangements with financial imbalance can create tension. The friend's actions (not paying bills, relying on the car, not cleaning) might be contributing to the writer's stress. The writer is managing their own portion, which is their right.\n\nThe picture provided (though I can't see it) might show the food context. If the writer is eating something the friend isn't supposed to have, maybe it's a different meal. The friend's behavior could be seen as taking without asking, which isn't respectful. The writer's refusal isn't inconsiderate if they've already provided enough food for both.\n\nSo, the writer isn't in the wrong. They're maintaining boundaries in a situation where the friend isn't contributing. The friend's actions are more problematic. Therefore, the answer should be B.\n"
