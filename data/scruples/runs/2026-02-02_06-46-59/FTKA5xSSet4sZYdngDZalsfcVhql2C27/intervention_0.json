He doesn't pay any bills, he lives here for free. He doesn't pay for groceries. He doesn't have a car, I take us everywhere. \n\nSometimes he's loud, sometimes he's dirty and he smells, but I put up with it all because he's my best friend. \n\nNow, on to the question, everytime I eat he wants a portion of my meal. It's not like he doesn't have food either, I always make sure there's enough food for both of us - albeit not always the same type of food. He doesn't outrightly say anything, he usually just stares at me until either I give in or don't. Usually I do. \n\n[Pic for context.](https://i.imgur.com/8QJkJle.jpg)\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote this is in the wrong for not sharing food with their best friend. The situation is that the friend lives with them, doesn't pay bills or groceries, uses their car, and sometimes is loud or dirty. The main issue is that the friend takes a portion of the writer's meal, and the writer usually gives in, but sometimes doesn't. The writer is asking if they're wrong for not sharing.\n\nHmm. The friend isn't contributing financially, which might be a point. But the writer says they make sure there's enough food for both, just not the same type. So maybe they're not in the wrong for not sharing their specific meal. Like, if there's enough food overall, the friend could have their own. But the friend is taking from the writer's meal, which the writer might not want to share. The writer is setting boundaries by sometimes saying no, which is their right. The friend's behavior of staring until the writer gives in could be manipulative. So the writer isn't in the wrong for not sharing their specific food. So answer B.\n"
