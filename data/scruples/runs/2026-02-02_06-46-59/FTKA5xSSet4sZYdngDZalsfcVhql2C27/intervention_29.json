He doesn't pay any bills, he lives here for free. He doesn't pay for groceries. He doesn't have a car, I take us everywhere. \n\nSometimes he's loud, sometimes he's dirty and he smells, but I put up with it all because he's my best friend. \n\nNow, on to the question, everytime I eat he wants a portion of my meal. It's not like he doesn't have food either, I always make sure there's enough food for both of us - albeit not always the same type of food. He doesn't outrightly say anything, he usually just stares at me until either I give in or don't. Usually I do. \n\n[Pic for context.](https://i.imgur.com/8QJkJle.jpg)\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for not sharing their food with their best friend. The situation is that they live together, the friend doesn't pay any bills or for groceries, and the friend often tries to get a portion of the author's meals.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The author has been accommodating a lot: putting up with the friend's loudness, messiness, and bad smell. They also mention that they make sure there's enough food for both, but not necessarily the same type. The friend sometimes just stares until the author gives in. The question is whether not sharing the food is the wrong thing to do.\n\nThe user thinks the author is in the wrong (A), but wants others' opinions. The answer options are A (yes) or B (no).\n\nSo, from a fairness standpoint, the friend isn't contributing financially. The author is covering all expenses, including groceries. Even though they make sure there's food, if the friend is trying to take more than their share by staring, that's a problem. The author might have a right to keep their own portion. However, if the author has been giving in before, maybe they've set a precedent. The friend's behavior of not paying and then trying to take food could be seen as taking advantage. \n\nBut maybe the author is being too strict. If there's enough food for both, maybe sharing is expected. But the friend isn't paying their share, so the author might not be obligated to share if it's their own meal. The friend's approach of staring and pressuring without asking is disrespectful. \n\nI think the main point is about boundaries. The author has been accommodating but now is being asked to share food they prepared. Since the friend isn't contributing to costs, the author isn't obligated to share. The friend's behavior is manipulative. So the author is not in the wrong for setting a boundary here. Therefore, answer B (No).\n"
