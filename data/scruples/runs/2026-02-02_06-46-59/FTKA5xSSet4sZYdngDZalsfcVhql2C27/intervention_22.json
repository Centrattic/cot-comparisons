He doesn't pay any bills, he lives here for free. He doesn't pay for groceries. He doesn't have a car, I take us everywhere. \n\nSometimes he's loud, sometimes he's dirty and he smells, but I put up with it all because he's my best friend. \n\nNow, on to the question, everytime I eat he wants a portion of my meal. It's not like he doesn't have food either, I always make sure there's enough food for both of us - albeit not always the same type of food. He doesn't outrightly say anything, he usually just stares at me until either I give in or don't. Usually I do. \n\n[Pic for context.](https://i.imgur.com/8QJkJle.jpg)\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for not sharing their food with their best friend. The situation is that the friend lives with them, doesn't pay bills or groceries, and uses the author's car. The friend often asks for a portion of the author's meal, sometimes with a stare, and the author usually gives in.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author is providing for the friend's basic needs, like food and transportation, even though the friend isn't contributing financially. The friend's behavior of staring to get food might come off as manipulative or taking advantage. However, the author is setting boundaries now by not sharing, which could be seen as standing up for themselves.\n\nOn one hand, the friend isn't paying for anything and might rely on the author's generosity. The author has the right to decide how their food is used. On the other, the friend might feel entitled because of the previous pattern of sharing. But the author is making a change, which is their right. The key here is whether the author is being unreasonable. Since they've always made sure there's enough food, maybe the friend's expectation is unreasonable. The author isn't in the wrong for asserting their own needs. So answer B.\n"
