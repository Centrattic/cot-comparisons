He doesn't pay any bills, he lives here for free. He doesn't pay for groceries. He doesn't have a car, I take us everywhere. \n\nSometimes he's loud, sometimes he's dirty and he smells, but I put up with it all because he's my best friend. \n\nNow, on to the question, everytime I eat he wants a portion of my meal. It's not like he doesn't have food either, I always make sure there's enough food for both of us - albeit not always the same type of food. He doesn't outrightly say anything, he usually just stares at me until either I give in or don't. Usually I do. \n\n[Pic for context.](https://i.imgur.com/8QJkJle.jpg)\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not sharing food with their best friend. So first, I need to understand the situation.\n\nThe author lives with their best friend who doesn't pay bills, groceries, or rent, and uses the author's car. The friend takes portions of the author's meals, not because there's no food available, but the types are different. The author sometimes gives in under the friend's passive-aggressive stare. The friend's actions here are taking food without asking, but the author is the one choosing not to share. \n\nHmm, the question is whether the author is wrong. The key points here are the living arrangement and the friend's behavior. The friend isn't contributing financially, which might be a separate issue, but the main conflict is about sharing food. The author says they make sure there's enough food for both, but maybe not the same type. So if the friend is taking from the author's specific meal, that could be an issue if the author made it for themselves. \n\nFrom an ethical standpoint, if someone is living with you and not contributing, it's reasonable to set boundaries. The friend's actions of taking without asking could be seen as disrespectful. The author might be in their right to say no if they prepared the meal themselves. However, if the food is communal, then sharing might be expected. But the author mentions making sure there's food for both, which might mean they provide enough in general but not specific meals. \n\nIn some cultures, sharing food is expected, but in others, personal meals are considered private. The author might feel their personal choice is being overridden by the friend's expectation. The friend's behavior of staring until the author gives in is passive-aggressive and could be seen as manipulative. \n\nSo, if the author is not the one initiating the sharing and is setting boundaries, they might not be in the wrong. The onus is on the friend to ask or not take without permission. The author isn't obligated to share every meal they make, especially if they're not the one being inconsiderate. The friend's lack of contribution to expenses could affect the dynamic, but the immediate issue is about the food sharing. \n\nTherefore, the author might not be in the wrong for deciding to keep their meal to themselves, especially if the friend isn't respecting their boundaries. So the answer would be B (No).\n"
