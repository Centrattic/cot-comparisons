He doesn't pay any bills, he lives here for free. He doesn't pay for groceries. He doesn't have a car, I take us everywhere. \n\nSometimes he's loud, sometimes he's dirty and he smells, but I put up with it all because he's my best friend. \n\nNow, on to the question, everytime I eat he wants a portion of my meal. It's not like he doesn't have food either, I always make sure there's enough food for both of us - albeit not always the same type of food. He doesn't outrightly say anything, he usually just stares at me until either I give in or don't. Usually I do. \n\n[Pic for context.](https://i.imgur.com/8QJkJle.jpg)\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong. The situation is that the author lives with their best friend who doesn't pay bills or groceries, and the friend keeps asking for food portions from the author's meals.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The friend lives for free, doesn't contribute financially, and relies on the author for transportation. The main issue here is the food sharing. The author makes sure there's enough food, but not necessarily the same type. The friend doesn't ask directly but uses a stare to get a portion. The author usually gives in.\n\nNow, considering the dynamics here. The friend isn't contributing financially, which could be a significant stress point. The fact that the friend doesn't ask politely and uses a stare might be seen as passive-aggressive. The author is providing food, but maybe the friend is taking more than their share, leading to the author feeling pressured to give up their meal.\n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong. If the author is making sure there's enough food for both, but the friend is still taking from their portions without asking, the friend's behavior is problematic. However, if the author is making different types of food and the friend is taking from the author's specific meal, maybe the author isn't at fault. The author has the right to their own meals, especially if they paid for them. The friend's expectation to take a portion without being asked could be the issue.\n\nAlso, the fact that the friend uses pressure tactics (staring) to get what they want might indicate manipulation. The author might feel obligated to share, but it's not their responsibility to constantly give up their food. If the author is the one providing everything, setting boundaries is reasonable.\n\nSo, considering all this, the author isn't in the wrong. The friend's behavior is the problem here. The answer should be B (No).\n"
