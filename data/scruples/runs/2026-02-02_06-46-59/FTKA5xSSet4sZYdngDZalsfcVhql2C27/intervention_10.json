He doesn't pay any bills, he lives here for free. He doesn't pay for groceries. He doesn't have a car, I take us everywhere. \n\nSometimes he's loud, sometimes he's dirty and he smells, but I put up with it all because he's my best friend. \n\nNow, on to the question, everytime I eat he wants a portion of my meal. It's not like he doesn't have food either, I always make sure there's enough food for both of us - albeit not always the same type of food. He doesn't outrightly say anything, he usually just stares at me until either I give in or don't. Usually I do. \n\n[Pic for context.](https://i.imgur.com/8QJkJle.jpg)\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the \"AITA\" post is in the wrong for not sharing food with their best friend. The friend lives with them but doesn't pay bills or groceries, and the author takes him everywhere since he has no car. The main issue is that the friend wants a portion of the author's meal each time, and the author sometimes gives in but now isn't sure if they're in the wrong.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The friend isn't contributing financially, so the author is covering all costs. The friend's behavior of staring until they get food might be seen as passive-aggressive or manipulative. The author has to decide if it's fair to share their own meals when the friend already has access to shared groceries. \n\nThe author mentions they ensure there's enough food for both, but not the same type. Maybe the friend is not satisfied with the available options and thus takes from the author's plate. The question is about the ethics of sharing. If the friend isn't paying, is it reasonable to expect the author to split their meals? On the other hand, the author has put up with other issues like noise and mess, perhaps expecting mutual respect. If the friend is taking without asking, that could be unfair. But the author might feel that as a best friend, they should accommodate even if it's not fair. \n\nI think the key points are the lack of financial contribution and the friend's entitlement to the author's personal meals. The author isn't responsible for the friend's meals beyond what they can reasonably share. The friend's behavior might be inconsiderate, so the author isn't in the wrong for not sharing when they choose not to. So the answer would be B.\n"
