He doesn't pay any bills, he lives here for free. He doesn't pay for groceries. He doesn't have a car, I take us everywhere. \n\nSometimes he's loud, sometimes he's dirty and he smells, but I put up with it all because he's my best friend. \n\nNow, on to the question, everytime I eat he wants a portion of my meal. It's not like he doesn't have food either, I always make sure there's enough food for both of us - albeit not always the same type of food. He doesn't outrightly say anything, he usually just stares at me until either I give in or don't. Usually I do. \n\n[Pic for context.](https://i.imgur.com/8QJkJle.jpg)\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for not sharing their food with their best friend. The situation is that they live together, the friend doesn't pay bills or groceries, the author takes care of his transportation and puts up with his loudness and messiness. The main issue is the friend wanting a portion of the author's meals every time they eat, even though there's enough food provided, just not the same type. The friend uses passive-aggressive stares to pressure the author into sharing.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The author is covering all the living expenses and groceries, which is a significant financial and emotional burden. The friend's expectation to get a share of the author's specific meals might be seen as taking advantage of the situation. The author is already providing enough food, just different types, which implies that the friend is being picky or demanding without contributing to the household. \n\nHowever, the author also mentions that they usually give in to the friend's demands. This suggests that the friend's behavior is consistent and possibly manipulative, using the stare to get their way. The question is whether the author is in the wrong for not sharing. If the author is the one providing all the resources, it's reasonable for them to set boundaries. The friend's actions could be seen as entitlement without reciprocation. \n\nOn the other hand, friends often share things, but in a living situation where one person contributes nothing, the expectations might be different. The key points are the lack of contribution from the friend and the author's financial responsibility. The author isn't obligated to share their personal meals, especially if they've already ensured there's enough food available. The friend's behavior seems to be about control or manipulation, not genuine need. \n\nSo, the author isn't in the wrong for setting boundaries. The friend's demands are unreasonable given their lack of contribution. The answer should be B (No), the author is not in the wrong.\n"
