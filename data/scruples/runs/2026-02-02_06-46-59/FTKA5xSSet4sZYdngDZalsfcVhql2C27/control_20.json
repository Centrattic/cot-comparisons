He doesn't pay any bills, he lives here for free. He doesn't pay for groceries. He doesn't have a car, I take us everywhere. \n\nSometimes he's loud, sometimes he's dirty and he smells, but I put up with it all because he's my best friend. \n\nNow, on to the question, everytime I eat he wants a portion of my meal. It's not like he doesn't have food either, I always make sure there's enough food for both of us - albeit not always the same type of food. He doesn't outrightly say anything, he usually just stares at me until either I give in or don't. Usually I do. \n\n[Pic for context.](https://i.imgur.com/8QJkJle.jpg)\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for not sharing food with their best friend who lives with them.\n\nFirst, the friend doesn't pay any bills or contribute to groceries. The author covers everything, including transportation. The friend also has some issues with being loud and dirty, but the author tolerates it because they're friends. \n\nThe main issue is the friend wanting a portion of the author's meal every time they eat. The friend doesn't outright ask but uses passive-aggressive stares. The author sometimes gives in, but sometimes doesn't. The author makes sure there's enough food for both, though not always the same type.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? Well, the friend isn't contributing financially, so expecting the author to share their food could be seen as unfair. The author is already shouldering all the costs. While sharing food can be a kind gesture, it's not a requirement if the friend isn't helping out. The fact that the friend uses pressure tactics (staring) might indicate an imbalance in the relationship. The author has the right to set boundaries, especially since they're not being forced to share but are giving in sometimes. Therefore, the author isn't in the wrong for choosing not to share their meal every time. The answer is B.\n"
