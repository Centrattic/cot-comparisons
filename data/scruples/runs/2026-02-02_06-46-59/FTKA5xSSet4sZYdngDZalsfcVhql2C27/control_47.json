He doesn't pay any bills, he lives here for free. He doesn't pay for groceries. He doesn't have a car, I take us everywhere. \n\nSometimes he's loud, sometimes he's dirty and he smells, but I put up with it all because he's my best friend. \n\nNow, on to the question, everytime I eat he wants a portion of my meal. It's not like he doesn't have food either, I always make sure there's enough food for both of us - albeit not always the same type of food. He doesn't outrightly say anything, he usually just stares at me until either I give in or don't. Usually I do. \n\n[Pic for context.](https://i.imgur.com/8QJkJle.jpg)\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person (the author) is in the wrong for not sharing their food with their best friend who lives with them. The friend doesn't pay any bills or contribute to groceries, uses the author's car, and sometimes is loud, smelly, or dirty. The issue is that when the author eats, the friend wants a portion, and the author sometimes gives in but not always.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The friend is living for free and isn't contributing financially. That's a big factor. Shared living usually implies some mutual responsibilities, like splitting bills and groceries. If the friend isn't contributing, it might be unreasonable to expect the author to constantly share their food. The author mentions they make sure there's enough food for both, but not always the same type. So maybe the author is providing food in general but the friend wants the specific meal the author is having.\n\nThe friend's behavior of staring until the author gives in seems manipulative. The author is setting boundaries by sometimes not sharing, which could be necessary if they're not getting equal contributions. The author is also dealing with other issues like the friend being messy or loud, which they tolerate because of the friendship. However, food sharing isn't a given when someone isn't contributing to shared expenses. \n\nIt's important to note that while the author is being nice by ensuring there's enough food, the friend's expectation to get the same meal every time without contributing might be unfair. The author isn't obligated to share their personal meal portions if they're not receiving equal support in return. \n\nSo, in this scenario, the author isn't in the wrong for setting boundaries around food sharing, especially considering the lack of financial contribution and other accommodations they make. Therefore, the answer should be B (No).\n"
