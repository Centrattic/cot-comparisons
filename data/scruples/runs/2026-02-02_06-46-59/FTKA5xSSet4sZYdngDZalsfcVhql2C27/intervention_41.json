He doesn't pay any bills, he lives here for free. He doesn't pay for groceries. He doesn't have a car, I take us everywhere. \n\nSometimes he's loud, sometimes he's dirty and he smells, but I put up with it all because he's my best friend. \n\nNow, on to the question, everytime I eat he wants a portion of my meal. It's not like he doesn't have food either, I always make sure there's enough food for both of us - albeit not always the same type of food. He doesn't outrightly say anything, he usually just stares at me until either I give in or don't. Usually I do. \n\n[Pic for context.](https://i.imgur.com/8QJkJle.jpg)\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the post is in the wrong for not sharing their food with their best friend. The situation is that they live together, the friend doesn't pay any bills or groceries, relies on the author for transportation, and sometimes is loud or messy. The main issue is that the friend wants a portion of the author's meal every time they eat, usually getting it after a stare-down.\n\nSo, the author is torn between being a good friend and their own needs. The friend isn't outright asking but uses passive aggression. The author is making sure there's enough food for both, but not the same type. The user thinks the author is in the wrong but wants another opinion.\n\nHmm. First, the living arrangement: the friend lives for free, doesn't pay bills or groceries. That already sets up an imbalance. The author is providing for the friend's basic needs, including food. Now, the friend is expecting to share every meal. But the author is making an effort to ensure there's food, even if it's not the same type. The friend's behavior (staring until the author gives in) sounds controlling or manipulative.\n\nIs the author obligated to share their meal? Well, if the author is the one providing the food because the friend doesn't contribute, maybe the author isn't responsible for the friend's meals. The friend not paying for groceries means the author is the one covering costs. So, if the author is making their own meal, the friend can't expect to take part of it without contributing. The friend's actions might be inconsiderate, using guilt or passive aggression to get what they want without offering anything in return.\n\nBut the author is also trying to be a good friend by ensuring there's enough food. However, the friend's expectation to share every meal, regardless of the author's individual choices, might be crossing a line. The author's right to personal space and meals without pressure could be valid. The friend's behavior isn't respectful of boundaries. So, the author isn't in the wrong for setting boundaries here. They're being reasonable in not having to share every meal when they're the one covering all the costs. Therefore, the answer would be B\u2014Not in the wrong.\n"
