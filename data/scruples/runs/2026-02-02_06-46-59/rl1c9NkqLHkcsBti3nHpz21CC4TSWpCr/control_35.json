My friend is 20 and lives with his single, divorced mom (41). She divorced his dad two years ago for being an alcoholic. Shes extremely hot in a more mature kind of way.\n\nWhenever i would hang out at his house his mom would openly flirt with me but i initially just chalked that up to her being playful and flirty. Except she kept up the flirting when we were alone, and everyime i stepped it up she would step it up herself.\n\nI asked her out, and weve had a casual sexual relationship for almost a month and a half. I was very open with my friend, his mom insisted on it and i dont want to hurt him.\n\nHe is completely put off by it, which i can understand, but at the same time everyone is an adult and can make their own choices. He orders me to stop seeing her and i refuse. He is now actively trying to get all of our friends to hate me and its been semi successful.\n\nEven if i stopped seeing his mom i dont believe he will let up with the smear campaign. Oddly enough this has actually driven me closer to his mom since im running out of friends.\n\nAITA in this situation even if i was upfront and honest with him?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who started a casual sexual relationship with their friend's mom is in the wrong. The situation involves a 23-year-old, his 20-year-old friend, and the mom who's 41. The mom was already flirting a lot, and the person took that as a sign to ask her out. They were honest with the friend, but the friend is upset and spreading negative stuff about them.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The mom is the friend's mother, so there's an existing relationship that the person is entering into. Even though the mom is an adult and they had a casual relationship, the key issue here is the impact on the friend. The person did tell the friend, but maybe not in the right way or at the right time. The friend is now trying to get friends to turn against them, which complicates things.\n\nLegally, both the author and the mom are adults, so consensual relationships aren't illegal. But socially and ethically, it's a different story. Relationships with someone's parent can be seen as crossing a boundary, especially since the friend is still in a close relationship with his mom. The fact that the mom initiated the flirting might not absolve the author of responsibility. They could have considered the potential harm to their friend's feelings and the trust in their friendship.\n\nAnother angle is the friend's reaction. The author might have thought being upfront was enough, but maybe they didn't consider how the friend would feel. Even if the author was honest, the act of pursuing a relationship with an ex-spouse's parent (since the mom is divorced) could be seen as taking advantage of a vulnerable situation, especially if the friend was still adjusting to the divorce.\n\nAlso, the author's reasoning that \"everyone is an adult\" might be simplistic. While consent is important, relationships between people with existing family ties can create complex emotional and social consequences. The author's actions have led to the friend's social circle turning against them, which indicates significant fallout. The fact that the author feels closer to the mom because they're losing friends might not be a valid justification for the situation they're in.\n\nIn terms of responsibility, the author made a choice that directly affected their friend's life and well-being. Even if the mom was interested, the author's decision to pursue the relationship without considering the friend's perspective is problematic. The friend's right to a stable relationship with their mother versus the author's desire for a sexual relationship is a conflict here. The author's actions have caused emotional distress and social consequences, which points towards them being in the wrong.\n\nSo, considering all these factors, the answer would likely be A (the author is in the wrong) because they disregarded the potential harm to their friend and the existing family dynamics, even if they were upfront about the relationship.\n"
