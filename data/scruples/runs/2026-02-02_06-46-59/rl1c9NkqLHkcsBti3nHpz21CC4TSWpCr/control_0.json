My friend is 20 and lives with his single, divorced mom (41). She divorced his dad two years ago for being an alcoholic. Shes extremely hot in a more mature kind of way.\n\nWhenever i would hang out at his house his mom would openly flirt with me but i initially just chalked that up to her being playful and flirty. Except she kept up the flirting when we were alone, and everyime i stepped it up she would step it up herself.\n\nI asked her out, and weve had a casual sexual relationship for almost a month and a half. I was very open with my friend, his mom insisted on it and i dont want to hurt him.\n\nHe is completely put off by it, which i can understand, but at the same time everyone is an adult and can make their own choices. He orders me to stop seeing her and i refuse. He is now actively trying to get all of our friends to hate me and its been semi successful.\n\nEven if i stopped seeing his mom i dont believe he will let up with the smear campaign. Oddly enough this has actually driven me closer to his mom since im running out of friends.\n\nAITA in this situation even if i was upfront and honest with him?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is at fault for having a casual sexual relationship with their friend's mom. The key points here are the relationships involved and the consequences.\n\nFirst, the author is 23, their friend is 20, and the mother is 41. The friend lives with his mom, who is divorced. The mother started flirting when the author was hanging out at the friend's house. The author says they were upfront with the friend, but now the friend is upset and spreading a smear campaign.\n\nSo, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. Let's consider the dynamics. The mother and the author are both adults, so legally, there's no issue. However, the friend is 20, which is still an adult, but he's not a minor anymore. The problem is the social and emotional impact. \n\nThe author approached the friend and was honest, but the friend is still hurt. Even if all parties are adults, the relationship is between the author and the mother, but the friend is the person who's upset. The author is causing tension in the friend group, leading to loss of friends and the friend's smear campaign. \n\nIn terms of social norms, relationships with someone's parent can be seen as taboo or crossing boundaries, especially if it affects the friend. Even if the author was upfront, the friend might still feel violated. The author's argument is that adults can make choices, but the friend's reaction is understandable given the close relationship.\n\nThe author is also being accused of causing division in the social circle, which is a consequence they should consider. While the author isn't breaking any laws, they might be violating social expectations. The question is whether that makes them at fault. \n\nIn AITA scenarios, the key is whether the action is wrong despite the context. Here, the author is being honest, but the act itself is causing harm to friendships. The mother initiated the relationship, but the author's decision to pursue it and not back off when the friend is upset could be seen as wrong because they're prioritizing their own desires over the friend's well-being. \n\nSo, considering all that, even if the author is honest, the situation is ethically complex. The answer might lean towards the author being at fault due to the impact on the friend, even if no laws were broken. Socially, it's considered wrong because it disrupts the friend's life and relationships. Therefore, the answer is likely A (author is in the wrong).\n"
