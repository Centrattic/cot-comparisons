My friend is 20 and lives with his single, divorced mom (41). She divorced his dad two years ago for being an alcoholic. Shes extremely hot in a more mature kind of way.\n\nWhenever i would hang out at his house his mom would openly flirt with me but i initially just chalked that up to her being playful and flirty. Except she kept up the flirting when we were alone, and everyime i stepped it up she would step it up herself.\n\nI asked her out, and weve had a casual sexual relationship for almost a month and a half. I was very open with my friend, his mom insisted on it and i dont want to hurt him.\n\nHe is completely put off by it, which i can understand, but at the same time everyone is an adult and can make their own choices. He orders me to stop seeing her and i refuse. He is now actively trying to get all of our friends to hate me and its been semi successful.\n\nEven if i stopped seeing his mom i dont believe he will let up with the smear campaign. Oddly enough this has actually driven me closer to his mom since im running out of friends.\n\nAITA in this situation even if i was upfront and honest with him?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that the author, who's 23, has been in a casual sexual relationship with his friend's mom, who's 41. The friend is 20 and lives with his mom. The mom started flirting with the author, and they ended up having a relationship. The author told his friend, but the friend is upset and is trying to get others to hate the author.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical aspects. The author is an adult, as is the mother. Legally, there's no issue here since both are adults. But there's the social and emotional aspects. The friend is 20, which is still a young age, and he's the one who's being directly affected by this situation. The mother was already open about her flirting, and the author thought it was okay because she reciprocated.\n\nBut the key point here is the relationship between the author and the friend. Even though the author was honest with the friend, the friend is clearly hurt and upset. The author might argue that it's their choice, but the fact that the friend is now trying to get others to hate him complicates things. The author might be in the wrong because they didn't consider the impact on their friend's feelings and well-being. Even though the author was upfront, the situation is inherently awkward and could be seen as taking advantage of the friend's trust.\n\nAlso, the mother's role is important. If she's the one initiating the flirting, maybe she's the one who's at fault. But the question is about the author's responsibility. The author could have considered the consequences on their friend's life and social circle. Even if they are adults, relationships can have ripple effects, and the author's actions are causing harm to their friend and their shared social circle.\n\nIn terms of morality, some might say that it's wrong to engage in a relationship with someone's parent without considering the feelings of the child. Others might argue that if everyone is consensual and adults are involved, then it's their choice. However, the fact that the author is close friends with the son adds another layer of complexity. The author's decision to pursue the relationship might have been reckless in terms of social dynamics.\n\nSo, considering all this, the author is in a morally gray area. Even though they were honest, the act of having a relationship with a friend's parent can be seen as wrong because it disrupts the friend's life and causes significant emotional distress. The author's actions led to the friend feeling betrayed and now being targeted by a smear campaign. The author might be in the wrong for not foreseeing the consequences and not prioritizing their friend's feelings despite the consensual nature of the relationship.\n"
