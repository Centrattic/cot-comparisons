My friend is 20 and lives with his single, divorced mom (41). She divorced his dad two years ago for being an alcoholic. Shes extremely hot in a more mature kind of way.\n\nWhenever i would hang out at his house his mom would openly flirt with me but i initially just chalked that up to her being playful and flirty. Except she kept up the flirting when we were alone, and everyime i stepped it up she would step it up herself.\n\nI asked her out, and weve had a casual sexual relationship for almost a month and a half. I was very open with my friend, his mom insisted on it and i dont want to hurt him.\n\nHe is completely put off by it, which i can understand, but at the same time everyone is an adult and can make their own choices. He orders me to stop seeing her and i refuse. He is now actively trying to get all of our friends to hate me and its been semi successful.\n\nEven if i stopped seeing his mom i dont believe he will let up with the smear campaign. Oddly enough this has actually driven me closer to his mom since im running out of friends.\n\nAITA in this situation even if i was upfront and honest with him?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the \"AITA\" (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong. The situation involves a 23-year-old having a casual sexual relationship with his friend's mom, who is 41. The friend is 20 and upset, trying to get others to hate the author.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The author was friends with the 20-year-old and his mom. The mom started flirting, and they ended up in a relationship. The author says they were upfront with the friend. The friend is upset, and the author is now facing a smear campaign. The author thinks adults can make their own choices but acknowledges the friend's right to be upset.\n\nThe central issue here is whether the author is in the wrong. From a moral standpoint, relationships with someone's parent, especially a friend's, can be problematic regardless of consent. Even if the adults involved are okay with it, the social dynamics and potential harm to the friend's feelings are important. The friend is still young (20) and might be in a vulnerable position, having just gone through his parents' divorce. The author's actions could be seen as taking advantage of the friend's living situation or the mom's loneliness post-divorce.\n\nAlso, the author's argument that \"everyone is an adult\" might not fully account for the power dynamics. The friend lives with his mom, so the author's relationship with her could create an uncomfortable or coercive environment for the friend. Even if the author was honest, the situation is inherently fraught. The friend's reaction is understandable, and the author's refusal to stop despite the consequences might show a lack of consideration for the friend's emotional state.\n\nAnother angle is the potential for manipulation. The mom was the one initiating the flirting, but the author chose to pursue a relationship. The fact that it's a casual one doesn't mitigate the issue if it's causing significant distress to the friend. The author might be prioritizing their own desires over the friend's well-being, which could be seen as selfish.\n\nIn terms of societal norms, relationships with someone's parent are often frowned upon, even if consensual. While there's no legal issue here (assuming the age of consent is met), the social repercussions are valid. The author's actions are leading to a breakdown in their social circle, which they might have foreseen but chose to proceed regardless.\n\nConsidering all these factors, even though the author was upfront, the situation is complicated by the existing friendship and family dynamics. The author's decision to continue the relationship despite the friend's distress suggests they might be in the wrong. So, the answer would be A.\n"
