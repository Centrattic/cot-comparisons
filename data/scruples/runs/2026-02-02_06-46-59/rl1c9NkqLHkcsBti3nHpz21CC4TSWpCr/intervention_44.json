My friend is 20 and lives with his single, divorced mom (41). She divorced his dad two years ago for being an alcoholic. Shes extremely hot in a more mature kind of way.\n\nWhenever i would hang out at his house his mom would openly flirt with me but i initially just chalked that up to her being playful and flirty. Except she kept up the flirting when we were alone, and everyime i stepped it up she would step it up herself.\n\nI asked her out, and weve had a casual sexual relationship for almost a month and a half. I was very open with my friend, his mom insisted on it and i dont want to hurt him.\n\nHe is completely put off by it, which i can understand, but at the same time everyone is an adult and can make their own choices. He orders me to stop seeing her and i refuse. He is now actively trying to get all of our friends to hate me and its been semi successful.\n\nEven if i stopped seeing his mom i dont believe he will let up with the smear campaign. Oddly enough this has actually driven me closer to his mom since im running out of friends.\n\nAITA in this situation even if i was upfront and honest with him?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation involves a 23-year-old having a casual sexual relationship with his friend's 41-year-old mother, and the friend is upset about it.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points here. The friend is 20, so he's still young, and his mom is divorced. The author says he was asked to stop by the friend, but he refuses. The friend is trying to get others to turn against him.\n\nLegally, both the author and the friend's mom are adults, so there's no legal issue. But morally and socially, it's more complicated. The main ethical question is whether it's wrong to have a relationship with someone's parent, especially when they're a close friend. The author claims he was upfront with the friend, which is a point in his favor because honesty is important. However, the friend is clearly hurt and upset, which suggests that the author might have crossed a social boundary.\n\nAnother angle is the power dynamic. The friend's mom was the one initiating the flirting, but once they started the relationship, the author continued despite knowing it would affect the friend. Even though adults make their own choices, the relationship affects the friend's social life and well-being, which means the author's actions have consequences beyond just their own relationship.\n\nAlso, the author mentions that the situation has driven him closer to the mother and away from friends. It's possible that he's prioritizing the relationship over his friendship, which could be seen as selfish. The fact that the friend is trying to get others to hate him shows how much this is affecting the social circle, and the author's refusal to stop might be exacerbating the problem.\n\nIn terms of moral responsibility, even if the author was honest, engaging in a relationship that causes significant distress to a friend could be considered wrong. The key factors here are consent (which is present between the author and the mother) versus the impact on the friend. While the author isn't breaking any laws, the social and emotional harm to the friend might make him responsible in a moral sense.\n\nI think the author is in the wrong because he chose to continue the relationship despite knowing it was causing his friend distress. Even though he was honest, the act of pursuing a relationship with a friend's parent, especially when it leads to the breakdown of friendships and intentional smear campaigns, is ethically questionable. The answer would be A, the author is in the wrong.\n"
