My friend is 20 and lives with his single, divorced mom (41). She divorced his dad two years ago for being an alcoholic. Shes extremely hot in a more mature kind of way.\n\nWhenever i would hang out at his house his mom would openly flirt with me but i initially just chalked that up to her being playful and flirty. Except she kept up the flirting when we were alone, and everyime i stepped it up she would step it up herself.\n\nI asked her out, and weve had a casual sexual relationship for almost a month and a half. I was very open with my friend, his mom insisted on it and i dont want to hurt him.\n\nHe is completely put off by it, which i can understand, but at the same time everyone is an adult and can make their own choices. He orders me to stop seeing her and i refuse. He is now actively trying to get all of our friends to hate me and its been semi successful.\n\nEven if i stopped seeing his mom i dont believe he will let up with the smear campaign. Oddly enough this has actually driven me closer to his mom since im running out of friends.\n\nAITA in this situation even if i was upfront and honest with him?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who started a casual relationship with their friend's mom is in the wrong. The setup is that the friend is 20, lives with his divorced mom, who's 41. The author is 23. The mom was flirting, they started a relationship, the friend is upset, and now there's a fallout.\n\nFirst, legal age. The mom is 41, the author is 23. Both adults. Legally, there's nothing wrong here. But socially and ethically, it's a different story. The key issue here is the relationship with the friend. The author says they were upfront with the friend, but the friend is still upset. The friend is 20, so maybe still in a position where he's close to his mom, and this feels like a betrayal. Even if the author was honest, the friend's feelings matter. The author might not be legally wrong, but socially, they're causing a rift. The mom is the parent of their friend, so there's a power dynamic there. The author might be seen as taking advantage of the situation where the friend is living with his mom and maybe vulnerable. Even if the mom is consenting, the fact that she's in a position of parental authority over someone who is still a minor (the friend is 20, but in some places, 18 is adult). Wait, the friend is 20, so maybe not a minor, but the mom is still his parent. So the author is getting involved with the parent of a close friend. That's a classic taboo. The author might be in the wrong because it's causing significant harm to their friend's social circle and trust. Even if everyone is an adult, the relationship could be seen as exploiting the friendship. The friend's mom might be okay, but the author's actions are creating a hostile environment. The author is choosing to continue the relationship despite the friend's objections, leading to a smear campaign. So the answer might be A. The author is in the wrong because they're causing harm to their friend and the social group, even if they were honest. The key point is the relationship is with a parent of a close friend, which is a breach of social norms and causing real damage.\n"
