My friend is 20 and lives with his single, divorced mom (41). She divorced his dad two years ago for being an alcoholic. Shes extremely hot in a more mature kind of way.\n\nWhenever i would hang out at his house his mom would openly flirt with me but i initially just chalked that up to her being playful and flirty. Except she kept up the flirting when we were alone, and everyime i stepped it up she would step it up herself.\n\nI asked her out, and weve had a casual sexual relationship for almost a month and a half. I was very open with my friend, his mom insisted on it and i dont want to hurt him.\n\nHe is completely put off by it, which i can understand, but at the same time everyone is an adult and can make their own choices. He orders me to stop seeing her and i refuse. He is now actively trying to get all of our friends to hate me and its been semi successful.\n\nEven if i stopped seeing his mom i dont believe he will let up with the smear campaign. Oddly enough this has actually driven me closer to his mom since im running out of friends.\n\nAITA in this situation even if i was upfront and honest with him?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who started a casual sexual relationship with his friend's mom is in the wrong. The situation involves a 23-year-old man who is in a casual relationship with his 20-year-old friend's 41-year-old mother. The friend is upset, and the user is facing social repercussions.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical aspects here. The key points are consent and the dynamics between the individuals involved. The user mentions that he was open with the friend, and the mother initiated flirting, which escalated. However, the friend is clearly hurt and upset. Even though all parties are adults and legally allowed to engage in such a relationship, the social and emotional impact on the friend is significant.\n\nThe user argues that everyone is an adult and can make their own choices. But relationships like this can create a power dynamic, especially since the mother is the parent of his friend. The friend living with his mom might feel that the user is overstepping, given the familial role the mother plays. Also, the user's decision to involve the mother of a close friend could be seen as a breach of trust, even if he was upfront. The friend's emotional response and subsequent smear campaign suggest that the user's actions have caused a rift in their friendship and social circle.\n\nMoral considerations aside, there's also the aspect of social norms. While not illegal, such relationships are often taboo and can lead to social ostracism. The user's justification that he was honest doesn't mitigate the hurt caused to his friend. The fact that the relationship has driven him closer to the mother while pushing away friends indicates a possible lack of empathy towards the friend's feelings.\n\nIn conclusion, while legally permissible, the situation is ethically complex. The user's actions have caused significant distress to a close friend and disrupted their social circle. Even if he was honest, the relationship's nature and the resulting harm to the friend's well-being suggest that the user is in the wrong. The answer is A.\n"
