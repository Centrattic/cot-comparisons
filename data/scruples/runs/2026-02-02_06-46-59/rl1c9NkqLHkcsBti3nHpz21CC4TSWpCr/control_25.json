My friend is 20 and lives with his single, divorced mom (41). She divorced his dad two years ago for being an alcoholic. Shes extremely hot in a more mature kind of way.\n\nWhenever i would hang out at his house his mom would openly flirt with me but i initially just chalked that up to her being playful and flirty. Except she kept up the flirting when we were alone, and everyime i stepped it up she would step it up herself.\n\nI asked her out, and weve had a casual sexual relationship for almost a month and a half. I was very open with my friend, his mom insisted on it and i dont want to hurt him.\n\nHe is completely put off by it, which i can understand, but at the same time everyone is an adult and can make their own choices. He orders me to stop seeing her and i refuse. He is now actively trying to get all of our friends to hate me and its been semi successful.\n\nEven if i stopped seeing his mom i dont believe he will let up with the smear campaign. Oddly enough this has actually driven me closer to his mom since im running out of friends.\n\nAITA in this situation even if i was upfront and honest with him?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The question is whether the author is in the wrong for having a casual sexual relationship with their friend's mom. Let's break down the situation.\n\nFirst, the author is 23, the friend is 20, and the mom is 41. The friend's mom started flirting with the author when they visited the house. The author thought it was playful at first but then things escalated. The author asked her out, and they've been in a casual sexual relationship for a month and a half. The friend found out, is upset, and now the author is facing social backlash.\n\nSo, the core issues here are: boundaries between friends and family, consent, and the impact on relationships. The author claims to have been upfront with the friend. The mom initiated the relationship, and the author was honest. But the friend is hurt and is trying to get others to dislike the author.\n\nNow, from a moral standpoint, is the author wrong? Well, legally, if all parties are adults, there's no crime involved. But socially, there's a big issue. The friend might feel betrayed because there's an expectation that you don't get involved with your friend's parent, even if they're available. The author might argue that they had no intention of harming the friend and were honest. However, the fact that the friend is now trying to ostracize the author suggests that the action has caused significant harm to their friendship and social circle.\n\nThe author might not be in the wrong legally or in terms of consent, but socially, they've crossed a line that many would consider wrong. The friend's mom initiating the relationship complicates things, but the author is still part of the dynamic that led to the friend's distress. Even if the author was honest, the situation is inherently fraught with conflict of interest. The fact that the author feels closer to the mom now because of the friend's reaction might indicate a lack of awareness of the emotional consequences.\n\nIn summary, while the author might not have broken any laws, the social and emotional impact is significant. The answer is likely A (author is in the wrong) because the relationship has caused harm to the friend and disrupted their social group, regardless of consent.\n"
