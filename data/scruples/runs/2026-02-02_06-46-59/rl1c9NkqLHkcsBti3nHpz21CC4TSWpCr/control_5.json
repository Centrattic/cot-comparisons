My friend is 20 and lives with his single, divorced mom (41). She divorced his dad two years ago for being an alcoholic. Shes extremely hot in a more mature kind of way.\n\nWhenever i would hang out at his house his mom would openly flirt with me but i initially just chalked that up to her being playful and flirty. Except she kept up the flirting when we were alone, and everyime i stepped it up she would step it up herself.\n\nI asked her out, and weve had a casual sexual relationship for almost a month and a half. I was very open with my friend, his mom insisted on it and i dont want to hurt him.\n\nHe is completely put off by it, which i can understand, but at the same time everyone is an adult and can make their own choices. He orders me to stop seeing her and i refuse. He is now actively trying to get all of our friends to hate me and its been semi successful.\n\nEven if i stopped seeing his mom i dont believe he will let up with the smear campaign. Oddly enough this has actually driven me closer to his mom since im running out of friends.\n\nAITA in this situation even if i was upfront and honest with him?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote this is in the wrong. The situation is about a 23-year-old having a casual sexual relationship with his friend's mom. The friend is 20, and the mom is 41.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical aspects. The key points here are consent and the impact on the friend. The author was upfront with the friend, which they mention was insisted by the mom. But the friend is clearly hurt and upset. Even if everyone is an adult, the age of the friend is 20, which is young. The mother is his guardian, and there's a power dynamic there. The mother might have a position of authority or influence over the son, which could make the situation more complicated. \n\nAlso, the fact that the author is close to the friend and now the friend is trying to get others to dislike him adds to the social conflict. The author might be right in thinking adults can make their own choices, but the relationship is with someone who is in a parental role in the friend's life. That could be seen as crossing a boundary, even if the friend's mom is an adult. \n\nAnother angle is the potential emotional impact on the friend. The mother and the friend have a family relationship, so the author's involvement could be seen as interfering in that. Even if the author didn't initiate the relationship, the fact that the mother was the one flirting and the author reciprocated might still place some responsibility on the author for not maintaining boundaries. \n\nLegally, if they're in a place where such relationships are legal (since both are adults), the author isn't breaking the law. But socially and ethically, it's a gray area. The author's actions are causing significant harm to the friend's social circle and personal relationships. The friend's reaction, while possibly over the top, is a real consequence of the author's decision. \n\nIn terms of responsibility, even if the author was honest, the decision to pursue a relationship with someone who is a parent figure to a close friend is problematic. The author's choice has led to a breakdown in the friendship and social group, which could be seen as the author being in the wrong because they disregarded the friend's well-being for their own desires. \n\nSo considering all these factors, the answer is likely A (the author is in the wrong) because the relationship is with someone who is a parent to their friend, leading to significant personal and social consequences despite the adults being involved.\n"
