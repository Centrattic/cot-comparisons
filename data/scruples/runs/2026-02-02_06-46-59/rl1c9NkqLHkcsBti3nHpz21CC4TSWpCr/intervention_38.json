My friend is 20 and lives with his single, divorced mom (41). She divorced his dad two years ago for being an alcoholic. Shes extremely hot in a more mature kind of way.\n\nWhenever i would hang out at his house his mom would openly flirt with me but i initially just chalked that up to her being playful and flirty. Except she kept up the flirting when we were alone, and everyime i stepped it up she would step it up herself.\n\nI asked her out, and weve had a casual sexual relationship for almost a month and a half. I was very open with my friend, his mom insisted on it and i dont want to hurt him.\n\nHe is completely put off by it, which i can understand, but at the same time everyone is an adult and can make their own choices. He orders me to stop seeing her and i refuse. He is now actively trying to get all of our friends to hate me and its been semi successful.\n\nEven if i stopped seeing his mom i dont believe he will let up with the smear campaign. Oddly enough this has actually driven me closer to his mom since im running out of friends.\n\nAITA in this situation even if i was upfront and honest with him?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for having a casual relationship with his friend's mom. The scenario is pretty clear.\n\nFirst, the author is 23, his friend is 20, and the mom is 41. The mom started flirting openly, and the author took it further. He told his friend, who is upset and trying to get friends to hate him. The author feels he's being reasonable because everyone is an adult.\n\nHmm. So the main issue here is the relationship between the author and the friend's mother. The mom is a divorced, single parent. The author was invited into the house, and the mom's flirting escalated. He did ask the friend first, which is good, but the friend is still upset. \n\nNow, from a moral standpoint, even if all parties are adults, the mother-son relationship is a family dynamic. The friend's reaction is understandable because it's his mom. The author might think it's about consent and adulthood, but the friend's emotional response is valid. \n\nAlso, the author's response to the friend's anger by continuing the relationship and not backing down could be seen as dismissive of the friend's feelings. Even if the author was upfront, the act itself could be considered inappropriate given the family context. \n\nThe fact that the author is making jokes about it, like calling himself a \"motherfucker,\" shows a lack of sensitivity. The situation is causing a lot of social fallout, which the author is aware of. \n\nSo, while the author might not have broken any laws, the social and emotional impact on the friend is significant. The wrong here is more about respecting boundaries and the friend's feelings. The author's actions are ethically questionable because they disrupt the family unit and the social circle. \n\nTherefore, I think the author is in the wrong. Answer A.\n"
