My friend is 20 and lives with his single, divorced mom (41). She divorced his dad two years ago for being an alcoholic. Shes extremely hot in a more mature kind of way.\n\nWhenever i would hang out at his house his mom would openly flirt with me but i initially just chalked that up to her being playful and flirty. Except she kept up the flirting when we were alone, and everyime i stepped it up she would step it up herself.\n\nI asked her out, and weve had a casual sexual relationship for almost a month and a half. I was very open with my friend, his mom insisted on it and i dont want to hurt him.\n\nHe is completely put off by it, which i can understand, but at the same time everyone is an adult and can make their own choices. He orders me to stop seeing her and i refuse. He is now actively trying to get all of our friends to hate me and its been semi successful.\n\nEven if i stopped seeing his mom i dont believe he will let up with the smear campaign. Oddly enough this has actually driven me closer to his mom since im running out of friends.\n\nAITA in this situation even if i was upfront and honest with him?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that the author, a 23-year-old, is in a casual sexual relationship with his friend's mom, who's 41 and divorced. The friend is 20, and the author claims he was upfront with him about the relationship. The friend is upset, and now the author is being shunned by friends due to the friend's smear campaign. The author is asking if he's the asshole here.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics between adults and relationships. The mom is an adult, so technically, as long as the relationship is consensual between two adults, that part might be okay. But the main issue here is the existing relationship with the friend. The author is friends with the son, and now he's involved with the mother. Even if the author was honest with the friend, the fact that the friend is 20, still probably has a close relationship with his mom, and the author is stepping into that dynamic complicates things.\n\nThere's also the aspect of the friend's feelings. The friend is put off and is trying to get others to dislike the author. The author might not see it, but involving someone's parent in a relationship can be very sensitive, especially when you're friends with the child. Even if the author is upfront, the act itself could be seen as taking advantage of a position or causing emotional harm to the friend.\n\nAnother thing to consider is the potential power dynamics. The mother is divorced and living with her son. If the author is friends with the son, there might be a perception of taking advantage of the situation. Also, the mother's behavior\u2014flirting openly with the author in front of her son could have added to the friend's discomfort. Even if the author didn't initiate it, the fact that he pursued the relationship might be seen as crossing a boundary.\n\nThe author's argument is that everyone is an adult and can make their choices. But relationships between adults can still be problematic when they affect others, especially if there's a pre-existing relationship with the child of the other person. The friend's well-being and feelings are valid here. Even if the author is honest, the act of engaging in a relationship with the friend's mom could be seen as ethically wrong because it disrupts the friend's trust and emotional state.\n\nMoreover, the author mentions that the situation has driven him closer to the mom because he's losing friends. This might indicate that he's using the mom as a source of support, which could further complicate things. The fact that the friend is launching a smear campaign suggests that the author's actions have caused significant harm to the friend's social standing and trust within the group.\n\nIn some cultures or contexts, relationships between friends and their parents might be more accepted, but generally, this is considered a taboo. Even in adult relationships, the social repercussions and emotional impact on the friend are significant. The author might not be wrong by law, but socially and ethically, he's probably in the wrong because he's causing harm to his friend and disrupting social bonds. The key point here is the impact on the friend and the existing friendship, which the author is ignoring by continuing the relationship despite the friend's objections.\n"
