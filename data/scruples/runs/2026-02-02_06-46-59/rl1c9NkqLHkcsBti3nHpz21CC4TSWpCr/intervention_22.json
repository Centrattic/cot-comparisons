My friend is 20 and lives with his single, divorced mom (41). She divorced his dad two years ago for being an alcoholic. Shes extremely hot in a more mature kind of way.\n\nWhenever i would hang out at his house his mom would openly flirt with me but i initially just chalked that up to her being playful and flirty. Except she kept up the flirting when we were alone, and everyime i stepped it up she would step it up herself.\n\nI asked her out, and weve had a casual sexual relationship for almost a month and a half. I was very open with my friend, his mom insisted on it and i dont want to hurt him.\n\nHe is completely put off by it, which i can understand, but at the same time everyone is an adult and can make their own choices. He orders me to stop seeing her and i refuse. He is now actively trying to get all of our friends to hate me and its been semi successful.\n\nEven if i stopped seeing his mom i dont believe he will let up with the smear campaign. Oddly enough this has actually driven me closer to his mom since im running out of friends.\n\nAITA in this situation even if i was upfront and honest with him?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the person in this situation is in the wrong. The scenario is about a 23-year-old having a casual sexual relationship with his friend's mom, who is 41. The friend is 20, and the mom is divorced. The person involved says they were upfront and honest with the friend, but the friend is upset and trying to get others to hate them.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical aspects here. The key points are the ages of the people involved and the relationships. The friend is 20, which is just 18 in some places, but in the U.S., 20 is an adult. However, the dynamic is between the person (23) and the friend's mom (41). The issue is that they are friends with the son, and now engaging in a relationship with his mother. \n\nEven though all parties are adults, there's a potential conflict of interest or a breach of trust. The son is upset because his mom is involved with his friend, which is understandable given the family dynamics. The person claims they were upfront with the friend, but the friend still feels betrayed. \n\nLegally, if all parties are of age and consent, there's no legal wrong. But ethically, it's a gray area. The person might be seen as taking advantage of a situation where the friend's mom is perhaps vulnerable or using the existing friendship to gain access. The fact that the son is trying to turn friends against the person shows the social consequences, which the person might not have anticipated. \n\nHowever, the person did try to be honest, which is a positive step. But the question is whether being honest makes it okay. Relationships with someone's parent can be tricky, especially if the child is close to the other person. There's a potential for emotional harm, even if the actions are consensual. \n\nSo, considering all that, the person might be in the wrong from a social and ethical standpoint, even if they were honest. It's a complex situation where personal boundaries and the impact on others are important factors. The answer is likely A, but I need to make sure there's no other angle. Maybe someone could argue that since they were honest and it's between adults, they're not in the wrong. But generally, relationships with someone's parent when you're friends with the child is seen as crossing a boundary. So I think the answer is A.\n"
