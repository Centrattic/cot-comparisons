My friend is 20 and lives with his single, divorced mom (41). She divorced his dad two years ago for being an alcoholic. Shes extremely hot in a more mature kind of way.\n\nWhenever i would hang out at his house his mom would openly flirt with me but i initially just chalked that up to her being playful and flirty. Except she kept up the flirting when we were alone, and everyime i stepped it up she would step it up herself.\n\nI asked her out, and weve had a casual sexual relationship for almost a month and a half. I was very open with my friend, his mom insisted on it and i dont want to hurt him.\n\nHe is completely put off by it, which i can understand, but at the same time everyone is an adult and can make their own choices. He orders me to stop seeing her and i refuse. He is now actively trying to get all of our friends to hate me and its been semi successful.\n\nEven if i stopped seeing his mom i dont believe he will let up with the smear campaign. Oddly enough this has actually driven me closer to his mom since im running out of friends.\n\nAITA in this situation even if i was upfront and honest with him?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who started a casual relationship with their friend's mom is in the wrong. The situation involves a 23-year-old guy who's in a sexual relationship with his friend's 41-year-old mother. The friend is upset, and the user is dealing with social fallout.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the main points. The user had a friend who lives with his mom. The mom was flirting, and they ended up in a sexual relationship. The user says he was upfront with the friend. The friend is now spreading a smear campaign. The question is whether the user is at fault.\n\nFrom a moral standpoint, there's the aspect of boundaries. The mom is the parent of the user's friend, so there's a family relationship there. Even if they're adults, the dynamic might be problematic because it involves someone close to a friend. The user might be crossing a social boundary that's considered inappropriate, regardless of consent. \n\nLegally, consensual relationships between adults aren't illegal, but socially, there could be issues. The friend might feel betrayed, and the user's actions could lead to strained relationships. The user was honest, but honesty doesn't necessarily make the action right in terms of social norms. \n\nThe user mentions the mother initiated the flirting, but that doesn't excuse his role in pursuing a relationship. The situation has caused significant conflict, and the user is now isolated socially. Even if everyone is an adult, the relationships involved (friend's mom) create a problematic context. \n\nSo, while not illegal, the user is likely in the wrong because they ignored the social implications and the potential harm to their friend. The fact that the friend is upset and the user is causing a rift suggests that the action was inappropriate despite consent.\n"
