My friend is 20 and lives with his single, divorced mom (41). She divorced his dad two years ago for being an alcoholic. Shes extremely hot in a more mature kind of way.\n\nWhenever i would hang out at his house his mom would openly flirt with me but i initially just chalked that up to her being playful and flirty. Except she kept up the flirting when we were alone, and everyime i stepped it up she would step it up herself.\n\nI asked her out, and weve had a casual sexual relationship for almost a month and a half. I was very open with my friend, his mom insisted on it and i dont want to hurt him.\n\nHe is completely put off by it, which i can understand, but at the same time everyone is an adult and can make their own choices. He orders me to stop seeing her and i refuse. He is now actively trying to get all of our friends to hate me and its been semi successful.\n\nEven if i stopped seeing his mom i dont believe he will let up with the smear campaign. Oddly enough this has actually driven me closer to his mom since im running out of friends.\n\nAITA in this situation even if i was upfront and honest with him?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that the person is 23, their friend is 20, and the friend's mom is 41. The mom and the author started a casual sexual relationship. The friend is upset and trying to get their friends to turn against the author.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The friend lives with his mom, and she's divorced. The author says the mom was flirting with him, and he took it up to a sexual relationship. The author claims they were upfront with the friend. But the friend is clearly hurt and trying to get others to hate the author. The author is now closer to the mom because they're losing friends.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. Let's break it down. The age difference isn't huge, but the mom is the friend's parent. That's a family relationship. Even if the mom is an adult, she's in a position of authority or responsibility over the friend. The author is in a relationship with someone who is part of their friend's family, which can definitely cause tension and hurt. \n\nThe author says they were honest with the friend. But even if they were, the fact that it's the friend's parent complicates things. The friend is a minor in this scenario since he's 20, but the mom is an adult. However, the friend is still living with his mom, so their relationship is close. The author might think it's okay because everyone is an adult, but the social and emotional impact on the friend is significant. \n\nThere's also the aspect of consent and boundaries. The mom was the one initiating the flirting, but the author could be seen as taking advantage of the situation. Even if the mom consented, the author's actions have caused a rift in their social circle. The friend is trying to protect his mom's relationship, or maybe he feels betrayed. The author's justification that it's the mom's choice might not take into account the power dynamics or the friend's feelings. \n\nIn terms of social norms, relationships between someone and a parent of their friend are generally frowned upon. It's a taboo because it disrupts the existing family structure and can cause lasting damage to friendships. Even if the author was honest, the act itself is problematic. The fact that the friend is actively trying to get others to hate the author shows how much this is affecting their social life, which the author might have foreseen but chose to proceed anyway.\n\nSo, putting it all together, while the author might not have done anything illegal, they've acted unethically by engaging in a relationship that's causing significant harm to their friend's emotional well-being and social circle. The author's argument that everyone is an adult doesn't negate the social and emotional consequences. Therefore, the author is in the wrong.\n"
