My friend is 20 and lives with his single, divorced mom (41). She divorced his dad two years ago for being an alcoholic. Shes extremely hot in a more mature kind of way.\n\nWhenever i would hang out at his house his mom would openly flirt with me but i initially just chalked that up to her being playful and flirty. Except she kept up the flirting when we were alone, and everyime i stepped it up she would step it up herself.\n\nI asked her out, and weve had a casual sexual relationship for almost a month and a half. I was very open with my friend, his mom insisted on it and i dont want to hurt him.\n\nHe is completely put off by it, which i can understand, but at the same time everyone is an adult and can make their own choices. He orders me to stop seeing her and i refuse. He is now actively trying to get all of our friends to hate me and its been semi successful.\n\nEven if i stopped seeing his mom i dont believe he will let up with the smear campaign. Oddly enough this has actually driven me closer to his mom since im running out of friends.\n\nAITA in this situation even if i was upfront and honest with him?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the post is in the wrong. The situation involves a 23-year-old having a casual sexual relationship with his friend's mom, who is 41. The friend is 20 and upset about it. The author says they were upfront with the friend.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the age of consent. In most places, the age of consent is around 16-18. Here, the friend is 20, but his mother is 41, so the relationship between the author and the mother would be between 23 and 41. As long as both adults consented, legally there's no issue. But socially, it's a different matter.\n\nThe main ethical issues here are the power dynamics and the existing relationship between the author and the friend. The author is friends with the son, which adds complexity. Even if the author was honest with the friend, the son might feel betrayed, especially since his mother is his parent. The mother's role as a guardian might also be a factor; if she's divorced and still has a parental role, her relationship with the son's friend could be seen as inappropriate.\n\nAnother angle is the mother's initial behavior. She was the one who started flirting, but the author took it further. However, both adults are consenting, so that's their choice. But the social circle is being disrupted because the friend is upset. The author mentions that the friend is trying to get others to hate him, which is a problem for the author. Still, the core issue is whether the author is in the wrong for being in a relationship with the friend's mom, despite being honest.\n\nAlso, the author claims it's a casual relationship, but the mother's actions and the son's reaction suggest it's a sensitive situation. Even if everyone is an adult, the interpersonal relationships are strained. The author might not be legally wrong, but socially and ethically, there's a lot to consider. The son's feelings and the potential for a power imbalance (the mother being his parent) could make the author responsible for causing harm to the friend. So, it's a nuanced situation where the author's actions, even if consensual, might be considered wrong due to the existing friendship and the parent's role.\n"
