My friend is 20 and lives with his single, divorced mom (41). She divorced his dad two years ago for being an alcoholic. Shes extremely hot in a more mature kind of way.\n\nWhenever i would hang out at his house his mom would openly flirt with me but i initially just chalked that up to her being playful and flirty. Except she kept up the flirting when we were alone, and everyime i stepped it up she would step it up herself.\n\nI asked her out, and weve had a casual sexual relationship for almost a month and a half. I was very open with my friend, his mom insisted on it and i dont want to hurt him.\n\nHe is completely put off by it, which i can understand, but at the same time everyone is an adult and can make their own choices. He orders me to stop seeing her and i refuse. He is now actively trying to get all of our friends to hate me and its been semi successful.\n\nEven if i stopped seeing his mom i dont believe he will let up with the smear campaign. Oddly enough this has actually driven me closer to his mom since im running out of friends.\n\nAITA in this situation even if i was upfront and honest with him?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user wants to know if the author of the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is that a 23-year-old guy has a casual sexual relationship with his friend's mom, who's 41. The friend is 20 and lives with her. The friend is upset and is trying to get their mutual friends to dislike the author. The author says he was upfront with the friend, but the friend is still upset.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The key points are the age difference, the relationship between the author and the friend, and the fact that the friend's mom is the one initiating the flirtation. The author mentions that the mom was openly flirting, and he eventually asked her out after she kept escalating. He was honest with the friend, but the friend is still upset and is spreading negative things about him.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. Let's break it down. The author is an adult (23), the mom is also an adult (41), and the friend is 20. The friend's mom is a single parent, divorced from the father for alcoholism. The author was friends with the son before the relationship started, and the son found out and is now upset.\n\nLegally, if all parties are adults and consenting, there's no legal wrong. But socially and morally, it's a different story. The son is close in age to the author (20 vs. 23), and the mother-son relationship is a trusting one. The author was friends with the son, which adds another layer. Even if the author was honest, the son might still feel betrayed. The mother may have a responsibility to avoid relationships with friends of her children, as it can complicate the child's trust and well-being.\n\nThe author might argue that he and the mom are adults and that he was upfront. However, being upfront with the son doesn't negate the fact that the relationship could cause emotional harm to the son. The son is still in a vulnerable position, living with his mom, and the author's involvement could disrupt their relationship. The author also mentions that the mom insisted on being upfront, but the son's reaction shows it's not just about honesty\u2014it's about the emotional impact.\n\nAnother angle: the author might be taking advantage of the son's trust and the mother's position of authority. Even if the mom initiated the flirting, the author's decision to pursue a relationship could be seen as taking advantage of their dynamic. The fact that the author is now closer to the mom because he's losing friends shows the negative consequences of his actions.\n\nSo, while there's no legal wrongdoing, the social and emotional implications are significant. The author's actions have caused distress to his friend and disrupted their social circle. Even with honesty, the relationship is ethically questionable because it involves a close friend's parent. The answer likely leans towards A (the author is in the wrong) because the relationship, despite the adults' consent, has caused harm to the son and the existing friendship.\n"
