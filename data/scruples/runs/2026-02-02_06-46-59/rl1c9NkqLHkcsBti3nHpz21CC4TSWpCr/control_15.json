My friend is 20 and lives with his single, divorced mom (41). She divorced his dad two years ago for being an alcoholic. Shes extremely hot in a more mature kind of way.\n\nWhenever i would hang out at his house his mom would openly flirt with me but i initially just chalked that up to her being playful and flirty. Except she kept up the flirting when we were alone, and everyime i stepped it up she would step it up herself.\n\nI asked her out, and weve had a casual sexual relationship for almost a month and a half. I was very open with my friend, his mom insisted on it and i dont want to hurt him.\n\nHe is completely put off by it, which i can understand, but at the same time everyone is an adult and can make their own choices. He orders me to stop seeing her and i refuse. He is now actively trying to get all of our friends to hate me and its been semi successful.\n\nEven if i stopped seeing his mom i dont believe he will let up with the smear campaign. Oddly enough this has actually driven me closer to his mom since im running out of friends.\n\nAITA in this situation even if i was upfront and honest with him?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong. The situation involves a 23-year-old having a casual sexual relationship with their friend's mom, who's 41. The friend is 20 and upset about it.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the relationships here. The friend is the son of the woman involved, so there's a family connection. The author was friends with the son first, and now the relationship with the mom has caused a rift. The author says they were upfront with the friend, but the friend is still upset and is trying to turn others against them.\n\nLegally, both the author and the mom are adults, so consensual sex isn't illegal. But socially and morally, it's a different story. The son is close to the author, so the relationship between the son and the author is part of the issue. The son might feel betrayed because the author was his friend first, and now is with his mom. Even if the author was honest, the act of pursuing a relationship with the friend's parent could be seen as crossing a line, regardless of consent.\n\nThen there's the emotional impact. The friend is hurt, and the author is now alienating their social circle. The author mentions that the friend is conducting a smear campaign, which is bad, but the initial action might have caused that. Even if the author is technically not breaking any laws, the social norms around relationships involving family members are strong. People often frown upon such relationships because they can disrupt family dynamics and betray trust.\n\nThe author claims they were honest, but being honest doesn't necessarily make the action right in terms of social expectations. The key point is the impact on the friend and the social group. The author might not be in the wrong legally, but morally, they're in a tricky spot because they've created tension and hurt feelings in a close-knit group.\n\nSo, considering all that, even though the author and the mom are both adults, the relationship is between the author and the friend's mother, which could be seen as crossing a social boundary. Therefore, the author is in the wrong from a social and moral standpoint.\n"
