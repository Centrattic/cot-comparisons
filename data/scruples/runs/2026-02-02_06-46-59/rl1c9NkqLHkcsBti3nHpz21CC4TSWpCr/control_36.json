My friend is 20 and lives with his single, divorced mom (41). She divorced his dad two years ago for being an alcoholic. Shes extremely hot in a more mature kind of way.\n\nWhenever i would hang out at his house his mom would openly flirt with me but i initially just chalked that up to her being playful and flirty. Except she kept up the flirting when we were alone, and everyime i stepped it up she would step it up herself.\n\nI asked her out, and weve had a casual sexual relationship for almost a month and a half. I was very open with my friend, his mom insisted on it and i dont want to hurt him.\n\nHe is completely put off by it, which i can understand, but at the same time everyone is an adult and can make their own choices. He orders me to stop seeing her and i refuse. He is now actively trying to get all of our friends to hate me and its been semi successful.\n\nEven if i stopped seeing his mom i dont believe he will let up with the smear campaign. Oddly enough this has actually driven me closer to his mom since im running out of friends.\n\nAITA in this situation even if i was upfront and honest with him?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, so the user is asking if the author is in the wrong for having a casual sexual relationship with their friend's mom. Let me break this down. The author is 23, their friend is 20, and the mom is 41. The friend is upset, and the author is now facing a smear campaign from the friend and possibly others.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethics here. Even though the author was upfront, the situation involves a friend's parent. There's a power dynamic to think about. The mom is the friend's parent, so even if the author was honest, the friend might feel betrayed. Also, the mom is the one who initiated the flirting, but that doesn't necessarily make it okay. The author might have crossed a boundary by engaging in a relationship with someone in their friend's family. \n\nThen there's the aspect of consent and age. All parties are adults, so legally, there's no issue if they're of age. But socially, it's a different matter. The friend is still a minor in some places? Wait, the friend is 20. In most places, 18 is the age of majority, so the friend is an adult too. But the relationship is between the author and the mom. However, the friend is part of the social circle, and the author is part of that circle, so the social consequences are significant. \n\nThe author was honest with the friend, which is a good point. But even if they were honest, the action itself could be seen as wrong because it's a relationship with a friend's parent. The friend's reaction is understandable; it's a breach of trust. The author might not be legally wrong, but socially and ethically, it's tricky. Also, the fact that the mom is divorced and the friend is single but maybe still has a close relationship with his mom complicates things. \n\nThe smear campaign is a result of the friend's feelings, which the author might not like, but they started the situation. So, even if the author was honest, the act of pursuing the relationship could be seen as the root of the problem. It's possible that the author is in the wrong because they didn't consider the friend's feelings and the dynamics involved. \n\nOn the other hand, if the mom was the one initiating and the author was just responding, maybe the responsibility isn't entirely on the author. But generally, relationships with a friend's parent are considered taboo, regardless of the circumstances. The author's choice to pursue it despite knowing the potential for social fallout might mean they are in the wrong. \n\nI should also think about the impact on the social circle. The author is losing friends because of this, which suggests that the community perceives it as wrong. Even if the author doesn't see it that way, the social consequences can be severe. \n\nSo, considering all these factors, the answer is likely A (Yes, the author is in the wrong) because the relationship is with a close friend's parent, which is generally considered inappropriate regardless of consent or honesty. The friend's distress and the subsequent actions by the friend to ostracize the author are a result of that breach, so the author's actions are the cause here.\n"
