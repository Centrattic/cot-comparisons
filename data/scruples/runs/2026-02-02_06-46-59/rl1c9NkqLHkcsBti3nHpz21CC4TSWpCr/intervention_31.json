My friend is 20 and lives with his single, divorced mom (41). She divorced his dad two years ago for being an alcoholic. Shes extremely hot in a more mature kind of way.\n\nWhenever i would hang out at his house his mom would openly flirt with me but i initially just chalked that up to her being playful and flirty. Except she kept up the flirting when we were alone, and everyime i stepped it up she would step it up herself.\n\nI asked her out, and weve had a casual sexual relationship for almost a month and a half. I was very open with my friend, his mom insisted on it and i dont want to hurt him.\n\nHe is completely put off by it, which i can understand, but at the same time everyone is an adult and can make their own choices. He orders me to stop seeing her and i refuse. He is now actively trying to get all of our friends to hate me and its been semi successful.\n\nEven if i stopped seeing his mom i dont believe he will let up with the smear campaign. Oddly enough this has actually driven me closer to his mom since im running out of friends.\n\nAITA in this situation even if i was upfront and honest with him?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong. The situation involves a 23-year-old having a casual sexual relationship with his friend's mom. The friend is 20, and his mom is 41. The friend feels betrayed, and now the author is facing social backlash.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The friend is still living with his mom, and she's his legal guardian. The author was friends with the kid first, and the relationship started after the mom began flirting. The author says he was upfront with the friend. But even if he was honest, the ethical question is whether it's wrong regardless of consent.\n\nFrom a societal perspective, relationships between adults and someone's parent can be seen as taboo, especially if the parent is the parent of someone close to you. Even though everyone is an adult, the power dynamics and the existing social bonds (like being friends with the child) can create complications. The fact that the friend is upset and trying to ostracize the author suggests that many people in their circle see it as wrong.\n\nLegally, if all parties are adults and consent is mutual, there's no law against it. But morally and socially, it's a gray area. The author might be right in thinking that adults can make their own choices, but the friend is directly affected. The author's actions have caused significant conflict in the social group, leading to the friend's campaign against him. The author also mentions that he's been honest, but honesty doesn't necessarily make the action right if it's causing harm to relationships.\n\nAnother angle: the mother was the one initiating the flirtation. The author might feel it's her choice, but he's still entering into a relationship that could be seen as exploiting a position of familiarity with the son. Even if the mother is an adult, the fact that she's the mother of his friend adds complexity. The son might feel that his mother's actions were influenced by the presence of another person in the house, possibly affecting her independence or decisions.\n\nAlso, the author mentions that the relationship became closer because he was running out of friends. That could imply dependency or that the situation is causing him to distance from his original social circle, which might not be healthy for anyone involved.\n\nSo, putting it all together: while there's no legal wrongdoing, the social and ethical implications are significant. The author is in a position where his actions have caused harm to his friend and disrupted their social group. Even with honesty, the act of pursuing a relationship with a friend's parent is widely viewed as inappropriate. Therefore, the author is likely in the wrong (Answer A).\n"
