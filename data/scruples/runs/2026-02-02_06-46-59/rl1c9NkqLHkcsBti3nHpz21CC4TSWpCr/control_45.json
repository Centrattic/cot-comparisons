My friend is 20 and lives with his single, divorced mom (41). She divorced his dad two years ago for being an alcoholic. Shes extremely hot in a more mature kind of way.\n\nWhenever i would hang out at his house his mom would openly flirt with me but i initially just chalked that up to her being playful and flirty. Except she kept up the flirting when we were alone, and everyime i stepped it up she would step it up herself.\n\nI asked her out, and weve had a casual sexual relationship for almost a month and a half. I was very open with my friend, his mom insisted on it and i dont want to hurt him.\n\nHe is completely put off by it, which i can understand, but at the same time everyone is an adult and can make their own choices. He orders me to stop seeing her and i refuse. He is now actively trying to get all of our friends to hate me and its been semi successful.\n\nEven if i stopped seeing his mom i dont believe he will let up with the smear campaign. Oddly enough this has actually driven me closer to his mom since im running out of friends.\n\nAITA in this situation even if i was upfront and honest with him?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for having a casual sexual relationship with his friend's mom. The key points here are the ages involved and the dynamics between the people.\n\nThe author is 23, his friend is 20, and the mom is 41. The friend's mom started flirting with the author when he was hanging out at their house. The author thought it was playful at first but then they started a relationship. The author was upfront with the friend, but the friend is upset and trying to get others to dislike the author.\n\nFirst, legally, if all parties are adults, the act itself might not be illegal, depending on the jurisdiction. But socially and ethically, it's a big issue. There's a power dynamic here: the friend's mom is in a parental role in the friend's life. The author was friends with the son, so there's a potential for jealousy, betrayal, and social repercussions. Even if the author was honest, the situation is inherently complicated because it involves someone's parent. The friend's reaction is understandable, even if he's being extreme. The author might be seen as taking advantage of a vulnerable position or not respecting the boundaries between the son and the parent. Even if the author wasn't at fault legally, socially, there's a strong argument that he's in the wrong because it's causing significant harm to the friend's life and their social circle. The fact that the friend is trying to get others to turn against the author shows the severity of the betrayal, even if the author was honest. So, considering all that, the answer would be A (the author is in the wrong).\n"
