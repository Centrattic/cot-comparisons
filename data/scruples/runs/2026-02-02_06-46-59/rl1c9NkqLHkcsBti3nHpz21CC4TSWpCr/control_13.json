My friend is 20 and lives with his single, divorced mom (41). She divorced his dad two years ago for being an alcoholic. Shes extremely hot in a more mature kind of way.\n\nWhenever i would hang out at his house his mom would openly flirt with me but i initially just chalked that up to her being playful and flirty. Except she kept up the flirting when we were alone, and everyime i stepped it up she would step it up herself.\n\nI asked her out, and weve had a casual sexual relationship for almost a month and a half. I was very open with my friend, his mom insisted on it and i dont want to hurt him.\n\nHe is completely put off by it, which i can understand, but at the same time everyone is an adult and can make their own choices. He orders me to stop seeing her and i refuse. He is now actively trying to get all of our friends to hate me and its been semi successful.\n\nEven if i stopped seeing his mom i dont believe he will let up with the smear campaign. Oddly enough this has actually driven me closer to his mom since im running out of friends.\n\nAITA in this situation even if i was upfront and honest with him?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for having a casual sexual relationship with their friend's mom. The situation involves a 23-year-old guy, his 20-year-old friend whose mom is 41. The mom was flirting from the start, the guy asked her out, they had a casual relationship for a month and a half. The friend is upset, spreading a smear campaign, and the author is wondering if they're in the wrong despite being upfront.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The key points are consent, age, and the relationship between the individuals. The mom is 41, the author is 23. Legally, both are adults. However, the mom is the parent of the friend, which creates a power imbalance. Even if the mom initiated the flirting, the fact that she's the parent of the friend complicates things. The friend is 20, so he's still in a position where his mother is making decisions about his household, maybe, or at least has a parental role.\n\nThe author says he was upfront with the friend. But even if he was honest, the act of engaging in a relationship with a parent of a close friend is inherently problematic. Friends often trust each other, and this could breach that trust. The friend's reaction is understandable; he's likely feeling betrayed because his mom is someone he's supposed to have a close, trusting relationship with. \n\nAlso, the author mentions that the friend is trying to get others to hate him. That's a negative consequence, but the question is about whether the author is in the wrong. The author's actions led to this conflict. Even if the mom was willing, the relationships involved (friendship with the son) are affected. \n\nThere's also the aspect of the mother being in a position of potential authority or influence over her son's environment. Even though they're all adults, the relationship crosses a social boundary that's generally frowned upon. It's not just about consent but about the social implications and the impact on existing relationships.\n\nSo, even though the author was honest, engaging in a relationship with a friend's parent is typically seen as a breach of trust and social norms. The answer is likely A (the author is in the wrong) because of the breach of trust with the friend and the complex dynamics involved, regardless of consent. The fact that the friend is still close to his mom and the author's actions caused such a rift supports the idea that the author overstepped boundaries.\n"
