Except she kept up the flirting when we were alone, and everyime i stepped it up she would step it up herself.\n\nI asked her out, and weve had a casual sexual relationship for almost a month and a half. I was very open with my friend, his mom insisted on it and i dont want to hurt him.\n\nHe is completely put off by it, which i can understand, but at the same time everyone is an adult and can make their own choices. He orders me to stop seeing her and i refuse. He is now actively trying to get all of our friends to hate me and its been semi successful.\n\nEven if i stopped seeing his mom i dont believe he will let up with the smear campaign.

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. Let me read through the situation again carefully.\n\nThe author is 23, their friend is 20, and the friend's mom is 41. The friend's mom divorced his dad two years ago because of alcoholism. She's described as \"extremely hot in a more mature kind of way.\" The author mentions that the mom was openly flirting, and they started a casual sexual relationship about a month and a half ago. The author says they were upfront with the friend and that the mom insisted on it. Now the friend is upset, wants them to stop, and is trying to get friends to hate the author. The author is wondering if they're at fault.\n\nFirst, let me consider the ethical aspects. The main issue here is that the author is in a relationship with someone's parent. Even though all three are adults, the dynamic involves a young adult's parent. The author's friend is 20, so not an adult in some places (like the US, the age of majority is 18, so they are technically an adult, but maybe they're still in school or not living independently). The parent is 41, which is a significant age difference.\n\nThe author claims they were honest with the friend, but the friend is clearly hurt. The fact that the author is continuing the relationship despite the friend's objections and the parent's insistence might complicate things. Also, the parent was the one initiating the flirtation, but the author chose to engage and take it further.\n\nLegally, as long as there's no incest or close family relation, it might be permissible, but social norms often frown upon such relationships, especially when one person is a parent of a close friend. The author might be violating social boundaries, which could lead to the friend's anger and subsequent actions.\n\nEven if the author was honest, the friend might still feel betrayed. The parent's initial flirtation might have been inappropriate, but the author's decision to act on it is a choice. The author is now facing social consequences, but maybe that's a result of their actions.\n\nThe author mentions that the friend is trying to get others to hate them, which is unkind, but the root of the problem is the author's relationship with the mom. The question is whether the author is morally wrong in pursuing this relationship, despite the friend's discomfort.\n\nIn many cultures, relationships with someone's parent are considered taboo, regardless of the individuals' ages. So even if all parties are adults, the social implications can be severe. The author might be in the wrong for not respecting their friend's feelings and the social norms, even if they were honest.\n\nAlso, considering the parent's situation\u2014divorced, and her child is still living with her. The parent might not have considered the impact on their child when engaging with the friend's friend. But the author still made the choice to pursue this.\n\nSo putting it all together, even though the author was upfront, the act of entering a sexual relationship with a friend's parent is likely seen as wrong in most social contexts. Therefore, the answer might be A (Yes, the author is in the wrong).\n"
