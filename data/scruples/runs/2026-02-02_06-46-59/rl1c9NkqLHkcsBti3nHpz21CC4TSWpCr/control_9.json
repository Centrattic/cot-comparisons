My friend is 20 and lives with his single, divorced mom (41). She divorced his dad two years ago for being an alcoholic. Shes extremely hot in a more mature kind of way.\n\nWhenever i would hang out at his house his mom would openly flirt with me but i initially just chalked that up to her being playful and flirty. Except she kept up the flirting when we were alone, and everyime i stepped it up she would step it up herself.\n\nI asked her out, and weve had a casual sexual relationship for almost a month and a half. I was very open with my friend, his mom insisted on it and i dont want to hurt him.\n\nHe is completely put off by it, which i can understand, but at the same time everyone is an adult and can make their own choices. He orders me to stop seeing her and i refuse. He is now actively trying to get all of our friends to hate me and its been semi successful.\n\nEven if i stopped seeing his mom i dont believe he will let up with the smear campaign. Oddly enough this has actually driven me closer to his mom since im running out of friends.\n\nAITA in this situation even if i was upfront and honest with him?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user wants to know if the author is in the wrong for having a sexual relationship with his friend's mom. So, the situation is that the author is 23, his friend is 20, and the mom is 41. The mom started flirting, they ended up in a casual relationship, and the friend is upset, spreading hate.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the relationships here. The friend is 20, so he's still an adult, but there's a clear power dynamic. The mom is his mother, so there's a familial connection. The author was friends with the son first, then got involved with the mom. The son is now angry and cutting off the author. \n\nLegally, in most places, both are adults, so consensual relationships are allowed. But socially and morally, there's a lot to unpack. The son is close to his mom, and the author's actions might be causing emotional distress. Even if the author was honest with the son, the son's reaction is understandable because of the emotional bond. \n\nThe author claims he was upfront. But even if he was honest, the son's trust is broken. The situation might not be about legal rightness but about the impact on the son's feelings. The author might be in the wrong from a moral standpoint because he's essentially dating his friend's mother, which is a common taboo. \n\nAlso, the author is using the son's house, which might imply some level of trust. The mom's actions could be seen as taking advantage of her son's friend. The author's decision to continue despite the son's anger might be seen as selfish. \n\nSo, even if all parties are adults, the social norms and the son's feelings matter. The author might not be legally wrong, but morally, he's in the wrong. The answer is likely A.\n"
