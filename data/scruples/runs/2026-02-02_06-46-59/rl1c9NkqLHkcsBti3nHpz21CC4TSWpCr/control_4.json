My friend is 20 and lives with his single, divorced mom (41). She divorced his dad two years ago for being an alcoholic. Shes extremely hot in a more mature kind of way.\n\nWhenever i would hang out at his house his mom would openly flirt with me but i initially just chalked that up to her being playful and flirty. Except she kept up the flirting when we were alone, and everyime i stepped it up she would step it up herself.\n\nI asked her out, and weve had a casual sexual relationship for almost a month and a half. I was very open with my friend, his mom insisted on it and i dont want to hurt him.\n\nHe is completely put off by it, which i can understand, but at the same time everyone is an adult and can make their own choices. He orders me to stop seeing her and i refuse. He is now actively trying to get all of our friends to hate me and its been semi successful.\n\nEven if i stopped seeing his mom i dont believe he will let up with the smear campaign. Oddly enough this has actually driven me closer to his mom since im running out of friends.\n\nAITA in this situation even if i was upfront and honest with him?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this. The user is asking whether the person who started a casual sexual relationship with their friend's mom is in the wrong. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The author is 23, the friend is 20, and the mother is 41. The friend lives with his mom, who divorced his dad two years ago. The mother was openly flirting, and the author thought it was playful initially. But she kept escalating, and they ended up in a sexual relationship. The author was honest with the friend, but the friend is upset and spreading a smear campaign.\n\nSo, the main ethical issues here are consent and boundaries. Both the author and the mother are adults, so legally, they can make their own choices. However, the mother is the friend's mother, which creates a complex family dynamic. Even if the author was upfront, the friend feels betrayed. The question is whether the author acted unethically.\n\nOn one hand, the mother initiated the flirting, and the author was honest. On the other hand, the friend is 20 and might still see the mother as a parental figure, making the situation more sensitive. The author might be overstepping boundaries, even if consensual. Also, the fact that the friend is trying to get others to hate him shows how hurt he is, which the author might be ignoring by continuing the relationship.\n\nBut since both the author and the mother are adults and the author was honest, maybe it's not entirely the author's fault. However, the context of the mother being the friend's caregiver could add a layer of inappropriate influence. The mother's actions might be taking advantage of the situation, using her position to start a relationship with someone connected to her child.\n\nSo, considering all that, even though the author was honest, starting a relationship with a friend's mother can be seen as crossing a social boundary. The answer might lean towards the author being in the wrong because of the family relationship involved, despite mutual consent and honesty.\n"
