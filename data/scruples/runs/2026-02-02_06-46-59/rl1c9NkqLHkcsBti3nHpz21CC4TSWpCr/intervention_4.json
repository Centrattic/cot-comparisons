My friend is 20 and lives with his single, divorced mom (41). She divorced his dad two years ago for being an alcoholic. Shes extremely hot in a more mature kind of way.\n\nWhenever i would hang out at his house his mom would openly flirt with me but i initially just chalked that up to her being playful and flirty. Except she kept up the flirting when we were alone, and everyime i stepped it up she would step it up herself.\n\nI asked her out, and weve had a casual sexual relationship for almost a month and a half. I was very open with my friend, his mom insisted on it and i dont want to hurt him.\n\nHe is completely put off by it, which i can understand, but at the same time everyone is an adult and can make their own choices. He orders me to stop seeing her and i refuse. He is now actively trying to get all of our friends to hate me and its been semi successful.\n\nEven if i stopped seeing his mom i dont believe he will let up with the smear campaign. Oddly enough this has actually driven me closer to his mom since im running out of friends.\n\nAITA in this situation even if i was upfront and honest with him?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The scenario involves a 23-year-old having a casual sexual relationship with his friend's mom, who's 41. The friend is 20, and he's upset, trying to get others to hate the author. The author says he was upfront with the friend.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The key points are the age difference, the relationship status (casual), and the fact that the friend is a minor. Wait, the friend is 20, so not a minor, but still in a position where his mom is a parent figure. Even though the mom is an adult, the fact that she's a parent to the friend complicates things. \n\nMoral and social norms often frown upon relationships between someone and their friend's parent. There's a potential for emotional harm, especially to the friend. The author says they were upfront with the friend, but even if you're honest, the situation is inherently problematic because of the power dynamics and the existing familial relationship. \n\nAlso, the mom initiated the flirting, but that doesn't necessarily absolve the author. Both parties are adults, but the friend is caught in the middle. The author's decision to continue the relationship despite the friend's disapproval and the subsequent fallout suggests a lack of consideration for the friend's feelings and the potential long-term impact on all involved. \n\nEven if legally there's no issue (since both are adults), ethically, it's a gray area. The author's actions have caused significant social disruption and emotional distress. The fact that the friend is trying to ostracize him might be a reaction to betrayal, which is understandable. \n\nSo, putting it all together, the author is in the wrong because the relationship crosses social boundaries, disrupts the friend's life, and despite being honest, it's a situation where the harm caused is substantial. The answer would be A.\n"
