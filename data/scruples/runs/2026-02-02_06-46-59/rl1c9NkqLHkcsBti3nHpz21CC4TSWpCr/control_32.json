My friend is 20 and lives with his single, divorced mom (41). She divorced his dad two years ago for being an alcoholic. Shes extremely hot in a more mature kind of way.\n\nWhenever i would hang out at his house his mom would openly flirt with me but i initially just chalked that up to her being playful and flirty. Except she kept up the flirting when we were alone, and everyime i stepped it up she would step it up herself.\n\nI asked her out, and weve had a casual sexual relationship for almost a month and a half. I was very open with my friend, his mom insisted on it and i dont want to hurt him.\n\nHe is completely put off by it, which i can understand, but at the same time everyone is an adult and can make their own choices. He orders me to stop seeing her and i refuse. He is now actively trying to get all of our friends to hate me and its been semi successful.\n\nEven if i stopped seeing his mom i dont believe he will let up with the smear campaign. Oddly enough this has actually driven me closer to his mom since im running out of friends.\n\nAITA in this situation even if i was upfront and honest with him?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who started a casual relationship with their friend's mom is in the wrong. The situation involves a 23-year-old, a friend who's 20, and the mom who's 41. The friend's mom was flirting, the person asked her out, and now there's a fallout.\n\nFirst, the key points here are consent and honesty. The author says they were upfront and honest with their friend. But the friend is upset and spreading a smear campaign. The question is whether the author is in the wrong.\n\nFrom a moral standpoint, even if everyone is an adult, the fact that it's a friend's parent complicates things. Relationships with someone's parent can cause a lot of social tension. The author might argue that they were honest, but the action itself is still sensitive. The friend's reaction is understandable because it's a breach of trust and social boundaries. Even if the mom consented, the author is still engaging in a relationship that the friend finds unacceptable.\n\nAlso, the fact that the friend is now trying to get others to hate the author suggests that the situation is causing significant harm to their social circle. While the author might feel it's their right to choose, the consequences are real and affecting others. The mom's divorce and the friend's emotional state (since his mom is his parent) add layers of complexity. The author's insistence on continuing the relationship despite the friend's objections could be seen as selfish, even if they were honest upfront.\n\nSo, considering the impact on the friend, the social dynamics, and the inherent awkwardness of the situation, the answer is likely that the author is in the wrong. The key is that relationships with someone's parent can be ethically problematic regardless of consent, due to the existing familial bonds and the potential for harm.\n"
