My friend is 20 and lives with his single, divorced mom (41). She divorced his dad two years ago for being an alcoholic. Shes extremely hot in a more mature kind of way.\n\nWhenever i would hang out at his house his mom would openly flirt with me but i initially just chalked that up to her being playful and flirty. Except she kept up the flirting when we were alone, and everyime i stepped it up she would step it up herself.\n\nI asked her out, and weve had a casual sexual relationship for almost a month and a half. I was very open with my friend, his mom insisted on it and i dont want to hurt him.\n\nHe is completely put off by it, which i can understand, but at the same time everyone is an adult and can make their own choices. He orders me to stop seeing her and i refuse. He is now actively trying to get all of our friends to hate me and its been semi successful.\n\nEven if i stopped seeing his mom i dont believe he will let up with the smear campaign. Oddly enough this has actually driven me closer to his mom since im running out of friends.\n\nAITA in this situation even if i was upfront and honest with him?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break down this situation. The user is asking if the person who started the casual relationship with their friend's mom is in the wrong. The key points here are the ages involved, the relationships, and the social consequences.\n\nFirst, the author is 23, their friend is 20, and the mom is 41. The mom was open about flirting, and the author took the initiative to ask her out. They mention being upfront with the friend. The friend is upset, leading to social issues and a smear campaign.\n\nLegally, all parties are adults. But there's a dynamic where the mom is the parent of the author's friend. Even if the mom initiated, the author is in a position where they're dating someone who is a parent of a close friend. This can be seen as a betrayal of trust, even if the friend's mom is an adult. The friend might feel that the author violated their trust, especially since they live together.\n\nEthically, the situation is tricky. The mom's divorce and her behavior might contribute, but the author could still be seen as taking advantage of a vulnerable situation. The friend's reaction is understandable because of the emotional connection and potential feelings of guilt or betrayal, even if the author was honest.\n\nSocially, relationships with adults are allowed, but when it involves someone's family, it's more complicated. The author's actions have caused significant rifts, which might indicate they are in the wrong, not just legally but in terms of social norms and trust. The fact that the friend is actively trying to turn others against them shows the seriousness of the breach.\n\nSo, while the author wasn't forced into the relationship and was honest, the context of the relationship (friend's parent) and the resulting social fallout suggest that the author is in a problematic position. The answer is likely A, the author is in the wrong.\n"
