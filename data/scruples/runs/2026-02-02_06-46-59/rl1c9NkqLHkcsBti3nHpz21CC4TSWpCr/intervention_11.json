My friend is 20 and lives with his single, divorced mom (41). She divorced his dad two years ago for being an alcoholic. Shes extremely hot in a more mature kind of way.\n\nWhenever i would hang out at his house his mom would openly flirt with me but i initially just chalked that up to her being playful and flirty. Except she kept up the flirting when we were alone, and everyime i stepped it up she would step it up herself.\n\nI asked her out, and weve had a casual sexual relationship for almost a month and a half. I was very open with my friend, his mom insisted on it and i dont want to hurt him.\n\nHe is completely put off by it, which i can understand, but at the same time everyone is an adult and can make their own choices. He orders me to stop seeing her and i refuse. He is now actively trying to get all of our friends to hate me and its been semi successful.\n\nEven if i stopped seeing his mom i dont believe he will let up with the smear campaign. Oddly enough this has actually driven me closer to his mom since im running out of friends.\n\nAITA in this situation even if i was upfront and honest with him?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break down this situation. The author is 23, involved in a casual sexual relationship with his friend's mom, who is 41. The friend is 20 and upset, leading to social issues.\n\nFirst, the key points: The author was aware of the mother's flirting, initiated the relationship after asking her out, and was upfront with the friend. The friend is upset and spreading a smear campaign. The author feels everyone is an adult and can make choices.\n\nMoral and social norms often consider relationships with someone's parent as taboo, even if all parties are adults. The friend's reaction is understandable because the relationship crosses a social boundary. The author might think consent and honesty matter, but the dynamic between friends and family can be complex. The mother's actions might be questionable too, but the focus is on the author. \n\nEven though the author was honest, the act of getting involved with a friend's parent inherently causes tension. The impact on the friend's well-being and the social circle's dynamics are significant. The author's refusal to end the relationship despite the friend's distress shows a lack of consideration for his feelings and the resulting fallout. \n\nEthically, it's a gray area, but many would argue the author is in the wrong because of the disruption caused and the potential emotional harm to the friend. The fact that the author is still engaging more with the mother despite the consequences also adds to the moral dilemma.\n"
