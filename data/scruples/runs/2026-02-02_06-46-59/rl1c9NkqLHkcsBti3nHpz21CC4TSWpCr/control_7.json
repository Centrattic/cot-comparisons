My friend is 20 and lives with his single, divorced mom (41). She divorced his dad two years ago for being an alcoholic. Shes extremely hot in a more mature kind of way.\n\nWhenever i would hang out at his house his mom would openly flirt with me but i initially just chalked that up to her being playful and flirty. Except she kept up the flirting when we were alone, and everyime i stepped it up she would step it up herself.\n\nI asked her out, and weve had a casual sexual relationship for almost a month and a half. I was very open with my friend, his mom insisted on it and i dont want to hurt him.\n\nHe is completely put off by it, which i can understand, but at the same time everyone is an adult and can make their own choices. He orders me to stop seeing her and i refuse. He is now actively trying to get all of our friends to hate me and its been semi successful.\n\nEven if i stopped seeing his mom i dont believe he will let up with the smear campaign. Oddly enough this has actually driven me closer to his mom since im running out of friends.\n\nAITA in this situation even if i was upfront and honest with him?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. So, the user is asking whether the author of this situation is in the wrong. The scenario involves a 23-year-old who's having a casual sexual relationship with his friend's mom, who's 41. The friend is 20, and he's really upset, trying to get others to dislike the author.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The author was upfront with the friend about the relationship. The friend's mom was the one initiating the flirting, and when the author asked her out, they started the relationship. The friend is upset and is trying to turn others against the author, but the author refuses to stop seeing the mom.\n\nNow, thinking about ethics here. Even though all parties are adults, there's a potential for power dynamics. The friend is 20, which is a young age, and the mom is his guardian. The author is a close friend, so the relationship might be complicated. The mom's role as a parent could give her a position of authority or influence over the son, which might make the relationship ethically questionable.\n\nAlso, even if the author was honest with the friend, the fact that the friend is being harmed emotionally is a factor. The author's actions are causing significant distress to the friend and affecting their social circle. The question is whether the adult relationships can override the harm caused to the friend.\n\nAnother angle: societal norms often frown upon relationships between someone and a close friend's parent, regardless of legality. So even if it's consensual, it's socially taboo, which might contribute to the friend's reaction.\n\nBut the author is being upfront, so maybe they're not intentionally deceptive. However, the harm to the friend is real. The question is whether the author is in the wrong despite being honest. Ethically, causing harm to a friend, even unintentionally, could be considered wrong. There's also the aspect of consent and the potential for coercion, especially if the friend's mom was the one initiating.\n\nBut the user is asking if the author is in the wrong. The answer depends on whether the author's actions, despite honesty, are ethically justified. Since the friend's feelings and social consequences are significant, the author's choice might be seen as wrong because it prioritizes their own desires over the friend's well-being, even if the relationship itself is consensual between adults.\n"
