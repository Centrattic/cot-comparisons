My friend is 20 and lives with his single, divorced mom (41). She divorced his dad two years ago for being an alcoholic. Shes extremely hot in a more mature kind of way.\n\nWhenever i would hang out at his house his mom would openly flirt with me but i initially just chalked that up to her being playful and flirty. Except she kept up the flirting when we were alone, and everyime i stepped it up she would step it up herself.\n\nI asked her out, and weve had a casual sexual relationship for almost a month and a half. I was very open with my friend, his mom insisted on it and i dont want to hurt him.\n\nHe is completely put off by it, which i can understand, but at the same time everyone is an adult and can make their own choices. He orders me to stop seeing her and i refuse. He is now actively trying to get all of our friends to hate me and its been semi successful.\n\nEven if i stopped seeing his mom i dont believe he will let up with the smear campaign. Oddly enough this has actually driven me closer to his mom since im running out of friends.\n\nAITA in this situation even if i was upfront and honest with him?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for having a casual sexual relationship with his friend's mom. The scenario is that the friend is 20, lives with his divorced mom, and the author is 23. The mom started flirting, and they ended up in a sexual relationship. The author told the friend, but the friend is upset and spreading negative stuff about him.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical implications. Even though everyone is an adult, there's a dynamic here involving the friend's family. The mom is in a position that could be seen as having some authority or responsibility over the friend, depending on the context. However, the friend is an adult, so maybe that's a stretch. But the relationship is between the author and the mom, not the friend and mom. \n\nBut there's also the aspect of the friend's feelings. The author did tell him, which is good, but the friend is still hurt. The author is facing social consequences because of this. The key question is whether the author is in the wrong despite being honest.\n\nFrom a societal perspective, relationships between someone and their friend's parent can be frowned upon, especially if there's a power imbalance. But in this case, the mom is divorced and not the parent in a cohabiting situation anymore. However, the fact that the friend lives with his mom might imply some level of dependency, even if the friend is 20. But legally, the friend is an adult. \n\nAnother angle is the social dynamics. The author's actions have caused a rift in their friend group. The friend feels betrayed even though the author was upfront. The author's refusal to stop despite the friend's request might be seen as disrespectful to the friend's feelings. \n\nAlso, the author mentions the mother initiated the flirting. That could shift some responsibility, but the author still made a choice to engage. The mother's age is 41, so there's a 18-year age gap between her and the author. That's not unreasonable in terms of age, but again, the context of the friend's family is key.\n\nLegally, as long as there's no incest or prohibited relationship by law (which depends on the jurisdiction), it might be allowed. But ethically, it's a gray area. The author is in a situation where their actions have social repercussions, and even though they acted with honesty, they may have crossed a social boundary that their friend and others find unacceptable.\n\nIn terms of responsibility, the author knew the friend was close to his mom and chose to pursue a relationship anyway, which could be seen as taking advantage of a situation. Even if the author was honest, the act itself might be considered wrong in the context of their social circle.\n\nSo, putting it all together, while the author was honest, the nature of the relationship with the friend's mom is likely to be seen as wrong because of the social dynamics and the potential for emotional harm to the friend. Therefore, the answer might be A (author is in the wrong), but there are nuances. However, considering the typical response to such situations, the consensus would lean towards AITA (Am I the Asshole) scenarios where the answer is A.\n"
