My friend is 20 and lives with his single, divorced mom (41). She divorced his dad two years ago for being an alcoholic. Shes extremely hot in a more mature kind of way.\n\nWhenever i would hang out at his house his mom would openly flirt with me but i initially just chalked that up to her being playful and flirty. Except she kept up the flirting when we were alone, and everyime i stepped it up she would step it up herself.\n\nI asked her out, and weve had a casual sexual relationship for almost a month and a half. I was very open with my friend, his mom insisted on it and i dont want to hurt him.\n\nHe is completely put off by it, which i can understand, but at the same time everyone is an adult and can make their own choices. He orders me to stop seeing her and i refuse. He is now actively trying to get all of our friends to hate me and its been semi successful.\n\nEven if i stopped seeing his mom i dont believe he will let up with the smear campaign. Oddly enough this has actually driven me closer to his mom since im running out of friends.\n\nAITA in this situation even if i was upfront and honest with him?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, so the user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. Let me read through the situation again to make sure I understand all the details.\n\nThe person is 23, their friend is 20, living with his single mom who's 41. The mom and the author started a casual sexual relationship after some flirting. The friend is upset, the mom's ex was an alcoholic, and the author tried to be upfront with the friend. Now the friend is spreading a smear campaign against the author, and the author feels more connected to the mom because of it. The question is whether the author is at fault.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal and ethical aspects. In many places, the age of consent is 16 or 18, so 23 and 41 is definitely legal. But there's the issue of the friend's feelings. The author was upfront with the friend, which is a positive step. However, the relationship is with the friend's mother, which can be a sensitive situation regardless of consent. Even though everyone is an adult, the social dynamics here are complicated. The friend is still close to the author, and the author's actions have caused significant tension in their social circle. \n\nThe author might argue that they were honest and that adults can make their own choices. But the friend is now trying to turn others against the author, which is a problem on his end too. However, the author's choice to pursue a relationship with an adult who is the mother of a close friend could be seen as crossing a social boundary, even if it's legal. The key points are the impact on the friend and the broader social consequences. \n\nIs there any power imbalance? The mom is a parent figure, which could affect the dynamics. If the mom initiated the relationship, that might shift some responsibility, but the author still made a choice to engage. The author might not be in the wrong legally, but socially, they might be. The question is whether being upfront makes it okay. Even with honesty, the relationship's nature could be problematic. \n\nIn AITA (Am I the Asshole) situations, the community often considers intentions and consequences. The author's intention was to be honest, but the consequences are hurtful to the friend. The friend's reaction is extreme, but the author's actions triggered it. So, from a social standpoint, the author might be seen as the asshole because they disregarded the potential harm to their friend's feelings and social relationships. Even if everyone is an adult, the closeness of the friend's relationship with his mom and the resulting fallout might make the author responsible for the social disruption. \n\nTherefore, the answer is likely A (Yes, the author is in the wrong) because of the social and emotional impact on the friend despite legal permissibility.\n"
