My friend is 20 and lives with his single, divorced mom (41). She divorced his dad two years ago for being an alcoholic. Shes extremely hot in a more mature kind of way.\n\nWhenever i would hang out at his house his mom would openly flirt with me but i initially just chalked that up to her being playful and flirty. Except she kept up the flirting when we were alone, and everyime i stepped it up she would step it up herself.\n\nI asked her out, and weve had a casual sexual relationship for almost a month and a half. I was very open with my friend, his mom insisted on it and i dont want to hurt him.\n\nHe is completely put off by it, which i can understand, but at the same time everyone is an adult and can make their own choices. He orders me to stop seeing her and i refuse. He is now actively trying to get all of our friends to hate me and its been semi successful.\n\nEven if i stopped seeing his mom i dont believe he will let up with the smear campaign. Oddly enough this has actually driven me closer to his mom since im running out of friends.\n\nAITA in this situation even if i was upfront and honest with him?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for having a casual sexual relationship with their friend's mom.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key elements here. The author is 23, the friend is 20, and the mom is 41. The friend's mom started flirting with the author, and they ended up in a relationship. The author was upfront with the friend, but the friend is upset and spreading negative things about the author. The author argues that everyone is an adult and can make their own choices.\n\nHmm, so the main issue is the relationship between the author and the friend's mom. The friend is a minor in terms of age compared to the author, but they are both adults. The mom is divorced and the author says she initiated the flirting. The author tried to be honest with the friend, but the friend is still angry and trying to get others to turn against the author.\n\nNow, I need to think about social norms and potential wrongdoings here. The age difference between the author and the friend's mom is significant, but both are adults. However, the friend is 20, which is still an adult, but there's a close friendship between the author and the friend. The author might have a duty to the friend not to engage in a relationship with their mother, even if the mother initiated it. \n\nAlso, the aspect of consent and honesty. The author was upfront with the friend, which is good. But the friend is clearly hurt, and the author's actions might have breached trust. Even though the author thinks adults can make their own choices, the situation involves the friend's family, which complicates things.\n\nAnother angle: the friend is still living with his mom, so the author's relationship with her might affect the friend's living situation and emotional well-being. The author's decision to continue the relationship despite the friend's objection could be seen as disregarding the friend's feelings, even if the author believes in personal freedom. \n\nBut then again, the author isn't in a position of authority over the mother or the friend. The mother is an adult, so her choice to engage in a relationship isn't against the law. However, the social implications and the impact on the friend's life are important. The author might be seen as taking advantage of a vulnerable situation, especially if the friend's mom is using the relationship to cope with her divorce.\n\nAlso, the fact that the author is close to the friend and then enters a relationship with the friend's parent could be considered a breach of trust. Even if it's consensual, it's a sensitive situation where the author's actions affect another person's relationships. The smear campaign by the friend is a consequence, but the author's choice to pursue the relationship might still be the root issue.\n\nIn terms of right or wrong, it's a bit tricky. Legally, it's between two adults, but socially and morally, it's questionable. The author might be in the wrong because they went behind the friend's back, even though they told him. The friend's mom initiating doesn't absolve the author of responsibility if the friend is deeply affected. The author's decision to continue the relationship despite the friend's anger could be seen as selfish or thoughtless, even if they believe in personal choice.\n\nSo, considering all these points, I think the answer would be that the author is in the wrong (A). The relationships here are complex, and while the actions might not be illegal, they're ethically problematic because they cause significant harm to the friend and disrupt social circles. The author's choice to not stop the relationship despite the friend's objections might be seen as prioritizing their own desires over the friend's well-being, which is a moral issue.\n"
