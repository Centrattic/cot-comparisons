My friend is 20 and lives with his single, divorced mom (41). She divorced his dad two years ago for being an alcoholic. Shes extremely hot in a more mature kind of way.\n\nWhenever i would hang out at his house his mom would openly flirt with me but i initially just chalked that up to her being playful and flirty. Except she kept up the flirting when we were alone, and everyime i stepped it up she would step it up herself.\n\nI asked her out, and weve had a casual sexual relationship for almost a month and a half. I was very open with my friend, his mom insisted on it and i dont want to hurt him.\n\nHe is completely put off by it, which i can understand, but at the same time everyone is an adult and can make their own choices. He orders me to stop seeing her and i refuse. He is now actively trying to get all of our friends to hate me and its been semi successful.\n\nEven if i stopped seeing his mom i dont believe he will let up with the smear campaign. Oddly enough this has actually driven me closer to his mom since im running out of friends.\n\nAITA in this situation even if i was upfront and honest with him?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA question is in the wrong. The situation is about a 23-year-old having a casual sexual relationship with his friend's mom, who's 41. The friend is 20, and the mom is divorced from his dad two years ago.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical aspects. The key points here are the relationships involved and the potential impact on others. The author is in a relationship with an adult, so legally it's allowed. But socially and ethically, there's more to unpack. The friend is only 20, so maybe he's still in a vulnerable position, especially since his parents just divorced. The mom might still be emotionally tied to her son, even though she's divorced.\n\nThe author says they were upfront with the friend. That's important because honesty is a factor in these situations. However, even if they were honest, the friend is upset and feels betrayed. The author's argument is that everyone is an adult, but the friend's reaction is significant. The mother's actions could be seen as taking advantage of the friend's relationship with the author. \n\nAlso, the author mentions that the friend is actively trying to get others to hate them, which could indicate that the friend is in emotional distress. The author might be contributing to a toxic environment, even if they were honest. The closeness to the mom due to losing friends is a consequence, but that doesn't necessarily justify the actions.\n\nPower dynamics could be an issue here. If the mom is the parent of the author's friend, there might be an imbalance, especially if the author is still considered part of the friend group. The mom's persistent flirting and the author's response to it might have crossed a social boundary. Even though both are adults, relationships between a parent and someone close to their child can be complicated and sensitive.\n\nSo, while it's not illegal, the social implications are heavy. The author is in a position where their actions affect a close friend, leading to a breakdown in the friend's trust and the social circle. The friend's age (20) is close to the author's (23), so the author might have been advised by the friend's mom. That could be a red flag. The author might be in the wrong because they participated in a relationship that caused significant harm to their friend, despite being honest. The key is whether the author should have known the potential consequences and avoided it to prevent harm.\n"
