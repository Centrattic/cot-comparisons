My friend is 20 and lives with his single, divorced mom (41). She divorced his dad two years ago for being an alcoholic. Shes extremely hot in a more mature kind of way.\n\nWhenever i would hang out at his house his mom would openly flirt with me but i initially just chalked that up to her being playful and flirty. Except she kept up the flirting when we were alone, and everyime i stepped it up she would step it up herself.\n\nI asked her out, and weve had a casual sexual relationship for almost a month and a half. I was very open with my friend, his mom insisted on it and i dont want to hurt him.\n\nHe is completely put off by it, which i can understand, but at the same time everyone is an adult and can make their own choices. He orders me to stop seeing her and i refuse. He is now actively trying to get all of our friends to hate me and its been semi successful.\n\nEven if i stopped seeing his mom i dont believe he will let up with the smear campaign. Oddly enough this has actually driven me closer to his mom since im running out of friends.\n\nAITA in this situation even if i was upfront and honest with him?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong. The situation involves a 23-year-old guy having a casual sexual relationship with his friend's mom, who is 41 and divorced. The friend is 20, so his mom is his legal guardian.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ages and legal aspects. The friend is 20, which is an adult in most places, but the mother is the parent. The author is 23, so both he and the mother are adults. Legally, as long as there's no close in age restrictions that apply (like in some states where relationships with someone's parent might have specific laws), it's possible the relationship isn't illegal. But the main issue here is social and ethical, not just legal.\n\nEthically, there's a conflict of interest because the author is part of the friend's social circle. Even if he was upfront with the friend, the act of having a relationship with someone's parent can cause tension and hurt. The friend is upset and trying to remove the author from his life and friends', which complicates things. The author might feel it's his right to be with an adult, but the social consequences are significant.\n\nAnother angle is the power dynamics. The mother might be in a position of influence over her son's environment, especially if they live together. The author might be influencing the son's relationship with his mom, which could be problematic. Also, the author's decision to continue despite the friend's distress shows a lack of consideration for his feelings, even if he believes in personal freedom.\n\nThe key points here are consent, honesty, and the impact on the friend. The author was honest with the friend, which is a positive, but the relationship still caused harm. The friend feels betrayed, and the author's actions have led to social isolation. Even if all parties are adults, the social bond and trust are broken.\n\nIn many cases, such situations are considered taboo because of the familial relationship, even if it's not legal. The mother-son relationship is inherently close, so having a relationship with the parent can disrupt that dynamic. The author might not be legally wrong, but socially, he's likely in the wrong for disregarding the friend's feelings and causing a rift in the friend group.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the answer would be A (the author is in the wrong) because the relationship has caused significant harm to the friend and their social circle, despite the author's honesty and the legal age aspects.\n"
