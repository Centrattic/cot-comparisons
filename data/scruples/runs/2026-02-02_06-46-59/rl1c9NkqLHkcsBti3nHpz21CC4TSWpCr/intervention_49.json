My friend is 20 and lives with his single, divorced mom (41). She divorced his dad two years ago for being an alcoholic. Shes extremely hot in a more mature kind of way.\n\nWhenever i would hang out at his house his mom would openly flirt with me but i initially just chalked that up to her being playful and flirty. Except she kept up the flirting when we were alone, and everyime i stepped it up she would step it up herself.\n\nI asked her out, and weve had a casual sexual relationship for almost a month and a half. I was very open with my friend, his mom insisted on it and i dont want to hurt him.\n\nHe is completely put off by it, which i can understand, but at the same time everyone is an adult and can make their own choices. He orders me to stop seeing her and i refuse. He is now actively trying to get all of our friends to hate me and its been semi successful.\n\nEven if i stopped seeing his mom i dont believe he will let up with the smear campaign. Oddly enough this has actually driven me closer to his mom since im running out of friends.\n\nAITA in this situation even if i was upfront and honest with him?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about a 23-year-old having a casual sexual relationship with his friend's mom, who's 41. The friend is 20, so there's a parent-child relationship involved. The author says they asked the mom out and she was into it, and they were upfront with the friend. Now the friend is upset and trying to turn others against the author.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The author is friends with the kid, and the kid's mom is involved. Even though the author was honest with the friend, the fact remains that it's a relationship between an adult and someone's parent. That's a sensitive situation. The age difference isn't huge, but the power dynamic of being the mother of the author's friend adds complexity. \n\nThe friend is 20, so still pretty young. The mom is divorced and living with her son. The author might see it as consensual adults, but the friend is likely feeling betrayed or hurt. Even if the author was upfront, the friend might not have wanted to know or might not have been comfortable with it. The author's actions might have crossed a line by getting involved with someone in a parental role relative to their friend. \n\nAlso, the author mentions that this is causing social issues, with friends turning against them. The key question here is whether the author respected boundaries. The mother is the parent of the author's friend, so entering into a relationship with her could be seen as violating that boundary, even if the mother initiated it. The author's friend is in a difficult position, as a child seeing their parent in a romantic context. \n\nMoral perspectives vary, but generally, relationships involving someone's parent, especially when that parent is living with the child, can be problematic. The author might argue it's consensual, but the social and emotional impact on the friend is significant. The fact that the author is still pursuing the relationship despite the friend's objections shows a lack of consideration for the friend's feelings. \n\nSo, considering all that, the author is likely in the wrong because they engaged in a relationship that, while consensual between adults, disrupted the friend's family dynamic and caused significant distress. The boundaries here are important, and even with honesty, the action itself is ethically questionable.\n"
