My friend is 20 and lives with his single, divorced mom (41). She divorced his dad two years ago for being an alcoholic. Shes extremely hot in a more mature kind of way.\n\nWhenever i would hang out at his house his mom would openly flirt with me but i initially just chalked that up to her being playful and flirty. Except she kept up the flirting when we were alone, and everyime i stepped it up she would step it up herself.\n\nI asked her out, and weve had a casual sexual relationship for almost a month and a half. I was very open with my friend, his mom insisted on it and i dont want to hurt him.\n\nHe is completely put off by it, which i can understand, but at the same time everyone is an adult and can make their own choices. He orders me to stop seeing her and i refuse. He is now actively trying to get all of our friends to hate me and its been semi successful.\n\nEven if i stopped seeing his mom i dont believe he will let up with the smear campaign. Oddly enough this has actually driven me closer to his mom since im running out of friends.\n\nAITA in this situation even if i was upfront and honest with him?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is about having a casual sexual relationship with a friend's mom.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The friend is 20, living with his mom who's 41. The author is 23. The mom was flirting, and the author started a relationship. They were upfront with the friend, but the friend is upset and spreading a smear campaign. The author is now closer to the mom because friends are turning against him.\n\nThe question is whether the author is wrong. Legally, all adults involved, so maybe not illegal. But socially and ethically? There's a power dynamic here. The mom is the parent of the friend, so even if the friend is an adult, there's a family connection. The author might be seen as taking advantage of the mom's loneliness or the situation. Also, the friend's feelings are hurt, and the author's actions are causing social strife. Even if they were honest, it's still causing harm. The author's defense is that adults can make their own choices, but maybe there's an ethical concern in pursuing a relationship with someone's parent when it affects their child so directly. The answer might be A (wrong) because of the family dynamics and the harm caused to the friend.\n"
