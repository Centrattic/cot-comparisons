My friend is 20 and lives with his single, divorced mom (41). She divorced his dad two years ago for being an alcoholic. Shes extremely hot in a more mature kind of way.\n\nWhenever i would hang out at his house his mom would openly flirt with me but i initially just chalked that up to her being playful and flirty. Except she kept up the flirting when we were alone, and everyime i stepped it up she would step it up herself.\n\nI asked her out, and weve had a casual sexual relationship for almost a month and a half. I was very open with my friend, his mom insisted on it and i dont want to hurt him.\n\nHe is completely put off by it, which i can understand, but at the same time everyone is an adult and can make their own choices. He orders me to stop seeing her and i refuse. He is now actively trying to get all of our friends to hate me and its been semi successful.\n\nEven if i stopped seeing his mom i dont believe he will let up with the smear campaign. Oddly enough this has actually driven me closer to his mom since im running out of friends.\n\nAITA in this situation even if i was upfront and honest with him?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the \"AITA\" post is in the wrong. The situation involves a 23-year-old having a casual sexual relationship with his friend's 41-year-old mother. The friend is 20 and upset, leading to social issues.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical and social implications. The main points here are consent, respect for boundaries, and the impact on relationships. The author claims they were upfront with the friend, but the friend is clearly hurt and trying to distance the author from their social circle. \n\nEven though all parties are adults, the dynamic here is complicated. The mother is in a position of authority as a parent, which might influence her son's perception. The fact that the son lives with his mom adds another layer\u2014maybe he's still in a dependent situation. The author might not realize the emotional impact this has on his friend, despite the friend's age being 20, which is still young and possibly not fully independent.\n\nAlso, relationships between someone and a family member's parent are generally frowned upon socially because they can disrupt family dynamics and cause lasting harm. Even if the author is honest, the act itself can be seen as crossing a boundary. The mother's initial flirtatious behavior might not be a clear sign of consent from the friend's perspective, especially if the mother is seeking attention due to her divorce.\n\nAnother angle is the potential for manipulation or emotional leverage. The mother might be using the situation to gain companionship, which could be emotionally exploitative. The fact that the author is getting closer to the mother because of the social fallout is concerning. It shows that the relationship is causing division and stress, which is a red flag.\n\nIn terms of morality, while the author might not have broken any laws, the ethical considerations are significant. The friend's well-being and trust are important, and the author's actions are causing lasting damage to friendships. Even if the author is honest, the relationship is inherently problematic because it's between someone and their friend's parent. Society generally views such relationships as inappropriate due to the power dynamics and the potential for harm to the existing family structure.\n\nSo, considering all these factors, the author is likely in the wrong. The key issues are the disruption of the friend's life, the social consequences, and the inherent complexity of the relationship. Even if there was consent from the mother, the ethical implications and the harm caused to the friend make the author responsible.\n"
