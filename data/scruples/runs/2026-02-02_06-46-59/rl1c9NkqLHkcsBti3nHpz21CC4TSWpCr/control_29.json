My friend is 20 and lives with his single, divorced mom (41). She divorced his dad two years ago for being an alcoholic. Shes extremely hot in a more mature kind of way.\n\nWhenever i would hang out at his house his mom would openly flirt with me but i initially just chalked that up to her being playful and flirty. Except she kept up the flirting when we were alone, and everyime i stepped it up she would step it up herself.\n\nI asked her out, and weve had a casual sexual relationship for almost a month and a half. I was very open with my friend, his mom insisted on it and i dont want to hurt him.\n\nHe is completely put off by it, which i can understand, but at the same time everyone is an adult and can make their own choices. He orders me to stop seeing her and i refuse. He is now actively trying to get all of our friends to hate me and its been semi successful.\n\nEven if i stopped seeing his mom i dont believe he will let up with the smear campaign. Oddly enough this has actually driven me closer to his mom since im running out of friends.\n\nAITA in this situation even if i was upfront and honest with him?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who started a casual relationship with their friend's mom is in the wrong. Let's look at the key points here.\n\nFirst, the situation involves a 23-year-old author and their 20-year-old friend. The friend's mom is 41, divorced, and they've been having a casual sexual relationship for about a month and a half. The author claims they were upfront with the friend about it, as the mom insisted on it. The friend is upset, trying to get their mutual friends to turn against the author, and the author feels the friend's campaign is ongoing even if they stopped seeing his mom.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. Let's consider ethical and social norms. Generally, relationships between someone and a parent of their friend are considered taboo and can cause significant social issues. The fact that the friend is still 20 and living with his mom might complicate things further, even though the mom is a legal adult. \n\nThe author says they were honest with the friend, which is a positive point. However, the action itself\u2014engaging in a relationship with a friend's parent\u2014can be seen as crossing a social boundary regardless of consent from the parent. The friend's reaction is understandable; it's a betrayal of trust and could damage their friendship. The author's refusal to stop despite the friend's objections might be viewed as dismissive of the friend's feelings.\n\nFrom a legal standpoint, if all parties are adults, there's no illegal activity. But socially and ethically, it's a gray area. The author's justification that everyone is an adult and can make their own choices is valid in terms of autonomy, but relationships with parents of friends often come with unspoken boundaries and expectations of loyalty.\n\nThe fact that the author is now isolated and the friend is spreading a smear campaign raises questions about the consequences and the author's responsibility. Even if the author was honest, the act itself might still be seen as wrong due to the social implications and the impact on the friend's trust and well-being.\n\nSo, considering all these factors, the answer would likely be that the author is in the wrong (A), even if they were upfront. The relationship breaches social norms and causes significant harm to the friendship, which is more important than the consent of the other party.\n"
