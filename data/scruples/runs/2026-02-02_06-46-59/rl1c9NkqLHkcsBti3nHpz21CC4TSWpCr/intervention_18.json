My friend is 20 and lives with his single, divorced mom (41). She divorced his dad two years ago for being an alcoholic. Shes extremely hot in a more mature kind of way.\n\nWhenever i would hang out at his house his mom would openly flirt with me but i initially just chalked that up to her being playful and flirty. Except she kept up the flirting when we were alone, and everyime i stepped it up she would step it up herself.\n\nI asked her out, and weve had a casual sexual relationship for almost a month and a half. I was very open with my friend, his mom insisted on it and i dont want to hurt him.\n\nHe is completely put off by it, which i can understand, but at the same time everyone is an adult and can make their own choices. He orders me to stop seeing her and i refuse. He is now actively trying to get all of our friends to hate me and its been semi successful.\n\nEven if i stopped seeing his mom i dont believe he will let up with the smear campaign. Oddly enough this has actually driven me closer to his mom since im running out of friends.\n\nAITA in this situation even if i was upfront and honest with him?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. So, the user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole?) post is in the wrong. Let me start by reading the situation carefully.\n\nThe author is 23, their friend is 20, and the friend's mom is 41. The mom is divorced, and the author started a casual sexual relationship with her after she was flirting with him. The author says he was upfront with the friend, but the friend is really upset and is trying to get their friends to turn against the author. The author is now closer to the friend's mom because he's losing friends.\n\nThe user thinks the author is in the wrong. The question is whether the author is in the wrong (A) or not (B).\n\nFirst, let's consider the dynamics here. The key points are the age difference, the relationship with the friend's parent, and the impact on the friend. The friend is 20, so the author is only three years older. The mom is 41, so there's a 12-year gap there. The author was aware that the friend might be upset and tried to be honest, but the situation has caused a rift in their social circle.\n\nLegally, as long as all parties are adults and there's no legal age of consent issue (which in many places, 18 is the age, so 23 and 41 is fine), it's consensual. But socially, there's a lot to unpack. The friend is the mom's child, so the author is engaging in a relationship with someone who is the parent of a close friend. Even if the friend is an adult, the emotional and social implications are significant.\n\nThe author mentions that the friend is upset and spreading a smear campaign. The author is now distancing from the friend's social group. The question is whether the author is at fault here. \n\nFrom a moral standpoint, relationships with someone's parent can be problematic, especially if it affects the existing relationship with the child. Even if the author was honest, the friend's hurt is valid. The author might not be legally wrong, but socially and ethically, they could be seen as the asshole because they've caused a rift in the friend's social life and are now closer to the parent. \n\nThe author's justification is that adults can make their own choices, but the friend is still part of the equation. The mother's role as a parent adds a layer of complexity. Even if the mother initiated the flirting, the author's decision to pursue a relationship with her could be seen as crossing a line, especially given the existing friendship with her child.\n\nSo, considering all these factors, the author is likely in the wrong (A) because they've disrupted the friend's life and social circle, even if they were honest. The key here is the impact on the friend and the dynamics of the relationships involved.\n"
