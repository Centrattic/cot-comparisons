My friend is 20 and lives with his single, divorced mom (41). She divorced his dad two years ago for being an alcoholic. Shes extremely hot in a more mature kind of way.\n\nWhenever i would hang out at his house his mom would openly flirt with me but i initially just chalked that up to her being playful and flirty. Except she kept up the flirting when we were alone, and everyime i stepped it up she would step it up herself.\n\nI asked her out, and weve had a casual sexual relationship for almost a month and a half. I was very open with my friend, his mom insisted on it and i dont want to hurt him.\n\nHe is completely put off by it, which i can understand, but at the same time everyone is an adult and can make their own choices. He orders me to stop seeing her and i refuse. He is now actively trying to get all of our friends to hate me and its been semi successful.\n\nEven if i stopped seeing his mom i dont believe he will let up with the smear campaign. Oddly enough this has actually driven me closer to his mom since im running out of friends.\n\nAITA in this situation even if i was upfront and honest with him?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the person in the scenario is in the wrong. The situation involves a 23-year-old having a casual sexual relationship with his friend's mom, who's 41 and divorced. The friend is 20 and lives with her.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the age aspect. The friend is 20, which in many places is still a young adult, maybe even a minor if the legal age is 18 or 21. But the person is 23, so they're an adult. However, the relationship is with someone who is the parent of a close friend. That could be problematic socially, even if legally they're both adults. \n\nEthically, it's more complicated. Even if they are both adults, the power dynamics might be an issue. The mother is the parent of the person's friend, so there could be a conflict of interest or emotional manipulation involved. The friend is upset and feels betrayed, which is understandable. The fact that the person was upfront about it doesn't necessarily make it right, because the context is a close social circle where the friend is involved. \n\nAlso, the person mentions that the friend is trying to get others to hate them, which might be a reaction to the situation. But does that justify the action? Probably not. The main question is about whether the author is in the wrong. Legally, if the mother is consenting and both are adults, maybe not. But morally and socially, most people would find it inappropriate. \n\nThere's a part where the author says they were open with the friend, but the friend might not have been in a position to give a mature or fair response. The relationship could be seen as taking advantage of a familial connection, even if both parties are technically adults. \n\nSo, putting it all together, the answer might be A (the author is in the wrong) because the relationship is with someone's parent, which can create ethical issues regardless of legality. Even if they were upfront, the social implications and the friend's feelings are significant. The fact that the friend is actively trying to turn others against the author shows the damage done, which is a point against the author.\n"
