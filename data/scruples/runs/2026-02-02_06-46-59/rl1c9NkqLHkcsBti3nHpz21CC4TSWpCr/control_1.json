My friend is 20 and lives with his single, divorced mom (41). She divorced his dad two years ago for being an alcoholic. Shes extremely hot in a more mature kind of way.\n\nWhenever i would hang out at his house his mom would openly flirt with me but i initially just chalked that up to her being playful and flirty. Except she kept up the flirting when we were alone, and everyime i stepped it up she would step it up herself.\n\nI asked her out, and weve had a casual sexual relationship for almost a month and a half. I was very open with my friend, his mom insisted on it and i dont want to hurt him.\n\nHe is completely put off by it, which i can understand, but at the same time everyone is an adult and can make their own choices. He orders me to stop seeing her and i refuse. He is now actively trying to get all of our friends to hate me and its been semi successful.\n\nEven if i stopped seeing his mom i dont believe he will let up with the smear campaign. Oddly enough this has actually driven me closer to his mom since im running out of friends.\n\nAITA in this situation even if i was upfront and honest with him?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation involves a 23-year-old having a casual sexual relationship with his friend's mom, who's 41 and divorced. The friend is 20 and upset about it.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ages and relationships. The author is 23, the friend is 20, so the friend is still quite young. The mom is divorced and the author's age is just three years older than the friend. Even though the mom is an adult, the dynamic here is a bit tricky because the author is close to the friend and their social circle. \n\nThe key points are: the mom was flirting openly, the author asked her out, and they had a casual relationship. The author was upfront with the friend. But the friend is now upset and trying to turn others against the author. The author is wondering if they're in the wrong despite being honest.\n\nFrom a social ethics perspective, the main issue is the relationship between the author and the friend's mom. While both are adults, the author's age is only slightly older than the friend. The friend is still in his early 20s, so their relationship might still be considered part of a family dynamic, even if the mom is divorced. The author's initial dismissal of the flirting as \"playful\" and then escalating might not be justifiable, especially if it's affecting the friend so negatively.\n\nAlso, the fact that the author is now facing a smear campaign suggests that the relationship is causing significant harm to the friend and their social group. Even if the author was honest, the act of engaging in a relationship with someone else's parent can be seen as violating social boundaries and trust. \n\nIn most social contexts, such a relationship is considered taboo, regardless of the adults' consent. The author might not be legally wrong, but socially, they're likely in the wrong. The friend's reaction is understandable, and the author's justification that \"everyone is an adult\" doesn't account for the emotional and social consequences. The answer is probably A, as the author is in the wrong.\n"
