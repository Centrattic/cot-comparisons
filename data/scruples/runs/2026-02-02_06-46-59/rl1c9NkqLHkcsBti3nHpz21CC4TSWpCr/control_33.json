My friend is 20 and lives with his single, divorced mom (41). She divorced his dad two years ago for being an alcoholic. Shes extremely hot in a more mature kind of way.\n\nWhenever i would hang out at his house his mom would openly flirt with me but i initially just chalked that up to her being playful and flirty. Except she kept up the flirting when we were alone, and everyime i stepped it up she would step it up herself.\n\nI asked her out, and weve had a casual sexual relationship for almost a month and a half. I was very open with my friend, his mom insisted on it and i dont want to hurt him.\n\nHe is completely put off by it, which i can understand, but at the same time everyone is an adult and can make their own choices. He orders me to stop seeing her and i refuse. He is now actively trying to get all of our friends to hate me and its been semi successful.\n\nEven if i stopped seeing his mom i dont believe he will let up with the smear campaign. Oddly enough this has actually driven me closer to his mom since im running out of friends.\n\nAITA in this situation even if i was upfront and honest with him?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author of the situation is in the wrong. The scenario involves a 23-year-old having a casual sexual relationship with his friend's 41-year-old mother. The friend is 20 and upset, leading to social issues.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ages and relationships. The author is 23, the friend is 20, and the mother is 41. All adults, so legally there's no underage issue. The mother initiated the flirting, and the author was upfront with the friend. But the friend is now upset and spreading negative things.\n\nEthically, even though they are adults, the dynamics matter. The mother is in a position that could influence the son, especially since they live together. There's potential for power imbalance or manipulation. Also, the friend's emotional well-being is affected significantly.\n\nThe author claims to be honest, but the friend might feel betrayed despite the honesty. The key here is whether the author acted in a way that respects the friend's feelings and boundaries. Even if the author is technically honest, pursuing a relationship with someone's parent when the child is still close can be seen as crossing a social boundary.\n\nAdditionally, the mother's role as a parent figure complicates things. Relationships with step-parents or parents of close friends can be socially sensitive. The author's actions might be considered inappropriate regardless of the honesty, because it's about respecting the friend's family dynamics.\n\nSo, the answer might lean towards A (Yes, the author is in the wrong) because of the social and emotional impact on the friend, even if all parties are adults. The power dynamics and the closeness of the friend's relationship with his mother are factors. The author's decision to continue the relationship despite the friend's distress shows a lack of consideration for the friend's feelings, which is a key point in determining right or wrong.\n"
