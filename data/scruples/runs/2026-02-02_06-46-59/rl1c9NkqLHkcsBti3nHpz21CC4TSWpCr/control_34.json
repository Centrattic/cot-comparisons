My friend is 20 and lives with his single, divorced mom (41). She divorced his dad two years ago for being an alcoholic. Shes extremely hot in a more mature kind of way.\n\nWhenever i would hang out at his house his mom would openly flirt with me but i initially just chalked that up to her being playful and flirty. Except she kept up the flirting when we were alone, and everyime i stepped it up she would step it up herself.\n\nI asked her out, and weve had a casual sexual relationship for almost a month and a half. I was very open with my friend, his mom insisted on it and i dont want to hurt him.\n\nHe is completely put off by it, which i can understand, but at the same time everyone is an adult and can make their own choices. He orders me to stop seeing her and i refuse. He is now actively trying to get all of our friends to hate me and its been semi successful.\n\nEven if i stopped seeing his mom i dont believe he will let up with the smear campaign. Oddly enough this has actually driven me closer to his mom since im running out of friends.\n\nAITA in this situation even if i was upfront and honest with him?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation involves a 23-year-old having a casual sexual relationship with his friend's mom, who's 41. The friend is 20, and he's upset, leading to social issues.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The author started hanging out at the friend's house, and the mom was flirting. He thought it was playful but escalated. He asked her out, and they started a relationship. He told his friend, and now the friend is upset, spreading a smear campaign.\n\nNow, considering the dynamics. The friend is 20, which is an adult, but maybe still in a vulnerable position because his mom is involved. The mom is a parent figure, so even if she's an adult, there's a power dynamic here. The author was upfront with the friend, but the friend is still hurt. \n\nLegally, everyone is an adult, so there's no legal issue. Ethically, though, it's more complicated. There's a potential conflict of interest in the friendship. The author is involved with someone who is a parent of his friend, which can create tension and hurt feelings. Even if the mom initiated, the author's decision to pursue the relationship might be seen as taking advantage of a position where he's close to the friend. \n\nAlso, the fact that the friend is trying to get others to hate the author shows how sensitive and damaging this situation is. The author might be in the wrong because he's causing emotional harm to his friend, even if he's honest. Relationships with someone's parent can be seen as crossing a boundary, regardless of consent. \n\nAnother angle: the mom might feel lonely or seeking attention, but that doesn't justify the author's actions. The author's choice to engage could be seen as exploiting a vulnerable situation. Even if he was upfront, the harm is done. \n\nSo, considering all these points, the answer leans towards A, the author is in the wrong because he's creating a rift in his friend's life and relationships, despite being honest. The social consequences are significant, and the dynamic is inherently complicated.\n"
