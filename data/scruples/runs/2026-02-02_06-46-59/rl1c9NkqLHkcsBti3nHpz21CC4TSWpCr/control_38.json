My friend is 20 and lives with his single, divorced mom (41). She divorced his dad two years ago for being an alcoholic. Shes extremely hot in a more mature kind of way.\n\nWhenever i would hang out at his house his mom would openly flirt with me but i initially just chalked that up to her being playful and flirty. Except she kept up the flirting when we were alone, and everyime i stepped it up she would step it up herself.\n\nI asked her out, and weve had a casual sexual relationship for almost a month and a half. I was very open with my friend, his mom insisted on it and i dont want to hurt him.\n\nHe is completely put off by it, which i can understand, but at the same time everyone is an adult and can make their own choices. He orders me to stop seeing her and i refuse. He is now actively trying to get all of our friends to hate me and its been semi successful.\n\nEven if i stopped seeing his mom i dont believe he will let up with the smear campaign. Oddly enough this has actually driven me closer to his mom since im running out of friends.\n\nAITA in this situation even if i was upfront and honest with him?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who started a casual sexual relationship with their friend's mom is in the wrong.\n\nFirst, the scenario: The user is 23, their friend is 20, and the friend's mom is 41. The mom initiated flirting, and the user became involved. They told the friend, but the friend is upset and spreading negative things about the user. The user feels the friend's actions are unfair since everyone is an adult.\n\nNow, considering ethics and social norms. Typically, relationships between someone and their friend's parent can be seen as crossing a social boundary. Even if the mom initiated it, the user's friend is close to them, so this could be considered a betrayal of trust. The user did tell the friend, but the act itself\u2014engaging with a parent figure of a close friend\u2014might be seen as inappropriate regardless of consent. \n\nThe user argues that adults can make their own choices. However, the core issue is the impact on the friend and the social circle. Even if the relationship is consensual, it's causing significant harm to the friend's trust and social standing among mutual friends. The fact that the friend is trying to turn others against the user shows the severity of the breach. \n\nAlso, the user's justification that they were honest with the friend doesn't negate the potential harm caused. Honesty is important, but the act itself may still be morally questionable due to the existing relationship dynamics. The user's actions have disrupted their friend's family and social group, which could be seen as wrong regardless of consent.\n\nSo, considering all these factors, the answer would likely be that the author is in the wrong.\n"
