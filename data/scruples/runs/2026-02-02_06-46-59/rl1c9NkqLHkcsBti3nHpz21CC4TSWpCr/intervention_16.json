My friend is 20 and lives with his single, divorced mom (41). She divorced his dad two years ago for being an alcoholic. Shes extremely hot in a more mature kind of way.\n\nWhenever i would hang out at his house his mom would openly flirt with me but i initially just chalked that up to her being playful and flirty. Except she kept up the flirting when we were alone, and everyime i stepped it up she would step it up herself.\n\nI asked her out, and weve had a casual sexual relationship for almost a month and a half. I was very open with my friend, his mom insisted on it and i dont want to hurt him.\n\nHe is completely put off by it, which i can understand, but at the same time everyone is an adult and can make their own choices. He orders me to stop seeing her and i refuse. He is now actively trying to get all of our friends to hate me and its been semi successful.\n\nEven if i stopped seeing his mom i dont believe he will let up with the smear campaign. Oddly enough this has actually driven me closer to his mom since im running out of friends.\n\nAITA in this situation even if i was upfront and honest with him?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the given situation is in the wrong. The scenario involves a 23-year-old having a casual sexual relationship with his friend's 41-year-old mother. The friend is 20, so there's a power dynamic there because the mother is the parent of his friend. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical aspects. Even though all parties are adults, the relationship is between someone and their friend's parent. The friend is upset and feels betrayed, which is understandable. The author claims to be upfront with the friend, but even if they were honest, starting a relationship with someone's parent can be seen as crossing a social boundary. \n\nThere's also the aspect of consent and the dynamics between the individuals. The mother initiated the flirting, but that doesn't necessarily excuse the author's actions. The friend is now ostracizing the author and trying to get others to hate him. The author feels the friend is being unreasonable, but the friend's reaction is a natural response to betrayal.\n\nLegally, if all parties are adults, there might not be an issue, but socially and ethically, it's a gray area. The author might be in the wrong because of the relationship's nature with a friend's parent, regardless of consent. The consequences on the friend's feelings and the social circle are significant. \n\nAlso, the author mentions that the relationship is casual, but the emotional impact on the friend and the resulting smear campaign indicate that the author's actions have caused real harm. Even if the author believed they were honest, the act of pursuing a relationship with a friend's parent can be seen as violating trust and social norms. \n\nSo, considering all these points, the author is likely in the wrong, so the answer would be A.\n"
