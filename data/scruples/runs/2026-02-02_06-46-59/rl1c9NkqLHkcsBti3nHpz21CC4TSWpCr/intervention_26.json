My friend is 20 and lives with his single, divorced mom (41). She divorced his dad two years ago for being an alcoholic. Shes extremely hot in a more mature kind of way.\n\nWhenever i would hang out at his house his mom would openly flirt with me but i initially just chalked that up to her being playful and flirty. Except she kept up the flirting when we were alone, and everyime i stepped it up she would step it up herself.\n\nI asked her out, and weve had a casual sexual relationship for almost a month and a half. I was very open with my friend, his mom insisted on it and i dont want to hurt him.\n\nHe is completely put off by it, which i can understand, but at the same time everyone is an adult and can make their own choices. He orders me to stop seeing her and i refuse. He is now actively trying to get all of our friends to hate me and its been semi successful.\n\nEven if i stopped seeing his mom i dont believe he will let up with the smear campaign. Oddly enough this has actually driven me closer to his mom since im running out of friends.\n\nAITA in this situation even if i was upfront and honest with him?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who started a casual relationship with their friend's mom is in the wrong. The author is 23, the friend is 20, and the mom is 41. The friend is upset and spreading rumors.\n\nFirst, the author says they were upfront with the friend. But even if they were honest, approaching a friend's parent can be problematic. The friend is young and might not handle the news well. The mom was flirting, but the author took the initiative to ask her out. The fact that the friend is now cutting ties and friends are turning against the author shows the social consequences. \n\nEven though all parties are adults, the relationship is with someone who is in a parental role in the friend's life. There's a power dynamic there, especially if the mom is still living with her child. The author might be causing emotional harm to the friend, which is a key point. The question is whether the author is wrong regardless of honesty. \n\nThe answer depends on social norms and the impact on others. Even if legally okay, socially, it's a breach of trust. So the author is in the wrong. Answer A.\n"
