My friend is 20 and lives with his single, divorced mom (41). She divorced his dad two years ago for being an alcoholic. Shes extremely hot in a more mature kind of way.\n\nWhenever i would hang out at his house his mom would openly flirt with me but i initially just chalked that up to her being playful and flirty. Except she kept up the flirting when we were alone, and everyime i stepped it up she would step it up herself.\n\nI asked her out, and weve had a casual sexual relationship for almost a month and a half. I was very open with my friend, his mom insisted on it and i dont want to hurt him.\n\nHe is completely put off by it, which i can understand, but at the same time everyone is an adult and can make their own choices. He orders me to stop seeing her and i refuse. He is now actively trying to get all of our friends to hate me and its been semi successful.\n\nEven if i stopped seeing his mom i dont believe he will let up with the smear campaign. Oddly enough this has actually driven me closer to his mom since im running out of friends.\n\nAITA in this situation even if i was upfront and honest with him?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user wants to know if the author is in the wrong for having a casual sexual relationship with his friend's mom. Let me break down the situation.\n\nFirst, the author is 23, the friend is 20, and the mom is 41. The mom is divorced and lives with her son. She's been flirting with the author, and they started a relationship. The author was upfront with the friend, but the friend is upset and trying to get others to dislike the author.\n\nHmm, so the main issue here is the relationship between the author and the friend's mom. The author claims he was honest with the friend. But even if he was honest, is it still wrong? Let me think about the dynamics here.\n\nThe friend is only 20, and his mom is his legal guardian, right? So there's a power dynamic there. Even though the mom is an adult, the fact that she's in a position of authority over her son could complicate things. Also, the author is close friends with the son, so there's a betrayal aspect here. The son is now trying to get others to hate the author, which is a big deal.\n\nBut the author argues that everyone is an adult and can make their own choices. However, relationships involving a parent and a friend of the child can be problematic. The mom might be an adult, but the son is still dependent on her since they live together. The author might be taking advantage of a vulnerable situation. Also, the son is upset and feeling betrayed, which is understandable.\n\nThe author was upfront, but that doesn't necessarily make it right. The key points here are consent from all parties, but the son is directly affected. Even if the mom is okay with it, the son's emotional well-being is a factor. The author's actions have caused a rift in the social circle, which is a consequence he's facing.\n\nSo, considering all these factors, the author is likely in the wrong. The relationship is crossing a boundary that affects the friend negatively. Even if the adults are involved, the friend's distress and the social fallout suggest that the author's actions were inappropriate. The answer is A.\n"
