My friend is 20 and lives with his single, divorced mom (41). She divorced his dad two years ago for being an alcoholic. Shes extremely hot in a more mature kind of way.\n\nWhenever i would hang out at his house his mom would openly flirt with me but i initially just chalked that up to her being playful and flirty. Except she kept up the flirting when we were alone, and everyime i stepped it up she would step it up herself.\n\nI asked her out, and weve had a casual sexual relationship for almost a month and a half. I was very open with my friend, his mom insisted on it and i dont want to hurt him.\n\nHe is completely put off by it, which i can understand, but at the same time everyone is an adult and can make their own choices. He orders me to stop seeing her and i refuse. He is now actively trying to get all of our friends to hate me and its been semi successful.\n\nEven if i stopped seeing his mom i dont believe he will let up with the smear campaign. Oddly enough this has actually driven me closer to his mom since im running out of friends.\n\nAITA in this situation even if i was upfront and honest with him?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that the author, who's 23, is in a casual sexual relationship with his friend's mom. The friend is 20, and his mom is 41. The mom started flirting with the author when they were hanging out at the friend's house. The author initially thought it was just playful, but the flirting continued when they were alone. Then the author asked her out, and they started this relationship. The friend found out and is upset, telling the author to stop. The author is now facing a smear campaign from the friend, and he's wondering if he's the asshole here.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The author is technically an adult, as is the mom. The friend is 20, which is just under the age of 21 in many places, but that's not directly relevant here. The main issue is the relationship between the author and the friend's mom. The author claims he was upfront with the friend, which might mitigate some guilt, but maybe not entirely. \n\nFrom a social and ethical standpoint, relationships with someone's parent can be really complicated. Even if everyone is an adult, there's a potential for power imbalances or emotional complications. The mom was the one who initiated the flirting, so the author might argue that he didn't start it. But the fact remains that he engaged in a sexual relationship with someone his friend considers a parent figure. \n\nAnother angle is consent. The author says the mom \"stepped it up\" when he did, implying mutual interest. But the friend feels betrayed, and the author's actions have caused significant social issues. Even if the author was honest with the friend, the friend's emotional response is valid. The author's decision to continue the relationship despite the friend's objections might be seen as disregarding the friend's feelings, which is a key part of any relationship.\n\nAlso, the fact that the friend is trying to get others to hate the author complicates things. The author might feel wronged, but his actions have led to this fallout. From an ethical perspective, even if adults can make their own choices, the impact on the friend is significant. The author's argument that \"everyone is an adult\" doesn't negate the personal and emotional harm caused to the friend.\n\nIn many communities and social circles, relationships with someone's parent are taboo, even if legally permissible. The author's actions could be seen as crossing a social boundary, regardless of consent. The fact that the author is now closer to the mom because of the fallout might be seen as exacerbating the situation by prioritizing the new relationship over the friendship.\n\nSo, weighing all these factors: the author was involved in a relationship with someone his friend sees as a parent, which is a sensitive situation. Even if the mom initiated and the author was upfront, the resulting harm to the friend is significant. The author's refusal to stop despite the friend's plea could be seen as inconsiderate. Therefore, the author might be in the wrong because he's contributing to the friend's distress and social isolation, even if the relationship itself is consensual.\n"
