My friend is 20 and lives with his single, divorced mom (41). She divorced his dad two years ago for being an alcoholic. Shes extremely hot in a more mature kind of way.\n\nWhenever i would hang out at his house his mom would openly flirt with me but i initially just chalked that up to her being playful and flirty. Except she kept up the flirting when we were alone, and everyime i stepped it up she would step it up herself.\n\nI asked her out, and weve had a casual sexual relationship for almost a month and a half. I was very open with my friend, his mom insisted on it and i dont want to hurt him.\n\nHe is completely put off by it, which i can understand, but at the same time everyone is an adult and can make their own choices. He orders me to stop seeing her and i refuse. He is now actively trying to get all of our friends to hate me and its been semi successful.\n\nEven if i stopped seeing his mom i dont believe he will let up with the smear campaign. Oddly enough this has actually driven me closer to his mom since im running out of friends.\n\nAITA in this situation even if i was upfront and honest with him?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person in the AITA scenario is in the wrong. The situation involves a 23-year-old having a casual sexual relationship with his friend's mom. The friend is 20, and his mom is 41. The author says he was upfront with his friend. Now the friend is upset and spreading a smear campaign against him.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical aspects here. The author is in a relationship with someone's parent, which can be a sensitive topic. Even though they are adults, the friend is still involved because the mom lives with him. The author claims he was honest about it, but the friend is hurt and angry. The key points here are consent, honesty, and the impact on the friend.\n\nThe author says he was open with his friend, but maybe that was not enough. Sometimes being upfront isn't the same as being considerate of the other person's feelings. The friend is clearly upset, and the author is continuing despite the friend's objections. That could be seen as dismissive of his friend's emotional state.\n\nAlso, the fact that the author is getting closer to the mom while distancing from the friend might be another issue. The friend's house is where they all hang out, and the author's actions are disrupting their social circle. Even if the author believes in personal freedom, there's a social contract here that might be breached by involving someone else's family in a romantic/sexual way without considering the consequences on the relationships.\n\nAnother angle is whether the mom is in a position to consent freely. Since she's divorced and a parent, but the author is friends with her son, there could be power dynamics or emotional complexities. However, the question is about the author's wrongness, not the mom's.\n\nThe social repercussions are significant. The author is causing rifts in the friend group, which is a common theme in AITA posts. Even if the actions are consensual, the impact on others is part of the consideration. The author's stance that everyone is an adult and should make their own choices might overlook the specific dynamics of friendship and family.\n\nIn many AITA cases, the key is balancing personal actions with their effects on others. Here, the author's actions are causing harm to a friend and the broader social group. Even if he was honest, continuing the relationship despite the friend's objections and the resulting smear campaign suggests he's prioritizing his desires over maintaining the friendship and social harmony. That usually points towards the person being in the wrong.\n\nSo, considering all these factors, the answer is likely A. The author is in the wrong because he's causing significant harm to his friend and social circle, even if he was upfront about the relationship. The consequences on the friend's emotional well-being and the social group's dynamic outweigh the personal choice aspect here.\n"
