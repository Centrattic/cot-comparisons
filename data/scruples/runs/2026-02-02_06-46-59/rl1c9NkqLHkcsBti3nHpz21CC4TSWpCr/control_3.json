My friend is 20 and lives with his single, divorced mom (41). She divorced his dad two years ago for being an alcoholic. Shes extremely hot in a more mature kind of way.\n\nWhenever i would hang out at his house his mom would openly flirt with me but i initially just chalked that up to her being playful and flirty. Except she kept up the flirting when we were alone, and everyime i stepped it up she would step it up herself.\n\nI asked her out, and weve had a casual sexual relationship for almost a month and a half. I was very open with my friend, his mom insisted on it and i dont want to hurt him.\n\nHe is completely put off by it, which i can understand, but at the same time everyone is an adult and can make their own choices. He orders me to stop seeing her and i refuse. He is now actively trying to get all of our friends to hate me and its been semi successful.\n\nEven if i stopped seeing his mom i dont believe he will let up with the smear campaign. Oddly enough this has actually driven me closer to his mom since im running out of friends.\n\nAITA in this situation even if i was upfront and honest with him?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for having a casual sexual relationship with his friend's mom. Let me break down the situation.\n\nFirst, the author is 23, the friend is 20, and the mom is 41. The mom started flirting with the author when he was hanging out at their house. The author thought it was playful at first but then things escalated. Eventually, they started a casual relationship. The author told the friend, and now the friend is upset, even trying to get others to dislike the author. The author says everyone's an adult and should make their own choices, but the friend is taking it hard.\n\nHmm, so the main points here are about consent, boundaries, and the impact on relationships. The author was upfront with the friend, which is a positive step. But is that enough? The friend might feel betrayed even if the author was honest. The mom is an adult, so the relationship could be consensual between her and the author. However, the dynamic with the friend complicates things. The friend is under 21, so maybe there's an age difference between the author and the friend's mom that's appropriate, but the fact that the friend is still in the picture and affected by this is a key point.\n\nEthically, the question is whether the author overstepped by engaging in a relationship with someone who is a parent of their close friend. Even if all parties are adults, the social and emotional impact on the friend is significant. The friend might feel like he's lost trust in both the author and his mom. The author mentions that the mom insisted on openness, but the friend isn't handling it well.\n\nThere's also the aspect of the friend's mom initiating the flirting. The author didn't push for the relationship; it seems the mom took the lead. However, the author's decision to pursue it despite knowing the friend's feelings could be seen as contributing to the problem. The author might not be in the wrong legally because all parties are adults, but socially and ethically, it's a gray area. The damage to the friend's trust and the resulting social fallout (friends turning against the author) is a consequence of the author's actions.\n\nOn one hand, the author was honest, which is commendable. On the other, the relationship created a rift in the friend group. The friend's reaction is understandable\u2014seeing someone close to you with a parent might feel like a betrayal, even if it's consensual. The author might not be inherently wrong, but their decision to continue despite the friend's objections and the resulting conflict could make them partly responsible for the situation's escalation.\n\nSo, considering all factors, the answer might hinge on societal norms and the specific dynamics of their friendship. The author's actions, while consensual, likely caused harm to the friend's relationships, which is a significant ethical consideration.\n"
