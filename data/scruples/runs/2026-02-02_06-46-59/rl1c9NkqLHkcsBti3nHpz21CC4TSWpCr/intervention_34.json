My friend is 20 and lives with his single, divorced mom (41). She divorced his dad two years ago for being an alcoholic. Shes extremely hot in a more mature kind of way.\n\nWhenever i would hang out at his house his mom would openly flirt with me but i initially just chalked that up to her being playful and flirty. Except she kept up the flirting when we were alone, and everyime i stepped it up she would step it up herself.\n\nI asked her out, and weve had a casual sexual relationship for almost a month and a half. I was very open with my friend, his mom insisted on it and i dont want to hurt him.\n\nHe is completely put off by it, which i can understand, but at the same time everyone is an adult and can make their own choices. He orders me to stop seeing her and i refuse. He is now actively trying to get all of our friends to hate me and its been semi successful.\n\nEven if i stopped seeing his mom i dont believe he will let up with the smear campaign. Oddly enough this has actually driven me closer to his mom since im running out of friends.\n\nAITA in this situation even if i was upfront and honest with him?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who started the relationship is in the wrong. The situation involves a 23-year-old having a casual sexual relationship with his friend's mom, who is 41. The friend is 20, and he's upset about it. The author says they were upfront with the friend, but the friend is still trying to get others to dislike him.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical aspects. Even though all parties are adults, there's a power dynamic here. The friend is living with his mom, so the mother might have a parental role in their social circle. Engaging in a relationship with someone's parent can cause significant social tension, especially if the child is close to the person. The author was honest from the start, but the friend is still hurt and upset. \n\nThe mother's initial behavior\u2014flirting openly with the friend's housemate\u2014might have been inappropriate. The author took the step to ask her out, leading to the relationship. Even if consent was given, the social implications are heavy. The friend's reaction is understandable; it's a violation of the trust inherent in their friendship. The fact that the friend is trying to ostracize the author suggests that the social circle sees this as wrong, which is a cultural norm to consider.\n\nMoral perspectives vary, but many would argue that engaging in a relationship with someone's parent, especially when the child is still close to both parties, is problematic. The author's insistence on continuing the relationship despite the friend's distress shows a lack of consideration for the friend's feelings and the potential long-term damage to social ties. The answer might hinge on the cultural context and personal ethics, but the majority view would likely side with the author being in the wrong. So, the answer is A.\n"
