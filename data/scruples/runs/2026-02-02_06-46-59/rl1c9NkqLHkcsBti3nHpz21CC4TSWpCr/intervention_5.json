My friend is 20 and lives with his single, divorced mom (41). She divorced his dad two years ago for being an alcoholic. Shes extremely hot in a more mature kind of way.\n\nWhenever i would hang out at his house his mom would openly flirt with me but i initially just chalked that up to her being playful and flirty. Except she kept up the flirting when we were alone, and everyime i stepped it up she would step it up herself.\n\nI asked her out, and weve had a casual sexual relationship for almost a month and a half. I was very open with my friend, his mom insisted on it and i dont want to hurt him.\n\nHe is completely put off by it, which i can understand, but at the same time everyone is an adult and can make their own choices. He orders me to stop seeing her and i refuse. He is now actively trying to get all of our friends to hate me and its been semi successful.\n\nEven if i stopped seeing his mom i dont believe he will let up with the smear campaign. Oddly enough this has actually driven me closer to his mom since im running out of friends.\n\nAITA in this situation even if i was upfront and honest with him?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote this is in the wrong. The situation is about a 23-year-old having a casual sexual relationship with his friend's mom, who's 41. The friend is 20 and is upset, leading to social issues.\n\nFirst, I should consider the ages. The author is 23, the friend is 20, and the mother is 41. Legally, in most places, all parties are adults, so there's no legal issue. But socially, it's a different story. The friend is close to the mother, and the author is in a relationship with her. The friend is upset and trying to get others to dislike the author. The author claims they were upfront with the friend, but maybe not in the right way or timing.\n\nEthically, even if everyone is an adult, the dynamics between a friend's parent and the friend themselves can be complicated. The mother might have a conflict of interest if she's the one who encouraged the relationship, but the key here is the impact on the friend. The author is causing emotional distress to their friend, leading to a smear campaign. Even if the author is honest, approaching a friend's parent in that way can be seen as crossing a boundary, especially if the friend is still close with their mother.\n\nAlso, the author mentions that the relationship has caused social issues, driving them away from friends. It's possible that the author's actions have led to a breakdown in the friend's trust and social circle. Even if the author isn't legally at fault, socially and morally, they might be in the wrong because they're disrupting the friend's family dynamics and emotional well-being.\n\nAnother angle is the power dynamics. The friend lives with his mom, so their relationship could influence the mother's decisions in ways that affect the friend's life. The mother's initial flirtation might have been inappropriate, but the author's decision to pursue the relationship despite knowing the friend's proximity adds to the problem.\n\nIn most cases, relationships with a friend's parent can be problematic due to loyalty and trust issues. Even if the author is honest, the act of engaging in a sexual relationship with a friend's parent is often considered a breach of social norms. The consequences, like the friend trying to ruin the author's reputation, are a result of this breach.\n\nSo, considering all these factors, the answer would lean towards the author being in the wrong, even if they were upfront. The key points are the social and emotional impact on the friend, the potential for conflict of interest, and the general discomfort such relationships can cause in social circles.\n"
