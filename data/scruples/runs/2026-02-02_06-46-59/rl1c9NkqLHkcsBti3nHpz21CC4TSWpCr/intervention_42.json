My friend is 20 and lives with his single, divorced mom (41). She divorced his dad two years ago for being an alcoholic. Shes extremely hot in a more mature kind of way.\n\nWhenever i would hang out at his house his mom would openly flirt with me but i initially just chalked that up to her being playful and flirty. Except she kept up the flirting when we were alone, and everyime i stepped it up she would step it up herself.\n\nI asked her out, and weve had a casual sexual relationship for almost a month and a half. I was very open with my friend, his mom insisted on it and i dont want to hurt him.\n\nHe is completely put off by it, which i can understand, but at the same time everyone is an adult and can make their own choices. He orders me to stop seeing her and i refuse. He is now actively trying to get all of our friends to hate me and its been semi successful.\n\nEven if i stopped seeing his mom i dont believe he will let up with the smear campaign. Oddly enough this has actually driven me closer to his mom since im running out of friends.\n\nAITA in this situation even if i was upfront and honest with him?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The author is a 23-year-old guy who had a casual sexual relationship with his friend's mom, who's 41. The friend is 20, and the mom is divorced. The author initially thought the flirting was playful but then escalated into a relationship. He told his friend, but now the friend is upset and spreading a smear campaign against him.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethics here. The key points are consent and the power dynamics involved. The mom is an adult, so legally, if she consented, it's not illegal. However, the relationship involves someone's parent, which can be socially sensitive. The friend is still part of the equation, even though he's 20 now. The author says he was upfront with the friend, which is good, but the friend is still hurt and angry.\n\nThe author's actions might be causing emotional distress to the friend, even if he's an adult. The problem is that the relationship could affect the friend's well-being. The author's refusal to stop despite the friend's request might be seen as disregarding the friend's feelings. Also, the author mentions that the mom insisted on telling the friend, but maybe that's not the same as the friend wanting to know.\n\nAnother angle is the potential for manipulation. The mom might be using the author to get back at the ex-husband, or there could be other motivations. But the author claims to be in a casual relationship, so maybe he's aware but still proceeds.\n\nEthically, while the adults involved (author and mom) are making a choice, the impact on the friend is significant. The author's decision to continue the relationship despite the friend's distress could be seen as morally wrong because it's causing harm to the friend's social circle and personal life. Even if the author is honest, the act itself is socially taboo and might be considered wrong because of the familial relationship involved.\n\nSo, considering all that, the author is in the wrong. The answer is A.\n"
