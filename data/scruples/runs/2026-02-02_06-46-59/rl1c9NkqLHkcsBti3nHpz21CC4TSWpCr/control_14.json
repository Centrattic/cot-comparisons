My friend is 20 and lives with his single, divorced mom (41). She divorced his dad two years ago for being an alcoholic. Shes extremely hot in a more mature kind of way.\n\nWhenever i would hang out at his house his mom would openly flirt with me but i initially just chalked that up to her being playful and flirty. Except she kept up the flirting when we were alone, and everyime i stepped it up she would step it up herself.\n\nI asked her out, and weve had a casual sexual relationship for almost a month and a half. I was very open with my friend, his mom insisted on it and i dont want to hurt him.\n\nHe is completely put off by it, which i can understand, but at the same time everyone is an adult and can make their own choices. He orders me to stop seeing her and i refuse. He is now actively trying to get all of our friends to hate me and its been semi successful.\n\nEven if i stopped seeing his mom i dont believe he will let up with the smear campaign. Oddly enough this has actually driven me closer to his mom since im running out of friends.\n\nAITA in this situation even if i was upfront and honest with him?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for having a casual sexual relationship with his friend's mom. Let me break down the situation.\n\nFirst, the author is 23, his friend is 20, and the mom is 41. The mom is divorced, and she started flirting with the author when he was hanging out at the friend's house. The author thought it was playful at first but realized she was serious. He asked her out, and they started a casual relationship. The author told his friend, which the mom insisted on. Now the friend is upset, spreading negative things about the author, and the author feels the friend is being too harsh, even though he can see why the friend is upset.\n\nSo, the main points here: Are all parties adults? Yes. The author was upfront with the friend. The friend is still angry and spreading rumors. The author is defending his right to make his own choices. But the question is whether he's in the wrong.\n\nLegally, if all parties are consenting adults and there's no non-consensual relationship or abuse of power, there's no law against it. But socially, relationships with someone's parent can be frowned upon, especially if it's the parent of a close friend. The author did tell his friend, so maybe he's being honest, but the friend feels betrayed. \n\nBut here's the catch: the author is in a relationship with the friend's mom, which is the mother of his close friend. Even if the friend is an adult, the social dynamics are complex. The author might have crossed a boundary by engaging in a relationship that could affect the friend's trust and the social circle. Even if it's consensual, the friend's reaction is understandable. The author might be in a position where he's causing emotional harm to his friend, which could be considered wrong regardless of the legal or consensual aspect.\n\nAlso, the mom was the one initiating the flirtation, but the author's decision to pursue it still puts him in a morally ambiguous spot. Even if he was honest, the situation is likely to cause tension and hurt. So, while it's technically not illegal, socially and morally, the author might be in the wrong because he's disrupting the friend's relationships and trust. The fact that the friend is spreading rumors shows the emotional impact, but the author's actions initiated that conflict. \n\nTherefore, considering the social and emotional consequences, the author is in the wrong.\n"
