My friend is 20 and lives with his single, divorced mom (41). She divorced his dad two years ago for being an alcoholic. Shes extremely hot in a more mature kind of way.\n\nWhenever i would hang out at his house his mom would openly flirt with me but i initially just chalked that up to her being playful and flirty. Except she kept up the flirting when we were alone, and everyime i stepped it up she would step it up herself.\n\nI asked her out, and weve had a casual sexual relationship for almost a month and a half. I was very open with my friend, his mom insisted on it and i dont want to hurt him.\n\nHe is completely put off by it, which i can understand, but at the same time everyone is an adult and can make their own choices. He orders me to stop seeing her and i refuse. He is now actively trying to get all of our friends to hate me and its been semi successful.\n\nEven if i stopped seeing his mom i dont believe he will let up with the smear campaign. Oddly enough this has actually driven me closer to his mom since im running out of friends.\n\nAITA in this situation even if i was upfront and honest with him?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation involves a 23-year-old having a casual sexual relationship with his friend's mom, who is 41. The friend is 20 and upset, leading to social issues.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key elements. The author was friends with his friend and his mother. The mom initiated flirting, and the relationship became sexual after the author asked her out. The author was upfront with the friend, but the friend is upset and spreading negative things about him.\n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong. Legally, both are adults, so consensual relationships are allowed. However, ethically, there's the issue of the mother being the girlfriend's parent. Even if the friend's mom is divorced, there's a potential conflict of interest, especially since the friend lives with her. The author's actions could lead to emotional distress for the friend, who might feel betrayed or uncomfortable.\n\nAlso, the author mentions that the friend is trying to turn their mutual friends against him. While the friend's reaction is extreme, the author's actions could be seen as crossing a boundary, given the family relationship. Even if the author was open with the friend, pursuing a relationship with someone's parent, especially when they still live under the same roof, can create tension and is often considered taboo.\n\nThe author argues that everyone is an adult and can make choices, but there's also the aspect of the existing social dynamics. The mother's age and the fact that she was the one initiating the relationship might affect the perception. However, the primary issue is the relationship's impact on the friend and the social circle. The author's decision to continue despite causing harm suggests a lack of consideration for the friend's feelings, which could be seen as wrong.\n\nSo, balancing the legal permissibility against the ethical and social implications, the answer leans towards the author being in the wrong because the relationship has caused significant distress and disrupted the social group, even if the actions were consensual between adults.\n"
