My friend is 20 and lives with his single, divorced mom (41). She divorced his dad two years ago for being an alcoholic. Shes extremely hot in a more mature kind of way.\n\nWhenever i would hang out at his house his mom would openly flirt with me but i initially just chalked that up to her being playful and flirty. Except she kept up the flirting when we were alone, and everyime i stepped it up she would step it up herself.\n\nI asked her out, and weve had a casual sexual relationship for almost a month and a half. I was very open with my friend, his mom insisted on it and i dont want to hurt him.\n\nHe is completely put off by it, which i can understand, but at the same time everyone is an adult and can make their own choices. He orders me to stop seeing her and i refuse. He is now actively trying to get all of our friends to hate me and its been semi successful.\n\nEven if i stopped seeing his mom i dont believe he will let up with the smear campaign. Oddly enough this has actually driven me closer to his mom since im running out of friends.\n\nAITA in this situation even if i was upfront and honest with him?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The person is asking if they're at fault for having a casual relationship with their friend's mom. The friend is 20, and the mom is 41. The user is 23. They say the mom was flirting, they asked her out, and now the friend is upset and spreading rumors.\n\nFirst, the main issue is the power dynamic. The friend is still living with his mom, who's his legal guardian, right? Even though they're all adults, the friend is quite young\u201420, which is still in his early 20s. The mom is his parent, so there's a natural authority and care relationship there. The user is in a position of possibly being close to the friend's home environment, which could create conflicts of interest.\n\nThe user did tell the friend, which is good, but the problem is that the relationship is between an adult and their parent's friend. Even if everyone is over 18, the social and emotional implications are significant. The friend is upset, and the user is causing tension in their social circle. The user's argument is that adults can make their own choices, but in this case, the friend's emotional well-being and trust are being affected. The mother's decision to engage in a relationship with someone her child is close to might also be ethically questionable, regardless of consent.\n\nAlso, the user mentions the friend is trying to get others to hate him. That's a result of the situation, but the root cause is the relationship itself. Even if the user was upfront, the act of engaging in a relationship with someone's parent, especially when the child is still young and dependent, is generally considered inappropriate. It can lead to emotional harm and damage friendships. So, while the user might not have broken any laws, they're likely in the wrong socially and ethically because of the potential for harm and the disruption caused to the friend's life.\n"
