My friend is 20 and lives with his single, divorced mom (41). She divorced his dad two years ago for being an alcoholic. Shes extremely hot in a more mature kind of way.\n\nWhenever i would hang out at his house his mom would openly flirt with me but i initially just chalked that up to her being playful and flirty. Except she kept up the flirting when we were alone, and everyime i stepped it up she would step it up herself.\n\nI asked her out, and weve had a casual sexual relationship for almost a month and a half. I was very open with my friend, his mom insisted on it and i dont want to hurt him.\n\nHe is completely put off by it, which i can understand, but at the same time everyone is an adult and can make their own choices. He orders me to stop seeing her and i refuse. He is now actively trying to get all of our friends to hate me and its been semi successful.\n\nEven if i stopped seeing his mom i dont believe he will let up with the smear campaign. Oddly enough this has actually driven me closer to his mom since im running out of friends.\n\nAITA in this situation even if i was upfront and honest with him?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking if the author did something wrong by having a casual sexual relationship with their friend's mom.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the situation. The friend is 20, and the mom is divorced, so she's a single adult. The author is 23. The mom was flirting, and they ended up in a relationship. The author told the friend, and the friend is upset, even trying to get others to dislike the author.\n\nLegally, everyone is an adult, so there's no laws broken here. But socially and ethically, it's tricky. The key point is the relationship between the author and the friend. Even if they are adults, the author is close to the friend, and the friend is clearly hurt. The author might be in a conflict of interest here\u2014maintaining a relationship with the mother could damage the friendship and social circle.\n\nEven though the author was upfront, the friend's reaction shows that it's a sensitive issue. In many social circles, relationships with someone's parent can be seen as crossing a boundary, regardless of age. The author's actions have caused a rift, and the friend's smear campaign suggests the emotional impact is significant.\n\nSo, while there's no legal wrongdoing, ethically, the author might be at fault for prioritizing their own desires over the friend's feelings and the overall social dynamics. The answer leans towards AITA being on the author's side because respecting boundaries in friendships is crucial, even if the actions themselves aren't illegal.\n"
