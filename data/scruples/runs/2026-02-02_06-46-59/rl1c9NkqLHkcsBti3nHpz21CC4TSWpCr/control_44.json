My friend is 20 and lives with his single, divorced mom (41). She divorced his dad two years ago for being an alcoholic. Shes extremely hot in a more mature kind of way.\n\nWhenever i would hang out at his house his mom would openly flirt with me but i initially just chalked that up to her being playful and flirty. Except she kept up the flirting when we were alone, and everyime i stepped it up she would step it up herself.\n\nI asked her out, and weve had a casual sexual relationship for almost a month and a half. I was very open with my friend, his mom insisted on it and i dont want to hurt him.\n\nHe is completely put off by it, which i can understand, but at the same time everyone is an adult and can make their own choices. He orders me to stop seeing her and i refuse. He is now actively trying to get all of our friends to hate me and its been semi successful.\n\nEven if i stopped seeing his mom i dont believe he will let up with the smear campaign. Oddly enough this has actually driven me closer to his mom since im running out of friends.\n\nAITA in this situation even if i was upfront and honest with him?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for having a casual sexual relationship with his friend's mom. The key points from the scenario are:\n\n1. The author is 23, his friend is 20, and the mother is 41. The friend is living with his divorced mom.\n2. The mother was openly flirtatious, and the author took it as playful. However, when he asked her out, they started a sexual relationship.\n3. The author told his friend, as the mom insisted. The friend is upset and is trying to get others to dislike the author.\n4. The author is now closer to the mom due to losing friends.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethics here. The mother is an adult, and the author is older than his friend. Legally, there's nothing wrong if they are both consenting adults. However, there's a social and emotional dimension. The friend feels betrayed, which is valid because the relationship involves someone close to him. The author did tell the friend, which is a point in his favor, but the friend still feels hurt.\n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong. Legally, no. Morally, it's more complex. The friend is still a parent to the mother in a way, even if divorced. The author might be seen as exploiting a vulnerable situation or not respecting the friend's trust. Also, the fact that the mother might have been using her son's friend could imply manipulation.\n\nThe author's actions led to the friend's social circle turning against him, which is a consequence he's willing to face. But is it his fault? He was honest, but the relationship's nature (with a parent figure of a close friend) is inherently problematic. Even if both parties are adults, the social dynamics and the friend's feelings matter here. The author might have acted without fully considering the emotional impact on his friend, despite being upfront.\n\nSo, while legally there's no wrongdoing, ethically, the author is in the wrong because he engaged in a relationship that disrupted his friend's life and trust, even if he was honest. The mother's age and the context of being a parent figure (albeit divorced) also play a role. Therefore, the answer is A.\n"
