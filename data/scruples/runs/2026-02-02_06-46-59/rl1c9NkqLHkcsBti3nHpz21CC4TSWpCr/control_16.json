My friend is 20 and lives with his single, divorced mom (41). She divorced his dad two years ago for being an alcoholic. Shes extremely hot in a more mature kind of way.\n\nWhenever i would hang out at his house his mom would openly flirt with me but i initially just chalked that up to her being playful and flirty. Except she kept up the flirting when we were alone, and everyime i stepped it up she would step it up herself.\n\nI asked her out, and weve had a casual sexual relationship for almost a month and a half. I was very open with my friend, his mom insisted on it and i dont want to hurt him.\n\nHe is completely put off by it, which i can understand, but at the same time everyone is an adult and can make their own choices. He orders me to stop seeing her and i refuse. He is now actively trying to get all of our friends to hate me and its been semi successful.\n\nEven if i stopped seeing his mom i dont believe he will let up with the smear campaign. Oddly enough this has actually driven me closer to his mom since im running out of friends.\n\nAITA in this situation even if i was upfront and honest with him?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to work through this. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for having a casual sexual relationship with their friend's mom. The situation involves a 23-year-old who's in a relationship with a 41-year-old woman who is the mother of his 20-year-old friend. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The friend's mom was openly flirting with the author, and the author took it further by asking her out. They have a casual sexual relationship. The friend is upset and is trying to get others to turn against the author. The author claims they were upfront with the friend.\n\nSo, the main points to consider: Is the author's action morally wrong? Legally, in most places, consensual adult relationships aren't illegal. But socially and ethically, there's a different angle. The friend is still a minor in some regions (20 years old), depending on the country. Even if the friend is an adult, the mother-son relationship complicates things. The mother is the legal guardian, and there's a power dynamic there. Also, the author was friends with the son, so there's a betrayal of trust in the friendship.\n\nEven if the author was honest with the friend, the act of pursuing the mother could be seen as taking advantage of the friend's trust or the family's dynamics. The mother might be in a vulnerable position after a divorce, and the author's pursuit could be seen as exploiting that. The author's actions have caused significant social problems, leading to the friend's smear campaign and the author losing friends.\n\nAnother angle is the potential for the mother to feel pressured. The author mentions that every time he stepped it up, she did too. It might not have been entirely consensual if there was an imbalance in the dynamic. Also, the mother's behavior\u2014flirting while her son lives at home\u2014could be problematic. The author might not have considered the impact on the son and the family stability.\n\nIn terms of ethics, relationships with someone close to a friend can be tricky. The author's decision to continue despite the friend's objections shows a disregard for the friend's feelings, which is a breach of trust. Even if adults have the right to make choices, the closeness of the relationship adds layers of complexity. The author's actions have caused harm, and the lack of support from friends suggests a social judgment against their actions.\n\nSo, putting it all together, while the author might not be legally wrong, the social and moral implications suggest they are in the wrong. The key factors are the power dynamics, betrayal of trust, and the negative impact on the friend's life. Therefore, the answer is likely A.\n"
