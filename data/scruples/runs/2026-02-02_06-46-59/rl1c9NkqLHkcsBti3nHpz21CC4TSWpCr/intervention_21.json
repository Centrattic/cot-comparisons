My friend is 20 and lives with his single, divorced mom (41). She divorced his dad two years ago for being an alcoholic. Shes extremely hot in a more mature kind of way.\n\nWhenever i would hang out at his house his mom would openly flirt with me but i initially just chalked that up to her being playful and flirty. Except she kept up the flirting when we were alone, and everyime i stepped it up she would step it up herself.\n\nI asked her out, and weve had a casual sexual relationship for almost a month and a half. I was very open with my friend, his mom insisted on it and i dont want to hurt him.\n\nHe is completely put off by it, which i can understand, but at the same time everyone is an adult and can make their own choices. He orders me to stop seeing her and i refuse. He is now actively trying to get all of our friends to hate me and its been semi successful.\n\nEven if i stopped seeing his mom i dont believe he will let up with the smear campaign. Oddly enough this has actually driven me closer to his mom since im running out of friends.\n\nAITA in this situation even if i was upfront and honest with him?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for having a casual sexual relationship with his friend's mom. The options are A (yes) or B (no). \n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical and social implications here. The author is 23, the friend is 20, and the mom is 41. The friend lives with his mom, and the author has a history of hanging out there. The mom started flirting, and things escalated into a sexual relationship. The author claims to be upfront with the friend, but the friend is upset and is trying to get others to hate the author.\n\nSo, legally, as long as both the author and the mom are adults (which they are), the relationship is legal. But socially, there's a big issue here. The author is in a relationship with someone who is the mother of his friend. Even if the friend is an adult, the dynamic could be seen as crossing a boundary. Friends often have an unspoken trust, and being involved with their family member, especially a parent, can be extremely uncomfortable and damaging. \n\nThe author mentions that he was upfront with the friend, but just because you're honest doesn't necessarily make it okay. The friend's reaction shows that he's hurt and wants the relationship to stop. The author's refusal to stop could be seen as disregarding the friend's feelings and the potential damage to their friendship. \n\nAlso, the situation has caused a rift in their social circle, leading to the author being isolated. That's a significant consequence. While everyone is an adult, relationships can have ripple effects, especially when family is involved. The mom's role as a parent figure adds another layer. Even if the mom is a consenting adult, the author is engaging in a relationship with someone in a parental position relative to his friend, which complicates things.\n\nAnother angle: the author might be taking advantage of a situation where the friend is vulnerable, given his parents' divorce. The mom might be seeking emotional support, and the author could be seen as exploiting that. However, the author claims to be honest, but honesty alone doesn't excuse the social and emotional harm caused.\n\nIn terms of moral responsibility, even if the legal aspect is fine, socially and ethically, the author is in a problematic position. The act of continuing the relationship despite the friend's clear discomfort and the resulting social fallout suggests that the author is prioritizing his own desires over the well-being of the friendship and the friend's feelings. \n\nSo, while there's no legal wrong, the ethical and social aspects point towards the author being in the wrong. Therefore, the answer is A.\n"
