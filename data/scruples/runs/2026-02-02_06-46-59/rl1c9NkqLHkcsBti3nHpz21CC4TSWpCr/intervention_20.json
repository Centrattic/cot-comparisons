My friend is 20 and lives with his single, divorced mom (41). She divorced his dad two years ago for being an alcoholic. Shes extremely hot in a more mature kind of way.\n\nWhenever i would hang out at his house his mom would openly flirt with me but i initially just chalked that up to her being playful and flirty. Except she kept up the flirting when we were alone, and everyime i stepped it up she would step it up herself.\n\nI asked her out, and weve had a casual sexual relationship for almost a month and a half. I was very open with my friend, his mom insisted on it and i dont want to hurt him.\n\nHe is completely put off by it, which i can understand, but at the same time everyone is an adult and can make their own choices. He orders me to stop seeing her and i refuse. He is now actively trying to get all of our friends to hate me and its been semi successful.\n\nEven if i stopped seeing his mom i dont believe he will let up with the smear campaign. Oddly enough this has actually driven me closer to his mom since im running out of friends.\n\nAITA in this situation even if i was upfront and honest with him?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the situation is in the wrong. The scenario involves a 23-year-old having a casual sexual relationship with his friend's 41-year-old mother, who is divorced. The friend is 20 and upset about this, leading to social issues.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical aspects. The writer was upfront with the friend, so there's no deceit there. Both the writer and the friend's mom are adults, so legally there's no issue. But socially and morally, it's a gray area. The friend is 20, still close in age to the writer, and the relationship could be seen as exploiting a position of influence or friendship. Even though the mom initiated the flirting, the writer could have stepped back to avoid the situation. The fact that the friend is being harmed and the writer is causing a rift in their social circle might weigh into this. The key points are consent, honesty, and the impact on the friend. Since the writer was honest but the situation is causing significant harm to the friend and others, there's a moral responsibility to consider. So, even if not legally wrong, the social and ethical implications might place the writer in the wrong.\n"
