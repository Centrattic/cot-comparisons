My friend is 20 and lives with his single, divorced mom (41). She divorced his dad two years ago for being an alcoholic. Shes extremely hot in a more mature kind of way.\n\nWhenever i would hang out at his house his mom would openly flirt with me but i initially just chalked that up to her being playful and flirty. Except she kept up the flirting when we were alone, and everyime i stepped it up she would step it up herself.\n\nI asked her out, and weve had a casual sexual relationship for almost a month and a half. I was very open with my friend, his mom insisted on it and i dont want to hurt him.\n\nHe is completely put off by it, which i can understand, but at the same time everyone is an adult and can make their own choices. He orders me to stop seeing her and i refuse. He is now actively trying to get all of our friends to hate me and its been semi successful.\n\nEven if i stopped seeing his mom i dont believe he will let up with the smear campaign. Oddly enough this has actually driven me closer to his mom since im running out of friends.\n\nAITA in this situation even if i was upfront and honest with him?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is that a 23-year-old had a casual sexual relationship with his friend's mom, who is 41. The friend is 20, and when he found out, he's upset and trying to get others to hate the author. The author says they were upfront with the friend.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics. The friend lives with his mom, and she was flirting with the author initially. The author thought it was playful but then the relationship became sexual. The key points here might be consent and the power dynamics. Are both parties adults? Yes, the author is 23, and the mom is 41. So legally, there's no issue there if it's consensual.\n\nBut there's the aspect of the friend's feelings. The friend is 20, so even though he's an adult, his mom is in a position of parental responsibility over him. The author is friends with the son, so there might be a conflict there. Even if the author told the friend upfront, the son might still feel betrayed. However, the author argues that everyone is an adult and can make their own choices. \n\nAnother angle is the potential for emotional manipulation. The mom was the one initiating the flirtation, which the author might have continued. Is there a power imbalance because the mom is the parent of the author's friend? That could complicate things. Even if the mom is consenting, the son's trust is being broken, which is a social and emotional issue.\n\nAlso, the author mentions that continuing the relationship has caused a rift in their social circle. The author feels driven closer to the mom because they're losing friends. But the friend is trying to start a smear campaign against the author. The author's actions might be causing harm to their friendship and the friend's emotional well-being.\n\nMoral judgment here is tricky. Legally, it's consensual between adults. But socially and ethically, the situation is complicated. The author is in a position of being close to the son and then engaging with the mother, which can be seen as crossing a boundary. Even if the author was honest with the friend, the friend's distress is valid. The author might not be wrong legally, but they might be in the wrong socially or morally because of the impact on the friend and the social circle.\n\nSo, considering all these factors, the answer might be that the author is in the wrong (A) because of the interpersonal dynamics and the harm caused to the friend, even if the actions themselves are consensual. The key here is the effect on the friend and the breach of trust in the friendship.\n"
