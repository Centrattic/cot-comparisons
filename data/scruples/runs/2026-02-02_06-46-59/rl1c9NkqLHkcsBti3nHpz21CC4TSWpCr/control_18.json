My friend is 20 and lives with his single, divorced mom (41). She divorced his dad two years ago for being an alcoholic. Shes extremely hot in a more mature kind of way.\n\nWhenever i would hang out at his house his mom would openly flirt with me but i initially just chalked that up to her being playful and flirty. Except she kept up the flirting when we were alone, and everyime i stepped it up she would step it up herself.\n\nI asked her out, and weve had a casual sexual relationship for almost a month and a half. I was very open with my friend, his mom insisted on it and i dont want to hurt him.\n\nHe is completely put off by it, which i can understand, but at the same time everyone is an adult and can make their own choices. He orders me to stop seeing her and i refuse. He is now actively trying to get all of our friends to hate me and its been semi successful.\n\nEven if i stopped seeing his mom i dont believe he will let up with the smear campaign. Oddly enough this has actually driven me closer to his mom since im running out of friends.\n\nAITA in this situation even if i was upfront and honest with him?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA post is in the wrong for having a casual sexual relationship with their friend's mom. The key points here are the ages involved, the dynamics of the relationship, and the consequences.\n\nFirst, the author is 23, the friend is 20, and the mother is 41. The mother and friend's father divorced two years ago. The mother started flirting with the author, and they ended up in a casual sexual relationship after the author asked her out. The author claims to be upfront with the friend, but the friend is upset and trying to get others to dislike the author. The author feels the friend is being unfair because everyone is an adult.\n\nNow, considering the ethical aspects. Even though all parties are adults, there's a potential issue with the power dynamics. The mother is the parent of the friend, which could mean there's an inherent power imbalance. Also, the mother might be using her position of authority or influence over the son, even if indirectly. The friend is 20, which is still young, and the mother is his parent. The author approached the mother, but the mother's initial flirtation is a point to consider. If the mother was the one initiating, does that shift some responsibility? Maybe, but the author still made a choice to pursue the relationship despite knowing the friend's feelings.\n\nAnother angle is the impact on the friend. The friend is clearly hurt and upset, leading to social consequences for the author. Even if the author was honest, the act of pursuing a relationship with someone's parent can be seen as crossing a social boundary. The fact that the author is now closer to the mother because friends are distancing them might not excuse the situation but shows the fallout is significant.\n\nLegally, there's no issue since all parties are adults. But socially and ethically, the situation is tricky. The AITA community often sides with the friend in these parent situations because of the family dynamics and potential manipulation. The mother's role as a parent could be seen as a conflict of interest, especially if she's using her position to start a relationship with someone close to her child.\n\nSo, the author might be in the wrong not because of the legality but because of the social and familial implications. Even if they were upfront, the act itself is considered by many as a breach of trust and boundary. The friend's reaction, while maybe excessive, is a natural response to the situation. Therefore, the answer would likely be A, the author is in the wrong.\n"
