My friend is 20 and lives with his single, divorced mom (41). She divorced his dad two years ago for being an alcoholic. Shes extremely hot in a more mature kind of way.\n\nWhenever i would hang out at his house his mom would openly flirt with me but i initially just chalked that up to her being playful and flirty. Except she kept up the flirting when we were alone, and everyime i stepped it up she would step it up herself.\n\nI asked her out, and weve had a casual sexual relationship for almost a month and a half. I was very open with my friend, his mom insisted on it and i dont want to hurt him.\n\nHe is completely put off by it, which i can understand, but at the same time everyone is an adult and can make their own choices. He orders me to stop seeing her and i refuse. He is now actively trying to get all of our friends to hate me and its been semi successful.\n\nEven if i stopped seeing his mom i dont believe he will let up with the smear campaign. Oddly enough this has actually driven me closer to his mom since im running out of friends.\n\nAITA in this situation even if i was upfront and honest with him?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the \"AITA\" (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong. The situation involves a 23-year-old having a casual sexual relationship with his friend's mom, who is 41. The friend is 20, so there's a significant age difference between the author and the friend. The mom was flirting with the author, and they ended up in a relationship. The friend is upset and is trying to get others to dislike the author.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical aspects here. The author is in a relationship with someone who is married to their friend's parent, even though the mom is divorced. The key points here are boundaries, consent, and the impact on friends. The author claims to have been upfront with the friend, but the friend is still hurt and upset. \n\nFrom a moral standpoint, relationships with someone's parent can be tricky, especially when it's a close friend. Even if everyone is an adult, it's about respecting personal boundaries and considering the feelings of others involved. The friend is the parent's child, so this relationship could be seen as crossing a line, even if the mom is willing. \n\nAlso, the author mentions that the friend is trying to get others to hate him, but the author is continuing the relationship, which might be exacerbating the situation. The fact that the author is becoming closer to the mom as friends drift away suggests that the social consequences are significant. \n\nLegally, there's no issue since both parties are adults and consent is present. But ethically, it's more about the impact on the friend and the social dynamics. The author might be in the wrong because they knowingly entered into a relationship that would deeply affect their friend, despite being told to stop. Even if they were honest, the act itself could be seen as violating a trust or boundary, leading to harm in the friend's life and their social circle.\n\nSo, considering all angles, the author is likely in the wrong because they pursued a relationship that caused significant distress to a close friend, regardless of consent from the other party. The answer should be A.\n"
