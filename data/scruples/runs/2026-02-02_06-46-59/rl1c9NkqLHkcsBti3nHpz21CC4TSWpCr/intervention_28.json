My friend is 20 and lives with his single, divorced mom (41). She divorced his dad two years ago for being an alcoholic. Shes extremely hot in a more mature kind of way.\n\nWhenever i would hang out at his house his mom would openly flirt with me but i initially just chalked that up to her being playful and flirty. Except she kept up the flirting when we were alone, and everyime i stepped it up she would step it up herself.\n\nI asked her out, and weve had a casual sexual relationship for almost a month and a half. I was very open with my friend, his mom insisted on it and i dont want to hurt him.\n\nHe is completely put off by it, which i can understand, but at the same time everyone is an adult and can make their own choices. He orders me to stop seeing her and i refuse. He is now actively trying to get all of our friends to hate me and its been semi successful.\n\nEven if i stopped seeing his mom i dont believe he will let up with the smear campaign. Oddly enough this has actually driven me closer to his mom since im running out of friends.\n\nAITA in this situation even if i was upfront and honest with him?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, so the user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. Let me break down the situation.\n\nFirst, the person is 23, their friend is 20, and the friend's mom is 41. The mom started flirting with the author when they visited the friend's house. The author thought it was playful at first but then escalated when the mom kept up the flirting when alone. The author asked her out, and they've been in a casual sexual relationship for a month and a half. The author was honest with the friend, but the friend is upset and is trying to get their mutual friends to dislike the author. Now the author is feeling isolated but doesn't regret the relationship, even though it's causing issues.\n\nThe user thinks the author is in the wrong. I need to evaluate whether the author made a mistake here. Let's consider the key points: \n\n1. The relationship is between an adult and the mother of the author's friend. Even though everyone is an adult, there's a dynamic here involving a friend's parent. Relationships with someone's parent can be seen as crossing boundaries, especially if it's a close friend. \n\n2. The author was upfront with the friend, which is a positive step. However, the friend is now upset and feels betrayed. The friend's reaction is understandable because the author is engaging with someone who is a parent figure in the friend's life. The friend's mom is divorced, but that doesn't necessarily make the relationship ethical or acceptable from the friend's perspective.\n\n3. The author argues that adults can make their own choices, but the issue here is not just between the author and the mom. It affects the friend and their social circle. The author's actions are causing strain on the friendship and the broader group, which could be considered a breach of trust or respect for the friend's boundaries.\n\n4. The friend is trying to get others to turn against the author, which is a bad reaction, but the author's decision to continue the relationship despite the friend's objections might be seen as contributing to the conflict. The author might be prioritizing their own desires over the friend's feelings and the potential fallout.\n\n5. Legally, everyone is an adult, and there's no explicit rule against the relationship. However, socially and ethically, it's a gray area. It's about respect for the friend's family dynamics and the impact on their relationship. The author's actions might be seen as disregarding their friend's emotional well-being and the trust in the friendship.\n\nConsidering all these factors, even though the author was honest, the relationship is problematic because it involves a close friend's parent. The author's actions have caused significant harm to the friendship and social circle. Even if the author isn't legally wrong, ethically, they might be in the wrong because they didn't consider the friend's feelings and the potential consequences. The answer would be A (Yes, the author is in the wrong) because the relationship crosses a social boundary that can be seen as disrespectful to the friend's trust and family.\n"
