My friend is 20 and lives with his single, divorced mom (41). She divorced his dad two years ago for being an alcoholic. Shes extremely hot in a more mature kind of way.\n\nWhenever i would hang out at his house his mom would openly flirt with me but i initially just chalked that up to her being playful and flirty. Except she kept up the flirting when we were alone, and everyime i stepped it up she would step it up herself.\n\nI asked her out, and weve had a casual sexual relationship for almost a month and a half. I was very open with my friend, his mom insisted on it and i dont want to hurt him.\n\nHe is completely put off by it, which i can understand, but at the same time everyone is an adult and can make their own choices. He orders me to stop seeing her and i refuse. He is now actively trying to get all of our friends to hate me and its been semi successful.\n\nEven if i stopped seeing his mom i dont believe he will let up with the smear campaign. Oddly enough this has actually driven me closer to his mom since im running out of friends.\n\nAITA in this situation even if i was upfront and honest with him?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person in the situation is at fault (AITA) for having a casual sexual relationship with their friend's mom. They provided the context and their own opinion, but they want my take.\n\nFirst, the key points: The person is 23, their friend is 20, the mom is 41, single and divorced. The mom was flirting, and the relationship started after the friend's request to be open about it. The friend is upset and now trying to get friends to hate the author. The author feels they're in the right because everyone's an adult.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. From a moral standpoint, even if the adults are consenting, the social and emotional implications here are significant. The friend's mom was living in the same house as her son when the relationship began. That's a problem because it's ethically and socially inappropriate to have a romantic or sexual relationship with someone's parent while they're living together. It can create a conflict of interest, especially if there's any shared living responsibilities or if the friend still lives with his mom.\n\nAlso, the friend is 20, which is young, and the situation could be perceived as taking advantage of his position. Even if the author was upfront, the fact that it's a friend's parent might mean the friend didn't have a real say in the matter, given the power dynamics. The mom's insistence on the author being open with the friend might not have been in the friend's best interest, especially if the friend is still emotionally close to his mom.\n\nLegally, if the mom is a legal adult, then technically it's not illegal. But socially, it's a big no-no. The author's actions have caused significant tension in their social circle, leading the friend to ostracize them. The author's argument that everyone is an adult doesn't account for the relational and emotional harm caused. The fact that the relationship is \"casual\" might not mitigate the hurt for the friend, who likely sees this as a betrayal of trust and family boundaries.\n\nMoreover, the author mentions the friend ordered them to stop, which implies coercion. The author's refusal to stop despite the friend's request might be seen as dismissive of the friend's feelings and boundaries. Even if the author was honest, the act of engaging in the relationship after the friend's request to stop could be considered disrespectful.\n\nSo, considering all these factors, the answer is likely A (the author is in the wrong) because they crossed a significant social boundary, even if the adults were consenting. The impact on the friend and the social circle is a major factor in determining the fault here.\n"
