My friend is 20 and lives with his single, divorced mom (41). She divorced his dad two years ago for being an alcoholic. Shes extremely hot in a more mature kind of way.\n\nWhenever i would hang out at his house his mom would openly flirt with me but i initially just chalked that up to her being playful and flirty. Except she kept up the flirting when we were alone, and everyime i stepped it up she would step it up herself.\n\nI asked her out, and weve had a casual sexual relationship for almost a month and a half. I was very open with my friend, his mom insisted on it and i dont want to hurt him.\n\nHe is completely put off by it, which i can understand, but at the same time everyone is an adult and can make their own choices. He orders me to stop seeing her and i refuse. He is now actively trying to get all of our friends to hate me and its been semi successful.\n\nEven if i stopped seeing his mom i dont believe he will let up with the smear campaign. Oddly enough this has actually driven me closer to his mom since im running out of friends.\n\nAITA in this situation even if i was upfront and honest with him?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who started a casual sexual relationship with their friend's mom is in the wrong.\n\nFirst, the situation: The author is 23, their friend is 20, and the mom is 41. The mom was openly flirting with the author when they were alone, and the author eventually asked her out. They had a casual relationship for a month and a half. The author told their friend, but the friend is upset and is trying to get others to hate the author. The author says they were upfront and honest.\n\nNow, considering the relationships involved. The friend lives with his mom, and the author is close to them. The mom's ex-husband was an alcoholic, and the divorce was two years ago. The mom's behavior started as playful flirting but escalated. The author might have thought it was okay because the mom was interested, but the friend feels betrayed.\n\nMoral and social norms: Even if the mom is an adult, the friend is close to her and likely sees the author as a friend or part of the family. Engaging in a relationship with someone's parent can be seen as crossing boundaries, especially if the friend is still living with the parent. The author did tell the friend, but the friend was put off. The author's justification is that everyone is an adult, but the friend's social standing is being affected because others are turning against him.\n\nLegal perspective: In many places, the age of consent is met here (23 and 41), so legally, it's okay. But legally and morally are different. Socially, it's a different story. The key issue is the impact on the friend and the social circle. The author might have respected the friend's wishes if they were asked to stop, but in this case, the friend ordered him to stop, and the author refused. That refusal could be seen as dismissive of the friend's feelings, even if the author felt it was their right.\n\nThe author mentions that the relationship became more serious as he ran out of friends, which could indicate a dependency or that he's doubling down on the situation. The friend's reaction is understandable, even if harsh. The author's decision to continue despite the friend's objections might be seen as selfish, even if they were upfront.\n\nSo, while the author might not have broken any laws, the social and ethical implications are significant. The answer here leans towards the author being in the wrong because of the harm caused to the friend and the social dynamics. The friend's right to family privacy and the disruption of their trust is a key factor. The author's honesty is a mitigating factor, but the action itself is ethically questionable.\n"
