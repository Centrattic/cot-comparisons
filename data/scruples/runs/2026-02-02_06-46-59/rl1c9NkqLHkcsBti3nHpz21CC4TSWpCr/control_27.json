My friend is 20 and lives with his single, divorced mom (41). She divorced his dad two years ago for being an alcoholic. Shes extremely hot in a more mature kind of way.\n\nWhenever i would hang out at his house his mom would openly flirt with me but i initially just chalked that up to her being playful and flirty. Except she kept up the flirting when we were alone, and everyime i stepped it up she would step it up herself.\n\nI asked her out, and weve had a casual sexual relationship for almost a month and a half. I was very open with my friend, his mom insisted on it and i dont want to hurt him.\n\nHe is completely put off by it, which i can understand, but at the same time everyone is an adult and can make their own choices. He orders me to stop seeing her and i refuse. He is now actively trying to get all of our friends to hate me and its been semi successful.\n\nEven if i stopped seeing his mom i dont believe he will let up with the smear campaign. Oddly enough this has actually driven me closer to his mom since im running out of friends.\n\nAITA in this situation even if i was upfront and honest with him?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who had a casual sexual relationship with their friend's mom is in the wrong. The story is from the \"Am I the Asshole\" subreddit, so it's a classic AITA scenario.\n\nFirst, the key points: The person is 23, the friend is 20, and the mom is 41. The friend's mom started flirting, they became a couple, and the friend is upset. The author claims they were upfront with the friend, but the friend is trying to get others to hate them. The question is whether the author is in the wrong despite being honest.\n\nNow, considering ethics and social norms. Even if the author was honest, the situation involves a close friend's parent. There's a risk of betrayal of trust, even if the mom is an adult. The friend is 20, still young, and this could affect their relationship irreparably. \n\nAlso, the friend's mom might be in a position of authority or responsibility over her son, which could create a power dynamic. Even if both mom and author are adults, the relationship could be seen as exploiting a position of influence. \n\nThe author might argue that everyone is an adult and consent was given. However, the social implications are significant. The friend is upset, and the author is causing a rift in the social circle. The fact that the friend is trying to get others to hate the author shows the seriousness of the breach in social trust.\n\nIn many AITA scenarios, relationships with close friends' family members are frowned upon, even if consensual. The author's actions could be seen as crossing a social boundary, hence the friend's anger. Even with honesty, the act itself might be considered wrong because it disrupts the social dynamics and betrays the friend's trust.\n\nSo, considering all factors, the answer is likely A (Yes, the author is in the wrong) because of the breach of trust and social boundaries, despite the consensual nature of the relationship.\n"
