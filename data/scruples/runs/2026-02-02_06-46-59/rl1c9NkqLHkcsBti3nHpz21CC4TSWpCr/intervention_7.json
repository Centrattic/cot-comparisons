My friend is 20 and lives with his single, divorced mom (41). She divorced his dad two years ago for being an alcoholic. Shes extremely hot in a more mature kind of way.\n\nWhenever i would hang out at his house his mom would openly flirt with me but i initially just chalked that up to her being playful and flirty. Except she kept up the flirting when we were alone, and everyime i stepped it up she would step it up herself.\n\nI asked her out, and weve had a casual sexual relationship for almost a month and a half. I was very open with my friend, his mom insisted on it and i dont want to hurt him.\n\nHe is completely put off by it, which i can understand, but at the same time everyone is an adult and can make their own choices. He orders me to stop seeing her and i refuse. He is now actively trying to get all of our friends to hate me and its been semi successful.\n\nEven if i stopped seeing his mom i dont believe he will let up with the smear campaign. Oddly enough this has actually driven me closer to his mom since im running out of friends.\n\nAITA in this situation even if i was upfront and honest with him?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user wants to know if the author is in the wrong for having a casual sexual relationship with their friend's mom. Let me start by breaking down the situation.\n\nThe author is 23, their friend is 20 and lives with his divorced mom, who is 41. The mom started flirting, and they ended up in a casual relationship. The author was honest with the friend, but the friend is upset and is trying to get others to dislike the author. The question is whether the author is at fault.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The mom is an adult, and the author is also an adult. Legally, there's no issue because both are adults. However, ethically and socially, there's a lot to unpack. The friend is the son of the woman involved, and he's clearly hurt. Even though the author was upfront, the friend might feel betrayed, especially since he's still a minor or just an adult (20), so his perspective might be more about the relationship between his mom and someone in his close circle.\n\nThe author mentions that the mom insisted on the friend knowing. But the friend is upset and is starting a smear campaign. The author is now closer to the mom because of the backlash. The key points here are consent, honesty, and the impact on the friend's life.\n\nEven if both parties are consenting adults, the relationship could be problematic because of the existing familial connection. The mom is in a position of some authority as the parent of the friend, and the author is close to that friend. This could create a power imbalance or at least a conflict of interest in their social circles. The friend's reaction is understandable because it's his mom, and he might feel a sense of betrayal or violation.\n\nThe author was honest with the friend, which is commendable, but honesty alone doesn't mitigate the emotional harm caused. The friend's well-being and feelings are important here. Even if the author is an adult, engaging in a relationship with someone whose child is a close friend can lead to significant social and emotional consequences, as we've seen here with the friend's smear campaign.\n\nAlso, the fact that the mom is the one who pursued the relationship might affect how the situation is viewed. However, the author still made the choice to engage in it, so responsibility isn't entirely on the mom. The author should have considered the potential fallout for the friend and the social dynamics involved.\n\nIn terms of ethics, while there's no legal wrongdoing, socially and morally, the author's actions have caused harm. The friend is struggling with this, and the author's decision to continue the relationship despite the friend's objections might be seen as selfish. The author's justification that \"everyone is an adult\" overlooks the personal and emotional stakes involved for the friend.\n\nSo, putting it all together, even though the author was honest, the act of entering into a relationship with the friend's mom has caused significant distress and social issues. The author's actions have led to a breakdown in their friendship and social group. Therefore, the author is likely in the wrong because they prioritized their own desires over the friend's feelings and well-being, leading to negative consequences for everyone involved.\n"
