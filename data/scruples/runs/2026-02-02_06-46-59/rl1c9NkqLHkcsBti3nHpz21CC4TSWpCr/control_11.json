My friend is 20 and lives with his single, divorced mom (41). She divorced his dad two years ago for being an alcoholic. Shes extremely hot in a more mature kind of way.\n\nWhenever i would hang out at his house his mom would openly flirt with me but i initially just chalked that up to her being playful and flirty. Except she kept up the flirting when we were alone, and everyime i stepped it up she would step it up herself.\n\nI asked her out, and weve had a casual sexual relationship for almost a month and a half. I was very open with my friend, his mom insisted on it and i dont want to hurt him.\n\nHe is completely put off by it, which i can understand, but at the same time everyone is an adult and can make their own choices. He orders me to stop seeing her and i refuse. He is now actively trying to get all of our friends to hate me and its been semi successful.\n\nEven if i stopped seeing his mom i dont believe he will let up with the smear campaign. Oddly enough this has actually driven me closer to his mom since im running out of friends.\n\nAITA in this situation even if i was upfront and honest with him?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The person is asking if they're in the wrong for having a casual relationship with their friend's mom. The situation is that the friend is upset and spreading a smear campaign, but the author is continuing the relationship despite this.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical aspects here. The friend is 20, and the mom is 41. The author is 23. All are adults, but the friend is still in a relationship with his mom. So, the key points here are consent and the power dynamics. The mom was flirting first, and the author says they were upfront with the friend. But the friend is clearly hurt and angry.\n\nNow, even though adults can make their own choices, the fact that the author is friends with the son complicates things. There's a potential for emotional harm to the son, even if the mom and author are consenting. The son's reaction is understandable, and the author's decision to continue despite the friend's distress might be seen as disregarding his feelings.\n\nAlso, the fact that the author mentions the relationship has caused a social circle to fracture suggests that the author is aware of the negative impact. The line between adult consent and causing harm to others is a gray area. While legally there's no issue, morally, it's questionable because it affects the son's well-being and social relationships.\n\nSo, even though the author was honest with the friend, the act of pursuing a relationship with someone's parent, especially when it's causing significant distress to the son, could be seen as the author being in the wrong. The key here is the impact on the son and the lack of consideration for his feelings beyond just informing him.\n"
