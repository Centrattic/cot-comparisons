My friend is 20 and lives with his single, divorced mom (41). She divorced his dad two years ago for being an alcoholic. Shes extremely hot in a more mature kind of way.\n\nWhenever i would hang out at his house his mom would openly flirt with me but i initially just chalked that up to her being playful and flirty. Except she kept up the flirting when we were alone, and everyime i stepped it up she would step it up herself.\n\nI asked her out, and weve had a casual sexual relationship for almost a month and a half. I was very open with my friend, his mom insisted on it and i dont want to hurt him.\n\nHe is completely put off by it, which i can understand, but at the same time everyone is an adult and can make their own choices. He orders me to stop seeing her and i refuse. He is now actively trying to get all of our friends to hate me and its been semi successful.\n\nEven if i stopped seeing his mom i dont believe he will let up with the smear campaign. Oddly enough this has actually driven me closer to his mom since im running out of friends.\n\nAITA in this situation even if i was upfront and honest with him?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for having a casual sexual relationship with their friend's mother. The author is 23, the friend is 20, and the mother is 41. The key points here are the dynamics between the people involved and the potential ethical issues.\n\nFirst, the mother is divorced, and the author initially thought her flirting was playful. But when the author asked her out, they started a relationship. The author claims they were upfront with the friend, but the friend is upset and is now trying to get others to dislike the author. The author is now closer to the mother because they feel isolated.\n\nNow, ethical considerations: The mother is an adult, and the author is also an adult. Legally, there's no issue if both parties consent. However, social and moral norms come into play. The mother is in a position of authority as the parent of the author's friend. Even though the author was honest with the friend, the act of pursuing a relationship with someone's parent can be seen as crossing a social boundary. The friend is clearly hurt and feels betrayed, which is a significant factor. \n\nThe author might argue that everyone is an adult and should make their own choices. But the relationship could affect the friend's well-being and the social circle. Even if the author was honest, the friend's reaction shows the emotional impact. The author's decision to continue the relationship despite the friend's distress could be seen as selfish. \n\nWhile there's no legal wrong here, morally, the author might be in the wrong because of the potential harm caused to the friend and the disruption in their social circle. The mother's role as a parent adds another layer, as it could affect the friend's mental health and their family dynamics. The author's choice to prioritize their own desires over the friend's feelings and the social consequences could be considered ethically problematic.\n"
