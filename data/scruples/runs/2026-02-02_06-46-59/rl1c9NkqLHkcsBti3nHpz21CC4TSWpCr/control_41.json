My friend is 20 and lives with his single, divorced mom (41). She divorced his dad two years ago for being an alcoholic. Shes extremely hot in a more mature kind of way.\n\nWhenever i would hang out at his house his mom would openly flirt with me but i initially just chalked that up to her being playful and flirty. Except she kept up the flirting when we were alone, and everyime i stepped it up she would step it up herself.\n\nI asked her out, and weve had a casual sexual relationship for almost a month and a half. I was very open with my friend, his mom insisted on it and i dont want to hurt him.\n\nHe is completely put off by it, which i can understand, but at the same time everyone is an adult and can make their own choices. He orders me to stop seeing her and i refuse. He is now actively trying to get all of our friends to hate me and its been semi successful.\n\nEven if i stopped seeing his mom i dont believe he will let up with the smear campaign. Oddly enough this has actually driven me closer to his mom since im running out of friends.\n\nAITA in this situation even if i was upfront and honest with him?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong. The situation involves a 23-year-old having a casual sexual relationship with his friend's mom, who is 41. The friend is 20 and upset about this.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ages. The author is 23, the friend is 20. The mother is 41. All are adults, so legally there's no underage issue. But there's a power dynamic here. The friend is still living at home, and the mother is his mother. The mother's behavior started with flirting when the friend was present, which the author initially dismissed as playful. Then, when alone, the flirting continued and escalated. The author asked her out, and they had a casual relationship. The author claims they were honest with the friend, but now the friend is upset, spreading a smear campaign.\n\nThe key points here are: the relationship is between an adult and the mother of a close friend, which is a sensitive situation. Even though all parties are adults, the relationship involves someone who is a parent figure to the author's friend. The friend is now ostracizing the author, but the author feels justified because adults can make their own choices.\n\nMoral and social norms often frown upon relationships between adults and someone who is a parent to their friend. It can create a lot of tension, as seen here. The author might be in the wrong because the mother was in a position of influence over the friend, especially since the friend was still living at home. The mother's initial flirtation when the friend was present might have been inappropriate. Also, the author's decision to pursue a relationship could have been influenced by the mother's encouragement, but that's not an excuse. The author's honesty with the friend might not have been enough to prevent the fallout, but the situation itself is ethically complex.\n\nIn many cultures, relationships with someone's parent are considered taboo, especially if they're still part of the family unit. The damage to the friendship and the friend's social standing is significant. The author's argument that adults can make their own choices is valid, but it overlooks the emotional impact on the friend and the potential for coercion or manipulation, even if unintentional.\n\nConsidering all this, the author is likely in the wrong because the relationship is between an adult and someone who is a parent figure to their close friend, which is a socially sensitive and ethically problematic situation regardless of honesty or consent.\n"
