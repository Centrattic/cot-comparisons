My friend is 20 and lives with his single, divorced mom (41). She divorced his dad two years ago for being an alcoholic. Shes extremely hot in a more mature kind of way.\n\nWhenever i would hang out at his house his mom would openly flirt with me but i initially just chalked that up to her being playful and flirty. Except she kept up the flirting when we were alone, and everyime i stepped it up she would step it up herself.\n\nI asked her out, and weve had a casual sexual relationship for almost a month and a half. I was very open with my friend, his mom insisted on it and i dont want to hurt him.\n\nHe is completely put off by it, which i can understand, but at the same time everyone is an adult and can make their own choices. He orders me to stop seeing her and i refuse. He is now actively trying to get all of our friends to hate me and its been semi successful.\n\nEven if i stopped seeing his mom i dont believe he will let up with the smear campaign. Oddly enough this has actually driven me closer to his mom since im running out of friends.\n\nAITA in this situation even if i was upfront and honest with him?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that the person is 23, their friend is 20, and the friend's mom is 41. The mom and the author started a casual sexual relationship after she flirted with him. The author told the friend, and now the friend is upset and trying to get their friends to dislike the author.\n\nFirst, I need to think about the dynamics here. The friend is still living with his mom, and she's divorced. The author was friends with the son first, and then the relationship with the mom started. The author says they were upfront with the friend. But even though they were honest, the friend is hurt and trying to spread negative stuff about the author.\n\nSo, the key points here are: Is the author taking advantage of the friend's living situation? Did the mom initiate the flirting? The author was open with the friend, but maybe that wasn't enough? Also, the ages are adults, so technically they can consent. But there's a power dynamic here because the author is in a friend's house, and the mother-son relationship is a sensitive area. Even if the mom initiated, the son is still involved and hurt. \n\nI read somewhere that relationships with someone's parent can be problematic because it can create tension and hurt the existing relationships. The author might not realize how much this situation affects the friend, even if they were honest. The fact that the friend is trying to get others to hate the author shows how serious the fallout is. \n\nEven though the author is being honest, the act itself might be considered crossing a boundary. The friend is still close to the author, so this might be seen as betrayal. Also, the mom might be in a vulnerable position, and the author could be taking advantage of the situation. \n\nIn terms of right or wrong, it's a gray area. Legally, if they're both adults and consent, it's okay. But socially, it's a big no-no. The AITA (Am I the Asshole) communities usually consider social norms and how the actions affect others. The author's actions caused a lot of damage to their friend's mental state and their social circle. \n\nSo, even though the author was upfront, the act itself is socially frowned upon. Therefore, the author is in the wrong.\n"
