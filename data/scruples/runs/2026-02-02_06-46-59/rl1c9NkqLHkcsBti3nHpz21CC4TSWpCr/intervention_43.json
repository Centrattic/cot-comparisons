My friend is 20 and lives with his single, divorced mom (41). She divorced his dad two years ago for being an alcoholic. Shes extremely hot in a more mature kind of way.\n\nWhenever i would hang out at his house his mom would openly flirt with me but i initially just chalked that up to her being playful and flirty. Except she kept up the flirting when we were alone, and everyime i stepped it up she would step it up herself.\n\nI asked her out, and weve had a casual sexual relationship for almost a month and a half. I was very open with my friend, his mom insisted on it and i dont want to hurt him.\n\nHe is completely put off by it, which i can understand, but at the same time everyone is an adult and can make their own choices. He orders me to stop seeing her and i refuse. He is now actively trying to get all of our friends to hate me and its been semi successful.\n\nEven if i stopped seeing his mom i dont believe he will let up with the smear campaign. Oddly enough this has actually driven me closer to his mom since im running out of friends.\n\nAITA in this situation even if i was upfront and honest with him?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the person who started the thread (AITA) is in the wrong. The situation is about a 23-year-old having a casual sexual relationship with his friend's 41-year-old mom. The friend is upset and spreading a smear campaign against him.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical and social aspects. The mother is divorced and an adult, so legally, there's nothing wrong with adults engaging in consensual relationships. However, the main issue here is the social dynamics. The mother's son is 20, and he's upset. The AITA person says they were upfront with the friend, but the friend is still angry and spreading negativity. \n\nThe key points are: Are all parties adults? Yes. Is there consent? The AITA person implies there was mutual consent. But the son is still part of the social circle, and the relationship is affecting their friendship and social group. Even if the AITA person was honest, the son might feel betrayed and hurt, which is understandable. \n\nBut the question is whether the AITA is in the wrong. Legally, maybe not. Socially, it's a gray area. However, the fact that the son is still part of the mother's life, even after divorce, might add complexity. Also, the AITA person is close to the son, so engaging in a relationship with the mother could create tension and damage the friendship. \n\nThe AITA person's argument is that everyone is an adult and should be able to make their own choices. That's true, but relationships involving family can be more complicated. The mother might have a responsibility to her son's well-being, but since she's an adult, she has autonomy. However, the son's emotional response is valid, and the AITA person might have crossed a social boundary by pursuing the relationship despite knowing the potential impact on the son. \n\nAlso, the AITA person says they were upfront with the son. Even if they were honest, it's possible that the son still feels hurt and betrayed. The AITA person's actions might have caused significant distress to their friend, which could be considered in the \"wrong\" category, even if there's no legal wrongdoing. \n\nIn summary, while the AITA isn't breaking any laws, the social and emotional impact on the friend and the potential breach of trust or social norms might place them in the wrong from a moral standpoint. So, the answer might be A, yes, they are in the wrong.\n"
