My friend is 20 and lives with his single, divorced mom (41). She divorced his dad two years ago for being an alcoholic. Shes extremely hot in a more mature kind of way.\n\nWhenever i would hang out at his house his mom would openly flirt with me but i initially just chalked that up to her being playful and flirty. Except she kept up the flirting when we were alone, and everyime i stepped it up she would step it up herself.\n\nI asked her out, and weve had a casual sexual relationship for almost a month and a half. I was very open with my friend, his mom insisted on it and i dont want to hurt him.\n\nHe is completely put off by it, which i can understand, but at the same time everyone is an adult and can make their own choices. He orders me to stop seeing her and i refuse. He is now actively trying to get all of our friends to hate me and its been semi successful.\n\nEven if i stopped seeing his mom i dont believe he will let up with the smear campaign. Oddly enough this has actually driven me closer to his mom since im running out of friends.\n\nAITA in this situation even if i was upfront and honest with him?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the person who wrote the \"AITA\" post is in the wrong. The situation involves a 23-year-old having a casual sexual relationship with his friend's mom, who's 41. The friend is 20 and really upset, even starting a smear campaign against the author.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The main points are: the author was friends with his friend's family, the mom was flirting, they started a relationship after the author asked her out, and he told his friend upfront. The friend is upset, and the author is now facing social backlash.\n\nMoral and ethical aspects: Is it wrong to have a relationship with an ex-partner's parent? In many cultures, there's a taboo around relationships with someone close to a friend, especially a parent figure. Even if all parties are adults, the power dynamic might be an issue. The friend is still close to the mom, even though he's an adult now. \n\nLegal aspect: In some places, there might be laws about relationships between someone and a close relative of a friend, but I'm not sure. Probably not a legal issue, more social.\n\nEmotional impact: The friend is hurt, which is significant. The author might think he's being honest, but the friend's reaction is valid. Even if the author was upfront, the friend's trust is broken. The author is causing emotional distress to his friend, which is a problem.\n\nSocial consequences: The author is losing friends because of this, which he acknowledges. That's a negative outcome, but does that mean he's in the wrong? It's possible he's making a choice that's affecting others negatively, even if he believes he's right.\n\nThe author says everyone is an adult and can make their own choices. But the friend's mom was living with the friend, so maybe there's an ongoing relationship or dependency. The friend is 20, still young, and the mother's actions might have been influenced by her own emotional state after a divorce. The author's decision could be seen as taking advantage of a vulnerable situation.\n\nAlso, the fact that the author is getting closer to the mom as friends drift away might indicate he's prioritizing the relationship over his friend's feelings. Even if he's honest, the action itself might be morally questionable regardless of honesty.\n\nSo, putting it all together, even though the author was upfront, the act of starting a relationship with a friend's parent is likely seen as wrong in most social contexts. The friend's distress is valid, and the author might be overstepping social boundaries, even if legally it's allowed. Therefore, the answer is A.\n"
