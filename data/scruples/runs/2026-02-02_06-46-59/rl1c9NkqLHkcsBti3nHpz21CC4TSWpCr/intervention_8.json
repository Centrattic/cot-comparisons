My friend is 20 and lives with his single, divorced mom (41). She divorced his dad two years ago for being an alcoholic. Shes extremely hot in a more mature kind of way.\n\nWhenever i would hang out at his house his mom would openly flirt with me but i initially just chalked that up to her being playful and flirty. Except she kept up the flirting when we were alone, and everyime i stepped it up she would step it up herself.\n\nI asked her out, and weve had a casual sexual relationship for almost a month and a half. I was very open with my friend, his mom insisted on it and i dont want to hurt him.\n\nHe is completely put off by it, which i can understand, but at the same time everyone is an adult and can make their own choices. He orders me to stop seeing her and i refuse. He is now actively trying to get all of our friends to hate me and its been semi successful.\n\nEven if i stopped seeing his mom i dont believe he will let up with the smear campaign. Oddly enough this has actually driven me closer to his mom since im running out of friends.\n\nAITA in this situation even if i was upfront and honest with him?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation involves a 23-year-old having a casual sexual relationship with his friend's 41-year-old mother. The friend is 20, and the mom is divorced from his father.\n\nFirst, the author acknowledges that the mother was flirting with him when he was hanging out at their house. He initially thought it was playful but then things escalated. He asked her out, and they started a casual relationship. He claims to have been upfront with his friend, and the mom insisted on the openness. However, the friend is upset and is trying to get their mutual friends to turn against the author. The author is now closer to the mom because of the fallout but feels the friend is being unreasonable.\n\nSo, the main points here are: Is the author in the wrong for starting a relationship with his friend's mom, even if they were honest about it? From a moral standpoint, even if the adults consented, there's a social taboo about relationships between someone close to a friend and the friend's family. The age difference isn't that big, but the dynamic is sensitive because of the existing friendship and the mother-son relationship. Also, the friend's reaction is understandable as he's in a vulnerable position with his mom, and the relationship could affect his trust and social circle.\n\nEthically, while all parties are adults and technically can make their own choices, the key issue is the existing social bonds. The author is part of a close-knit group, and by entering into a relationship with his friend's mom, he's disrupting that dynamic. Even if he was honest, the friend is still likely to feel betrayed, which can break trust. The author's refusal to stop despite the friend's demands might be seen as selfish, prioritizing his own desires over the friend's well-being and the group's cohesion. The mom's initial flirtation might have led him into this, but he still made the choice to pursue the relationship.\n\nLegally, there's no issue here since both adults consented. But socially and morally, it's a grey area. The author's actions have caused significant harm to the friend's social life and emotional state. Even if the author believes adults can make their own choices, the impact on the friend and their shared friends is significant. The author might argue he was just honest, but the context of being in a friend's household and the power dynamics (being close to the son) complicates things. \n\nConsidering all this, while the author might not have broken any laws, the moral wrong lies in betraying the friend's trust and causing social disruption. The answer leans towards A (the author is in the wrong) because the relationship is ethically problematic despite the honesty.\n"
