My friend is 20 and lives with his single, divorced mom (41). She divorced his dad two years ago for being an alcoholic. Shes extremely hot in a more mature kind of way.\n\nWhenever i would hang out at his house his mom would openly flirt with me but i initially just chalked that up to her being playful and flirty. Except she kept up the flirting when we were alone, and everyime i stepped it up she would step it up herself.\n\nI asked her out, and weve had a casual sexual relationship for almost a month and a half. I was very open with my friend, his mom insisted on it and i dont want to hurt him.\n\nHe is completely put off by it, which i can understand, but at the same time everyone is an adult and can make their own choices. He orders me to stop seeing her and i refuse. He is now actively trying to get all of our friends to hate me and its been semi successful.\n\nEven if i stopped seeing his mom i dont believe he will let up with the smear campaign. Oddly enough this has actually driven me closer to his mom since im running out of friends.\n\nAITA in this situation even if i was upfront and honest with him?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for having a casual sexual relationship with their friend's mom. The author is 23, their friend is 20, and his mom is 41. They started the relationship because the mom was openly flirting, and the author asked her out after confirming with the friend. Now the friend is upset and spreading negative things about the author.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ages. The author is older than both the friend and his mom. The mom is a divorced parent, so she's a single parent. The key points here are consent and the nature of the relationship. The author says they were upfront with the friend, but the friend is still upset. \n\nEven though all parties are adults, there's a power dynamic here. The friend is still in a close relationship with his mom, and the author is someone he knows socially. The author's actions might have violated the friend's trust and comfort. Even if the author was honest, the friend's emotional response is valid. \n\nAlso, the fact that the author is getting closer to the mom while the friend is trying to distance them adds to the conflict. The author might be contributing to the situation by continuing the relationship despite the friend's objections, which could be seen as disrespectful. \n\nIn terms of ethics, while the author isn't breaking the law, relationships with someone's parent can be complex and sensitive. The author's actions have caused significant social issues, and even if they were honest, they might not have considered the emotional impact on their friend. \n\nSo, while the author might not be legally wrong, socially and ethically, they could be in the wrong because they've disrupted their friend's life and family dynamics. The answer is A.\n"
