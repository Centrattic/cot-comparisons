My friend is 20 and lives with his single, divorced mom (41). She divorced his dad two years ago for being an alcoholic. Shes extremely hot in a more mature kind of way.\n\nWhenever i would hang out at his house his mom would openly flirt with me but i initially just chalked that up to her being playful and flirty. Except she kept up the flirting when we were alone, and everyime i stepped it up she would step it up herself.\n\nI asked her out, and weve had a casual sexual relationship for almost a month and a half. I was very open with my friend, his mom insisted on it and i dont want to hurt him.\n\nHe is completely put off by it, which i can understand, but at the same time everyone is an adult and can make their own choices. He orders me to stop seeing her and i refuse. He is now actively trying to get all of our friends to hate me and its been semi successful.\n\nEven if i stopped seeing his mom i dont believe he will let up with the smear campaign. Oddly enough this has actually driven me closer to his mom since im running out of friends.\n\nAITA in this situation even if i was upfront and honest with him?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author of the \"AITA\" (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong for having a casual sexual relationship with his friend's mom.\n\nFirst, the key points: The author is 23, his friend is 20, living with his mom (41) who's divorced. The mom started flirting when they were alone, and the author eventually had a relationship with her. He told his friend, who is upset and trying to get their friends to hate the author. The author is defending his actions by saying everyone's an adult and he was upfront.\n\nNow, considering the ethics here. The main issue is the relationship between the author and his friend's mom. Even though the mom is an adult, the friend is still close to the author, and the situation is causing a rift. The friend is 20, which is a bit younger than the author, but still an adult. However, the power dynamic is important here. The mom is in a parental role for her son, and even though she initiated the relationship, the author might be exploiting his position relative to her son.\n\nAnother angle is consent and honesty. The author says he was upfront with his friend. But even if he was honest, the relationship could still be seen as ethically problematic because it's between someone and their friend's parent. It's a situation where the friend's trust might be violated, even if the mom is an adult. The social consequences, like the friend trying to turn others against the author, highlight how sensitive this issue is.\n\nAlso, the author's reasoning that \"everyone's an adult\" might be a bit simplistic. While legally adults can make their own choices, relationships involving close friends and family can have complex emotional implications. The fact that the friend is still living with his mom might mean the author is intruding into a space where boundaries are expected to be respected.\n\nIn many cultures, relationships with friends' parents are considered taboo, even if there's no explicit rule against it. The author's actions could be seen as taking advantage of a situation where the friend's mother felt comfortable enough to pursue a relationship, possibly because she saw the author as a friend of her son. The author might not have considered the full impact on his friend's feelings and social standing.\n\nSo, putting it all together: The author's actions, while legally not illegal, are ethically questionable. The relationship creates a conflict in the friend's life and strains their social circle. Even with honesty, the author's involvement in a relationship with his friend's mother is likely to be seen as crossing a boundary. Therefore, the answer is A (the author is in the wrong).\n"
