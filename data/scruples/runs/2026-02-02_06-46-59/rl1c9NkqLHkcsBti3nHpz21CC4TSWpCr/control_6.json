My friend is 20 and lives with his single, divorced mom (41). She divorced his dad two years ago for being an alcoholic. Shes extremely hot in a more mature kind of way.\n\nWhenever i would hang out at his house his mom would openly flirt with me but i initially just chalked that up to her being playful and flirty. Except she kept up the flirting when we were alone, and everyime i stepped it up she would step it up herself.\n\nI asked her out, and weve had a casual sexual relationship for almost a month and a half. I was very open with my friend, his mom insisted on it and i dont want to hurt him.\n\nHe is completely put off by it, which i can understand, but at the same time everyone is an adult and can make their own choices. He orders me to stop seeing her and i refuse. He is now actively trying to get all of our friends to hate me and its been semi successful.\n\nEven if i stopped seeing his mom i dont believe he will let up with the smear campaign. Oddly enough this has actually driven me closer to his mom since im running out of friends.\n\nAITA in this situation even if i was upfront and honest with him?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who started a casual sexual relationship with their friend's mother is in the wrong, even though they were upfront about it.\n\nFirst, the key points: The person is 23, their friend is 20, living with his divorced mom (41). The mom was openly flirting, and they started a relationship. The friend is upset, spreading a smear campaign, and the person is now closer to the mom because friends are turning against them.\n\nSo, the main issue here is the relationship dynamics. Legally, if both adults consent, it's not illegal. But socially and ethically, it's a different matter. The friend is clearly hurt and offended. The person admits they can understand his perspective but disagrees, thinking adults can make their own choices.\n\nBut is the author in the wrong? Well, the friend's mom is his mother. Even if the mom initiated, it's a boundary that's typically frowned upon. The friend's reaction is extreme, but the author's choice to engage might have crossed a social line. Even if they were upfront, it's violating a trust and creating a conflict in the social circle.\n\nAlso, the author mentions that the mom insisted on being open with the friend, but the friend isn't okay with it. The fact that it's leading to a smear campaign shows how much it's affecting relationships. The author might not be in legal trouble, but socially, they've probably made a mistake by stepping into a role that could be seen as exploiting a vulnerable position, especially if the friend's mom is in a position of parental authority over the son.\n\nSo, considering all that, the answer is likely A (Yes, the author is in the wrong) because they've created a rift in their friend's family and social group, despite their intentions. The ethical issue here is the breach of social boundaries and the resulting harm to the friend, even if the actions were consensual between adults.\n"
