My friend is 20 and lives with his single, divorced mom (41). She divorced his dad two years ago for being an alcoholic. Shes extremely hot in a more mature kind of way.\n\nWhenever i would hang out at his house his mom would openly flirt with me but i initially just chalked that up to her being playful and flirty. Except she kept up the flirting when we were alone, and everyime i stepped it up she would step it up herself.\n\nI asked her out, and weve had a casual sexual relationship for almost a month and a half. I was very open with my friend, his mom insisted on it and i dont want to hurt him.\n\nHe is completely put off by it, which i can understand, but at the same time everyone is an adult and can make their own choices. He orders me to stop seeing her and i refuse. He is now actively trying to get all of our friends to hate me and its been semi successful.\n\nEven if i stopped seeing his mom i dont believe he will let up with the smear campaign. Oddly enough this has actually driven me closer to his mom since im running out of friends.\n\nAITA in this situation even if i was upfront and honest with him?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation involves a 23-year-old having a casual sexual relationship with his friend's 41-year-old mom. The friend is 20 and upset, and the mom initiated the flirting. The author says they were upfront with the friend, but the friend is now trying to get others to hate him.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ages. The author is 23, the friend is 20. The mom is 41. Legally, in most places, both the author and the mom are adults, so there's no underage issue here. However, there's a power dynamic because the author is in a social circle where the friend's mom is a parent figure. That might affect the perception of consent and appropriateness, even if both adults are consenting.\n\nNext, the friend is 20, still relatively young, and the author acknowledges that the friend is hurt. The author was upfront with the friend, but the friend is now spreading a smear campaign. The author feels they're in the right because everyone is an adult, but the friend's reaction is understandable given the relationship dynamics.\n\nEthically, while the author and the mom might be consenting adults, the relationship is with someone who is the mother of the author's friend. This creates a conflict of interest in their social circle. Even if the author was honest, the friend's distress is valid. Relationships like this often lead to complications, especially when they involve family members of friends. The author's insistence on continuing despite the friend's disapproval might be seen as disregarding the friend's feelings, which could damage friendships and the social group.\n\nAlso, the fact that the author is now closer to the mom while losing friends might indicate that the author is prioritizing the relationship over maintaining the friendship, which could be seen as a poor choice. Even if legally okay, socially and morally, it's questionable. The friend's mom initiating the relationship might not absolve the author, because the author could have considered the impact on the friend.\n\nSo, while there's no legal wrong, the ethical and social implications are significant. The author's actions are causing harm to the friend's well-being and the social group. Therefore, it's likely that the author is in the wrong from an ethical standpoint.\n"
