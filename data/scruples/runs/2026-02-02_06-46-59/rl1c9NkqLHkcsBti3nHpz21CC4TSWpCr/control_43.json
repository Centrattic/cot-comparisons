My friend is 20 and lives with his single, divorced mom (41). She divorced his dad two years ago for being an alcoholic. Shes extremely hot in a more mature kind of way.\n\nWhenever i would hang out at his house his mom would openly flirt with me but i initially just chalked that up to her being playful and flirty. Except she kept up the flirting when we were alone, and everyime i stepped it up she would step it up herself.\n\nI asked her out, and weve had a casual sexual relationship for almost a month and a half. I was very open with my friend, his mom insisted on it and i dont want to hurt him.\n\nHe is completely put off by it, which i can understand, but at the same time everyone is an adult and can make their own choices. He orders me to stop seeing her and i refuse. He is now actively trying to get all of our friends to hate me and its been semi successful.\n\nEven if i stopped seeing his mom i dont believe he will let up with the smear campaign. Oddly enough this has actually driven me closer to his mom since im running out of friends.\n\nAITA in this situation even if i was upfront and honest with him?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who started a casual sexual relationship with his friend's mom is in the wrong. The situation involves multiple layers: the ages of the people involved, the dynamics between the individuals, and the impact on social relationships.\n\nFirst, the ages: the author is 23, the friend is 20, and the mother is 41. The mother is divorced and the friend's father was an alcoholic. The mother started flirting with the author when he visited the house. The author initially thought it was playful, but it escalated. He asked her out, and they've been in a casual relationship for a month and a half. He was upfront with his friend, but the friend is upset, leading to social issues and a smear campaign by the friend.\n\nNow, considering the ethical aspects. Even though the author was upfront, the core issue is the relationship between an adult and someone who is part of a friend's family. The friend is 20, and the mother is his caregiver. There's a power dynamic here because the mother is in a parental role, even if she's not a direct parent to the author. There's also the potential for emotional harm to the friend, who is still living with his mother. The author's actions could be seen as taking advantage of a vulnerable situation, especially if the mother's flirtatious behavior was influenced by her role as a parent. \n\nAnother angle is the social impact. The friend is actively trying to isolate the author, which is a problem, but the author's actions have caused this rift. Even if the author is honest, the relationship is inherently problematic because it involves someone in a parental role. There's also the question of consent and whether the mother was genuinely making her own choice without any pressure from her son's absence or emotional dependency.\n\nLegally, all parties are adults, so there's no legal issue. But ethically, the situation is more complex. The author might not be legally wrong, but socially and morally, he's in a tough spot. The key here is the role of the mother in the friend's life. Even if the mother initiated the relationship, the fact that she's the mother figure of someone close to the author adds layers of complexity. It's not just about the two adults involved but also the impact on the friend and the broader social circle.\n\nIn many cultures, relationships with someone's parent, especially when there's a close friendship with the child, are considered taboo. This can lead to social ostracization, as seen in the friend's reaction. The author might be in the right in terms of honesty, but the act itself is ethically questionable due to the potential for exploitation and the disruption it causes in the friend's life.\n\nSo, considering all these factors, the author is likely in the wrong. The relationship, regardless of being consensual, creates a conflict of interest and potential harm to the friend. The mother's role as a parent figure, even if she's divorced, still places her in a position of care over her son. The author's persistence despite the friend's objections and the resulting social fallout suggests that his actions are causing more harm than he's accounting for.\n"
