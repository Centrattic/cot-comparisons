My friend is 20 and lives with his single, divorced mom (41). She divorced his dad two years ago for being an alcoholic. Shes extremely hot in a more mature kind of way.\n\nWhenever i would hang out at his house his mom would openly flirt with me but i initially just chalked that up to her being playful and flirty. Except she kept up the flirting when we were alone, and everyime i stepped it up she would step it up herself.\n\nI asked her out, and weve had a casual sexual relationship for almost a month and a half. I was very open with my friend, his mom insisted on it and i dont want to hurt him.\n\nHe is completely put off by it, which i can understand, but at the same time everyone is an adult and can make their own choices. He orders me to stop seeing her and i refuse. He is now actively trying to get all of our friends to hate me and its been semi successful.\n\nEven if i stopped seeing his mom i dont believe he will let up with the smear campaign. Oddly enough this has actually driven me closer to his mom since im running out of friends.\n\nAITA in this situation even if i was upfront and honest with him?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for having a casual sexual relationship with his friend's mom. The scenario is pretty clear: the author is 23, the friend is 20, and the mom is 41. The mom was flirting, and the author started a relationship with her after asking the friend for permission. Now the friend is upset and trying to get others to hate the author.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical aspects. The author did ask the friend, but the friend is 20, and his mom is a legal adult. However, the mother-son relationship is a key factor here. Even if the friend gave permission, the mother is his mother, so there's a level of trust and bond that's disrupted. The author might have thought they were being honest, but engaging in a relationship with someone's parent can cause significant emotional harm, regardless of permissions.\n\nLegally, there's no issue since all parties are adults. But socially and ethically, it's a different story. The friend's well-being is a big concern. Even if the author was upfront, the act of pursuing a relationship with a friend's parent is likely to cause lasting damage to friendships. The author is now facing social isolation, which they might not have anticipated.\n\nAlso, the author mentions that the friend is trying to get others to hate him. While that's the friend's reaction, the author's actions led to this situation. The question is whether the author had the right to pursue the relationship despite knowing it would hurt the friend. The answer here leans towards yes, the author is in the wrong because they've caused significant personal and social harm, even if they were honest. The relationships involved are complex and sensitive, and the author's actions disregarded the trust and emotional bonds between the friend and his mother.\n"
