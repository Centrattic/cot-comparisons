My friend is 20 and lives with his single, divorced mom (41). She divorced his dad two years ago for being an alcoholic. Shes extremely hot in a more mature kind of way.\n\nWhenever i would hang out at his house his mom would openly flirt with me but i initially just chalked that up to her being playful and flirty. Except she kept up the flirting when we were alone, and everyime i stepped it up she would step it up herself.\n\nI asked her out, and weve had a casual sexual relationship for almost a month and a half. I was very open with my friend, his mom insisted on it and i dont want to hurt him.\n\nHe is completely put off by it, which i can understand, but at the same time everyone is an adult and can make their own choices. He orders me to stop seeing her and i refuse. He is now actively trying to get all of our friends to hate me and its been semi successful.\n\nEven if i stopped seeing his mom i dont believe he will let up with the smear campaign. Oddly enough this has actually driven me closer to his mom since im running out of friends.\n\nAITA in this situation even if i was upfront and honest with him?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation involves a 23-year-old who's in a casual sexual relationship with his friend's mom, who is 41. The friend is 20 and upset because the author started this relationship even though they were upfront about it. The friend is now trying to get their mutual friends to turn against the author.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points here. The author was friends with the younger guy, and the mom was flirting with him. The author asked the mom out, and they had a casual relationship. They told the friend, as the mom insisted. The friend is upset, and the author is now facing social consequences. The question is whether the author is in the wrong despite their honesty.\n\nSo, the main ethical issues here are about boundaries, consent, and the impact on the friend. The author is an adult, as is the mom. Legally, both are adults, so there's no underage issue. However, the relationship involves a parent figure of a close friend, which adds a layer of complexity. Even if the author was honest with the friend, the act itself could be seen as crossing a social boundary, especially since the friend lives with his mom. The mother's role in the household might make the situation more delicate, as she's the caregiver for her son, even though he's an adult.\n\nFrom a moral standpoint, even if consent is mutual between the author and the mom, the relationship could be considered inappropriate because it's between someone and a parent of a close friend. The friend's reaction is understandable because it's a breach of trust and could be seen as taking advantage of a position of familiarity. The author's decision to continue the relationship despite the friend's anger and subsequent social isolation might be viewed as selfish. Even if the author was upfront, the consequences on the friend's life and their social circle are significant. The author's argument that everyone is an adult and can make their own choices doesn't fully address the emotional impact on the friend and the possible exploitation of the mother's position.\n\nAdditionally, the fact that the mother was the one initiating the flirtation might not absolve the author of responsibility, as they were aware of the context and the potential impact on their friend. The author's insistence on continuing the relationship despite the friend's objections shows a disregard for the friend's feelings, which can be seen as inconsiderate.\n\nSo, considering all these factors, the author's actions, while not illegal, are ethically questionable. The answer would be A, the author is in the wrong because they disregarded their friend's boundaries and caused significant harm to the social dynamic, even if they were honest about the relationship.\n"
