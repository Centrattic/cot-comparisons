My friend is 20 and lives with his single, divorced mom (41). She divorced his dad two years ago for being an alcoholic. Shes extremely hot in a more mature kind of way.\n\nWhenever i would hang out at his house his mom would openly flirt with me but i initially just chalked that up to her being playful and flirty. Except she kept up the flirting when we were alone, and everyime i stepped it up she would step it up herself.\n\nI asked her out, and weve had a casual sexual relationship for almost a month and a half. I was very open with my friend, his mom insisted on it and i dont want to hurt him.\n\nHe is completely put off by it, which i can understand, but at the same time everyone is an adult and can make their own choices. He orders me to stop seeing her and i refuse. He is now actively trying to get all of our friends to hate me and its been semi successful.\n\nEven if i stopped seeing his mom i dont believe he will let up with the smear campaign. Oddly enough this has actually driven me closer to his mom since im running out of friends.\n\nAITA in this situation even if i was upfront and honest with him?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong. The situation involves a 23-year-old having a casual sexual relationship with his friend's 41-year-old mom, which has caused a rift in their friendship and social circle.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key elements here. The author is in a relationship with the mother of his 20-year-old friend. The friend is upset and has ordered the author to stop, leading to a smear campaign. The author claims he was upfront with the friend about the relationship, but the friend is still upset.\n\nMoral and social norms play a big role here. Even though all parties are adults, relationships between someone and a close friend's parent can be seen as taboo. There's a dynamic where the mother and son have a dependent relationship, so involving the mother in a romantic way might be considered inappropriate, regardless of consent.\n\nAlso, the author mentions that the friend's mom was flirting and they escalated things. But the fact that the author pursued a relationship with his friend's mother, even if the mother was interested, could be seen as taking advantage of a situation where the friend is still emotionally connected to his mother. The mother being a parent figure adds another layer, even if she's divorced and living separately.\n\nThe author's justification is that everyone's an adult and can make their own choices. However, social contexts matter. The friendship between the author and the 20-year-old is significant here. The author's actions have caused the friend to distance himself and spread negative information, which complicates things. The author might be in the wrong because he's disrupting his friend's life and causing emotional harm, even if the relationship isn't illegal.\n\nAnother angle is the power dynamic. The mother is in a position of authority as a parent, even if not living with her son. The son (20) is still in a dependent relationship with his mom, so pursuing a relationship with her could be seen as exploiting that dynamic. Even if the mother is willing, the son's age and the fact that he's still in a parental relationship might make this ethically problematic.\n\nAlso, the author's decision to involve himself in a relationship that's causing such a rift in the friend group suggests that he may not have considered the emotional impact beyond just the consensual aspect. While consent is important, social and familial boundaries are also crucial. The fact that the friend is now actively trying to turn others against the author shows the severity of the situation, which the author might have underestimated.\n\nIn conclusion, while the relationship itself is consensual between two adults, the context of the mother being a close friend's parent and the resulting friendship breakdown likely places the author in the wrong. The ethical considerations around family dynamics and friendship loyalty outweigh the purely consensual act in this case.\n"
