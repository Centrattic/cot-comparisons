My friend is 20 and lives with his single, divorced mom (41). She divorced his dad two years ago for being an alcoholic. Shes extremely hot in a more mature kind of way.\n\nWhenever i would hang out at his house his mom would openly flirt with me but i initially just chalked that up to her being playful and flirty. Except she kept up the flirting when we were alone, and everyime i stepped it up she would step it up herself.\n\nI asked her out, and weve had a casual sexual relationship for almost a month and a half. I was very open with my friend, his mom insisted on it and i dont want to hurt him.\n\nHe is completely put off by it, which i can understand, but at the same time everyone is an adult and can make their own choices. He orders me to stop seeing her and i refuse. He is now actively trying to get all of our friends to hate me and its been semi successful.\n\nEven if i stopped seeing his mom i dont believe he will let up with the smear campaign. Oddly enough this has actually driven me closer to his mom since im running out of friends.\n\nAITA in this situation even if i was upfront and honest with him?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is that a 23-year-old had a casual relationship with his friend's mom, who's 41. The friend is 20 and is upset, leading to social issues.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical aspects. The author claims he was upfront with the friend, which might mitigate some blame, but the friend is still hurt. Even if everyone is an adult, the relationship involves a family member of a close friend, which can be problematic. The mother was the one initiating the flirtation, but that doesn't necessarily excuse the author's actions. The dynamic here is complicated because the friend might feel betrayed, even if the author didn't know initially. \n\nThen there's the aspect of consent and maturity. The mother is an adult, so from a legal standpoint, it's okay. But socially and emotionally, it's a mess. The author's continued refusal to stop despite the friend's objections shows a lack of consideration for the friend's feelings. The friend is trying to protect his mom's relationship with her son, so the author's actions are causing significant harm to the friend's social circle and mental well-being. \n\nAlso, the author's attitude that \"everyone is an adult\" might be too dismissive of the emotional impact. The fact that the friend is actively trying to get others to hate him shows how broken the trust is. The author might not see it as wrong because he's focusing on the adults involved, but the real issue is the breach of trust and the effect on the friend. \n\nSo, putting it all together, even if the author was honest, the relationship is causing significant harm to the friend. The author's actions are ethically questionable because they disregard the friend's emotional state and social well-being. Therefore, the author is likely in the wrong here.\n"
