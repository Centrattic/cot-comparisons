My friend is 20 and lives with his single, divorced mom (41). She divorced his dad two years ago for being an alcoholic. Shes extremely hot in a more mature kind of way.\n\nWhenever i would hang out at his house his mom would openly flirt with me but i initially just chalked that up to her being playful and flirty. Except she kept up the flirting when we were alone, and everyime i stepped it up she would step it up herself.\n\nI asked her out, and weve had a casual sexual relationship for almost a month and a half. I was very open with my friend, his mom insisted on it and i dont want to hurt him.\n\nHe is completely put off by it, which i can understand, but at the same time everyone is an adult and can make their own choices. He orders me to stop seeing her and i refuse. He is now actively trying to get all of our friends to hate me and its been semi successful.\n\nEven if i stopped seeing his mom i dont believe he will let up with the smear campaign. Oddly enough this has actually driven me closer to his mom since im running out of friends.\n\nAITA in this situation even if i was upfront and honest with him?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for having a casual sexual relationship with his friend's mom. The situation is a bit complicated.\n\nFirst, the author is 23, the friend is 20, and the mom is 41. The friend's mom is divorced, and there's been a lot of flirting from her side. The author thought it was playful at first but then realized it was more serious. They started a relationship after the author asked her out, and he was honest with the friend. Now the friend is upset and trying to get others to hate the author.\n\nSo, the main question is whether the author is in the wrong. Let's break it down. Legally, they're all adults, so the relationship itself isn't illegal. But socially, there's a lot of taboo around relationships between someone and their partner's or ex-partner's parent. The friend is the child of the mother, so there's a mother-son dynamic here. Even if the mother is divorced, the son still has a relationship with her. The author is essentially forming a relationship with the mother, which the son finds unacceptable. \n\nThe author claims to be upfront, but the son is still upset. The author might argue that since everyone is an adult, they should make their own choices. However, the son's feelings and the potential impact on his relationship with his mom are significant. The mother might have a duty to consider her son's feelings, but she's choosing to be with the author. The author's role here is complicated because he's part of the son's social circle, which creates tension.\n\nAnother angle is consent and honesty. The author says they were open with the friend, but maybe the friend felt betrayed even if informed. The mother's actions in pursuing the author when he was already part of her son's life could be seen as taking advantage of her position. The author might not be directly at fault for the mother's actions, but by engaging in the relationship, he's contributed to the conflict.\n\nAlso, the author's decision to continue the relationship despite the son's anger shows he's aware of the social repercussions but chooses to ignore them. The fact that the son is trying to turn friends against him suggests the author's actions have caused real harm to the social group. The author might not be in legal trouble, but socially, he's in a very contentious position.\n\nIn terms of ethics, relationships with in-laws or step-parents can be tricky. Even if everyone consents, the power dynamic and existing family ties can create complex issues. The author might not be the sole wrongdoer, but he's definitely part of a problematic situation. The mother's role is also important here; she could be seen as the instigator, but the author's participation makes him complicit.\n\nSo, considering all these factors, even though the author was upfront, the situation involves a mother-son relationship and the son's emotional distress. The author's actions have caused significant disruption, so he's likely in the wrong from a social and ethical standpoint, even if not legally.\n"
