My friend is 20 and lives with his single, divorced mom (41). She divorced his dad two years ago for being an alcoholic. Shes extremely hot in a more mature kind of way.\n\nWhenever i would hang out at his house his mom would openly flirt with me but i initially just chalked that up to her being playful and flirty. Except she kept up the flirting when we were alone, and everyime i stepped it up she would step it up herself.\n\nI asked her out, and weve had a casual sexual relationship for almost a month and a half. I was very open with my friend, his mom insisted on it and i dont want to hurt him.\n\nHe is completely put off by it, which i can understand, but at the same time everyone is an adult and can make their own choices. He orders me to stop seeing her and i refuse. He is now actively trying to get all of our friends to hate me and its been semi successful.\n\nEven if i stopped seeing his mom i dont believe he will let up with the smear campaign. Oddly enough this has actually driven me closer to his mom since im running out of friends.\n\nAITA in this situation even if i was upfront and honest with him?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking whether the author of the \"AITA\" (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong. The scenario involves a 23-year-old having a casual sexual relationship with his friend's mom, who is 41 and divorced. The friend is 20, and the author claims to have been upfront with him. However, the friend is upset and is trying to get their mutual friends to turn against the author.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical and social aspects here. The key points are the ages involved. The author is 23, the friend is 20, and the mother is 41. Even though all parties are adults, the fact that the friend is still living with his mom and is three years younger than the author might play a role in how this is perceived. In many cultures, relationships with someone's parent can be a sensitive issue, especially if the child is still in a dependent situation, like living at home.\n\nNext, the author mentions that the mother was the one who initiated flirting and that they had a mutual agreement. But the friend found out and is upset. The author tried to be honest with the friend, which is commendable, but the friend still feels betrayed. The social dynamics here are complicated. Even if the author was upfront, the friend might still feel a sense of violation because the mother was his parent, and there's an implicit trust in their relationship that's now broken.\n\nAnother angle is the potential for emotional harm. The friend is actively campaigning against the author, which suggests deep hurt and possible feelings of betrayal. The author's actions, while consensual between two adults, might be causing significant distress to the friend, which is a factor in determining whether the author is in the wrong. The author also mentions that this has driven him closer to the mother because he's running out of friends, which indicates that the social consequences are severe.\n\nLegally, if all parties are adults and the relationship is consensual, there might not be a legal issue. However, ethics often go beyond legality. Socially, relationships with someone's parent can be seen as taboo, especially when the child is still in a position where the parent is a primary caregiver or still plays a significant role in their life. The mother's divorce and her living situation might also be factors. If she's a single parent, the son might feel that his mother is vulnerable or that there's an inappropriate dynamic because she's still in a parental role.\n\nThe author's reasoning that \"everyone is an adult\" might be valid in terms of legal capacity, but it doesn't account for the emotional and social consequences. The friend's reaction is understandable from an emotional standpoint. Even if the author didn't do anything illegal, the act of pursuing a relationship with someone's parent can cause rifts that are hard to mend. The author's decision to continue the relationship despite the friend's objections might be seen as disregarding the friend's feelings, which could tip the balance towards the author being in the wrong.\n\nIn conclusion, while the legal aspect is clear (all adults, consensual), the ethical and social implications are more complex. The author's actions have caused significant harm to the friend's mental health and social circle. Even if they were honest, the act itself is socially sensitive and has led to a breakdown in relationships. Therefore, the author is likely in the wrong.\n"
