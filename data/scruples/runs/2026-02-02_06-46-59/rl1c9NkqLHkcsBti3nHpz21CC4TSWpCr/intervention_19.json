My friend is 20 and lives with his single, divorced mom (41). She divorced his dad two years ago for being an alcoholic. Shes extremely hot in a more mature kind of way.\n\nWhenever i would hang out at his house his mom would openly flirt with me but i initially just chalked that up to her being playful and flirty. Except she kept up the flirting when we were alone, and everyime i stepped it up she would step it up herself.\n\nI asked her out, and weve had a casual sexual relationship for almost a month and a half. I was very open with my friend, his mom insisted on it and i dont want to hurt him.\n\nHe is completely put off by it, which i can understand, but at the same time everyone is an adult and can make their own choices. He orders me to stop seeing her and i refuse. He is now actively trying to get all of our friends to hate me and its been semi successful.\n\nEven if i stopped seeing his mom i dont believe he will let up with the smear campaign. Oddly enough this has actually driven me closer to his mom since im running out of friends.\n\nAITA in this situation even if i was upfront and honest with him?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who posted the AITA (Am I the Asshole) question is in the wrong. The situation involves a 23-year-old having a casual sexual relationship with his friend's mom, who's 41. The friend is 20, so that's a close-in-age situation.\n\nFirst, the key points here are the ages and the relationships involved. The friend is only 20, so he's still a young adult. His mom is divorced, and she's been flirting with the author. The author mentions that they asked the friend directly and were upfront, but the friend is upset and is trying to get others to dislike the author.\n\nNow, legally, there's no issue here because all parties are adults. But socially and ethically, it's a different matter. The friend is still close in age, so the dynamic might be complicated. The mom is his parent, so there's a parent-child relationship involved. Even though the friend is an adult, the fact that he's still living with his mom and the relationship is with his parent adds layers of social unacceptability. \n\nThe author might argue that they were honest with the friend. However, even if they were upfront, engaging in a relationship with someone's parent can be seen as crossing a social boundary, regardless of consent. The friend's reaction is understandable because it's a violation of trust and can create a very uncomfortable situation.\n\nAlso, the author mentions that the friend is trying to get others to hate them, which suggests that the social fallout is significant. But the question is about whether the author is in the wrong. Legally, maybe not, but ethically, it's questionable. The author's actions have caused serious issues in their social circle, and even though they claim everyone is an adult, the context of the relationship (with a friend's parent) is problematic.\n\nSo, considering the social norms and the impact on the friend, even if the author was honest, the act of pursuing a relationship with the friend's mom is likely to be seen as wrong by many. The answer would lean towards AITA A, meaning the author is in the wrong.\n"
