My friend is 20 and lives with his single, divorced mom (41). She divorced his dad two years ago for being an alcoholic. Shes extremely hot in a more mature kind of way.\n\nWhenever i would hang out at his house his mom would openly flirt with me but i initially just chalked that up to her being playful and flirty. Except she kept up the flirting when we were alone, and everyime i stepped it up she would step it up herself.\n\nI asked her out, and weve had a casual sexual relationship for almost a month and a half. I was very open with my friend, his mom insisted on it and i dont want to hurt him.\n\nHe is completely put off by it, which i can understand, but at the same time everyone is an adult and can make their own choices. He orders me to stop seeing her and i refuse. He is now actively trying to get all of our friends to hate me and its been semi successful.\n\nEven if i stopped seeing his mom i dont believe he will let up with the smear campaign. Oddly enough this has actually driven me closer to his mom since im running out of friends.\n\nAITA in this situation even if i was upfront and honest with him?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. So the user is asking if the person who started the relationship with his friend's mom is in the wrong. The scenario is pretty clear: he's 23, his friend is 20, and the mom is 41. They started a casual sexual relationship after she flirted with him, and now the friend is upset and trying to get others to hate him.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the age of consent. In most places, the age of consent is 16 or 18, so 23 and 41 are both adults. Legally, that's okay. But there's the aspect of the friend's mom living with her son. Even though the mom is divorced, she's still his stepmother? Wait, the friend's mom is divorced from his dad, so the user is not related to her by marriage. So there's no legal incest issue here. But socially, it's still a touchy situation because it's the mother of someone he's friends with.\n\nThe user said he was upfront with the friend. The friend is upset, which is understandable. The friend is 20, so maybe he's still in school or not fully independent. The mom might have a power dynamic here, being the parent figure. Even if she's divorced, she might have some influence over her son's life, which could make the relationship seem exploitative, especially if the mom is in a position to affect his well-being.\n\nAlso, the user mentions that the friend is trying to start a smear campaign. The user's response is to continue the relationship and distance himself from the friend. The question is whether the user is in the wrong despite being honest. \n\nFrom a moral standpoint, relationships between someone and a parent figure of a close friend can be problematic. The friend's trust has been broken, and the user might be seen as taking advantage of a situation where the friend is more vulnerable. Even if everyone is an adult, the social dynamics and potential for hurt feelings are significant. The user's actions have caused a rift in the friend group, which is a consequence he's willing to face, but that doesn't necessarily make it right.\n\nI think the key points here are the emotional impact on the friend, the power dynamic between the mom and her son, and the social consequences. Even if the user was honest, the act of pursuing a relationship with the friend's mom could be seen as crossing a boundary. So, the answer would likely be that the user is in the wrong (A).\n"
