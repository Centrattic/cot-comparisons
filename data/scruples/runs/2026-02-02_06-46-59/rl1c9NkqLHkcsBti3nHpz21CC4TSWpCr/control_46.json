My friend is 20 and lives with his single, divorced mom (41). She divorced his dad two years ago for being an alcoholic. Shes extremely hot in a more mature kind of way.\n\nWhenever i would hang out at his house his mom would openly flirt with me but i initially just chalked that up to her being playful and flirty. Except she kept up the flirting when we were alone, and everyime i stepped it up she would step it up herself.\n\nI asked her out, and weve had a casual sexual relationship for almost a month and a half. I was very open with my friend, his mom insisted on it and i dont want to hurt him.\n\nHe is completely put off by it, which i can understand, but at the same time everyone is an adult and can make their own choices. He orders me to stop seeing her and i refuse. He is now actively trying to get all of our friends to hate me and its been semi successful.\n\nEven if i stopped seeing his mom i dont believe he will let up with the smear campaign. Oddly enough this has actually driven me closer to his mom since im running out of friends.\n\nAITA in this situation even if i was upfront and honest with him?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so the user is asking if the person who wrote the \"Am I the Asshole\" (AITA) post is in the wrong. Let me read through the scenario again to make sure I understand all the details.\n\nThe author is 23, their friend is 20 and lives with his divorced mom who is 41. The mom and the author started a casual sexual relationship after some flirting. The friend found out and is upset, even trying to get their mutual friends to turn against the author. The author is defending their actions by saying they were upfront and that everyone is an adult. The question is whether the author is in the wrong.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key factors here. The main issue is the relationship between the author and the friend's mother. The friend is 20, so technically underage in some places (if the legal age is 21, for example). But the author is 23, which is an adult. However, the mother is 41, so she's also an adult. The problem here is the dynamic of the relationship and the potential for conflict of interest given the friend's proximity.\n\nThe friend is upset because his mother is involved with someone he's close to. The author claims they told the friend, which might have been a mistake because it could have been done in a way that was hurtful or without considering the friend's feelings. The friend is now trying to ostracize the author, but that doesn't justify the author's actions.\n\nI should think about the ethical implications. Even though all parties are adults, the mother is in a position that could be seen as authority or a parental figure to the friend, which complicates things. Relationships with someone close to a family member can lead to social and emotional consequences, as seen here.\n\nThe author's justification is that they were honest and that adults can make their own choices. However, honesty doesn't necessarily excuse the impact on others, especially the friend who is directly affected. The fact that the author pursued the relationship despite knowing the potential fallout shows a lack of consideration for the friend's feelings and the existing social dynamics.\n\nIn many cases, relationships with someone's parent can be problematic because it disrupts the family unit and the friend's relationship with their mother. The author might not have considered how this would affect their friendship and the trust involved. Even if the friend's mom is consenting, the author's actions could be seen as taking advantage of a situation where the friend is vulnerable, especially after a difficult divorce.\n\nAnother angle is whether the mother initiated the flirting or if the author crossed boundaries. The author mentions that the mother was openly flirtatious and stepped things up when the author did, but that doesn't absolve the author of responsibility. The key is that the author chose to act on the flirting despite knowing the friend's close relationship with his mother.\n\nIn terms of societal norms and expectations, people often frown upon relationships that involve someone close to a friend's family. While it's not illegal, it's considered socially unacceptable in many circles because of the potential for harm. The author's actions led to the friend's social circle turning against them, which is a consequence of their decision.\n\nSo, putting it all together, even though the author was honest, the relationship created significant conflict and hurt. The author didn't consider the friend's perspective and the natural bond between a son and his mother. The decision to pursue the relationship shows a lack of empathy and foresight regarding the consequences. Therefore, the author is in the wrong.\n"
