My friend is 20 and lives with his single, divorced mom (41). She divorced his dad two years ago for being an alcoholic. Shes extremely hot in a more mature kind of way.\n\nWhenever i would hang out at his house his mom would openly flirt with me but i initially just chalked that up to her being playful and flirty. Except she kept up the flirting when we were alone, and everyime i stepped it up she would step it up herself.\n\nI asked her out, and weve had a casual sexual relationship for almost a month and a half. I was very open with my friend, his mom insisted on it and i dont want to hurt him.\n\nHe is completely put off by it, which i can understand, but at the same time everyone is an adult and can make their own choices. He orders me to stop seeing her and i refuse. He is now actively trying to get all of our friends to hate me and its been semi successful.\n\nEven if i stopped seeing his mom i dont believe he will let up with the smear campaign. Oddly enough this has actually driven me closer to his mom since im running out of friends.\n\nAITA in this situation even if i was upfront and honest with him?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person in the scenario is in the wrong. The situation involves a 23-year-old having a casual sexual relationship with his friend's mom, who's 41. The friend is 20, and he's upset, leading to social issues.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The author was upfront with the friend, but the friend is still upset. The mother was flirting first, and the author took it further. The question is whether the author is at fault despite being honest.\n\nLegally, all parties are adults, so there's no legal issue. But morally and socially, it's more complex. The friend might feel betrayed, which is valid. Even if the author was honest, the relationship could still cause harm to the friend. The mother's actions might be questionable too, as she's in a position that could be seen as taking advantage of her son's friendship with the author.\n\nThe author mentions that the mother insisted on being upfront, so maybe the mother had a role in complicating things. However, the author's choice to pursue the relationship despite knowing the potential impact on the friend could be seen as selfish. Even with consent, relationships with someone's parent can be ethically tricky, especially when the child is a close friend.\n\nThe author is causing distress to the friend, leading to a smear campaign. The author's response is to continue the relationship and feel closer to the mother, which might not address the friend's feelings. So, while there's no legal fault, the social and emotional impact suggests the author is in the wrong because they disregarded their friend's feelings and caused significant harm to their social circle.\n"
