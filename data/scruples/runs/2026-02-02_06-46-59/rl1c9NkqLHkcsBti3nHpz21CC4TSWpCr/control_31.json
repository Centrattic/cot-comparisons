My friend is 20 and lives with his single, divorced mom (41). She divorced his dad two years ago for being an alcoholic. Shes extremely hot in a more mature kind of way.\n\nWhenever i would hang out at his house his mom would openly flirt with me but i initially just chalked that up to her being playful and flirty. Except she kept up the flirting when we were alone, and everyime i stepped it up she would step it up herself.\n\nI asked her out, and weve had a casual sexual relationship for almost a month and a half. I was very open with my friend, his mom insisted on it and i dont want to hurt him.\n\nHe is completely put off by it, which i can understand, but at the same time everyone is an adult and can make their own choices. He orders me to stop seeing her and i refuse. He is now actively trying to get all of our friends to hate me and its been semi successful.\n\nEven if i stopped seeing his mom i dont believe he will let up with the smear campaign. Oddly enough this has actually driven me closer to his mom since im running out of friends.\n\nAITA in this situation even if i was upfront and honest with him?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. Let's see. The situation is that he's 23, his friend is 20, and the friend's mom is 41. They have a casual sexual relationship after she started flirting with him. He was upfront with his friend, but the friend is upset and trying to get others to hate him. The question is whether the author is in the wrong.\n\nFirst, I should consider the age aspect. The author is 23, the mom is 41. So there's a 20-year age gap. But both are adults. However, there's a power dynamic here because the mom is the mother of his friend. Even if she initiated the relationship, she's in a position of authority or at least a parental figure in relation to the friend. That could be a problem because it might be seen as exploiting a position of trust or influence over her son's friend.\n\nThen, the fact that the friend found out and is upset. The author says he's honest with the friend, but the friend is still hurt. The author's argument is that they're all adults and can make their own choices. But the issue here is the relationship with the friend's mother. Even if consensual, it's a taboo situation. Socially, it's considered inappropriate, regardless of the ages. People might see it as wrong because of the family connection, even if the friend is an adult.\n\nAlso, the mother is divorced and maybe still adjusting to that life, but that doesn't justify the relationship from the son's perspective. The son might feel betrayed, and even if the author was upfront, the act itself could be seen as crossing a line. The author is in a position where he's close to the friend, so getting involved with the mother could be seen as taking advantage of that access.\n\nAnother point is that the author mentions the mother insisted on being open with the friend. But even if they were honest, the relationship's nature is problematic. The friend's reaction is understandable because it's a violation of boundaries in the social circle. The author's refusal to stop seeing her despite the friend's request might be seen as not respecting the friend's feelings, even if the author thinks they're all adults.\n\nAlso, the author is now being ostracized by their mutual friends. While the friend's smear campaign is extreme, the author's actions contributed to that outcome. The question is whether the actions themselves are wrong, regardless of the consequences. The core issue is the relationship with the friend's mother, which is typically considered socially unacceptable, even if consensual. So, the author might be in the wrong because of violating social norms and the trust within the friend group, even if they were honest about it.\n"
