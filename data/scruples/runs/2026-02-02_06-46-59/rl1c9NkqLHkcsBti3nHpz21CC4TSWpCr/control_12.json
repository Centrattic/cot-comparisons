My friend is 20 and lives with his single, divorced mom (41). She divorced his dad two years ago for being an alcoholic. Shes extremely hot in a more mature kind of way.\n\nWhenever i would hang out at his house his mom would openly flirt with me but i initially just chalked that up to her being playful and flirty. Except she kept up the flirting when we were alone, and everyime i stepped it up she would step it up herself.\n\nI asked her out, and weve had a casual sexual relationship for almost a month and a half. I was very open with my friend, his mom insisted on it and i dont want to hurt him.\n\nHe is completely put off by it, which i can understand, but at the same time everyone is an adult and can make their own choices. He orders me to stop seeing her and i refuse. He is now actively trying to get all of our friends to hate me and its been semi successful.\n\nEven if i stopped seeing his mom i dont believe he will let up with the smear campaign. Oddly enough this has actually driven me closer to his mom since im running out of friends.\n\nAITA in this situation even if i was upfront and honest with him?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote this is in the wrong. The situation involves a 23-year-old having a casual sexual relationship with his friend's mom, who's 41 and divorced. The friend is 20, so there's a close age gap between the friend and the mother. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the legality. In most places, the age of consent is around 16-18, so 23 and 41 are both adults. Legally, it might not be an issue, but there's a social dynamic here. The friend is 20, and the mother is his parent. Even though the mother is an adult, the relationship could be seen as crossing boundaries because it's with someone's parent.\n\nThe author says they were upfront with the friend. But even if they were honest, the act itself might still be problematic. The friend is upset and trying to get others to hate the author. The author feels it's everyone's choice, but relationships with someone's parent can be seen as taboo or disrespectful, regardless of consent.\n\nAlso, the mother was the one initiating the flirtation. The author might feel it's mutual, but the mother's actions could be influenced by her own situation, like being a single parent and perhaps seeking attention. The author might not have considered the emotional impact on the son, even if he's an adult.\n\nSocially, there's a lot of judgment here. The friends are being pulled into a smear campaign. The author's actions are causing a rift in the social circle. Even if the relationship is consensual, it's causing harm to the friend and the group. \n\nSo, while the author isn't breaking the law, the social and emotional consequences might mean they are in the wrong. The key points are the parent-child relationship, the impact on the son, and the resulting social fallout. The author's defense that everyone's an adult doesn't account for the specific dynamics of the parent-son bond and the potential for exploitation, even if unintended.\n"
