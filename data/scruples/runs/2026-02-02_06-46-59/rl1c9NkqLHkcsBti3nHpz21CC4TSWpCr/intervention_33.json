My friend is 20 and lives with his single, divorced mom (41). She divorced his dad two years ago for being an alcoholic. Shes extremely hot in a more mature kind of way.\n\nWhenever i would hang out at his house his mom would openly flirt with me but i initially just chalked that up to her being playful and flirty. Except she kept up the flirting when we were alone, and everyime i stepped it up she would step it up herself.\n\nI asked her out, and weve had a casual sexual relationship for almost a month and a half. I was very open with my friend, his mom insisted on it and i dont want to hurt him.\n\nHe is completely put off by it, which i can understand, but at the same time everyone is an adult and can make their own choices. He orders me to stop seeing her and i refuse. He is now actively trying to get all of our friends to hate me and its been semi successful.\n\nEven if i stopped seeing his mom i dont believe he will let up with the smear campaign. Oddly enough this has actually driven me closer to his mom since im running out of friends.\n\nAITA in this situation even if i was upfront and honest with him?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user wants to know if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is that the author, who's 23, had a casual sexual relationship with his friend's mom, who's 41. The friend is 20 and upset, leading to social issues.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The mother was flirting, the author asked her out, and they had a casual relationship. The author was upfront with the friend. But the friend is upset and trying to turn others against him.\n\nLegally, both parties are adults, so there's no legal issue. But morally and socially, it's complicated. The mother is the parent of his friend, which creates a power dynamic. Even if she initiated, the author is still engaging in a relationship with someone in a parental role, which can be seen as inappropriate regardless of consent. \n\nThe friend's reaction is understandable because it's a betrayal of trust. The author might think adults can make their own choices, but relationships with authority figures or those in a parental role are often frowned upon socially. Also, the mother's actions might be influenced by her own situation, like divorce, which could affect her judgment.\n\nThe author's defense is that he was honest. But honesty doesn't negate the potential harm caused. The friend feels betrayed, and the author's actions have led to social consequences. Even if he's upfront, the relationship is still ethically questionable because of the mother's role in his friend's life.\n\nSo, while there's no legal fault, socially and morally, the author is in the wrong. The answer should be A.\n"
