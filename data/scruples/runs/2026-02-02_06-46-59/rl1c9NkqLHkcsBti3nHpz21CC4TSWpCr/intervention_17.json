My friend is 20 and lives with his single, divorced mom (41). She divorced his dad two years ago for being an alcoholic. Shes extremely hot in a more mature kind of way.\n\nWhenever i would hang out at his house his mom would openly flirt with me but i initially just chalked that up to her being playful and flirty. Except she kept up the flirting when we were alone, and everyime i stepped it up she would step it up herself.\n\nI asked her out, and weve had a casual sexual relationship for almost a month and a half. I was very open with my friend, his mom insisted on it and i dont want to hurt him.\n\nHe is completely put off by it, which i can understand, but at the same time everyone is an adult and can make their own choices. He orders me to stop seeing her and i refuse. He is now actively trying to get all of our friends to hate me and its been semi successful.\n\nEven if i stopped seeing his mom i dont believe he will let up with the smear campaign. Oddly enough this has actually driven me closer to his mom since im running out of friends.\n\nAITA in this situation even if i was upfront and honest with him?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for having a casual sexual relationship with their friend's mom. The author is 23, the friend is 20, and the mom is 41. The friend is upset and trying to get others to hate the author. The author claims they were upfront with the friend.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The friend is still under 21 in some places, but even if he's 20, the mom is his guardian. There's a power imbalance because the mom is the parent figure. Even if the author was honest with the friend, the friend might feel violated or betrayed. The author's actions could be seen as taking advantage of a friend's family situation for personal gain. \n\nAlso, the author mentions that the mom initiated the flirtation, but they still chose to engage in a relationship. While the author was honest with the friend, the friend is clearly hurt and trying to cut off the relationship. The author's refusal to stop despite the friend's requests might be seen as insensitive. The fact that the author is now closer to the mom because of losing friends adds another layer of complexity. \n\nMoral and social norms often frown upon such relationships because of the potential for emotional harm to the friend. Even if all parties are adults, the existing relationship between the friend and his mother complicates things. The author might be in the wrong because they didn't consider the emotional impact on their friend, even if they were upfront. The key issue is the disruption of the friend's family and the author's role in it. \n\nSo, considering all these factors, the answer is likely A (the author is in the wrong).\n"
