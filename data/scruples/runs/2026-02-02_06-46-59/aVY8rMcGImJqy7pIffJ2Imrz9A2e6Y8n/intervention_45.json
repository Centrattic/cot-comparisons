I have told them multiple times that I don't believe in what they believe, but they brush it off and force me to come anyways. So this time, I brought earbuds and put on an album to listen to (Stokeley by Ski Mask the Slump God is great; listen to it) because I wanted to listen to my music instead. I would also text my friend every 15 minutes or so. During the entire mass, my mom shot me dirty looks the whole time and later told me on the ride home that I have a horribly negative attitude and that I should enjoy things more (even though I have told them countless times that I don't believe in what they do and dislike attending church.\n\nAm I just being a bitch or are my parents at fault?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is about the author being forced to attend church by their parents, even though they're an atheist. The author wears earbuds and checks their phone during mass, which leads to their mom being upset and giving them dirty looks.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author is an atheist, so attending church against their will is a conflict. They've communicated their beliefs to their parents, but the parents still force them to come. The author's response is to use earbuds and text a friend. \n\nIs the author in the wrong? Well, from a moral standpoint, if you're in a public setting like a church mass, even if you don't believe in it, being disruptive might be considered rude. Using earbuds might be okay if it's just for personal use without disturbing others. However, texting during the service could be seen as disrespectful, especially in a setting where people are trying to focus on the service. \n\nBut the key point here is the context of being forced to attend. The author is in a situation where they're not allowed to opt out, which adds to the tension. The parents might expect the child to participate respectfully, even if they don't believe. The author's actions could be seen as a form of protest against being forced to attend, but the method might be inappropriate. \n\nOn the other hand, the parents are forcing religious attendance, which could be inappropriate themselves. The author might feel that their autonomy is being violated. However, the author's behavior during the service could still be considered disrespectful regardless of their beliefs. \n\nThe answer depends on whether respecting others' customs in a shared space is more important than the conflict with parental pressure. The author is using a public space (church) and their actions might be seen as disrespectful to the parents' beliefs and the community. \n\nSo, even if the parents are in the wrong for forcing attendance, the author's actions during the service might still be seen as disrespectful. Therefore, the answer is likely A (author is in the wrong). But there's nuance here. Some might argue that the parents are more at fault for the coercion. However, the question is specifically about the author's actions during the service. Their use of earbuds and texting could be seen as the immediate issue causing the conflict. So, the answer is A.\n"
