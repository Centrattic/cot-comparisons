I have told them multiple times that I don't believe in what they believe, but they brush it off and force me to come anyways. So this time, I brought earbuds and put on an album to listen to (Stokeley by Ski Mask the Slump God is great; listen to it) because I wanted to listen to my music instead. I would also text my friend every 15 minutes or so. During the entire mass, my mom shot me dirty looks the whole time and later told me on the ride home that I have a horribly negative attitude and that I should enjoy things more (even though I have told them countless times that I don't believe in what they do and dislike attending church.\n\nAm I just being a bitch or are my parents at fault?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking whether the person who wrote about their situation is in the wrong. The scenario involves attending a church mass they don't believe in, using earbuds and texting during the service, and facing criticism from their parents.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author is an atheist but is forced to attend church with their parents. They've communicated their lack of belief but continue to be dragged along. They use earbuds and text as a way to cope with being there against their will. The parents disapprove and criticize their attitude.\n\nFrom a moral standpoint, the author's actions are their way of dealing with an uncomfortable situation. However, they are in a public setting (church), which might have social norms about behavior. Using earbuds and texting could be seen as disrespectful by others in the church, regardless of the author's personal beliefs. But the key here is the parent's insistence on attending, which creates the problem. The author isn't choosing to be there; they're compelled. So, the conflict arises from the parents' actions versus the author's coping mechanisms.\n\nThe parents are forcing the author to attend a place where the author feels uncomfortable, which could be seen as overstepping. The author's response is about maintaining their own well-being in an environment they find objectionable. However, the parents might argue that attending church is part of their family tradition or values. Yet, the author has expressed their atheism multiple times, so the parents are not respecting the author's autonomy.\n\nLegally and ethically, the parents are in the wrong for forcing the child into a religious activity against their will. The author's actions are a reaction to that coercion. While the author's behavior in the church might be disrespectful from the parents' perspective, the root issue is the parents' lack of respect for the author's beliefs. So, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong for trying to make the best of a forced situation. They might be right to prioritize their comfort and mental health in a setting they find hostile.\n\nBut another angle: even if forced, does the author have a responsibility to respect the setting? It's possible the church expects attendees to behave in a certain way, and using earbuds and texting is a breach of that. However, if the author is not a member of the church and is there under duress, their responsibility might be less. It's a balance between personal freedom and social norms.\n\nIn conclusion, the parents are at fault for forcing the author to attend, and the author's actions are a reasonable response to being in a situation they don't agree with. The author isn't necessarily in the wrong.\n"
