I have told them multiple times that I don't believe in what they believe, but they brush it off and force me to come anyways. So this time, I brought earbuds and put on an album to listen to (Stokeley by Ski Mask the Slump God is great; listen to it) because I wanted to listen to my music instead. I would also text my friend every 15 minutes or so. During the entire mass, my mom shot me dirty looks the whole time and later told me on the ride home that I have a horribly negative attitude and that I should enjoy things more (even though I have told them countless times that I don't believe in what they do and dislike attending church.\n\nAm I just being a bitch or are my parents at fault?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of this AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong for wearing earbuds and checking their phone during a church mass they're forced to attend, even though they're an atheist. The parents have recently started going to church and are making the author come along. The author is trying to cope by listening to music and texting, but the mom got upset.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze the situation from both sides. The author is an atheist, so they don't believe in the religious practices. They've communicated their lack of belief to their parents, but the parents are still forcing them to attend. The author's actions are a way to deal with the discomfort of being in a situation they disagree with and find unpleasant. On the other hand, the parents might see church as a family activity, a moral duty, or a way to instill values, even if the child isn't religious.\n\nNow, the key points here are: forced attendance, the author's coping mechanisms (earbuds, texting), and the parents' reaction. The question is about whether the author is in the wrong. From a religious perspective, especially within a family setting, showing disengagement by using earbuds or phones might be seen as disrespectful. However, the author's position is that they're being forced to attend something they don't believe in, so their actions could be a form of protest or managing their own experience in an environment they find oppressive.\n\nI should consider cultural and familial expectations. In many religions, especially those with strict attendance norms, being present and participating is important. The parents might expect the author to at least appear respectful, even if they don't believe. The author, on the other hand, might feel that their autonomy and personal beliefs should be respected. They are not physically disrupting the service but are mentally disengaging, which can still be seen as disrespectful by others.\n\nAlso, the phrase \"forced to attend\" is crucial. If the author is a minor or under parental authority, the parents have a say in family activities. But if the author is an adult, the situation is different. The post doesn't specify the author's age, which is important. Assuming the author is an adult, arguing that they are being forced might be a stretch since they could choose to not go. But if they are a child, then the parents have the right to set family expectations.\n\nAnother angle is the impact on others. Wearing earbuds might prevent the author from being a distraction, but texting during mass could be disruptive if they're using their phone openly. However, if they're discreet, maybe not. The parents' dirty looks and criticism suggest they feel disrespected, but the author's intent was to cope with an uncomfortable situation.\n\nIn AITA scenarios, the community often looks for respect, consideration, and communication. The author did communicate their discomfort, but the parents didn't change their stance. The author's response is to disengage rather than find a compromise. The parents are enforcing their values, which is common, but the author is asserting their own autonomy.\n\nBalancing these factors, I think the author's actions might be seen as disrespectful in the context of a religious service where active participation and attentiveness are expected. Even if they are forced to attend, the way they handle it (using earbuds and texting) could be viewed as being inconsiderate or showing contempt. The parents might have a right to expect some level of respect or at least not being distracted by their child's behavior. However, the parents are also forcing the author to attend against their beliefs, which is a separate issue.\n\nSo, while the author is not wrong to have their own beliefs, using earbuds and texting during the mass might be crossing a line in terms of respect for the parents' wishes and the setting. The answer might be A (author is in the wrong) because of the disrespectful behavior during the service, despite the parents' actions. Alternatively, if the author is being forced and the parents aren't respecting their autonomy, maybe B (not in the wrong). But typically, in AITA, the \"wrong\" is about the action taken in the situation, not the initial conflict. The author's actions during the mass, which are seen as disrespectful by the parents, could be the focus here. So I think the answer is A.\n"
