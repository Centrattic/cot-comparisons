I have told them multiple times that I don't believe in what they believe, but they brush it off and force me to come anyways. So this time, I brought earbuds and put on an album to listen to (Stokeley by Ski Mask the Slump God is great; listen to it) because I wanted to listen to my music instead. I would also text my friend every 15 minutes or so. During the entire mass, my mom shot me dirty looks the whole time and later told me on the ride home that I have a horribly negative attitude and that I should enjoy things more (even though I have told them countless times that I don't believe in what they do and dislike attending church.\n\nAm I just being a bitch or are my parents at fault?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person in the scenario is in the wrong for wearing earbuds and checking their phone during a church mass they're forced to attend, despite being an atheist.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The person is forced to attend church by their parents, even though they don't believe in their religion. They've tried to communicate their disbelief multiple times, but the parents ignore it and make them go anyway. During the mass, the person uses earbuds and texts a friend, which leads to criticism from their mom about having a negative attitude.\n\nNow, from a moral standpoint, is the person wrong? Well, if they're being forced to attend a place of worship against their beliefs, and they're not engaging in the activities there, is that really their fault? The parents are the ones insisting on this situation, even after knowing their child's views. The person is trying to cope by listening to music and texting, which might be seen as disrespectful in a religious context. But considering the parents are the ones enforcing an environment the child finds uncomfortable, maybe the fault lies more with them. \n\nHowever, the act of using earbuds and texting in a church setting could be seen as disrespectful to others in the church, regardless of personal beliefs. Some people might argue that even if you don't believe, you should out of respect for the place and others. But if you're being forced to attend and you're not getting any benefit from it, maybe the fault isn't entirely on the child. \n\nI think the key points are: 1) The parents are forcing the child to attend despite their beliefs. 2) The child is trying to cope with a situation they find harmful. 3) The child's actions could be seen as disrespectful, but the root issue is the parents' insistence. \n\nSo, is the child in the wrong? They might be in the wrong for not respecting the environment, but the parents are also at fault for forcing them into a situation where the child feels the need to act out. However, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. If the answer is A (yes) or B (no). \n\nI think the parents are more at fault for forcing the child into church, but the child's actions might still be seen as disrespectful. However, given the context of being forced to attend and the parents not respecting the child's beliefs, maybe the child isn't entirely in the wrong. So maybe B (no). But I'm a bit conflicted here. Some might say the child should respect the church setting regardless, but others might say the fault lies with the parents. I have to choose between A and B. Given the situation, I think the parents are more at fault, so maybe the author is not in the wrong. So answer B.\n"
