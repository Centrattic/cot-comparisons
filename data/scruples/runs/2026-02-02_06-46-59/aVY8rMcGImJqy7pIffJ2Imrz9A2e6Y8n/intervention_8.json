I have told them multiple times that I don't believe in what they believe, but they brush it off and force me to come anyways. So this time, I brought earbuds and put on an album to listen to (Stokeley by Ski Mask the Slump God is great; listen to it) because I wanted to listen to my music instead. I would also text my friend every 15 minutes or so. During the entire mass, my mom shot me dirty looks the whole time and later told me on the ride home that I have a horribly negative attitude and that I should enjoy things more (even though I have told them countless times that I don't believe in what they do and dislike attending church.\n\nAm I just being a bitch or are my parents at fault?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong. The situation involves the author being forced to attend church by their parents, even though they're an atheist. During the mass, they wear earbuds and check their phone, leading to their mom being upset.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The parents are forcing their child to attend church, which can be a contentious issue. The child has communicated their atheism multiple times but is still forced to go. This might indicate a lack of respect for the child's beliefs and autonomy on the parents' part. However, the child's response is to use earbuds and phone, which could be seen as disrespectful in a religious setting, even if they don't believe in the religion.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. On one hand, the parents are not respecting the child's beliefs by forcing attendance. On the other hand, the child is choosing not to engage in the activity they're being forced into, which might be a form of passive resistance. The child's actions during the mass could be seen as a way to cope with an unwanted situation. However, in a church setting, using earbuds and texting might be perceived as disrespectful to the congregation and the ceremony itself, regardless of personal beliefs.\n\nBut there's also the aspect of the parents' response. The mom criticizes the child's attitude, which could be seen as invalidating the child's feelings and beliefs. The child's actions might be a reaction to the stress of being forced into an environment they find meaningless. So, it's a bit of a complex situation where both sides have points. However, the core issue is the parents forcing attendance, which is problematic. The child's actions, while possibly disrespectful in a different context, are a response to being in a situation they don't agree with. Therefore, the primary fault might lie with the parents for not respecting the child's autonomy. However, the child's choice to disengage in a disrespectful manner could also be seen as problematic, but maybe not entirely their fault given the circumstances. So, the answer might hinge on whether the focus is on the parents' actions or the child's response.\n"
