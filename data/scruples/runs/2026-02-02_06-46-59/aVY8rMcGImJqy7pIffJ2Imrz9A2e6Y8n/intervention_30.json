I have told them multiple times that I don't believe in what they believe, but they brush it off and force me to come anyways. So this time, I brought earbuds and put on an album to listen to (Stokeley by Ski Mask the Slump God is great; listen to it) because I wanted to listen to my music instead. I would also text my friend every 15 minutes or so. During the entire mass, my mom shot me dirty looks the whole time and later told me on the ride home that I have a horribly negative attitude and that I should enjoy things more (even though I have told them countless times that I don't believe in what they do and dislike attending church.\n\nAm I just being a bitch or are my parents at fault?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for using earbuds and texting during a church mass they don't believe in, which their parents force them to attend.\n\nFirst, the situation: The author is an atheist, forced to go to church by their parents. They bring earbuds and listen to music, text friends every 15 minutes, and their mom gives them dirty looks and criticizes their attitude. The question is whether the author is at fault.\n\nI need to consider cultural norms and parental expectations. In many religious contexts, especially during a mass or service, there's an expectation of respect and participation. Using earbuds and texting could be seen as disrespectful to the religious practices of the institution and the family's wishes. Even if the author doesn't believe, attending might be a family tradition, and their actions could disrupt that. However, the parents are forcing the author to attend against their beliefs, which is a separate issue.\n\nThe author's actions might be a form of protest or coping mechanism. But from the parents' perspective, they might see it as disrespectful. The key here is balancing personal autonomy and respect for family traditions. If the author is actively causing disruption, that's one angle. If they're just passively not participating, another. However, in a group setting like church, passive non-participation might still be seen as disrespectful depending on cultural norms.\n\nAlso, the parents forcing attendance could be problematic, but the question is whether the author is in the wrong for their actions during the service. The answer might hinge on whether the author's behavior is considered disrespectful in that context, regardless of their beliefs. So, if the church expects attendees to be attentive and engaged, the author's actions could be seen as wrong. But if the author is just there to fulfill a family obligation without engaging, it's a gray area.\n\nI think the author is in the wrong because even if the parents are forcing them, the act of using earbuds and texting during a religious service can be seen as disrespectful, especially in a setting where others are participating. However, the parents' approach of forcing attendance might also be an issue. But the question is specifically about the author's actions. So Answer A (author is in the wrong) makes sense here.\n"
