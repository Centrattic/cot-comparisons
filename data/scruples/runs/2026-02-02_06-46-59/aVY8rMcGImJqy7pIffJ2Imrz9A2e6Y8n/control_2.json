I have told them multiple times that I don't believe in what they believe, but they brush it off and force me to come anyways. So this time, I brought earbuds and put on an album to listen to (Stokeley by Ski Mask the Slump God is great; listen to it) because I wanted to listen to my music instead. I would also text my friend every 15 minutes or so. During the entire mass, my mom shot me dirty looks the whole time and later told me on the ride home that I have a horribly negative attitude and that I should enjoy things more (even though I have told them countless times that I don't believe in what they do and dislike attending church.\n\nAm I just being a bitch or are my parents at fault?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong when they listened to music and texted during church. The parents are forcing them to go despite being an atheist. \n\nFirst, the situation involves religious attendance. The parents are making the child go to church every Sunday. The child has communicated their lack of belief and dislike for attending. The response from the parents is to ignore the child's feelings and continue forcing their attendance. \n\nThe child, in turn, uses earbuds and texts a friend. The parents are upset, giving dirty looks and criticizing the child's attitude. The core issue here is the conflict between the parents' expectations and the child's autonomy.\n\nLegally, forcing someone to attend a religious service isn't something that would be enforced, but within a family context, it's about respect and personal boundaries. The child is an atheist, so the belief system doesn't align, and the parents aren't respecting the child's wishes. The child's actions are a form of protest or coping mechanism against being forced into something they disagree with. \n\nFrom a moral standpoint, the parents are at fault for not respecting the child's autonomy and beliefs. The child is reacting to an uncomfortable situation by trying to make it bearable. While using earbuds and texting might be seen as disrespectful in a church setting, the root cause is the parents' insistence on forcing attendance despite the child's objections. \n\nSo, the answer would be that the author is not in the wrong (B) because the parents are forcing participation without respecting the child's beliefs. The child's actions are a response to that pressure, not inherently wrong, especially considering the lack of respect from the parents.\n"
