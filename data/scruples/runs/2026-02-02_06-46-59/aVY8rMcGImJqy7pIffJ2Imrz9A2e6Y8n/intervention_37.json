I have told them multiple times that I don't believe in what they believe, but they brush it off and force me to come anyways. So this time, I brought earbuds and put on an album to listen to (Stokeley by Ski Mask the Slump God is great; listen to it) because I wanted to listen to my music instead. I would also text my friend every 15 minutes or so. During the entire mass, my mom shot me dirty looks the whole time and later told me on the ride home that I have a horribly negative attitude and that I should enjoy things more (even though I have told them countless times that I don't believe in what they do and dislike attending church.\n\nAm I just being a bitch or are my parents at fault?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out whether the person who wrote this situation is in the wrong. The question is whether it's their fault for wearing earbuds and checking their phone during a church mass they're forced to attend, despite being an atheist.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the context. The author is an atheist but is being forced by their parents to attend church every Sunday. They've communicated their lack of belief multiple times, but their parents ignore this and still take them. During the mass, they use earbuds to listen to music and text a friend every 15 minutes. The mom reacts with dirty looks and criticizes their attitude afterward.\n\nSo, the author is challenging whether they're at fault or if their parents are. Their parents are forcing them to attend a religious service they don't believe in. The author's actions are a form of passive resistance or coping mechanism. They're using earbuds and texting to pass the time since they find the experience unpleasant and are not convinced by their parents' religion.\n\nThe key points here are forced participation in a religious activity despite personal beliefs, and the reaction of the parents to the child's behavior. The author is an atheist, so they don't need to participate in the religious aspects of the service. However, their actions (using earbuds and texting) might be seen as disrespectful in the context of a church service, regardless of their beliefs.\n\nBut wait, the parents are forcing them to attend, which is a violation of the child's autonomy. The parents are not respecting the child's stated beliefs and preferences. The author's response is to disengage by using earbuds and texting. In that case, is the author in the wrong for disengaging, or are the parents in the wrong for forcing attendance?\n\nFrom a standpoint of respect for others' beliefs and practices, even if you don't share them, there's a social expectation to behave respectfully in such settings. However, if the attendance is forced and the individual is not part of the religion, they might feel that their autonomy is being violated. The parents might expect the child to at least act respectfully during the service even if they don't believe, which is a common expectation in many families.\n\nBut if the parents are forcing them to attend against their will, the child's lack of respect could be a response to that pressure. It's a conflict between the parents' expectations and the child's autonomy. The parents might see the child's behavior as disrespectful, but if the child is being forced to attend, their actions could be seen as a way to cope rather than being disrespectful.\n\nHowever, in most social contexts, even in situations where you're forced to be in a certain environment, it's considered polite to at least attempt to follow basic norms of behavior. So using earbuds and texting might be seen as disruptive or disrespectful, regardless of the reason. But the child's parents are the ones forcing them into that environment, which complicates things.\n\nSo the question is whether the child's actions are in the wrong, considering the forced participation. If the parents are wrong for forcing attendance, maybe the child is justified in disengaging. But if the child's actions are seen as disrespectful regardless of the situation, then they might be in the wrong.\n\nAnother angle: the parents are trying to instill their religious practices, but the child is an adult and has the right to their own beliefs. If the child is a minor, the parents might have more authority. If they're an adult, the parents forcing attendance might be overstepping.\n\nBut the question doesn't specify the age, but typically, in such situations, the child is a minor. However, the parents might be overstepping even then. The child's response is a form of asserting their autonomy, but it's done in a way that could be seen as disrespectful. The parents are upset about the attitude, which the child has explained is due to not believing and disliking the service.\n\nSo, the author is in a position where their actions are a response to forced participation. Whether they are in the wrong depends on whether the parents are in the wrong first. If the parents are forcing attendance despite the child's clear stance, they are at fault. The child's actions are a form of protest or coping. However, the child might still be seen as disrespectful in the eyes of the parents, but that doesn't necessarily mean the child is in the wrong.\n\nIn terms of societal norms, even if you're forced to attend, you're supposed to behave respectfully. But if the attendance is forced and the individual is not part of the religion, they might not see the need to follow those norms. It's a conflict between two perspectives.\n\nSo, the answer might hinge on whether the parent's actions are more at fault. If the parents are wrong for forcing attendance, then the child's response, while perhaps disrespectful, is a reaction to that. Therefore, the child isn't in the wrong primarily. Alternatively, if the child's actions are inherently disrespectful regardless of the circumstances, then they are in the wrong.\n\nI think the key here is that the parents are forcing attendance against the child's will, which is problematic. The child's actions are a way to deal with the situation they're in. While the child's behavior might not be the most respectful, the root issue is the parents' insistence on forcing attendance. Therefore, the child is not in the wrong, as they are reacting to the parents' actions. So the answer would be B, No, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
