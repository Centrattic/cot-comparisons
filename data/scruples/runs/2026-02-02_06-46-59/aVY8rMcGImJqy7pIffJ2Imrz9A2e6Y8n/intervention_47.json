I have told them multiple times that I don't believe in what they believe, but they brush it off and force me to come anyways. So this time, I brought earbuds and put on an album to listen to (Stokeley by Ski Mask the Slump God is great; listen to it) because I wanted to listen to my music instead. I would also text my friend every 15 minutes or so. During the entire mass, my mom shot me dirty looks the whole time and later told me on the ride home that I have a horribly negative attitude and that I should enjoy things more (even though I have told them countless times that I don't believe in what they do and dislike attending church.\n\nAm I just being a bitch or are my parents at fault?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. Let me start by reading through the situation again to make sure I understand all the details. The user is an atheist who is forced by their parents to attend church every Sunday. They've told their parents multiple times that they don't believe in their religion, but the parents still make them go. During the mass, the user wears earbuds and listens to music, texts a friend every 15 minutes, and their mom gives them dirty looks, later calling them a negative person and telling them to enjoy things more.\n\nThe user is asking if they are the asshole (AITA) in this situation. They think they might be in the wrong but want others' opinions. The question is whether the author is at fault. The answer should be A (yes) or B (no). \n\nFirst, let's consider the parents' perspective. They have a religious practice and want to attend church. They might see attending mass as an important family activity, even if the child doesn't share their beliefs. Forcing a child to attend church, especially if the child is an adult, could be seen as respecting their autonomy. However, in some contexts, parents might have different expectations if the child is a minor. But the user didn't specify their age, so maybe they're an adult. If they're an adult, being forced to attend church might overstep, especially since they've communicated their atheism.\n\nOn the other hand, the user's actions during the mass: wearing earbuds and texting could be seen as disrespectful in a religious setting. Even if they don't believe, being in a place of worship and not participating respectfully might upset the parents. The parents might feel that the user is showing disdain for their beliefs and the setting. However, the user has valid reasons for not wanting to attend and might feel that their autonomy is being disregarded.\n\nThe key points here are respect, autonomy, and the context of the situation. If the user is an adult, the parents forcing attendance without considering their wishes could be a problem. However, if the user is a minor, the parents might have different expectations. Since the user mentions being forced, it's possible they're a teenager. In that case, the parents might believe they have authority over their child's activities. But the user's reaction (disrespecting the setting) might be seen as a way to push back against the pressure to attend.\n\nBut from a general perspective, regardless of age, showing up to a religious service and not engaging respectfully can be seen as disrespectful to the parents' beliefs and the environment. Even if the user doesn't believe, they might be expected to at least appear respectful during the service. The parents' dirty looks and criticism later might be because they feel disrespected. However, the parents forcing attendance without considering the user's feelings could also be at fault.\n\nI need to balance both sides. The user's actions might be disrespectful, but the parents' insistence on forcing attendance despite the user's clear objections is also problematic. The question is whether the user is in the wrong. Since the user is in a place that isn't their own (the church) and is part of a family activity, maybe they should make an effort to be respectful, even if they don't believe. However, the parents shouldn't force a child to attend against their will. \n\nIf the user is acting out as a form of protest, it's a conflict between personal autonomy and respect for parents' wishes. In many cultures, respecting parents is important, so the user's actions might be seen as disrespectful. On the flip side, forcing someone to attend a religion they don't believe in can be harmful. \n\nBut the question is whether the user is in the wrong. The user's actions during the mass, like texting and listening to music, are clearly disrespectful in that setting. Even if they're upset about being forced to attend, they could have chosen to be present without being disruptive. The parents, while perhaps overbearing, are in a place where they expect certain behavior. So the user's actions are likely the root of the problem here. Therefore, the answer would be A (yes, the author is in the wrong).\n"
