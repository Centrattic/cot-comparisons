I have told them multiple times that I don't believe in what they believe, but they brush it off and force me to come anyways. So this time, I brought earbuds and put on an album to listen to (Stokeley by Ski Mask the Slump God is great; listen to it) because I wanted to listen to my music instead. I would also text my friend every 15 minutes or so. During the entire mass, my mom shot me dirty looks the whole time and later told me on the ride home that I have a horribly negative attitude and that I should enjoy things more (even though I have told them countless times that I don't believe in what they do and dislike attending church.\n\nAm I just being a bitch or are my parents at fault?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The question is whether the person who wrote this is in the wrong for wearing earbuds and texting during a church mass they don't believe in and are forced to attend.\n\nFirst, the context: The person is an atheist, their parents have recently become interested in church, and they're forced to go every Sunday. The author is using earbuds to listen to music and texting friends, which their mom disapproves of. The mom says they have a negative attitude and should enjoy things more.\n\nSo, the main points here are about respect, religious practices, and personal autonomy. The author is in a situation where they're attending a religious service they don't believe in, which they find unpleasant. They're trying to cope by listening to music and texting. The parents see this as disrespectful and have a negative reaction.\n\nFrom the author's perspective, they're being forced to attend a service they don't want to be part of. They might feel that their personal space and freedom are being invaded, so they use earbuds and texting as a way to cope. They might not see their actions as disrespectful because they don't believe in the religion. However, in a public religious setting, even if they don't agree with the beliefs, there's an expectation of respect for the environment and other attendees. Wearing earbuds could be seen as not participating or being distracted, which might be considered rude in that context. Texting during a service is generally considered disrespectful in many religious settings because it's a form of distraction and disrespect towards the ceremony.\n\nOn the parents' side, they're likely trying to instill religious practices and community involvement, even if the child isn't interested. They might feel that the author's behavior reflects poorly on the family and is a sign of ingratitude for being included. The mom's comment about having a negative attitude suggests she's upset about the perceived disrespect.\n\nBut the key point here is that the author is being forced to attend something they strongly disagree with. Their actions are a form of protest or coping mechanism. While in some contexts, using earbuds and texting might be seen as disrespectful, the situation is complicated by the fact that the author's presence is mandatory and they don't share the beliefs of the service. The parents are forcing their child to participate in a practice the child rejects, which could be seen as the parents being at fault. The author's actions might be a way to assert their autonomy in a situation where they feel coerced.\n\nHowever, there's also the social aspect: even if one doesn't agree with the beliefs, being present in a public space (like a church service) often requires certain social courtesies. The author might not be wrong in their actions if they're not participating, but the parents' enforcement of attendance without respecting the child's beliefs could be problematic.\n\nIn many cases, forcing a child to attend religious services they don't believe in can be seen as a form of pressure, especially if they're an adult. The author, as an adult, might have the right to make their own choices. However, if they're still a minor, the dynamics might be different. The situation isn't clear on the age of the author.\n\nBut assuming the author is an adult, the parents are forcing them into a situation they're uncomfortable with. The author's actions are a way to manage their discomfort, which could be understandable. The parents, on the other hand, are not respecting the author's autonomy and beliefs. So, the fault might lie more with the parents for not respecting the author's views and continuing to force attendance despite the author's clear statements about not believing.\n\nIn terms of the specific actions (earbuds and texting), in a public religious service, those actions might be seen as disrespectful regardless of personal beliefs. However, if the author is in a situation where they're forced to attend, the responsibility for the conflict might shift more towards the parents. The author is not in the wrong for trying to cope in a situation they're being forced into. The parents are at fault for not respecting the author's autonomy and beliefs, leading to the author's actions as a form of resistance.\n"
