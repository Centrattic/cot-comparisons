I have told them multiple times that I don't believe in what they believe, but they brush it off and force me to come anyways. So this time, I brought earbuds and put on an album to listen to (Stokeley by Ski Mask the Slump God is great; listen to it) because I wanted to listen to my music instead. I would also text my friend every 15 minutes or so. During the entire mass, my mom shot me dirty looks the whole time and later told me on the ride home that I have a horribly negative attitude and that I should enjoy things more (even though I have told them countless times that I don't believe in what they do and dislike attending church.\n\nAm I just being a bitch or are my parents at fault?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong. The situation involves an atheist being forced to attend a church mass by their parents. During the mass, the person uses earbuds to listen to music and texts a friend. The parent is upset and criticizes them.\n\nFirst, I need to consider cultural and familial norms. In many religious contexts, attending services is seen as a communal activity where respect for the event is expected. Wearing earbuds and using a phone could be perceived as disrespectful, even if the person doesn't share the beliefs. However, the parents are forcing the child to attend against their religious beliefs. The child is an atheist and has communicated their disinterest. The parents' insistence might be the root issue here. \n\nThe key points are the forced attendance and the child's attempt to cope with a situation they find disagreeable. The parents might expect participation and respect during the service, but the child's actions are a form of protest against being forced to attend. Legally, can parents force a child to attend church? In some places, yes, but ethically, it's a different matter. The child's right to express their lack of belief versus the parents' right to enforce their religious practices.\n\nThe parents' reaction includes dirty looks and criticizing the child's attitude. The child's behavior is a response to being in an environment they find alienating. Are they being disrespectful, or is it a reasonable way to handle being forced into an activity they dislike? The parents might see the earbuds and texting as disrespectful, but the child's perspective is about coping with a situation they're not comfortable in. \n\nSo, considering both sides, the parents are forcing attendance against the child's beliefs, which is problematic. The child's actions are a form of self-soothing in that situation. Therefore, the author is not necessarily in the wrong. The parents are at fault for not respecting the child's beliefs and the child's response is understandable given the context. Answer B.\n"
