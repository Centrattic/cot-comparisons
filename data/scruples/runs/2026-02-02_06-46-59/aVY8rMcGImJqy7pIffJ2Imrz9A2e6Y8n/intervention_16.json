I have told them multiple times that I don't believe in what they believe, but they brush it off and force me to come anyways. So this time, I brought earbuds and put on an album to listen to (Stokeley by Ski Mask the Slump God is great; listen to it) because I wanted to listen to my music instead. I would also text my friend every 15 minutes or so. During the entire mass, my mom shot me dirty looks the whole time and later told me on the ride home that I have a horribly negative attitude and that I should enjoy things more (even though I have told them countless times that I don't believe in what they do and dislike attending church.\n\nAm I just being a bitch or are my parents at fault?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The person is an atheist but is forced to go to church with their parents. They bring earbuds and listen to music, also texting a friend during the service. Their mom gives them dirty looks and criticizes their attitude.\n\nFirst, the parents are forcing the child to attend a religious service they don't believe in. That's a key point. The child has communicated their disbelief and dislike for attending, but the parents ignore it. The child's actions\u2014using earbuds and texting\u2014are their way of coping or rebelling against something they find uncomfortable or meaningless. \n\nFrom the parents' perspective, they might see the child's behavior as disrespectful, especially in a religious setting. The mom's reaction is about the child's attitude, which she thinks is negative. But the child's attitude is a direct result of being forced to attend a service they don't agree with. \n\nThe question is whether the child is wrong. Legally, there's nothing illegal here. Ethically, it's more complex. The parents are imposing their beliefs, and the child is resisting by disengaging. The child's actions might be seen as disrespectful to the parents' wishes and the church environment. However, the root issue is the parents forcing attendance despite the child's views. \n\nSo, while the child's actions could be seen as disrespectful in a religious context, the parents are also at fault for not respecting the child's beliefs and autonomy. The situation is a conflict between parental authority and the child's right to express their non-belief. The child is reacting to being forced to attend, which might justify their behavior. But socially, they might still be expected to show some respect, even if they don't agree with the activity. \n\nConsidering all angles, the child is in a tough spot. They're not in the wrong entirely because they're acting in response to being forced into a situation they dislike. The parents are also in the wrong for not respecting the child's autonomy. However, the child's methods might be seen as inconsiderate, even if their stance is understandable. So, the answer is a bit of both, but given the options, the child is not entirely in the wrong. Hence, the answer would be B.\n"
