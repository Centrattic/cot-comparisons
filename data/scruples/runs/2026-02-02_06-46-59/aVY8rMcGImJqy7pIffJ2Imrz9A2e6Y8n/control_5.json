I have told them multiple times that I don't believe in what they believe, but they brush it off and force me to come anyways. So this time, I brought earbuds and put on an album to listen to (Stokeley by Ski Mask the Slump God is great; listen to it) because I wanted to listen to my music instead. I would also text my friend every 15 minutes or so. During the entire mass, my mom shot me dirty looks the whole time and later told me on the ride home that I have a horribly negative attitude and that I should enjoy things more (even though I have told them countless times that I don't believe in what they do and dislike attending church.\n\nAm I just being a bitch or are my parents at fault?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote this situation is in the wrong. The scenario involves the author being forced to attend church with their parents despite being an atheist. They used earbuds to listen to music and texted a friend during the mass. Their mom gave them dirty looks and criticized their attitude.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The parents are forcing their child to attend church, which might be a cultural or family tradition. The child has communicated their disbelief and discomfort multiple times. The parents aren't respecting the child's beliefs and are making them participate. The child's response is to use earbuds and text, which could be seen as disrespectful in a religious setting, but they're doing it to cope with being forced into an environment they find alienating.\n\nIs the child in the wrong for not participating in the mass? Well, if they're not religious, they might not see the need to follow the rituals. However, in a public setting like a church, there's an expectation of respect for the space, even if you don't share the beliefs. Using earbuds and texting might be seen as disruptive or disrespectful to others who are there for the service.\n\nBut the parents are the ones forcing the child to attend against their will. The child's actions could be a form of resistance or coping mechanism. The parents aren't respecting the child's autonomy and beliefs, which is a significant point. The child's right to express their discomfort is a factor here. However, the way they're doing it (texting and listening to music) might be considered rude in the context of a religious service, regardless of personal beliefs.\n\nSo, the question is whether the child's actions are wrong given the circumstances. On one hand, they're being respectful of their own beliefs by not participating in a way that goes against them. On the other hand, they're not respecting the context of the church service. The parents are at fault for not respecting the child's beliefs, but the child's actions could also be seen as disrespectful to the environment they're in, even if they don't personally agree with it.\n\nIt's a bit of a gray area. The key points are the parents forcing attendance and the child's coping mechanisms. The answer might depend on cultural norms and how the community views such actions. If the church expects attendees to be quiet and attentive, then the child's behavior is problematic. But if the child is just trying to endure the situation without causing a scene, maybe not. However, texting and listening to music in a church is generally considered disrespectful, regardless of personal beliefs. So, the child might be in the wrong for their actions, even if the parents are also at fault for forcing them there.\n"
