So this time, I brought earbuds and put on an album to listen to (Stokeley by Ski Mask the Slump God is great; listen to it) because I wanted to listen to my music instead. I would also text my friend every 15 minutes or so.

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. Let me start by breaking down the situation.\n\nThe person is an atheist, but their parents have recently started going to church, and they're forcing the author to attend mass every Sunday. The author has communicated their lack of belief multiple times, but the parents ignore that and still make them come. During the mass, the author uses earbuds to listen to music and texts a friend every 15 minutes. The mom is upset, gives dirty looks, and later criticizes the author for having a negative attitude and not enjoying things more. The author is wondering if they're being a bitch or if the parents are at fault.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The parents are forcing the child to attend a religious service they don't believe in. The child is rebelling by using earbuds and texting. The parents are upset, but the child is an atheist and has expressed this. \n\nReligious practices and family dynamics can be complex. In many cases, parents might push their children to attend church for various reasons\u2014community, tradition, moral upbringing, etc. However, forcing a child to attend when the child has made it clear they don't believe could be seen as overstepping. The child's actions (listening to music, texting) might be seen as disrespectful in the context of a church service, where silence and attention are expected. But the child is in a situation where they're being forced to participate in something they don't agree with. \n\nFrom a cultural standpoint, in many religious settings, using earbuds and texting during a service is considered inconsiderate or disrespectful. However, the child's perspective is that they're being forced into a situation they don't consent to. So there's a conflict between the child's autonomy and the parents' expectations.\n\nThe parents' reaction\u2014dirty looks and criticism\u2014might be because they see the child's behavior as disrespectful, both to the religious service and to their own wishes. The child, on the other hand, might feel they have the right to be disengaged since they're not part of the religion. \n\nBut the key point here is whether the author is in the wrong. The parents are forcing attendance, which could be problematic. However, the author is responding by being disengaged during the service, which might be seen as disrespectful in that setting. So there's a dual issue: the parents are forcing the child into a context where certain behaviors are expected, and the child is violating those norms as a form of protest.\n\nIn terms of right and wrong, if you're in a public setting with social norms (like a church service), you're expected to follow those norms unless you're in a situation where you can't. But the author is being forced into that situation, so there's a conflict. The parents are at fault for forcing attendance, but the author's actions within that setting might also be seen as disrespectful. However, if the author is being coerced, their rebellion could be seen as a form of asserting autonomy, which might be understandable. \n\nBut in terms of the author being \"in the wrong,\" if the question is about whether they acted inconsiderately during the church service, then yes, because using earbuds and texting could be seen as impolite. However, if the question is about the parents' forced attendance being the root issue, then the parents are more at fault. The answer likely hinges on whether the author's actions are judged by the context of the situation (parents forcing attendance) or by the norms of the church service itself.\n\nSince the author is being forced to attend, their actions might be a form of protest. But in terms of the immediate situation during the mass, the author's behavior could be seen as disrespectful. So depending on which perspective you take, the answer might differ. The question is whether the author is in the wrong. If the standard is respect for the parents' wishes and the setting, then the author is in the wrong. If the standard is considering the coercion and the child's right to autonomy, then maybe not. But the question is from the parents' point of view, so the answer might lean towards the author being in the wrong because they didn't follow the social norms during the service, even if forced to attend. But the parents are also at fault for forcing attendance. However, the question is specifically about the author's actions. So maybe the answer is A (yes, the author is in the wrong) because they acted disrespectfully during the service, even if the parents are also in the wrong for forcing them to attend. The question is about the author's actions, not the parents'.\n"
