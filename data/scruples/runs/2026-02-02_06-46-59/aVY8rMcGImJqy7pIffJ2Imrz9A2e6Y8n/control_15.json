I have told them multiple times that I don't believe in what they believe, but they brush it off and force me to come anyways. So this time, I brought earbuds and put on an album to listen to (Stokeley by Ski Mask the Slump God is great; listen to it) because I wanted to listen to my music instead. I would also text my friend every 15 minutes or so. During the entire mass, my mom shot me dirty looks the whole time and later told me on the ride home that I have a horribly negative attitude and that I should enjoy things more (even though I have told them countless times that I don't believe in what they do and dislike attending church.\n\nAm I just being a bitch or are my parents at fault?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is that the person is an atheist but is forced to attend church with their parents every Sunday. They brought earbuds and a phone to listen to music and text friends during the mass. Their mom got upset, gave them dirty looks, and later criticized their attitude. Now the author is asking if they're in the wrong or if the parents are.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The parents are forcing the child to attend church despite the child's stated atheism. That seems like a big issue. If the parents are making them go against their beliefs, that's a problem. The child is trying to cope by listening to music and texting, which is a way to pass the time since they don't believe in the service. But from a religious perspective, especially in a church setting, using earbuds and phones might be seen as disrespectful. However, the parents are the ones forcing them to be there in the first place.\n\nBut the question is about whether the author is in the wrong. So, in terms of respect, even if you don't believe, being visibly disengaged (like using earbuds) might be considered rude in some contexts. However, if the child is being forced to attend a place they find objectionable, their actions could be seen as a form of protest or coping. The parents, on the other hand, are not respecting the child's autonomy and beliefs. \n\nThe parents' reaction is also important. The mom criticized the child's attitude, but the child has repeatedly stated they don't believe. The parents brushing off those statements and forcing attendance is problematic. The child's actions might be a response to that lack of respect. \n\nSo the core issue is the parents' insistence on forcing attendance despite the child's beliefs. The child's actions (earbuds, texting) are a reaction to that. While there might be a cultural expectation to be respectful in a church setting, the parents are the ones initiating the conflict by not respecting the child's autonomy. Therefore, the author isn't in the wrong because the main fault lies with the parents for forcing them into a situation they're uncomfortable with.\n"
