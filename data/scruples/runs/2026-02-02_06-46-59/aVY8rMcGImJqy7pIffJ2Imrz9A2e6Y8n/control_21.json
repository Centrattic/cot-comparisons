I have told them multiple times that I don't believe in what they believe, but they brush it off and force me to come anyways. So this time, I brought earbuds and put on an album to listen to (Stokeley by Ski Mask the Slump God is great; listen to it) because I wanted to listen to my music instead. I would also text my friend every 15 minutes or so. During the entire mass, my mom shot me dirty looks the whole time and later told me on the ride home that I have a horribly negative attitude and that I should enjoy things more (even though I have told them countless times that I don't believe in what they do and dislike attending church.\n\nAm I just being a bitch or are my parents at fault?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is that they're an atheist being forced to attend church by their parents. They brought earbuds and listened to music during the mass, also texting friends. The parents are upset, calling them negative.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The parents are forcing them to attend, and the author has communicated their lack of belief. If they're being forced to go, maybe they don't have a choice. But the parents might see attending as important, even if the author isn't into it. \n\nIs it respectful to use earbuds in church? That could be seen as disrespectful in some religious settings, but the author isn't religious. They might feel that the time is wasted, so they use it for something else. However, from the parents' perspective, attending church is a family activity, and the author's behavior might be seen as rude or disrespectful to the parents' beliefs.\n\nBut wait, the author is being forced. If they have no choice, is it fair to expect them to act like they're engaged? The parents might want their child to participate respectfully, but the child isn't interested. The author's actions are a form of passive resistance. \n\nIs there a cultural aspect here? In some religions, it's expected to be fully present during services. Using earbuds could be a major no-no. However, if the parents are the ones forcing the attendance, maybe the expectations are unreasonable. \n\nAlso, the parents are upset about the attitude, not just the earbuds. The author is clearly not enjoying it, so maybe their expressions of disinterest (like texting) are just showing their true feelings. The parents might want the author to fake interest, but that's a bit of a conflict.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? If they're being forced to attend, maybe they aren't at fault. They're not harming anyone by listening to music, but it might be disrespectful. However, the parents' expectation that the author must behave as if they believe could be unrealistic. The author's right to personal expression versus the parents' religious practices. \n\nIn some cases, respecting family traditions is important, but if the author has clearly stated their beliefs and is still forced to attend, the parents might be overstepping. The author's actions are a way to cope with an unwanted situation. \n\nI think the answer is B (the author is not in the wrong). They're not hurting anyone, and the parents are the ones forcing them into a situation where they can't participate. The author's actions are a way to manage their own time and mental state during an unwanted activity.\n"
