I have told them multiple times that I don't believe in what they believe, but they brush it off and force me to come anyways. So this time, I brought earbuds and put on an album to listen to (Stokeley by Ski Mask the Slump God is great; listen to it) because I wanted to listen to my music instead. I would also text my friend every 15 minutes or so. During the entire mass, my mom shot me dirty looks the whole time and later told me on the ride home that I have a horribly negative attitude and that I should enjoy things more (even though I have told them countless times that I don't believe in what they do and dislike attending church.\n\nAm I just being a bitch or are my parents at fault?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote this is in the wrong. The situation is about a teenager being forced to attend church by their parents even though they're an atheist. The author is using earbuds and texting during the service, and the parents are upset. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal and ethical aspects. In many places, children are not legally adults, so parents have authority over their children's activities, including religious practices. However, the child's autonomy is a factor here. The author has expressed their disbelief multiple times but is still forced to attend. That raises questions about parental control versus the child's rights.\n\nUsing earbuds and texting during church\u2014depending on the context, this could be seen as disrespectful to the family's religious practice. However, if the child is being coerced into attending a place they find meaningless, their actions might be a form of protest. The parents might view it as disrespectful, but the child might see it as a necessary coping mechanism.\n\nAlso, the parents' reaction is a factor. Telling the child they have a negative attitude and to enjoy things more, despite the child's clear stance on their beliefs, could be seen as dismissive. The parents aren't respecting the child's feelings or autonomy, which might make their approach problematic.\n\nBut then again, in some cultures or families, attending religious services is a family tradition, and participation is expected. The parents might feel that the child's behavior is not just disrespectful to the service but also to their family values. The child's actions could be seen as rebellious rather than justified.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? If the parents are legally and ethically within their rights to require attendance (even if the child disagrees), then the child's actions might be considered disrespectful. However, if the child's autonomy and expressed discomfort are being ignored, the parents might be at fault for not respecting the child's boundaries.\n\nThe key points are the parents' enforcement of attendance despite the child's explicit non-belief, the child's attempts to cope by disengaging during the service, and the parents' dismissive response. Depending on cultural norms and legal standards, both sides might have valid points. But from a standpoint of respect for the child's autonomy and the parents' coercive practices, the parents might be in the wrong. However, from the parents' perspective, they might feel justified in expecting respect for their traditions. \n\nIn conclusion, it's a complex situation. The author's actions are a form of resistance against forced participation, which the parents might not understand. But the parents, in forcing their child to attend against their beliefs, might be overstepping, making the author not in the wrong.\n"
