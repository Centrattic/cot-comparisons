I have told them multiple times that I don't believe in what they believe, but they brush it off and force me to come anyways. So this time, I brought earbuds and put on an album to listen to (Stokeley by Ski Mask the Slump God is great; listen to it) because I wanted to listen to my music instead. I would also text my friend every 15 minutes or so. During the entire mass, my mom shot me dirty looks the whole time and later told me on the ride home that I have a horribly negative attitude and that I should enjoy things more (even though I have told them countless times that I don't believe in what they do and dislike attending church.\n\nAm I just being a bitch or are my parents at fault?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, so I need to decide whether the author of this situation is in the wrong. Let's break it down.\n\nThe person is an atheist being forced to attend church by their parents. They've told their parents multiple times they don't believe, but the parents still make them come. During the mass, the person uses earbuds to listen to music and texts a friend every 15 minutes. Their mom gets upset, gives dirty looks, and later comments on their negative attitude.\n\nFirst, the parents are forcing attendance despite the person's beliefs. That seems intrusive. The person is being respectful by attending but is also trying to cope with being in a situation they find meaningless. Using earbuds and texting might be seen as disrespectful in a church setting, especially if others expect quiet reflection or participation. However, the parents are the ones forcing participation, which complicates things.\n\nThe person's actions could be seen as a way to endure the situation, but maybe they should have tried to sit out or find another arrangement instead of engaging in behavior that could be seen as disruptive. On the other hand, the parents aren't respecting the person's beliefs by forcing attendance. So there's a conflict here between respecting personal beliefs and respecting others' religious practices. The author might be in the wrong for not respecting the context of the church, even if they're being forced to attend. Alternatively, the parents are in the wrong for forcing attendance. But since the question is about the author's actions, their behavior during the mass (using earbuds, texting) is likely seen as disrespectful by the parents and possibly others in the church. So maybe the answer is A.\n"
