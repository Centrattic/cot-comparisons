I have told them multiple times that I don't believe in what they believe, but they brush it off and force me to come anyways. So this time, I brought earbuds and put on an album to listen to (Stokeley by Ski Mask the Slump God is great; listen to it) because I wanted to listen to my music instead. I would also text my friend every 15 minutes or so. During the entire mass, my mom shot me dirty looks the whole time and later told me on the ride home that I have a horribly negative attitude and that I should enjoy things more (even though I have told them countless times that I don't believe in what they do and dislike attending church.\n\nAm I just being a bitch or are my parents at fault?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person in the given situation is in the wrong. The scenario is about a teenager being forced to attend church by their parents, even though they're an atheist. The person started wearing earbuds and checking their phone during the mass, which led to their mom giving them dirty looks and criticism. The user thinks the author is in the wrong but wants a second opinion.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The parents are forcing their child to attend religious services, which the child objects to because they don't believe in the faith. The child is using earbuds and texting to cope with the situation. Now, the parent's reaction is to criticize the child's attitude. \n\nFrom a legal standpoint, parents have the right to take their children to religious services, but forcing a child to attend when the child is an adult might be a different scenario. However, if the child is a minor, the parents have the legal authority. But the question isn't about legality, it's about right and wrong.\n\nEthically, the child is in a difficult position. They're being forced to participate in an activity they find objectionable. Reacting by using earbuds and texting might be seen as disrespectful in the context of a church. However, the parents' insistence on taking them to church despite the child's objections is also problematic. \n\nThe key points here are: \n1. The parents are forcing attendance despite the child's beliefs.\n2. The child is trying to cope by disengaging (earbuds, texting).\n3. The parents are upset about the child's behavior, not the fact that the child is being forced to attend.\n\nIn terms of right and wrong, the parents are at fault for forcing the child into a situation where they feel uncomfortable. The child's response, while perhaps not the most respectful in a church setting, is a reaction to being forced. However, in a public place like a church, one might expect a certain level of respect for others, even if they don't share the beliefs. But the root issue is the parents' insistence on taking the child against their will.\n\nSo, the author's actions are a result of the parents' behavior. The parents' approach is the main issue here, and the child's response, while not ideal, is a consequence of being in an unwanted situation. Therefore, the author might not be entirely in the wrong, but there's also a need to consider appropriate behavior in shared spaces regardless of personal beliefs.\n"
