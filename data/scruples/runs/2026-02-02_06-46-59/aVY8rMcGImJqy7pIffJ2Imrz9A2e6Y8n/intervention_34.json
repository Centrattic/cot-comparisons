I have told them multiple times that I don't believe in what they believe, but they brush it off and force me to come anyways. So this time, I brought earbuds and put on an album to listen to (Stokeley by Ski Mask the Slump God is great; listen to it) because I wanted to listen to my music instead. I would also text my friend every 15 minutes or so. During the entire mass, my mom shot me dirty looks the whole time and later told me on the ride home that I have a horribly negative attitude and that I should enjoy things more (even though I have told them countless times that I don't believe in what they do and dislike attending church.\n\nAm I just being a bitch or are my parents at fault?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, so I need to figure out if the person who wrote this is in the wrong. Let me start by breaking down the situation.\n\nThe user is an atheist who's being forced to attend church by their parents. They've told their parents multiple times they don't believe, but the parents keep making them go. During the service, the user wears earbuds and texts friends. Their mom gives them dirty looks and later criticizes their attitude. The user is asking if they're in the wrong or if their parents are.\n\nFirst, I should consider the context. The user is being forced to attend a religious service they don't believe in. That's a big point. Freedom of religion is a right in many places, and being forced to participate in a religion you don't follow can be stressful. The parents are insisting on this despite the user's clear communication of their atheism.\n\nNow, the user's actions: using earbuds and texting. In a church setting, especially during a mass, there are social norms about behavior. People typically expect others to participate respectfully, even if they're not devout. Using earbuds might be seen as disrespectful because you're not listening to the service. Texting is also a distraction and could be viewed as rude in such a public religious setting. However, the user is there under duress, so their actions might be a form of protest or coping mechanism.\n\nBut the core issue is the parents' behavior. Forcing a child to attend a religious service repeatedly, despite their objections, is problematic. It's a form of pressure that can be emotionally taxing. The parents' response to the user's actions is to criticize their attitude, which might be dismissing the underlying issue of being forced to attend. The user might feel entitled to their own behavior in a space they don't agree with, even if it's considered rude.\n\nSo, is the user in the wrong? If we look at the parents' actions, they're the ones forcing attendance and dismissing the child's beliefs. The user is reacting to that pressure. However, in the context of the church service, their actions could be seen as disrespectful. But given the coercion, maybe the user isn't at fault. The parents are the ones violating the child's autonomy and beliefs.\n\nBut the question is about the user's actions specifically. Are they in the wrong for using earbuds and texting during mass? In a respectful public setting, those actions are indeed impolite. However, the context of being forced there might mitigate that. It's a conflict between social etiquette and personal rights.\n\nI think the answer depends on whether the user's actions are justified by their circumstances. If the parents are wrong for forcing them, then the user's actions might be a reaction to that. But if we judge the user's behavior in the mass alone, without context, they might be in the wrong. However, considering the coercion, maybe they aren't. The parents are at fault for the coercion, so the user's actions are a response, not the main issue.\n\nSo, the user is in the wrong in terms of respecting the social setting, but the parents are more at fault for the coercion. However, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. The answer might be A (yes), but considering the context, maybe B (no). It's a bit of a gray area. But since the user is in the space they don't agree with and are acting out of discomfort, maybe they aren't in the wrong. However, the act of using earbuds and texting is still socially rude. I'm torn here. Maybe the answer is A because of the social norms, but the parents are more at fault. The user's question is about their own wrong, not the parents'. So perhaps the user is in the wrong for their actions, even if the parents are wrong for forcing them. But the user's actions are a form of resistance. It's a tricky balance.\n"
