I have told them multiple times that I don't believe in what they believe, but they brush it off and force me to come anyways. So this time, I brought earbuds and put on an album to listen to (Stokeley by Ski Mask the Slump God is great; listen to it) because I wanted to listen to my music instead. I would also text my friend every 15 minutes or so. During the entire mass, my mom shot me dirty looks the whole time and later told me on the ride home that I have a horribly negative attitude and that I should enjoy things more (even though I have told them countless times that I don't believe in what they do and dislike attending church.\n\nAm I just being a bitch or are my parents at fault?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the person is in the wrong here. The situation is that they're an atheist forced to go to church with their parents. They're using earbuds and texting during mass, which makes their mom upset. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The person mentioned they're an atheist and have communicated their lack of belief to their parents. The parents are forcing them to attend church, which the person clearly doesn't want to do. In that situation, using earbuds and texting might be their way of coping with the time they're spending in a place they disagree with.\n\nFrom a moral standpoint, does the person have a right to be there? Well, they're being forced by their parents, so maybe they feel they have no choice. Their actions during the service could be seen as disrespectful by the parents, especially in a religious setting where participation is expected. However, the person's behavior is a response to being forced into a situation they don't believe in. \n\nThe parents' perspective is that they're taking the child to church, and the child's actions are seen as disrespectful. But the child's argument is that they don't believe and are being forced. The question is whether the child's actions are justified given the circumstances. \n\nIn some cultures, attending church with family is seen as a social norm, and participating respectfully is expected. But if the child's religion doesn't require participation, maybe the parents are overstepping. However, the parents might feel they're instilling values or traditions. \n\nThe key points here are consent and respect. The child is not consenting to attend, which could make their actions a form of resistance. However, in a public setting like church, where there are shared norms, disrupting or showing disrespect could be problematic. But the child isn't disrupting; they're just not participating. Earbuds and texting might be seen as disengaged but not disruptive. \n\nAnother angle is the parents' right to enforce their religious practices. However, if the child is an adult, their autonomy might be more respected. But if they're a minor, the parents might feel they have the authority to make such decisions.\n\nIn terms of right or wrong, it's a bit of a gray area. The parents might be faulted for forcing their child to attend against their beliefs, but the child's actions could also be seen as disrespectful in a setting where they're present. However, since the child is being forced, their actions might be a way to cope, not necessarily disrespectful. The parents should consider the child's feelings and perhaps allow them to opt out if they're an adult. \n\nSo, considering all this, maybe the parents are at fault for forcing attendance, and the child's actions are a response to that. Therefore, the answer might be B (not in the wrong).\n"
