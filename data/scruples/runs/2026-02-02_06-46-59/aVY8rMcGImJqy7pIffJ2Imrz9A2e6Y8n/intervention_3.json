I have told them multiple times that I don't believe in what they believe, but they brush it off and force me to come anyways. So this time, I brought earbuds and put on an album to listen to (Stokeley by Ski Mask the Slump God is great; listen to it) because I wanted to listen to my music instead. I would also text my friend every 15 minutes or so. During the entire mass, my mom shot me dirty looks the whole time and later told me on the ride home that I have a horribly negative attitude and that I should enjoy things more (even though I have told them countless times that I don't believe in what they do and dislike attending church.\n\nAm I just being a bitch or are my parents at fault?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me think through this. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong. The situation involves the author attending a church mass with their parents, even though they're an atheist. They brought earbuds and checked their phone during the service, which their mom disapproved of.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author is forced to attend church by their parents. They've communicated their lack of belief multiple times. So, the parents are making them go against their will. The author uses earbuds and texts a friend. Are these actions wrong?\n\nFrom a religious perspective, church services are meant to be participatory and respectful. Distracting oneself with music or texting might be seen as disrespectful. However, the author is under duress. They\u2019re not there by choice. But does that justify their behavior? Maybe not. Even in an environment you don't agree with, being respectful to others around you is generally expected. Distractions could disrupt the service or upset others.\n\nThe parents' reaction is also a factor. They might have expected the author to at least sit quietly. However, the parents are forcing a religious activity on their child, which could be problematic, especially if the child is of an age where they can make their own decisions. But the author's response (listening to music, texting) does show a lack of respect for the setting and their parents' wishes.\n\nOn the other hand, the author is an atheist and has communicated that. They\u2019re in a situation they\u2019re not comfortable with. But even if they\u2019re forced to attend, they could choose to sit quietly or read a book instead of using electronic devices. Texting might be seen as more disruptive than just listening to music. The parents might feel disrespected, but the author is also dealing with forced participation.\n\nSo, considering both sides: the author is disrespectful by using earbuds and texting, which could be seen as rude in a church setting. However, the parents are forcing their child to attend a service they don\u2019t believe in, which is also a form of pressure. But the question is about whether the author is in the wrong. The author's actions, while possibly a response to being forced, still breach social norms in a religious context. Therefore, the author is in the wrong (A).\n"
