I have told them multiple times that I don't believe in what they believe, but they brush it off and force me to come anyways. So this time, I brought earbuds and put on an album to listen to (Stokeley by Ski Mask the Slump God is great; listen to it) because I wanted to listen to my music instead. I would also text my friend every 15 minutes or so. During the entire mass, my mom shot me dirty looks the whole time and later told me on the ride home that I have a horribly negative attitude and that I should enjoy things more (even though I have told them countless times that I don't believe in what they do and dislike attending church.\n\nAm I just being a bitch or are my parents at fault?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking if the person who wrote the \"AITA\" (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong. The situation is that they're an atheist forced to attend church with their parents every Sunday. They brought earbuds to listen to music and texted a friend during mass. Their mom gave them dirty looks and later said they have a negative attitude.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the perspectives here. The author is an atheist, so they don't believe in the church's teachings. They've told their parents multiple times, but the parents still force attendance. The author uses earbuds and texts during mass. The parents are upset, saying the author has a bad attitude.\n\nFrom a religious perspective, churches often expect attendees to be respectful during services. Distractions like earbuds and texting might be seen as disrespectful, even if the person doesn't believe. So the author's actions could be viewed as impolite or disruptive in that setting. The parents might feel their tradition or values are being disrespected, even if the author isn't religious.\n\nBut on the other hand, the author is in a situation where their beliefs are being forced upon them. They have no choice but to attend, which might be stressful. Using earbuds as a way to cope could be seen as self-preservation. The parents are forcing attendance despite the author's clear communication about their atheism, which could be the parents' fault for not respecting their child's beliefs.\n\nThe key points are: the author is an atheist, forced to attend church they don't believe in, uses earbuds and texts during mass, parents disapprove. The question is whether the author is in the wrong.\n\nI need to weigh the respect aspect. Even if the author doesn't believe, showing respect for the setting (especially in a place of worship) might be expected. However, the parents forcing attendance in a way that disregards the author's beliefs could be problematic. The author might be reacting to being forced into a situation they find meaningless or uncomfortable, hence the earbuds and texting.\n\nBut the act of using earbuds and texting during a service might be considered disrespectful regardless of one's beliefs. Even if you're not a believer, in a public religious setting, you might be expected to at least act respectfully. The parents might feel that their child is being rude, even if the author is an atheist. The parents' response (dirty looks and criticism) shows they feel disrespected.\n\nHowever, the parents are the ones forcing attendance without respecting the author's atheism. So there's a conflict here. The author's actions might be seen as a form of protest or coping mechanism. But the parents might not see it that way and feel their traditions are being undermined.\n\nIn terms of societal norms, attending a church service with earbuds and texting is generally considered impolite. Even if the person is an atheist, using earbuds during a service could be seen as ignoring the event, which is disrespectful. The parents might expect their child to at least sit quietly or participate respectfully, even if they don't believe.\n\nOn the flip side, the parents forcing attendance on someone who doesn't believe could be seen as overstepping. The author is in a tough spot, trying to cope with a situation they find unpleasant. But their coping mechanism involves actions that others (like their parents) might find disrespectful.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? If we consider the parents' perspective and the general expectation of respect in a church setting, even for non-believers, the answer might lean towards A (author is in the wrong). However, if we consider the parents forcing attendance despite the author's beliefs, maybe the parents are at fault, making the author not in the wrong (B). But the question is specifically about the author's actions.\n\nI think the key here is that while the parents might be wrong for forcing attendance, the author's actions during the service (using earbuds and texting) could still be seen as disrespectful. Therefore, the author is partially at fault for their behavior, even if the parents are also in the wrong for forcing attendance. But the question is whether the author is in the wrong regarding their specific actions. Since the focus is on their behavior during the mass, I think the answer is A (author is in the wrong) because their actions during the service are considered disrespectful in that context, regardless of their beliefs.\n"
