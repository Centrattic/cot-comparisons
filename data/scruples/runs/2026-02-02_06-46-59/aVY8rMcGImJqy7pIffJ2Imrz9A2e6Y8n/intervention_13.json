I have told them multiple times that I don't believe in what they believe, but they brush it off and force me to come anyways. So this time, I brought earbuds and put on an album to listen to (Stokeley by Ski Mask the Slump God is great; listen to it) because I wanted to listen to my music instead. I would also text my friend every 15 minutes or so. During the entire mass, my mom shot me dirty looks the whole time and later told me on the ride home that I have a horribly negative attitude and that I should enjoy things more (even though I have told them countless times that I don't believe in what they do and dislike attending church.\n\nAm I just being a bitch or are my parents at fault?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the situation is in the wrong. The scenario is about an atheist being forced to attend church with their parents and deciding to listen to music and text during the service. The parents are upset with their behavior.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author is an atheist, which means they don't believe in the religion their parents are practicing. They're attending church against their will because their parents are forcing them. So, the author's actions\u2014using earbuds and texting\u2014might be a way to cope with being in a place they don't want to be and don't agree with.\n\nBut the parents are attending church themselves and expect their child to participate or at least behave appropriately. From their perspective, they might see the child's actions as disrespectful, especially if the church environment requires a certain level of attentiveness or reverence. The mother's reaction with dirty looks and later criticism suggests that she views the behavior as negative and possibly disrespectful to the church's practices.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. On one hand, the parents are forcing their child to attend a service, which is a form of pressure. On the other hand, the child is reacting to being in an environment they find meaningless or even offensive by disengaging. The child's actions could be seen as a form of rebellion against being forced into a situation they don't agree with.\n\nHowever, in many religious contexts, especially in a church setting, there is an expectation of respect for the rituals and the space. Even if someone doesn't believe, the social norm might be to at least appear respectful. Using earbuds to listen to music and texting could be seen as disruptive or disrespectful, regardless of the individual's beliefs. The parents might feel that their child is showing a negative attitude not just towards the church but also towards their family's values and traditions.\n\nBut there's a counterpoint here: if the child is being forced to attend against their will, their actions might be a form of protest. The parents are not allowing the child to opt out of the activity, which could be considered a form of coercion. In that case, the child's resistance through disengagement might be a way to assert their autonomy.\n\nHowever, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. The parents are in a position of authority, and the child is a minor. The parents have the right to expect certain behaviors from their child in public settings, even if they disagree with the reasons. The child's actions might be seen as disrespectful, not just to the church but to the parents' wishes.\n\nBut the child is also expressing their true feelings and coping with an uncomfortable situation. The parents have not respected the child's beliefs by forcing them to attend. So there's a conflict here between parental authority and the child's autonomy.\n\nIn many cases, children are expected to comply with their parents' wishes, even if they don't agree. The parents might argue that attending church is part of their family tradition, and the child should show respect for that. The child's actions could be seen as a refusal to comply and a sign of disrespect.\n\nHowever, the parents have forced the child into a situation they find harmful or meaningless, and the child is reacting to that. The parents might be at fault for not respecting the child's autonomy and beliefs, leading to the child's negative behavior.\n\nBut the question is specifically about the author's actions. Even if the parents are at fault in forcing attendance, the child's behavior in the church might still be considered disrespectful. The parents have every right to expect their child to behave respectfully in a public setting, even if the child is there against their will.\n\nSo, considering all factors, the author might be in the wrong in terms of respecting their parents' wishes for the event, even if the parents are also at fault for not respecting the child's beliefs. The answer might be A, the author is in the wrong, because they chose actions that could be seen as disrespectful in a church setting, regardless of their personal beliefs. However, there's a strong argument that the parents' actions forced the child into a situation where disengagement was a form of coping.\n"
