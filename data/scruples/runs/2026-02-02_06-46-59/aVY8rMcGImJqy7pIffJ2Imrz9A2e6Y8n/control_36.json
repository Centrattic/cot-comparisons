I have told them multiple times that I don't believe in what they believe, but they brush it off and force me to come anyways. So this time, I brought earbuds and put on an album to listen to (Stokeley by Ski Mask the Slump God is great; listen to it) because I wanted to listen to my music instead. I would also text my friend every 15 minutes or so. During the entire mass, my mom shot me dirty looks the whole time and later told me on the ride home that I have a horribly negative attitude and that I should enjoy things more (even though I have told them countless times that I don't believe in what they do and dislike attending church.\n\nAm I just being a bitch or are my parents at fault?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person is in the wrong for wearing earbuds and texting during church. The parent made them go to mass even though they're an atheist. The person tried to explain they don't believe, but the parents forced them anyway. So, the person brings earbuds and listens to music, texts a friend, and the mom is upset, calling them negative.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The person is forced to attend a religious service they don't believe in. They've communicated their lack of belief multiple times. Wearing earbuds and texting is their way of coping or passing the time. The parents are upset, but is the child wrong here?\n\nFrom a religious perspective, church services are seen as sacred, and using earbuds or being on the phone could be seen as disrespectful. However, the person's attendance is coerced, and they don't share the beliefs. So, the conflict is between the parents' expectations and the child's personal beliefs and autonomy.\n\nLegally or ethically, there's no wrongdoing in the actions taken. The parents are forcing the child to attend, which might be a different issue. The child's actions are a form of resistance or coping. However, socially, in the context of the church, it's considered disrespectful. But if the child is not a believer, they might not see it that way. The parents' frustration stems from their belief that attending church is important and respectful. The child's actions are seen as a negative attitude, but the root issue is the forced attendance.\n\nSo, it's a complex situation. The parents might be at fault for forcing attendance, but the child's reaction is a response to that. The child isn't necessarily in the wrong because they're acting within their rights to handle a situation that's causing them discomfort. The key is whether the child's actions are disrespectful in a public setting. If they were in a different environment, like a concert, using earbuds would be okay. But in a religious setting, others might find it disrespectful. However, since the child doesn't believe, they might not see it that way. The answer depends on balancing respect for personal autonomy against the parents' wishes and the social norms of the church.\n"
