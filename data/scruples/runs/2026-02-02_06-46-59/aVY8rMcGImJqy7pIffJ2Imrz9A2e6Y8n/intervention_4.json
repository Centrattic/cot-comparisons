I have told them multiple times that I don't believe in what they believe, but they brush it off and force me to come anyways. So this time, I brought earbuds and put on an album to listen to (Stokeley by Ski Mask the Slump God is great; listen to it) because I wanted to listen to my music instead. I would also text my friend every 15 minutes or so. During the entire mass, my mom shot me dirty looks the whole time and later told me on the ride home that I have a horribly negative attitude and that I should enjoy things more (even though I have told them countless times that I don't believe in what they do and dislike attending church.\n\nAm I just being a bitch or are my parents at fault?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user wants to know if the person who wrote the situation is in the wrong. The scenario is about a teenager being forced to attend church by their parents, even though they're an atheist. The author used earbuds and texted their friend during the service, leading to their mom being upset.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The parents are forcing their child to attend church against their beliefs. The child has communicated their atheism multiple times. Using earbuds and texting could be seen as disrespectful in a religious setting. But the parents are the ones making them attend, which might contribute to the child's frustration.\n\nOn one hand, the church is a place where people expect respect, so using earbuds and texting might disrupt the experience for others or be seen as disrespectful. On the other hand, the parents are imposing their beliefs on the child, which is a form of forced participation. The child might feel conflicted and act out because they're forced to attend something they don't believe in.\n\nThe question is whether the child is in the wrong. If the parents are forcing attendance, the child's actions could be a response to that pressure. However, the child's actions during the service might still be considered disrespectful regardless of the reason. But maybe the parents' actions (forcing attendance) are the root issue here.\n\nSo, is the child in the wrong? It's a bit of a gray area. If the child is being disrespectful, maybe they are at fault. But if the parents are the ones forcing them into a situation they're uncomfortable with, perhaps the parents share some responsibility. The key point is that the child is an atheist and the parents are forcing them to participate in a religion they don't believe in. The child's actions might be a form of resistance.\n\nIn terms of societal norms, respecting religious settings is important, but so is respecting an individual's right to their beliefs. The parents might not realize the pressure they're putting on their child. The child's actions could be a way to cope with the discomfort of being in a situation they don't agree with.\n\nIn conclusion, while the child's actions could be seen as disrespectful in the context of a church service, the parents' enforcement of attendance without considering the child's beliefs also plays a role. However, the immediate question is whether the author is in the wrong. The answer might lean towards A (yes) because the actions taken during the service could be considered disrespectful. But there's a strong argument that the parents' actions are the main issue here. But the question is specifically about the author's actions, not the parents'.\n"
