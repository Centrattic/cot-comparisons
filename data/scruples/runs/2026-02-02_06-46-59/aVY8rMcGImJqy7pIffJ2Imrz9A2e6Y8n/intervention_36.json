I have told them multiple times that I don't believe in what they believe, but they brush it off and force me to come anyways. So this time, I brought earbuds and put on an album to listen to (Stokeley by Ski Mask the Slump God is great; listen to it) because I wanted to listen to my music instead. I would also text my friend every 15 minutes or so. During the entire mass, my mom shot me dirty looks the whole time and later told me on the ride home that I have a horribly negative attitude and that I should enjoy things more (even though I have told them countless times that I don't believe in what they do and dislike attending church.\n\nAm I just being a bitch or are my parents at fault?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote this situation is in the wrong. The scenario is about a person being forced to attend church by their parents, even though they're an atheist. They used earbuds and checked their phone during the service, which led to their mom being upset.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The author is an atheist but is being forced to attend religious services. They've communicated their disbelief multiple times but are still forced to go. That's a problem because parental authority shouldn't override a child's autonomy to the point of forcing them into activities they find meaningless or uncomfortable. \n\nNow, the author's actions: using earbuds and texting. In a church setting, especially during a mass, there's an expectation of respect and attentiveness. Even if the person doesn't believe, being disruptive could be seen as disrespectful. However, the parents are forcing the child to attend, which is a key point. The child is in a situation where they're being compelled to be in an environment they don't agree with, which is inherently problematic.\n\nThe parents might argue that attending church is a family tradition, but the child has made their stance clear. The parents dismissing the child's beliefs and forcing attendance could be the root issue. The child's response (using earbuds) might be a way to cope, but in a public setting like church, there's a social norm to be quiet and respectful. However, the child's actions might be a form of passive resistance against being forced to attend.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? On one hand, they're being disrespectful in a place where respect is expected, regardless of belief. On the other hand, they're being forced into an uncomfortable situation. The parents are likely at fault for not respecting the child's autonomy. The author's actions might be a reaction to that, but in the context of the environment, using earbuds and texting could be seen as inappropriate. However, the main wrong here might be the parents' insistence on forcing attendance despite the child's clear objections. \n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong. If the parents are forcing attendance, the child's actions might be a justified response, even if they're not the most respectful. The answer could depend on cultural expectations and how the behavior is perceived. But in terms of right and wrong, the parents are in the wrong for not respecting the child's autonomy, and the child's actions are a form of protest, albeit disrespectful. But the main issue is the parents' actions. So maybe the author isn't entirely in the wrong. But the question is whether the author is in the wrong. If the answer is A (yes), then the author is at fault for being disrespectful. If B (no), then the parents are the ones at fault. Given the context, the author's actions are a response to being forced into something they don't believe in, which could mitigate their fault. But in the church setting, the behavior is still arguably disrespectful. However, the parents' actions are more problematic. So maybe the answer is B (no).\n"
