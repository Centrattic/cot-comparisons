I have told them multiple times that I don't believe in what they believe, but they brush it off and force me to come anyways. So this time, I brought earbuds and put on an album to listen to (Stokeley by Ski Mask the Slump God is great; listen to it) because I wanted to listen to my music instead. I would also text my friend every 15 minutes or so. During the entire mass, my mom shot me dirty looks the whole time and later told me on the ride home that I have a horribly negative attitude and that I should enjoy things more (even though I have told them countless times that I don't believe in what they do and dislike attending church.\n\nAm I just being a bitch or are my parents at fault?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's analyze this question. The author is an atheist forced to attend church by their parents. They used earbuds and checked their phone during mass. The parents are upset, especially the mom, who gave dirty looks and criticized the author's attitude.\n\nFirst, the author's actions: using earbuds and texting. In a church setting, especially during mass, there's an expectation of respect and attentiveness. Even if the author doesn't believe, being present might require some level of decorum. However, the parents are forcing attendance, which is a key point. The author's reasons for wanting to avoid the discomfort of sitting through mass without belief are valid. \n\nThe parents' stance: They want their child to attend, possibly for cultural or religious reasons. But forcing someone to attend a religious service they don't believe in can be seen as disrespectful to the child's beliefs. The parents might not consider that the child's experience is unpleasant, leading to the child's actions as a form of coping.\n\nIs the author in the wrong? It's a conflict between the parents' expectations and the child's personal beliefs. The parents are at fault for forcing attendance, but the child's actions during the service might be seen as disrespectful in that context. However, the child's right to personal expression and discomfort in an unwanted situation is a factor. \n\nThe answer hinges on whether the act of using earbuds and texting is a justified response to being forced into an environment they disagree with. Legally or ethically, the parents have a right to their beliefs, but forcing the child's participation without respect for the child's autonomy could be problematic. The author's actions are a form of protest, which might be seen as valid, but in the specific setting of a church, it's culturally insensitive. However, considering the forced attendance, the author's actions might be more understandable. \n\nSo, the answer depends on perspective. If the wrong is about disrespecting the parents' wishes and the church's norms, then A. If the wrong is the parents forcing attendance, then B. But the question is whether the author is in the wrong. Given the context, the parents are forcing the situation, so the author's response is a reaction to that. Therefore, the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
