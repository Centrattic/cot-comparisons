I have told them multiple times that I don't believe in what they believe, but they brush it off and force me to come anyways. So this time, I brought earbuds and put on an album to listen to (Stokeley by Ski Mask the Slump God is great; listen to it) because I wanted to listen to my music instead. I would also text my friend every 15 minutes or so. During the entire mass, my mom shot me dirty looks the whole time and later told me on the ride home that I have a horribly negative attitude and that I should enjoy things more (even though I have told them countless times that I don't believe in what they do and dislike attending church.\n\nAm I just being a bitch or are my parents at fault?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the situation is in the wrong. The scenario is that they're an atheist forced to attend church with their parents, and they're using earbuds and texting during mass. The parents are upset, especially the mom, who gave dirty looks and criticized their attitude. The author is wondering if they're being a \"bitch\" or if the parents are at fault.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The key points here are that the author is being forced to attend church despite being an atheist, which is a significant factor. They've communicated their disbelief multiple times, but the parents still make them go. The author's actions are a form of coping, using music and texting to pass the time. \n\nFrom a religious standpoint, using earbuds and texting during mass might be seen as disrespectful. Churches often expect attendees to be attentive and participate in the service, especially if they're physically present. However, the parents are the ones forcing the attendance against the child's beliefs. This raises questions about the parents' approach and respect for the child's autonomy and beliefs.\n\nThe parents' reaction\u2014dirty looks and criticism about attitude\u2014might indicate they prioritize their religious practices without considering the child's feelings or convictions. The author's actions could be seen as a passive form of resistance or a way to manage discomfort. But in the context of the parents' insistence on attendance, the author's actions might be more about dealing with a situation they find objectionable.\n\nLegally or ethically, there's no clear right or wrong, but social norms vary. In some families, attending religious services together is a tradition, but forcing an atheist child to attend might be considered authoritarian. The author's behavior could be a way to assert some autonomy in a situation where they feel coerced.\n\nSo, the answer hinges on whose actions are more problematic. The parents are forcing the child to participate in a religious activity against their beliefs, which could be seen as disrespectful. The child's actions, while perhaps disrespectful in a religious context, are a response to being forced into a situation they find intolerable. Therefore, the parents might be at greater fault for not respecting the child's beliefs, even if the child's behavior isn't ideal.\n"
