I have told them multiple times that I don't believe in what they believe, but they brush it off and force me to come anyways. So this time, I brought earbuds and put on an album to listen to (Stokeley by Ski Mask the Slump God is great; listen to it) because I wanted to listen to my music instead. I would also text my friend every 15 minutes or so. During the entire mass, my mom shot me dirty looks the whole time and later told me on the ride home that I have a horribly negative attitude and that I should enjoy things more (even though I have told them countless times that I don't believe in what they do and dislike attending church.\n\nAm I just being a bitch or are my parents at fault?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The situation involves attending a church mass against their will, being an atheist, and using earbuds and texting during the service.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author is forced to attend church by their parents despite not believing in their religion. They mention they've tried to express their non-belief multiple times, but the parents ignore them. The author uses earbuds and texts to cope with the situation. The parents are upset, saying the author has a negative attitude.\n\nSo, from a moral standpoint, is the author wrong? Well, they're trying to handle a situation where they're being forced to participate in something they don't believe in. Using earbuds to listen to music might be seen as disrespectful in a religious setting, but the author isn't there by choice. The parents are making them attend, so maybe the author is just managing their own discomfort. However, the act of texting during a religious service could be seen as disrespectful regardless, even if they're being forced to attend. \n\nOn the other hand, the parents are forcing their child to attend a church they don't believe in, which could be considered coercive. The author might feel they have no choice but to find a way to cope, but the method they chose might be inappropriate. The question is whether the author's actions are wrong despite the circumstances. \n\nI think it's a bit of both. The parents are wrong for forcing their child to attend a religion they don't believe in. However, the author could handle the situation differently, like maybe talking to their parents again or finding another way to cope without using earbuds and texting, which might be seen as disrespectful even if they're not there by choice. But since the author is an adult and in a position where they might not have legal means to stop attending (if they're a minor), the responsibility might not entirely be on them. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the author is within their rights to use earbuds to make the experience bearable, but the texting might be more disruptive. However, in a church setting, being attentive is expected, so even if you're not there by choice, maybe the author should make an effort to be respectful. But given that they've already tried to express their non-belief and the parents aren't listening, the author might be justified in trying to cope in their own way.\n\nSo, considering all that, maybe the answer is B (the author is not in the wrong) because they're being forced into a situation they don't believe in, and using earbuds is a way to handle their own experience. The parents are at fault for forcing them. However, some might argue that the author should still be respectful. But since the parents are the ones forcing them, the author isn't entirely in the wrong. I'll go with B.\n"
