I have told them multiple times that I don't believe in what they believe, but they brush it off and force me to come anyways. So this time, I brought earbuds and put on an album to listen to (Stokeley by Ski Mask the Slump God is great; listen to it) because I wanted to listen to my music instead. I would also text my friend every 15 minutes or so. During the entire mass, my mom shot me dirty looks the whole time and later told me on the ride home that I have a horribly negative attitude and that I should enjoy things more (even though I have told them countless times that I don't believe in what they do and dislike attending church.\n\nAm I just being a bitch or are my parents at fault?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so the user is asking whether the person who posted the situation is in the wrong. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the author is an atheist but is forced by their parents to attend church every Sunday. They mention that they've told their parents multiple times about their disbelief, but the parents brush it off. The author then uses earbuds and texts a friend during the service. The mom gets angry, calling them negative, even though the author has stated their views.\n\nHmm, the key factors here are the forced attendance and the author's actions. The parents are making them go to church despite their atheism, which is a form of pressure. The author's response is to use earbuds and check their phone. Is this wrong?\n\nWell, in a public setting like a church service, there's an expectation of respect, especially if you're attending with others. Even if the author doesn't agree with the beliefs, being in the space might require some level of decorum. Using earbuds and texting could be seen as disrespectful, but the parents are forcing them to be there against their beliefs. \n\nThere's a conflict between the parents' religious practices and the author's personal beliefs and autonomy. The parents aren't respecting the author's views, and the author is reacting by not engaging. But from a social standpoint, even in a religious setting, is it acceptable to use earbuds and text? It depends on cultural norms. In many churches, people are expected to participate or at least be quiet. Using earbuds might be less noticeable, but texting could be distracting or seen as a lack of respect.\n\nHowever, the parents are forcing the author to attend, which is the root issue. The author's actions could be a form of protest against being forced to participate in something they disagree with. But the question is about whether the author is in the wrong. If the parents are at fault for forcing attendance, then the author's actions might be a justified reaction. But if the author's actions are disrespectful in the church setting, then they might share some blame.\n\nI think this is a nuanced situation. The parents are wrong for forcing attendance, but the author's actions could be seen as disrespectful in that space. However, given the context of being forced to attend, the author's actions might be a way to cope with a situation they're uncomfortable in. So maybe the author isn't entirely in the wrong. But there's a balance between personal freedom and respecting the space you're in. \n\nI'm leaning towards the author not being in the wrong because the parents are forcing them into a situation they don't believe in. The author's actions are a response to that pressure. However, there's a possibility that the author could have handled it differently without being disrespectful, like just sitting quietly. But since they've tried to communicate their views and the parents aren't listening, the author's actions are a form of self-expression in a constrained environment.\n\nSo the answer might be B (No, the author isn't in the wrong), but I'm not 100% sure. It's a bit of a gray area, but the parents' actions are more problematic here.\n"
