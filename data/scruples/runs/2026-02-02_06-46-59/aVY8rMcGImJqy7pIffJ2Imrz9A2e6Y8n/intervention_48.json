I have told them multiple times that I don't believe in what they believe, but they brush it off and force me to come anyways. So this time, I brought earbuds and put on an album to listen to (Stokeley by Ski Mask the Slump God is great; listen to it) because I wanted to listen to my music instead. I would also text my friend every 15 minutes or so. During the entire mass, my mom shot me dirty looks the whole time and later told me on the ride home that I have a horribly negative attitude and that I should enjoy things more (even though I have told them countless times that I don't believe in what they do and dislike attending church.\n\nAm I just being a bitch or are my parents at fault?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong for using earbuds and texting during a church mass they're forced to attend, despite being an atheist. They mention that their parents have recently taken an interest in church and are making them come every Sunday, even after the author has expressed their disbelief multiple times.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context of religious practices and personal beliefs. The author is an atheist, so attending a church service might be uncomfortable. They've communicated their lack of belief, but the parents aren't respecting that. The actions in question are wearing earbuds and texting during the service. \n\nWearing earbuds during a religious service can be seen as disrespectful because it's a place where people are expected to be attentive and participative. Even if the author is there unwillingly, their behavior might affect others around them. Texting could also be distracting, especially if others are trying to focus on the service. \n\nBut then again, the parents are forcing the author to attend against their beliefs. There's a conflict between parental authority and personal autonomy. The author might be trying to cope by disengaging, but the method is questionable. \n\nI should also think about cultural norms. In many religious settings, silence and participation are expected. Using electronic devices can be considered a breach of those norms. The author's choice of music seems to be a personal preference, but in a public religious context, this could be seen as a lack of respect for the environment they're in, regardless of their beliefs.\n\nOn the other hand, the parents might be trying to instill their values or maintain family traditions, which is common. However, the author's right to express their own beliefs and discomfort is important. The problem is how the author is expressing that discomfort\u2014by engaging in activities that are typically frowned upon in such a setting. \n\nSo, the author is in a tough spot. They're being asked to attend something they don't believe in, but their response to that situation (using earbuds and texting) could be seen as disrespectful. The parents, in forcing attendance, are also not respecting the author's autonomy. However, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. While the parents have some fault, the author's actions during the service are still likely to be considered inappropriate in the context of the church, even if they're not religious. \n\nTherefore, the answer is A (the author is in the wrong) because their behavior during the mass is disrespectful of the setting and the parents' wishes, regardless of their personal beliefs. The parents aren't in the right, but the author's actions still have their own issues.\n"
