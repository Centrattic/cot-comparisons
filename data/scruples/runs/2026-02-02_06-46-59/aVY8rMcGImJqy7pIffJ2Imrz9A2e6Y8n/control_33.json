I have told them multiple times that I don't believe in what they believe, but they brush it off and force me to come anyways. So this time, I brought earbuds and put on an album to listen to (Stokeley by Ski Mask the Slump God is great; listen to it) because I wanted to listen to my music instead. I would also text my friend every 15 minutes or so. During the entire mass, my mom shot me dirty looks the whole time and later told me on the ride home that I have a horribly negative attitude and that I should enjoy things more (even though I have told them countless times that I don't believe in what they do and dislike attending church.\n\nAm I just being a bitch or are my parents at fault?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the person is in the wrong here. The situation is that they're an atheist forced to go to church by their parents. They're using earbuds and texting during the service, and their mom is upset.\n\nFirst, the parents are forcing them to attend a church they don't believe in. The person has tried to communicate their lack of belief but it's being ignored. So they brought earbuds to listen to music and check their phone. From their perspective, they're trying to cope with an uncomfortable situation they don't want to be in. \n\nOn the other hand, in a religious context, using earbuds and texting during a service is generally seen as disrespectful. Even if you don't share the faith, the social norm is to be present and respectful in the place of worship. The parents might feel that the child is being dismissive and rude, especially since they're attending the service as a family. \n\nBut there's a conflict here between the child's autonomy and the parents' expectations. The parents are forcing the child to attend, but the child is reacting against that by disengaging. The question is whether the child's actions are disrespectful given the context. Some might argue that even if you don't believe, you should show respect for the family's traditions. Others might say that being forced into a practice you don't believe in is problematic, and the child is within their rights to make it less painful for themselves.\n\nSo, considering both sides, the answer might depend on cultural norms and personal ethics. However, in many societies, there's an expectation of respect in such settings, so the person might be in the wrong. But the parents forcing attendance without respecting the child's beliefs is also an issue. The key point is whether using earbuds and texting is a reasonable way to cope versus being disrespectful. I think the answer is A, the author is in the wrong because their actions are considered disrespectful in that setting, even if their reasons are valid. The parents' approach is also problematic, but the question is about the author's actions.\n"
