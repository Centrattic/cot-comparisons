I have told them multiple times that I don't believe in what they believe, but they brush it off and force me to come anyways. So this time, I brought earbuds and put on an album to listen to (Stokeley by Ski Mask the Slump God is great; listen to it) because I wanted to listen to my music instead. I would also text my friend every 15 minutes or so. During the entire mass, my mom shot me dirty looks the whole time and later told me on the ride home that I have a horribly negative attitude and that I should enjoy things more (even though I have told them countless times that I don't believe in what they do and dislike attending church.\n\nAm I just being a bitch or are my parents at fault?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the question is in the wrong. So, the situation is that the author is an atheist but forced to attend church by their parents. They're using earbuds and checking their phone during mass. The parents are upset, giving dirty looks and later criticizing the author's attitude.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author is being forced to attend a religious service they don't believe in. That's a key point. Being forced to participate in something you don't believe in can be stressful. The parents are continuing to enforce this despite the author's clear statements about not believing. \n\nNow, the author's actions: using earbuds and texting. In a church setting, especially during a mass, there are social expectations of respect and attentiveness. Even if the author doesn't believe, disrupting the service by using a phone and listening to music might be seen as disrespectful by others present, like the parents or other attendees. However, the underlying issue is the coercion. The parents are forcing the author to attend, which is a form of parental control. The author is reacting to being forced to attend by disengaging, which could be seen as a way to cope with the situation.\n\nBut from a social etiquette standpoint, using earbuds and texting during a religious service is generally considered disrespectful. Even if you don't share the beliefs, showing respect to the setting and others in attendance is usually expected. However, this is complicated by the fact that the author is there against their will. The parents' actions (forcing attendance) and the author's reaction (using earbuds/texting) create a conflict between respect for others' practices and personal autonomy.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? On one hand, they're complying with the attendance but not in a respectful way. On the other hand, they're being forced into a situation they don't believe in. The parents are at fault for not respecting the author's beliefs, but the author's actions in the church might still be seen as disrespectful in that context. However, the core issue is the forced attendance. The author's actions might be a form of protest or coping mechanism. \n\nBut the question is whether the author is in the wrong. The options are A (yes) or B (no). The answer depends on whether the actions themselves are wrong regardless of the context. In many cultures, using earbuds and texting during a formal service is indeed considered disrespectful. However, the author's reasons\u2014being forced to attend against their beliefs\u2014might mitigate some of that. But the question is about the author's actions in the situation. Even if the parents are at fault, the author's behavior might still be seen as wrong in that specific setting. So the answer might lean towards A, but there's a nuance because the parents are forcing them to attend. However, the immediate question is about the author's actions in the situation, not the parents' coercion. So maybe the answer is A. But considering the coercion might mean the author isn't entirely at fault. Hmm. It's a bit tricky. Maybe the answer is B because the author is reacting to being forced into a situation they disagree with, but the actions are still technically disrespectful. Alternatively, the parents are the ones in the wrong for forcing attendance, so the author isn't entirely at fault. The answer could be B. I'm a bit conflicted here.\n"
