I have told them multiple times that I don't believe in what they believe, but they brush it off and force me to come anyways. So this time, I brought earbuds and put on an album to listen to (Stokeley by Ski Mask the Slump God is great; listen to it) because I wanted to listen to my music instead. I would also text my friend every 15 minutes or so. During the entire mass, my mom shot me dirty looks the whole time and later told me on the ride home that I have a horribly negative attitude and that I should enjoy things more (even though I have told them countless times that I don't believe in what they do and dislike attending church.\n\nAm I just being a bitch or are my parents at fault?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The question is whether the author is in the wrong for wearing earbuds and checking their phone during a church mass they're forced to attend as an atheist. \n\nFirst, the situation: the author is an atheist but forced to go to church by their parents. They brought earbuds and listened to music, texted friends, and their mom was upset, calling them negative.\n\nSo, from the parents' perspective, they're taking their child to a religious service, expecting some level of respect and participation. The child is disengaged, using technology, which might be seen as disrespectful. Churches often have norms about behavior during services\u2014like sitting quietly, not using phones, etc. So the parents might see the child's actions as rude or dismissive.\n\nBut from the author's side, they don't believe in the religion, are forced to attend, and are trying to cope by listening to music. They've communicated their disbelief multiple times. The parents aren't listening, so maybe the author feels justified in not engaging. Also, being forced to attend an activity one disagrees with can be stressful, and using earbuds is a way to manage that.\n\nNow, the key points: Is it wrong to be disrespectful in a place of worship, even if you don't believe? Some might say yes, because it's a sacred space. Others might argue that if they're not part of the belief system, they can't be expected to follow the same rules. Also, being forced to attend could be a factor in the author's behavior.\n\nBut the author is actively using their phone and earbuds, which might be seen as more disruptive than just being disengaged. Maybe the parents' expectations are reasonable, expecting their child to at least not openly disrupt the service. The author's actions could be perceived as showing disrespect, regardless of their personal beliefs.\n\nHowever, if the parents are forcing someone to attend against their will, maybe the parents are at fault too. But the question is about whether the author is in the wrong. The author's actions during the service are the focus here. So even if the parents are overstepping, the author's behavior might still be considered disrespectful in that context.\n\nSo, considering social norms and expectations in a church, the author might be in the wrong for their actions during the mass. Even if they don't believe, being respectful in a place of worship is generally expected, even if one is there against their will. Therefore, the answer might be A.\n"
