I have told them multiple times that I don't believe in what they believe, but they brush it off and force me to come anyways. So this time, I brought earbuds and put on an album to listen to (Stokeley by Ski Mask the Slump God is great; listen to it) because I wanted to listen to my music instead. I would also text my friend every 15 minutes or so. During the entire mass, my mom shot me dirty looks the whole time and later told me on the ride home that I have a horribly negative attitude and that I should enjoy things more (even though I have told them countless times that I don't believe in what they do and dislike attending church.\n\nAm I just being a bitch or are my parents at fault?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the post is in the wrong for wearing earbuds and texting during church. They're an atheist, forced to go by their parents, and they're trying to cope by listening to music and checking their phone.\n\nFirst, I need to consider cultural and religious norms. In many Christian churches, especially more traditional ones, using phones and earbuds during mass is seen as disrespectful. The parents might expect the kid to be quiet and participate, even if they don't believe. So the kid's actions could be viewed as disrespectful from the parents' perspective.\n\nOn the other hand, the kid is being forced to attend, which they find unpleasant. They've communicated their lack of belief multiple times. Using earbuds and texting is their way of dealing with the situation, but it's clearly making their mom upset. The parents might feel that even if the kid doesn't believe, they should at least show respect by not using electronic devices.\n\nBut is the kid wrong? Well, respect in different settings. Church is a place where certain behaviors are expected. Even atheists can show respect for the environment, even if they don't share the beliefs. The kid's actions might be seen as disruptive or disrespectful not just to their parents but to the church setting itself. However, the parents are the ones forcing attendance, which could be problematic. The kid's right to autonomy is a factor here. If they're being forced into an environment that's incompatible with their beliefs, their reaction is understandable. But the method of coping by using phones and earbuds might still be considered inappropriate in that context.\n\nSo the question is whether the kid's actions are wrong. The parents might be at fault for forcing attendance, but the kid's actions in the church setting might still be considered wrong from the parents' and church's perspective. So the answer might be A, but there's nuance. However, the user is asking if the author is in the wrong. Considering societal expectations and the parents' perspective, the answer is likely A. But also, the parents forcing attendance could be in the wrong. However, the question is specifically about the author's actions. So the answer is A.\n"
