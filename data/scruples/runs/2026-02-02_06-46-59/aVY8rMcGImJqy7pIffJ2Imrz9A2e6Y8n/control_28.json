I have told them multiple times that I don't believe in what they believe, but they brush it off and force me to come anyways. So this time, I brought earbuds and put on an album to listen to (Stokeley by Ski Mask the Slump God is great; listen to it) because I wanted to listen to my music instead. I would also text my friend every 15 minutes or so. During the entire mass, my mom shot me dirty looks the whole time and later told me on the ride home that I have a horribly negative attitude and that I should enjoy things more (even though I have told them countless times that I don't believe in what they do and dislike attending church.\n\nAm I just being a bitch or are my parents at fault?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA question is in the wrong. The situation is that the person is an atheist forced to attend church with their parents, so they wear earbuds and check their phone during the mass. The parents are upset, and the question is whether the author is wrong for doing that.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The parents are forcing the child to attend church despite the child being an atheist. The child has communicated their disbelief multiple times but the parents ignore it. The parents are using force, so the child is in a position where they have to attend against their will. \n\nThe child's actions: listening to music and texting. In a religious setting, especially during a service, there are social expectations to be respectful. However, the child is in a situation where they're being forced to attend, which might justify their actions as a form of coping. But from the parents' perspective, they might see it as disrespectful, especially if they value the church service and expect participation.\n\nBut the key point is that the parents are forcing attendance. If the parents were to take their child's beliefs into account and not force them to attend, maybe this wouldn't happen. The child is trying to make the time bearable by listening to music and texting, which is understandable. However, in a public religious service, even if one is an atheist, there's a cultural expectation to be present and participatory. But the parents are the ones forcing them to attend, so the child might not be at fault for trying to cope.\n\nOn the other hand, the child's actions could be seen as disrespectful to the parents' beliefs and the religious context. But since the child is being forced to attend, their actions might be a form of resistance. The parents are in the wrong for forcing their child into a religious practice against their beliefs. Therefore, the child's actions are a result of that coercion, making the parents at fault.\n\nSo, the answer would be B (No, the author is not in the wrong) because the parents are forcing attendance, and the child's actions are a response to that coercion. The parents should respect the child's autonomy and beliefs, and the child is justified in seeking ways to cope during the forced attendance.\n"
