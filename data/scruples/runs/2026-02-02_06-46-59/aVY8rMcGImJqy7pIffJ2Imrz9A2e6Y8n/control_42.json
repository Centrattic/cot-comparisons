I have told them multiple times that I don't believe in what they believe, but they brush it off and force me to come anyways. So this time, I brought earbuds and put on an album to listen to (Stokeley by Ski Mask the Slump God is great; listen to it) because I wanted to listen to my music instead. I would also text my friend every 15 minutes or so. During the entire mass, my mom shot me dirty looks the whole time and later told me on the ride home that I have a horribly negative attitude and that I should enjoy things more (even though I have told them countless times that I don't believe in what they do and dislike attending church.\n\nAm I just being a bitch or are my parents at fault?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the person who wrote the situation is in the wrong. The scenario is about a teenager who's forced to attend a church mass with their parents even though they're an atheist. The kid wears earbuds, listens to music, and texts friends during the service. The parents are upset, giving dirty looks and criticizing their attitude.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The person is an atheist, so attending church isn't their belief. They've tried to express their lack of belief before, but the parents ignore it and still make them go. The kid is using earbuds and texting as a way to cope with being forced to be there. \n\nFrom a religious perspective, some might argue that being disrespectful in a religious setting is wrong. But the key here is that the kid is being forced to attend against their will. The parents are compelling them to participate in something the child doesn't believe in. So, the child's actions might be seen as a form of protest or coping mechanism rather than outright disrespect. \n\nAlso, the parents are the ones enforcing attendance despite the child's clear statements of not believing. The child isn't in the wrong for asserting their personal space by using earbuds and engaging with their phone. However, the social norms in religious settings usually expect some level of respect, like not using phones openly. But given the coercion, the child's actions might be justified as a way to handle an uncomfortable situation.\n\nOn the other hand, the parents might feel that the child is being disrespectful, but they are also at fault for forcing attendance. The conflict arises from the parents' insistence on their religious practices without respecting the child's autonomy. The answer isn't straightforward, but considering the coercion and the child's efforts to communicate their beliefs, the blame might not lie solely with the child.\n"
