I have told them multiple times that I don't believe in what they believe, but they brush it off and force me to come anyways. So this time, I brought earbuds and put on an album to listen to (Stokeley by Ski Mask the Slump God is great; listen to it) because I wanted to listen to my music instead. I would also text my friend every 15 minutes or so. During the entire mass, my mom shot me dirty looks the whole time and later told me on the ride home that I have a horribly negative attitude and that I should enjoy things more (even though I have told them countless times that I don't believe in what they do and dislike attending church.\n\nAm I just being a bitch or are my parents at fault?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is that the author is an atheist, forced to attend church by their parents every Sunday. They wear earbuds and check their phone during the service, which their mom disapproves of. The author is asking if they're the asshole for doing this.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author is being forced to attend something they don't believe in. That's a key point. Being forced to participate in religious activities when you don't believe can be frustrating. The parents are making them go, and the author is trying to cope by listening to music and texting a friend. \n\nBut then, the actions during the service: wearing earbuds and texting. In a church setting, especially during a mass, there's usually an expectation of respect for the space and the people around you. Even if you don't believe, disrupting the service isn't appropriate. Wearing earbuds might be seen as disrespectful because it's a place where people are there to worship and concentrate. Texting during the service is also a form of distraction, not just for the author but potentially for others around them. \n\nHowever, the author is in a difficult situation because they're being forced to attend. The parents are not respecting their beliefs, which is a problem. The author's actions might be a form of protest or coping mechanism. But does that justify their behavior during the service? The question is about whether they're in the wrong. \n\nOn one hand, the parents are forcing them to attend, which is an issue. On the other hand, during the time they are there, the author could choose to be more respectful by not using their phone or earbuds. Maybe they could find a way to sit in a less disruptive area or use a white noise app instead of music. However, they chose to openly text and listen to music, which could be seen as disrespectful in that setting. \n\nAnother angle: the parents might have different values. They want their child to attend church, perhaps to learn about the family's religion or to be part of the community. The author's actions are a direct challenge to that, which could explain the mom's reaction. But is the author's behavior justified as a form of resistance against being forced to attend? Or is it just disrespectful regardless of the circumstances?\n\nI think the key here is the concept of respect. Even if you don't agree with the beliefs of a place, entering a religious service and being disruptive is generally frowned upon. The author is in a public setting where others are there to worship, so their actions might be causing a disturbance. However, the underlying issue is the parents forcing attendance. \n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? If we focus solely on their behavior during the service, yes, they might be disrespectful. But if we consider the context of being forced to attend, maybe there's some understanding. However, the answer usually in AITA situations tends to look at the immediate actions. The parents are at fault for forcing attendance, but the author is also in the wrong for being disrespectful during the service. But the question is specifically about the author's actions. The answer would likely be A because they were disrespectful, even if the parents are also wrong.\n"
