I have told them multiple times that I don't believe in what they believe, but they brush it off and force me to come anyways. So this time, I brought earbuds and put on an album to listen to (Stokeley by Ski Mask the Slump God is great; listen to it) because I wanted to listen to my music instead. I would also text my friend every 15 minutes or so. During the entire mass, my mom shot me dirty looks the whole time and later told me on the ride home that I have a horribly negative attitude and that I should enjoy things more (even though I have told them countless times that I don't believe in what they do and dislike attending church.\n\nAm I just being a bitch or are my parents at fault?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the person in the scenario is in the wrong. Let me start by breaking down the situation.\n\nThe author is an atheist who's being forced to attend church by their parents. They bring earbuds and listen to music, text a friend occasionally. Their mom gives them dirty looks and later criticizes their attitude. The author is asking if they're the one at fault here.\n\nFirst, the parents are forcing them to attend church. The author mentions they've told their parents multiple times they don't believe in the religion but are still dragged along. So the parents are compelling participation in something the child doesn't believe in. That seems problematic. Parents have the right to raise their children in their beliefs, but forcing a child to attend religious services against their will, especially when the child is an adult (assuming they're old enough to be in college or working, given the context), might be an issue of control or lack of respect for personal autonomy.\n\nNow, the author's actions: using earbuds and texting. In a church setting, especially during a mass, people are expected to be respectful and engaged. Wearing earbuds and listening to music could be seen as disrespectful to the people around them and the purpose of the event. Even if the author is there against their will, they might still have a responsibility to maintain a respectful presence, even if they don't believe in the religion. Texting during the service could also be seen as distracting and disrespectful.\n\nHowever, the root issue here is the parents forcing attendance. If the parents aren't allowing the author to opt out of attending church, that's a problem. The author is in a situation where they're not free to choose, which complicates their responsibility. But in such a public setting, there's an expectation of courtesy towards others. So even if the author is resentful, their actions might still be seen as disrespectful, especially in a place where others are there for the religious service.\n\nOn the other hand, the parents' criticism of the author's attitude is also questionable. If the author has communicated their lack of belief, expecting them to pretend to be happy or engaged might be unfair. The parents might not be acknowledging the author's autonomy and feelings, which is part of the problem.\n\nSo balancing both sides: the author's actions could be considered disrespectful in the context of a church service, but the parents are forcing attendance without respecting the author's beliefs. The question is whether the author is in the wrong. Given that the parents are the ones enforcing the attendance, the author's actions might be a form of protest or coping mechanism. However, in a social setting like a church, there's a general expectation of respect, and the author's behavior might breach that, even if they're not a believer.\n\nIn conclusion, while the parents are definitely at fault for forcing attendance, the author's actions could still be seen as disrespectful in that specific context. Therefore, the author might be in the wrong for their behavior during the service.\n"
