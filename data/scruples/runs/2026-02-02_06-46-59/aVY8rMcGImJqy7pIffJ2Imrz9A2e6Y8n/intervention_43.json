I have told them multiple times that I don't believe in what they believe, but they brush it off and force me to come anyways. So this time, I brought earbuds and put on an album to listen to (Stokeley by Ski Mask the Slump God is great; listen to it) because I wanted to listen to my music instead. I would also text my friend every 15 minutes or so. During the entire mass, my mom shot me dirty looks the whole time and later told me on the ride home that I have a horribly negative attitude and that I should enjoy things more (even though I have told them countless times that I don't believe in what they do and dislike attending church.\n\nAm I just being a bitch or are my parents at fault?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the author of the situation is in the wrong. The scenario involves the author, an atheist, being forced to attend a church mass with their parents. During the service, they use earbuds to listen to music and text their friend, which their mom disapproves of.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author is an atheist and doesn't believe in their family's religion. They've communicated this to their parents, but they're still forced to attend. The author's actions during the mass could be seen as disrespectful, especially in a religious setting. But there's also the aspect of being forced to attend something they disagree with, which might contribute to their behavior.\n\nFrom a religious perspective, attending a church service is a sacred time for the family. Distractions like listening to music or texting might be seen as showing disrespect to the religious practices and the place itself. The parents might feel that the author is not participating respectfully, hence the dirty looks and the lecture about having a negative attitude.\n\nHowever, the author is in a situation where they're being forced to attend against their beliefs. Their actions might be a form of protest or a way to cope with being in an environment they find uncomfortable. But even so, in many cultures, showing up to a religious service and actively disengaging could be viewed as rude, regardless of personal beliefs.\n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong. On one hand, they're disrespected the setting by using earbuds and texting. On the other hand, they're being coerced into attending something they don't believe in, which might explain their actions. It's a bit of a cultural and personal values issue.\n\nIn many societies, even if you don't share the beliefs, being present in a religious institution often requires a certain level of decorum. So the author's actions could be seen as disrespectful, hence them being in the wrong. But if the parents are forcing attendance without considering the child's beliefs, that's also problematic. However, the immediate question is about the author's actions during the service, not the parents' forcing them to attend.\n\nSo, considering all that, I think the author is in the wrong because their actions during the service were disrespectful to the setting, regardless of their personal beliefs. But the situation is complex because of the coercion. Still, the act itself of using earbuds and texting in a church during a service is likely seen as inappropriate.\n"
