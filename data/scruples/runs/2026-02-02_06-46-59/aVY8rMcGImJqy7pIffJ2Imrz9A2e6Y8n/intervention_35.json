I have told them multiple times that I don't believe in what they believe, but they brush it off and force me to come anyways. So this time, I brought earbuds and put on an album to listen to (Stokeley by Ski Mask the Slump God is great; listen to it) because I wanted to listen to my music instead. I would also text my friend every 15 minutes or so. During the entire mass, my mom shot me dirty looks the whole time and later told me on the ride home that I have a horribly negative attitude and that I should enjoy things more (even though I have told them countless times that I don't believe in what they do and dislike attending church.\n\nAm I just being a bitch or are my parents at fault?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person in the scenario is in the wrong. The situation is about an atheist being forced to attend church with their parents, and they're using earbuds and texting during the mass. The parents are upset.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The person is an atheist, so they don't believe in the religion. They've told their parents multiple times but are still forced to attend. Using earbuds and texting might be seen as disrespectful during a religious service, but the person is there against their will. \n\nFrom a religious perspective, attending mass is important, and being disrespectful by using a phone and earbuds could be considered inappropriate. The parents might feel that their religious environment is being disrespected. However, the person is there because they're forced, not by choice, which complicates things. \n\nOn the other hand, the parents are forcing their child to attend a religious service, which might not be the best approach, especially if the child doesn't believe. The parents' response of giving dirty looks and criticizing the child's attitude could be seen as dismissive of the child's feelings. \n\nBut the question is whether the author is in the wrong. The author's actions during the service could be seen as disrespectful regardless of their personal beliefs. Even if they're forced to attend, being present in a religious setting that they don't believe in, and then not participating respectfully might be seen as wrong. However, the parents' actions in forcing attendance are also problematic. \n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? They might be, because they chose to use earbuds and text, which are disruptive. But they are in an environment they don't agree with and are forced there. It's a bit of a gray area. However, generally, in such settings, even if you don't agree, showing respect is expected. So maybe the answer is A, the author is in the wrong. But I'm not 100% sure. Alternatively, maybe the parents are at fault for forcing attendance. But the question is about the author's actions specifically. I think the answer is A, the author is in the wrong.\n"
