I have told them multiple times that I don't believe in what they believe, but they brush it off and force me to come anyways. So this time, I brought earbuds and put on an album to listen to (Stokeley by Ski Mask the Slump God is great; listen to it) because I wanted to listen to my music instead. I would also text my friend every 15 minutes or so. During the entire mass, my mom shot me dirty looks the whole time and later told me on the ride home that I have a horribly negative attitude and that I should enjoy things more (even though I have told them countless times that I don't believe in what they do and dislike attending church.\n\nAm I just being a bitch or are my parents at fault?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote this is in the wrong. The situation is that the person is an atheist but is forced to attend church with their parents every Sunday. They've told their parents multiple times they don't believe, but the parents keep making them go. So, the person started wearing earbuds and listening to music, texting friends during the mass. Their mom gave them dirty looks and later told them they have a negative attitude and should enjoy things more.\n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong. The options are A (yes) or B (no). \n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The person is being forced to attend a religious service they don't believe in. They've communicated their disbelief, but their parents are not respecting that. The actions the person took\u2014using earbuds and texting\u2014are ways to cope with being in a situation they find uncomfortable. \n\nFrom a moral standpoint, many people might see that the parents are being overbearing, especially since the child has expressed their views. The parents forcing attendance despite the child's protests could be seen as violating the child's autonomy. The child's response is a way to pass the time in a situation they don't want to be in. \n\nHowever, some might argue that in a religious setting, even as an atheist, one should be respectful and not disrupt the service. Using earbuds and texting isn't disruptive, but it's a sign of disengagement. The parents might see this as disrespectful. But given that the child is being forced to attend, their disengagement is a form of protest against being forced to participate in something they don't believe in.\n\nSo, considering the parents' role in forcing attendance despite the child's beliefs, the author's actions are a reaction to that pressure. The parents are not respecting the child's autonomy, which could be more of a problem. Therefore, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong; the parents are at fault for not respecting their child's wishes.\n"
