I have told them multiple times that I don't believe in what they believe, but they brush it off and force me to come anyways. So this time, I brought earbuds and put on an album to listen to (Stokeley by Ski Mask the Slump God is great; listen to it) because I wanted to listen to my music instead. I would also text my friend every 15 minutes or so. During the entire mass, my mom shot me dirty looks the whole time and later told me on the ride home that I have a horribly negative attitude and that I should enjoy things more (even though I have told them countless times that I don't believe in what they do and dislike attending church.\n\nAm I just being a bitch or are my parents at fault?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote this is in the wrong. The situation is about attending church against their will and using earbuds and texting during mass.\n\nFirst, the author is an atheist forced to go to church by their parents. They\u2019ve tried to communicate their lack of belief before, but the parents ignore them. The author brings earbuds to listen to music and texts a friend. The parents disapprove, leading to a conflict.\n\nNow, considering the ethics here. The parents are forcing their child to attend a religious service they don't believe in. That seems like a lack of respect for the child's autonomy and beliefs. The child is trying to cope by listening to music and texting, which might be seen as disrespectful in a church setting, but given the context of being forced to attend, maybe it's a form of self-preservation.\n\nOn the other hand, churches often expect attendees to be respectful, so using earbuds and texting could be seen as disruptive or disrespectful. But if the child is there against their will, the responsibility might lie more with the parents for not respecting the child's beliefs.\n\nI need to check if the action of the author is wrong. The key points are: being forced to attend, using earbuds to avoid the service, texting during the service. The parents are at fault for forcing attendance. The author's actions are a reaction to that. So the author isn't in the wrong because the parents are not respecting their autonomy. Therefore, the answer might be B (No).\n"
