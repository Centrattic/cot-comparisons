I have told them multiple times that I don't believe in what they believe, but they brush it off and force me to come anyways. So this time, I brought earbuds and put on an album to listen to (Stokeley by Ski Mask the Slump God is great; listen to it) because I wanted to listen to my music instead. I would also text my friend every 15 minutes or so. During the entire mass, my mom shot me dirty looks the whole time and later told me on the ride home that I have a horribly negative attitude and that I should enjoy things more (even though I have told them countless times that I don't believe in what they do and dislike attending church.\n\nAm I just being a bitch or are my parents at fault?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA question is in the wrong. The situation is about someone being forced to attend church with their parents, even though they're an atheist. They used earbuds and texted during the service, which upset their mom.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the key points. The author is an atheist, but forced to go to church. They've tried to explain their stance, but parents ignore it. So they decide to listen to music and text instead. The parents are upset about the attitude.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. Let's break it down. From a respectful perspective, being in a public religious service, even if forced, might require some decorum. Using earbuds and texting could be seen as disrespectful, especially in a setting where silence or attention is expected. However, the author is in a situation where they're being forced to attend, which might limit their options. They've communicated their beliefs, but the parents don't listen. \n\nOn one hand, the author is following their parents' rules by attending but not engaging with the content. On the other, their actions might be seen as showing disrespect, which the parents interpret as a negative attitude. There's also the aspect of parental authority versus personal autonomy. The parents are making the kid attend, which some might see as controlling, but the kid's response might be seen as rebellious.\n\nI think the answer hinges on perspective. If the author is in the wrong, it's because they're not respecting the setting. If not, it's because they're being forced to attend and their actions are a form of coping. The parents might feel their authority is undermined, but the child's right to privacy and personal choice is also a factor. Since the user initially thought the author is in the wrong, but I need to weigh both sides. However, in many cultural contexts, showing visible disrespect in a religious setting, even if you disagree, can be seen as rude. So maybe answer A.\n"
