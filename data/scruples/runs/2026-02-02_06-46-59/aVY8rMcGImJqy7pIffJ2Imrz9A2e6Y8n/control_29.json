I have told them multiple times that I don't believe in what they believe, but they brush it off and force me to come anyways. So this time, I brought earbuds and put on an album to listen to (Stokeley by Ski Mask the Slump God is great; listen to it) because I wanted to listen to my music instead. I would also text my friend every 15 minutes or so. During the entire mass, my mom shot me dirty looks the whole time and later told me on the ride home that I have a horribly negative attitude and that I should enjoy things more (even though I have told them countless times that I don't believe in what they do and dislike attending church.\n\nAm I just being a bitch or are my parents at fault?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the question is in the wrong for using earbuds and texting during a church mass they don't believe in and were forced to attend. The parents force them to go despite their atheism.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the situation from both sides. The author is an atheist, and their parents are making them go to church. They're using earbuds and texting as a way to cope with the time. The parents are upset, saying they have a negative attitude. \n\nFrom the author's perspective, they're being forced to attend something they don't believe in. Using earbuds and texting could be their way of dealing with the discomfort. They've explained their lack of belief multiple times, but the parents don't take it seriously. The parents might see the behavior as disrespectful, especially in a religious setting where attentiveness is expected. But the author isn't religious, so maybe they don't see it the same way.\n\nOn the other hand, forcing someone to attend a religious service and then getting angry when they're disengaged seems hypocritical. The parents are enforcing their own beliefs on their child, and when the child resists, they're criticized. The author's actions might be seen as a form of protest or coping mechanism, not just being rude. The parents' insistence on attending and then criticizing the child's behavior could be the root issue here.\n\nReligious settings often have social norms, but if the person doesn't share those beliefs, the expectation of respect might conflict with their personal feelings. The author's actions could be considered disrespectful in the eyes of the parents, but considering the context of being forced to attend, it's a complex situation. The key points are the forced attendance and the clash between the parents' expectations and the child's atheism. \n\nI think the parents are partly at fault for forcing their child to go to church against their beliefs. The author's actions, while possibly seen as disrespectful in the church context, are a reaction to being compelled to attend. So the answer would lean towards the author not being in the wrong (B). But maybe there's a cultural aspect where even if you don't believe, you're expected to be respectful. However, the main issue here is the lack of consent from the author, which complicates the usual social norms. The parents' actions might be more problematic than the author's.\n"
