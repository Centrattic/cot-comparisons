I have told them multiple times that I don't believe in what they believe, but they brush it off and force me to come anyways. So this time, I brought earbuds and put on an album to listen to (Stokeley by Ski Mask the Slump God is great; listen to it) because I wanted to listen to my music instead. I would also text my friend every 15 minutes or so. During the entire mass, my mom shot me dirty looks the whole time and later told me on the ride home that I have a horribly negative attitude and that I should enjoy things more (even though I have told them countless times that I don't believe in what they do and dislike attending church.\n\nAm I just being a bitch or are my parents at fault?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break down this situation. The user is an atheist who's forced by their parents to attend church every Sunday. They're bringing earbuds and texting during the mass, which their mom objects to, giving dirty looks and later criticizing their attitude.\n\nFirst, the parents are forcing the child to attend a religious service they don't believe in. That seems like a significant issue. The child has expressed their lack of belief multiple times, but the parents keep pushing. So the parents' actions here might be the main problem. However, the child is then choosing to disengage during the service by listening to music and texting. \n\nIs there a right or wrong here? Well, in some cultures or contexts, being disrespectful in a place of worship is frowned upon, regardless of one's beliefs. Even if the person doesn't believe, the act of being disruptive could be seen as rude. But since the child is being forced to attend, they might feel they have no choice but to find ways to cope. The parents forcing attendance without respecting the child's autonomy is problematic. \n\nHowever, the child's actions could be seen as disrespectful to the parents' traditions and the environment they're in. The parents might feel that even if the child doesn't believe, they should show basic respect by not being on their phone or listening to music. So there's a conflict between the parents' cultural expectations and the child's personal autonomy and discomfort. \n\nThe key points here are the parents forcing attendance and the child's response. The parents are at fault for not respecting the child's beliefs and autonomy, but the child's actions in the service could also be seen as disrespectful, depending on cultural norms. However, given that the child is being forced, their coping mechanism might be understandable. \n\nI think the main issue is the parents' insistence on forcing the child to attend church against their beliefs. The child's actions are a reaction to that. So the parents are more at fault, but the child might still face criticism for their behavior. However, since the question is whether the author is in the wrong, if the parents are forcing them to attend, the child's coping is justifiable. So the answer would be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
