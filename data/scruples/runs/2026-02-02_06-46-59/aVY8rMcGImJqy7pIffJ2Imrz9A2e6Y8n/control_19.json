I have told them multiple times that I don't believe in what they believe, but they brush it off and force me to come anyways. So this time, I brought earbuds and put on an album to listen to (Stokeley by Ski Mask the Slump God is great; listen to it) because I wanted to listen to my music instead. I would also text my friend every 15 minutes or so. During the entire mass, my mom shot me dirty looks the whole time and later told me on the ride home that I have a horribly negative attitude and that I should enjoy things more (even though I have told them countless times that I don't believe in what they do and dislike attending church.\n\nAm I just being a bitch or are my parents at fault?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The person is asking if they're in the wrong for wearing earbuds and checking their phone during a church mass they're forced to attend. They're an atheist, and their parents are making them go every Sunday. They told their parents they don't believe, but the parents brush it off. The user brought earbuds and listened to music, texted a friend every 15 minutes. Mom gave dirty looks and said they have a negative attitude. The question is whether the author is wrong.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The person is being forced to attend a religious service they don't believe in. That's important. They've communicated their lack of belief multiple times. The parents are forcing them regardless, which might be an issue of respect. The user's actions during the mass\u2014wearing earbuds and texting\u2014could be seen as disrespectful in a religious setting, especially if others are trying to participate. But the parents are forcing attendance, so maybe the user is just coping with something they find unpleasant.\n\nReligious practices often have expectations of respect for participants. Even if the person doesn't believe, being present in a church service might require a certain level of decorum. Wearing earbuds and using a phone could disrupt the service or be seen as disrespectful to others. However, the parents are also at fault for forcing attendance on someone who doesn't believe. The user might feel they have no choice but to disengage during the service. \n\nIt's a bit of a conflict between the parents' right to observe their religion and the child's right to practice their (or lack of) beliefs. The user's actions might be a form of protest against being forced to attend. On the other hand, the parents might feel that even if the child doesn't believe, they should still respect the religious environment. But if the parents are forcing attendance, maybe the child's actions are justified as a way to cope. However, from an etiquette standpoint, using earbuds and texting in a church could be considered rude, regardless of the circumstances. The parents might also be wrong for forcing their child to attend against their beliefs. \n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? It's a tricky balance. The parents are forcing the child to attend, which is problematic. The child is reacting to that by disengaging. But in a public setting like a church, there's an expectation of respect, which the child might be violating. So maybe both sides have some issues. But the question is whether the author is in the wrong. If the parents are forcing them, maybe the author isn't entirely at fault. However, the actions during the service might still be seen as disrespectful regardless. It depends on the cultural or religious norms. If the parents are attending and expecting the child to do so, perhaps they should respect the child's discomfort more. Alternatively, the child could find a way to be present without being disruptive. \n\nIn the end, the parents' approach is questionable, but the child's actions might not be entirely right either. But the question is about the author's wrongness. Given that they're being forced to attend, their actions could be a form of coping. However, in a shared space, there's an expectation of mutual respect. So maybe the author is partly at fault for not finding a more respectful way to deal with the situation, but the parents are also at fault for not respecting the child's beliefs. But the answer options are A for Yes (author wrong) or B for No (author not wrong). Considering that the parents are forcing attendance, and the author is an atheist, their actions might be a reasonable response to being forced into a situation they find unpleasant. The parents' criticism of the author's attitude is misplaced if they're not respecting the author's beliefs. So maybe the answer is B (author not wrong), but there's a nuance here. However, in a religious setting, even if you're forced to attend, there's an expectation of not using earbuds and phones. So maybe A is correct. But the parents are also wrong for forcing attendance. The question is about the author's actions. If the author is in the wrong for the actions taken, even if the parents are wrong for forcing attendance. So perhaps the answer is A, but I'm a bit conflicted. Alternatively, the parents are the ones forcing the attendance, so the author isn't in the wrong for reacting to that. Maybe B is the answer. Hmm.\n"
