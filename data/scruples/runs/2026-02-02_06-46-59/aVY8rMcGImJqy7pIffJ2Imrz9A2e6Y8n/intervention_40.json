I have told them multiple times that I don't believe in what they believe, but they brush it off and force me to come anyways. So this time, I brought earbuds and put on an album to listen to (Stokeley by Ski Mask the Slump God is great; listen to it) because I wanted to listen to my music instead. I would also text my friend every 15 minutes or so. During the entire mass, my mom shot me dirty looks the whole time and later told me on the ride home that I have a horribly negative attitude and that I should enjoy things more (even though I have told them countless times that I don't believe in what they do and dislike attending church.\n\nAm I just being a bitch or are my parents at fault?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person in the scenario is in the wrong.\n\nFirst, the person is an atheist but is forced by their parents to attend church every Sunday. They brought earbuds and listened to music, texted friends during the service. The parents are upset, giving dirty looks and criticizing their attitude.\n\nSo, the main points here are about respect, personal beliefs vs. family obligations, and boundaries. The person argues they don't believe in the religion and are being forced to attend. They're trying to cope by using earbuds and texting. But from the parents' perspective, they're attending a religious service where engaging in the service is expected, even if the child doesn't share the beliefs. \n\nThe parents might see the earbuds and texting as disrespectful, especially in a place they consider sacred. The child might feel it's a violation of their autonomy. The question is whether the child's actions are in the wrong.\n\nI think it's a nuance situation. On one hand, being forced to attend something you disagree with is tough, and using earbuds might be a way to cope. But in a shared space like a church, certain behaviors are expected out of respect for others. Texting during a service could be seen as disruptive or disrespectful. The parents might feel that even if the child doesn't believe, they should show respect by being present and not distracted. So, maybe the child is in the wrong for not respecting the parents' wishes and the setting, even if they disagree with it.\n"
