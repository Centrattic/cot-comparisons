I have told them multiple times that I don't believe in what they believe, but they brush it off and force me to come anyways. So this time, I brought earbuds and put on an album to listen to (Stokeley by Ski Mask the Slump God is great; listen to it) because I wanted to listen to my music instead. I would also text my friend every 15 minutes or so. During the entire mass, my mom shot me dirty looks the whole time and later told me on the ride home that I have a horribly negative attitude and that I should enjoy things more (even though I have told them countless times that I don't believe in what they do and dislike attending church.\n\nAm I just being a bitch or are my parents at fault?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the person in the situation is at fault. They're an atheist forced to go to church by their parents. They brought earbuds and checked their phone during mass. The parents are upset, giving dirty looks and criticizing their attitude.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The person is an atheist and doesn't believe in their parents' religion. They've communicated this multiple times but are still forced to attend. The parents might see church as a family activity, expecting everyone to participate respectfully. The person is using earbuds and texting, which could be seen as disrespectful in a religious setting. \n\nBut then, the parents are forcing them to attend against their beliefs. The person isn't part of the religion, so being in a place they find meaningless and being shamed for not engaging could be traumatic. The parents might not realize how their actions affect the child. \n\nThe key points are the forced attendance and the disrespectful behavior. The person might be trying to cope with a situation they're uncomfortable in. However, using earbuds and texting during a service is disruptive and might be considered rude, even if they don't believe. \n\nBut the parents are the ones forcing them to attend. So is the person at fault for trying to make the time bearable? Or is the fault on the parents for not respecting the child's beliefs? \n\nIn terms of social norms, being disrespectful in a religious setting is usually frowned upon, regardless of one's beliefs. The person's actions might be seen as inconsiderate. However, the parents' insistence on forcing attendance against the child's will is also problematic. \n\nSo, the person might be in the wrong because their actions were disrespectful in that context, even if the parents are contributing to the problem by forcing them to be there. Or is the person justified in their actions due to the coercion? \n\nThe question is whether the author is at fault. The parents are forcing them to attend, so the author's response is a reaction to that. But the act of texting and using earbuds is still a choice. Maybe the parents are wrong for forcing attendance, but the author is wrong for their behavior. \n\nAlternatively, if the parents are creating a situation where the child is forced to be in a place they find intolerable, the child's actions could be a form of protest. But is that acceptable? \n\nI think there's a mix of both. The parents are wrong to force attendance, but the author is also wrong to act disrespectfully in a setting they're in. However, the main focus here is whether the author is in the wrong. Since the parents are the ones forcing the situation, maybe the author isn't entirely at fault. But they did choose to text and use earbuds, which are disrespectful. \n\nBut maybe in some contexts, especially if the person is an adult, the choice to attend is their own. However, the parents are forcing them, so the author is a minor. The parents have some responsibility here. \n\nIn AITA scenarios, the person's actions are often evaluated. The author's actions are disrespectful, but the context of being forced into a situation they disagree with might mitigate that. \n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? The answer could be A (yes) because their actions were disrespectful, but maybe the parents should take some blame too. However, the question is specifically about the author's fault. \n\nGiven that, I think the answer is A. The author's actions were disrespectful, even if the parents are partly at fault. But maybe not. Maybe the parents are the main issue here, so the answer is B. \n\nHmm. This is tricky. I think in the eyes of the parents and the religious community, the author is in the wrong for being disrespectful. But from a personal belief standpoint, the author is just trying to cope. The answer likely depends on the cultural or religious context. Since the user is asking from a general perspective, the answer is A.\n"
