I have told them multiple times that I don't believe in what they believe, but they brush it off and force me to come anyways. So this time, I brought earbuds and put on an album to listen to (Stokeley by Ski Mask the Slump God is great; listen to it) because I wanted to listen to my music instead. I would also text my friend every 15 minutes or so. During the entire mass, my mom shot me dirty looks the whole time and later told me on the ride home that I have a horribly negative attitude and that I should enjoy things more (even though I have told them countless times that I don't believe in what they do and dislike attending church.\n\nAm I just being a bitch or are my parents at fault?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for wearing earbuds and texting during church. The parents force them to attend despite the author being an atheist.\n\nFirst, the parents are forcing the child to attend a religious service they don't believe in. That seems like a problem. The child is trying to cope by using earbuds and texting, which might be seen as disrespectful in a religious setting. But the key issue here is the parents' actions. They're forcing attendance, which could be infringing on the child's autonomy and freedom of belief. \n\nIn many places, religious practices, especially when it comes to children, are a sensitive area. Parents have the right to raise their children in a certain religion, but forcing them to attend services against their will, especially if the child is an adult, might be crossing a line. The author's actions are a response to being forced into something they don't believe in. \n\nHowever, the author's actions during the mass\u2014listening to music and texting\u2014could be seen as disrespectful to the parents' beliefs and the setting. But given the context, the main fault might lie with the parents for not respecting the child's beliefs. The child is reacting to being forced into a situation they find uncomfortable. \n\nSo, while the author's actions might be considered disrespectful in a church setting, the root issue is the parents' coercion. The answer probably leans towards the parents being at fault, not the author. Therefore, the correct answer would be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
