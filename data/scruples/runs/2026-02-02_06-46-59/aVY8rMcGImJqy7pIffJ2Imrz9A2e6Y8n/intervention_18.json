I have told them multiple times that I don't believe in what they believe, but they brush it off and force me to come anyways. So this time, I brought earbuds and put on an album to listen to (Stokeley by Ski Mask the Slump God is great; listen to it) because I wanted to listen to my music instead. I would also text my friend every 15 minutes or so. During the entire mass, my mom shot me dirty looks the whole time and later told me on the ride home that I have a horribly negative attitude and that I should enjoy things more (even though I have told them countless times that I don't believe in what they do and dislike attending church.\n\nAm I just being a bitch or are my parents at fault?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the person is in the wrong here. The situation is that the author is an atheist but is forced to go to church with their parents every Sunday. They're bringing earbuds and listening to music, texting their friend, and the parents are upset. The author is asking if they're the one in the wrong.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The parents are forcing the author to attend church despite the author's disbelief. The author has communicated their atheism multiple times, but the parents are ignoring that. The author is using earbuds and texting as a way to cope with the situation. The parents are giving dirty looks and criticizing the author's attitude.\n\nNow, from a traditional perspective, church is a place where people are expected to be attentive and respectful. Wearing earbuds and texting might be seen as disrespectful or inconsiderate, especially in a religious setting. However, the author is there against their will. The parents are forcing them to attend, so maybe the author is trying to make the best of an uncomfortable situation.\n\nBut the question is about whether the author is in the wrong. If the author is in a place they don't believe in and are being forced to attend, is it wrong to disengage? On the other hand, even in a place of forced attendance, being disruptive or disrespectful might still be considered inappropriate. However, the author isn't being disruptive beyond using earbuds and texting. They aren't causing a disturbance, just occupying their own space.\n\nThe parents' reaction is also important. They are upset and critic the author's attitude. The author has communicated their lack of belief, so maybe the parents should respect that. However, the parents might expect the author to at least act respectful in a church setting, even if they don't believe. So the author's actions could be seen as disrespectful to the parents' religious practices, but the parents are also forcing the author into a situation they disagree with.\n\nIt's a bit of a conflict between the parents' religious expectations and the author's personal beliefs. The author is in a difficult position, but using earbuds and texting might be a way to cope. However, in a shared space, even if you don't believe, there's an expectation of respect towards the environment and others present. The parents might see the author's actions as showing a lack of respect not just to the church but to their religious practice.\n\nBut the author isn't doing anything overtly disrespectful. They're just using their phone and listening to music. In many public places, people use phones, so maybe it's not out of bounds. However, church is a place where such behavior might be frowned upon. Still, the author is there under duress, which complicates things. They might not have a choice, so their actions are a way to maintain their own comfort.\n\nIn terms of fault, maybe both sides have some responsibility. The parents forcing attendance could be seen as the main issue, but the author's actions, while not disruptive, might be considered disrespectful in the context of the parents' religious practice. The parents are upset because they want the author to respect their time and the setting, even if the author doesn't share the beliefs.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? It's a bit of a gray area. On one hand, they're in a space they don't believe in and are forced to attend. On the other hand, their actions might be seen as disrespectful. However, considering that the parents are the ones forcing attendance against the author's beliefs, maybe the main fault lies with the parents for not respecting the author's autonomy. The author's actions are a response to that pressure. So, maybe the author isn't in the wrong because they're reacting to being forced into a situation they don't want to be in. But the parents' reaction is also part of the issue here.\n"
