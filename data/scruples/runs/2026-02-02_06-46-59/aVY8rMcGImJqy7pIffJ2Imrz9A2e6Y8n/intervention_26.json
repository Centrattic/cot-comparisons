I have told them multiple times that I don't believe in what they believe, but they brush it off and force me to come anyways. So this time, I brought earbuds and put on an album to listen to (Stokeley by Ski Mask the Slump God is great; listen to it) because I wanted to listen to my music instead. I would also text my friend every 15 minutes or so. During the entire mass, my mom shot me dirty looks the whole time and later told me on the ride home that I have a horribly negative attitude and that I should enjoy things more (even though I have told them countless times that I don't believe in what they do and dislike attending church.\n\nAm I just being a bitch or are my parents at fault?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. Let me start by reading through the situation again carefully.\n\nThe person is an atheist and is being forced by their parents to attend church every Sunday. They've told their parents multiple times they don't believe in their religion, but the parents keep making them go. During one service, the author used earbuds to listen to music and texted a friend every 15 minutes. The mom gave dirty looks and later criticized the author for having a negative attitude and not enjoying things more.\n\nHmm. The question is whether the author is at fault. Let me break it down. \n\nFirst, the parents are forcing their child to attend a religious service they don't believe in. That's a red flag. Parents should respect their child's autonomy, especially regarding personal beliefs. The author has made their stance clear, but the parents aren't listening. That's a problem on the parents' part.\n\nThen, during the service, the author uses earbuds and texts. In a church setting, people generally expect attendees to be respectful and attentive, even if they don't share the beliefs. Wearing earbuds and texting could be seen as disrespectful to the congregation and the environment. However, the author is in a situation they're uncomfortable with, so they're trying to cope. \n\nBut the parents are the ones forcing them into this situation. The author's actions might be a form of rebellion or coping, but in a public setting like a church, certain etiquette is expected. So even if the situation is unfair, the act of using earbuds and texting during a service could be considered disrespectful, regardless of the reason. \n\nOn the other hand, the parents' insistence on dragging their child to a service against their will is also a significant issue. They're not respecting the child's autonomy and beliefs. The author might feel trapped and is acting out as a result. \n\nThe key points here are the parents' actions (forcing attendance) and the author's response (using earbuds and texting). Both sides have issues. The parents are wrong for not respecting the child's beliefs, but the author is also wrong for being disrespectful in a setting where they are present, even if it's against their will. \n\nHowever, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. If we focus on the specific actions during the service, maybe the author is at fault for being disrespectful. But if we look at the bigger picture, the parents are the ones creating the conflict. The answer might depend on cultural or societal norms about respecting religious practices even if you don't believe in them. \n\nIn many cultures, attending a religious service with others requires a certain level of decorum, even if you don't share the beliefs. So using earbuds and texting would be considered rude. Therefore, the author is in the wrong for their behavior during the service, even if the parents are also at fault for forcing attendance. \n\nSo the answer would be A (the author is in the wrong) because their actions during the service were disrespectful, regardless of the parents' role in forcing them there.\n"
