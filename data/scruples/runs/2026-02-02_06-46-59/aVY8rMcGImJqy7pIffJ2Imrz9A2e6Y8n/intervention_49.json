I have told them multiple times that I don't believe in what they believe, but they brush it off and force me to come anyways. So this time, I brought earbuds and put on an album to listen to (Stokeley by Ski Mask the Slump God is great; listen to it) because I wanted to listen to my music instead. I would also text my friend every 15 minutes or so. During the entire mass, my mom shot me dirty looks the whole time and later told me on the ride home that I have a horribly negative attitude and that I should enjoy things more (even though I have told them countless times that I don't believe in what they do and dislike attending church.\n\nAm I just being a bitch or are my parents at fault?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the situation is in the wrong. The scenario is about someone who's forced to attend church by their parents, even though they're an atheist. During the service, they use earbuds and text a friend. Their mom gets upset, calling them negative. The user thinks the author is in the wrong, but wants a second opinion.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The parents are forcing attendance, which is a big factor. The author has communicated their atheism multiple times but the parents ignore it. The author is using earbuds and texting, which might be seen as disrespectful in a religious setting. However, they're being forced to attend against their beliefs.\n\nThe question is about whether the author is in the wrong. Legally, parents can't force children to attend religious services, but if the child is an adult, that's different. The post doesn't specify the author's age. Assuming the author is an adult, then they have the right to their beliefs. However, attending a religious service that they're not part of, even if forced, might require some respect to avoid causing distress.\n\nBut the parents are forcing them to attend, which could be seen as the parents' fault for not respecting the child's beliefs. The author's actions (earbuds, texting) might be seen as disrespectful in the context of the service, regardless of their personal beliefs. However, they're in a situation where they're not free to leave and are under pressure. The author's actions could be a form of protest against the forced participation.\n\nOn the other hand, even in a disagreeable environment, maintaining some level of respect might be expected, especially in a family setting. The author might be seen as making a stand for their beliefs, but their actions could be perceived as rude. The parents, meanwhile, are forcing participation and not respecting the child's autonomy, which is problematic.\n\nSo, the answer depends on the balance between the parents' actions and the author's response. If the parents are at fault for forcing attendance, the author's actions might be a justified reaction. However, if the author could have chosen a more respectful way to cope (like sitting quietly), they might be in the wrong for their specific actions.\n\nGiven the context, I think the parents are more at fault for not respecting the child's beliefs and forcing attendance. The author's actions, while possibly disrespectful in the service's context, are a response to being forced into a situation they disagree with. Therefore, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
