I have told them multiple times that I don't believe in what they believe, but they brush it off and force me to come anyways. So this time, I brought earbuds and put on an album to listen to (Stokeley by Ski Mask the Slump God is great; listen to it) because I wanted to listen to my music instead. I would also text my friend every 15 minutes or so. During the entire mass, my mom shot me dirty looks the whole time and later told me on the ride home that I have a horribly negative attitude and that I should enjoy things more (even though I have told them countless times that I don't believe in what they do and dislike attending church.\n\nAm I just being a bitch or are my parents at fault?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the \"Am I the Asshole?\" post is in the wrong. The situation is that the author is an atheist forced to attend church by their parents, and during the mass, they wear earbuds and check their phone. The parents are upset, especially the mom, who gave dirty looks and later criticized the author's attitude.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author is being forced to attend a religious service they don't believe in. That's a key point. Being forced to participate in something you don't agree with can be stressful. The author is using earbuds and texting as a way to cope or pass the time. But the parents see this as disrespectful or having a negative attitude.\n\nNow, from a traditional standpoint, churches often expect attendees to be attentive and respectful during services. Using phones and earbuds might be seen as disruptive or disrespectful, even if the person isn't religious. However, the parents are forcing their child to attend, which could be problematic. The child is disengaged not out of malice but because they're being made to be there against their beliefs.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? Well, if we look at societal norms, attending a church service usually involves following certain etiquette, like not using phones. The author's actions might be seen as violating those norms. But the parents are also forcing their child to attend, which is a form of pressure that might not be healthy. The author is disengaging as a way to cope with being forced into a situation they disagree with.\n\nOn one hand, the author is within their rights to feel uncomfortable and find ways to handle that discomfort. On the other hand, the method they used might be disrespectful in the context of a church service. However, the core issue is the parents forcing attendance despite the child's beliefs. The author's actions are a reaction to that pressure.\n\nIn terms of responsibility, the parents are forcing the child to attend, which is the root problem. The child's disengagement is a response to that. But if the parents are expecting the child to participate respectfully, even if they don't believe, then the child's actions could be seen as disrespectful. However, given the context of being forced to attend, it's a bit of a complex situation.\n\nI think the answer hinges on whose actions are more at fault. The parents are forcing their child to attend against their beliefs, which is problematic. The child's response, while perhaps not the most respectful in a church setting, is a reaction to that pressure. However, if the question is whether the author is in the wrong, considering the norms of attending a church service, their actions might be seen as disrespectful. But if considering the broader context, the parents are the ones forcing the situation. However, the question is specifically about the author's actions during the service, not the parents' decision to force attendance. So in the immediate context, the author's actions could be seen as disrespectful, hence in the wrong. But if the parents are the ones forcing it, maybe not. Hmm. It's a tough call. I think the answer is A, the author is in the wrong because their actions during the service were disrespectful, even if forced by the parents.\n"
