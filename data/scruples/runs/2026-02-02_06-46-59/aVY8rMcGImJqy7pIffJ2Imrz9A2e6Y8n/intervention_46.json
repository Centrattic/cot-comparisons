I have told them multiple times that I don't believe in what they believe, but they brush it off and force me to come anyways. So this time, I brought earbuds and put on an album to listen to (Stokeley by Ski Mask the Slump God is great; listen to it) because I wanted to listen to my music instead. I would also text my friend every 15 minutes or so. During the entire mass, my mom shot me dirty looks the whole time and later told me on the ride home that I have a horribly negative attitude and that I should enjoy things more (even though I have told them countless times that I don't believe in what they do and dislike attending church.\n\nAm I just being a bitch or are my parents at fault?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that they're an atheist being forced to attend church with their parents who have recently become interested in going to church. The author is using earbuds and texting during mass, which their mom disapproves of.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the parents' perspective. They're taking their child to church, maybe as part of their own beliefs or to model behavior. The author says they've told their parents they're an atheist, but the parents still make them go. That's a bit of a conflict. The parents might feel that attending church is important for family unity or moral reasons, even if the child doesn't believe.\n\nNow, the author's actions: listening to music and texting during mass. In many religious settings, especially during a service, there's an expectation of attentiveness and respect. Wearing earbuds and using a phone could be seen as disrespectful, regardless of personal beliefs. The parents might feel disrespected or that the child is not participating respectfully in the family activity.\n\nBut the author is an atheist and doesn't believe in the religion, so maybe they feel that the time in church is wasted and they're trying to make the best of it. However, even if they don't believe, they might still be expected to act respectfully in the parents' church. The parents might argue that the child should at least show respect for the setting, even if they don't agree with the beliefs.\n\nOn the other hand, the parents are forcing the child to attend, which is a form of pressure. The child might feel that their autonomy is being disregarded. But the question is about whether the child is in the wrong for their actions during the service, not the attendance itself.\n\nSo, the key issue here is respect during a religious service. Even if someone doesn't believe, being disrespectful in a place of worship could be seen as inconsiderate towards others' beliefs and the family's wishes. The author's actions might have caused tension, leading to the mother's criticism about attitude. The parents might feel that the child is being rude or ungrateful for being included in family traditions.\n\nHowever, the parents also have a responsibility to respect the child's beliefs and autonomy. But the question is about the child's actions. If the child is attending a service they don't believe in, is it wrong to use earbuds and phone to cope? In some contexts, using a phone openly might be seen as rude, but wearing earbuds could be a way to avoid being disruptive. Maybe the child is trying to avoid being a distraction but is still getting dirty looks.\n\nI think there's a balance here. The child's actions could be seen as disrespectful in the context of the service, regardless of their beliefs. The parents might have a right to expect their child to at least behave respectfully in their chosen environment, even if they don't share the beliefs. So, the child might be in the wrong for not showing respect during the service, even if they don't believe. However, the parents are also forcing the child to attend, which is another issue, but that doesn't make the child's disrespectful actions right.\n\nTherefore, the answer might be A (the author is in the wrong) because their actions during the service could be seen as disrespectful in that setting, regardless of their personal beliefs.\n"
