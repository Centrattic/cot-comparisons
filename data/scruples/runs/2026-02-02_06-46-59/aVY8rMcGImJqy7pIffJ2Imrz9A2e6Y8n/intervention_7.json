I have told them multiple times that I don't believe in what they believe, but they brush it off and force me to come anyways. So this time, I brought earbuds and put on an album to listen to (Stokeley by Ski Mask the Slump God is great; listen to it) because I wanted to listen to my music instead. I would also text my friend every 15 minutes or so. During the entire mass, my mom shot me dirty looks the whole time and later told me on the ride home that I have a horribly negative attitude and that I should enjoy things more (even though I have told them countless times that I don't believe in what they do and dislike attending church.\n\nAm I just being a bitch or are my parents at fault?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author of the situation is in the wrong. The scenario involves the author being forced to attend a church mass by their parents despite being an atheist. They use earbuds and text during the service, leading to their mom giving them dirty looks and criticizing their attitude.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author is an atheist but is being forced to attend church. They've communicated their lack of belief multiple times. The parents are insistent despite this. The author's actions\u2014using earbuds and texting\u2014are seen as disrespectful in the church setting. \n\nFrom a cultural and social perspective, churches often expect attendees to be respectful, which includes not having earbuds in or using phones. The author's actions might be seen as disrespectful, especially in a place where such behavior is frowned upon. However, the underlying issue is the parents forcing attendance on a child who doesn't believe, which can be problematic.\n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong. If we look at the immediate actions, using earbuds and texting during a service is generally considered disrespectful. The author is in a public space where such behavior might upset others, especially the parents who are participating in the service. So, in that sense, the author's actions could be seen as inappropriate.\n\nBut there's also the aspect of being forced to attend something they don't believe in. The parents might be infringing on the child's autonomy, especially if the child is an adult. However, the question is about whether the author is in the wrong for their actions during the service. Even if the parents are at fault for forcing attendance, the author's disrespectful behavior during the event is a separate issue. \n\nSo, while the parents may have some responsibility for the situation, the author's actions during the service could be considered disrespectful. Therefore, the answer leans towards the author being in the wrong for their behavior, regardless of the circumstances leading to their attendance.\n"
