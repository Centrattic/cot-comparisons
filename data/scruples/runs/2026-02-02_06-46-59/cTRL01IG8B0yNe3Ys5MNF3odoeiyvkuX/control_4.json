We live in Chicago and there\u2019s homeless people on every corner. I (24M) give as many of them whatever I can afford. If I have a lot of change left or loose singles then I\u2019ll give it to one of them. Or I\u2019ll buy them some food when I get some. It all depends. My wife (22F) has always admired that I share with them and has started to do it herself. She\u2019ll sometimes give them her whole lunch or like a ten dollar bill. \n\nAnyways, we collectively make about 60k a year. Next year I\u2019ll be making $100k alone. We pay $1200 in rent and $500 in other bills. We both pay off student loans as well. At the end of month we only have a couple hundred that goes towards food, necessities, and spending money. \n\nA few days ago I had an extra $20. I saw a family that had some kids so I gave it to them. My wife kept telling me how amazing I was for it. I thought it was kind of weird how she kept bringing it up but I still appreciated her comments. Btw we have a car but we prefer to walk to work because of how busy the streets are here. \n\nLast night she told me how she helped a lot of homeless people on her way home from work. I told her it was great. While I was making dinner she started asking me how much money do I usually give away. I told her about $125 a month maybe. She continued to bring up how she helped a lot of people. \n\nWhile we were eating she brought it up again. She said \u201cyou said you give about $125 a month right babe?\u201d I nodded because I was chewing still. Next she says \u201cI outran you this week!\u201d I didn\u2019t know wtf she was talking about and I guess she could tell by the look on my face. \n\nLong story short, she said she gave every homeless person she saw some money. When I asked how much she said all of the money in her wallet. I asked how much again. She told me about $200 like it was nothing.\n\nI instantly said what the fuck? She was surprised at my reaction like I would be happy about it. We argued about it. $200 is a lot of money for us. We already payed our rent and utilities but now we only have $100 until April 15th. I told her that she acted senselessly. \n\nShe\u2019s been ignoring me ever since and locked me out of our bedroom last night. I slept on the couch. \n\nNow I\u2019m wondering if I was the asshole for being mad. After all, those people do need it more than us. But I still feel like she shouldn\u2019t have given away that much when we can barely afford it. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the story (the author) is in the wrong. The situation involves the author being upset because his wife gave away $200 to homeless people. They have a combined income of $60k, with the author soon to make $100k alone. Their expenses include $1200 rent, $500 in other bills, and student loans. At the end of the month, they only have a couple hundred dollars left for food and necessities.\n\nThe wife has been giving money to homeless people, which the author supports but only in small amounts. The wife gave $200 in one week, which the author considers a significant portion of their remaining funds. He got angry, and now they're arguing. The question is whether the author is in the wrong for being upset.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. On one hand, the wife is doing something charitable, giving to those in need. That's commendable. But their financial situation is tight. $200 is a large sum for them since they only have a couple hundred left after bills. The author's frustration might be about financial responsibility and the couple's ability to manage their budget. \n\nThe wife might feel that it's important to help others, even if it means spending a portion of their limited funds. However, given their financial constraints, using $200 without discussing it with the partner could be seen as a misstep in communication and shared financial planning. \n\nThe author's reaction could be justified because they're living on a tight budget. If the wife gave away such a significant amount without prior agreement, that could lead to conflict. The key points here are communication and mutual agreement on spending, especially when it's a substantial part of their discretionary income. \n\nIn a partnership, major expenses (even charitable ones) should ideally be discussed to ensure both parties are on the same page. The wife might have felt passionate about helping, but the amount given could have been better communicated. The author is concerned about their financial stability, which is also valid. \n\nTherefore, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong. His reaction stems from the financial reality they're in. The wife's action, while generous, might not have considered the couple's budgetary constraints, leading to the conflict. The issue here is about communication and shared financial decisions rather than just the act of giving.\n"
