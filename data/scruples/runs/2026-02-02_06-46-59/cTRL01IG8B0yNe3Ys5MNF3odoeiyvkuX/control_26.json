We live in Chicago and there\u2019s homeless people on every corner. I (24M) give as many of them whatever I can afford. If I have a lot of change left or loose singles then I\u2019ll give it to one of them. Or I\u2019ll buy them some food when I get some. It all depends. My wife (22F) has always admired that I share with them and has started to do it herself. She\u2019ll sometimes give them her whole lunch or like a ten dollar bill. \n\nAnyways, we collectively make about 60k a year. Next year I\u2019ll be making $100k alone. We pay $1200 in rent and $500 in other bills. We both pay off student loans as well. At the end of month we only have a couple hundred that goes towards food, necessities, and spending money. \n\nA few days ago I had an extra $20. I saw a family that had some kids so I gave it to them. My wife kept telling me how amazing I was for it. I thought it was kind of weird how she kept bringing it up but I still appreciated her comments. Btw we have a car but we prefer to walk to work because of how busy the streets are here. \n\nLast night she told me how she helped a lot of homeless people on her way home from work. I told her it was great. While I was making dinner she started asking me how much money do I usually give away. I told her about $125 a month maybe. She continued to bring up how she helped a lot of people. \n\nWhile we were eating she brought it up again. She said \u201cyou said you give about $125 a month right babe?\u201d I nodded because I was chewing still. Next she says \u201cI outran you this week!\u201d I didn\u2019t know wtf she was talking about and I guess she could tell by the look on my face. \n\nLong story short, she said she gave every homeless person she saw some money. When I asked how much she said all of the money in her wallet. I asked how much again. She told me about $200 like it was nothing.\n\nI instantly said what the fuck? She was surprised at my reaction like I would be happy about it. We argued about it. $200 is a lot of money for us. We already payed our rent and utilities but now we only have $100 until April 15th. I told her that she acted senselessly. \n\nShe\u2019s been ignoring me ever since and locked me out of our bedroom last night. I slept on the couch. \n\nNow I\u2019m wondering if I was the asshole for being mad. After all, those people do need it more than us. But I still feel like she shouldn\u2019t have given away that much when we can barely afford it. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. Let me start by reading through the situation again carefully.\n\nThe couple makes about $60k a year together, with the husband set to earn $100k next year. They have $1200 rent, $500 in other bills, and they both pay off student loans. At the end of the month, they have a couple hundred left for food, necessities, and spending. The husband gives around $125 a month to homeless people, and the wife recently gave $200 in a week. The husband got angry, thinking it's too much for their budget, while the wife was expecting praise. Now they're arguing.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both perspectives. The husband is concerned about their finances. They have a tight budget, and $200 in a week is significant. They only have $100 left until the 15th, which sounds like a short time to cover expenses. The wife's action might have caused financial stress. On the other hand, the wife was following the husband's example and wanted to help people in need. She might feel that the husband's disapproval is contradictory since he supports giving when it's less.\n\nI should check if the husband's reaction is reasonable. The couple's finances are limited, so unexpected expenses like $200 could lead to issues. The husband might feel that the wife didn't consult him about such a large expenditure, especially since they share financial responsibilities. The wife giving away all the cash in her wallet without considering the family's needs could be seen as impulsive. However, the wife might see her actions as compassionate and not realizing the financial impact.\n\nThe key points here are financial responsibility and communication. The husband might be right to be upset because sudden large donations without discussing them could lead to financial strain. The wife might not have considered the family's budget constraints, even if her intentions were good. The fact that they live in a city with many homeless people and both have been giving before complicates things. The wife's action was more significant in amount, though.\n\nSo, is the husband in the wrong for being angry? Or is he justified? The question is whether his reaction is appropriate. The wife gave away a large sum without consultation, which could be seen as irresponsible in their financial situation. The husband's anger stems from concern for their shared finances. However, the wife might feel that her actions were altruistic and that the husband's reaction is harsh. \n\nI think the husband isn't in the wrong here. The couple needs to discuss their financial boundaries and how much they're willing to give. The wife should have considered their budget, and the husband's reaction, while maybe harsh, is a valid concern given their financial situation. So, the answer would be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
