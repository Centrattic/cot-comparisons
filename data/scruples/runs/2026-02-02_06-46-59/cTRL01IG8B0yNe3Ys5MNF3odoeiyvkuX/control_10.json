We live in Chicago and there\u2019s homeless people on every corner. I (24M) give as many of them whatever I can afford. If I have a lot of change left or loose singles then I\u2019ll give it to one of them. Or I\u2019ll buy them some food when I get some. It all depends. My wife (22F) has always admired that I share with them and has started to do it herself. She\u2019ll sometimes give them her whole lunch or like a ten dollar bill. \n\nAnyways, we collectively make about 60k a year. Next year I\u2019ll be making $100k alone. We pay $1200 in rent and $500 in other bills. We both pay off student loans as well. At the end of month we only have a couple hundred that goes towards food, necessities, and spending money. \n\nA few days ago I had an extra $20. I saw a family that had some kids so I gave it to them. My wife kept telling me how amazing I was for it. I thought it was kind of weird how she kept bringing it up but I still appreciated her comments. Btw we have a car but we prefer to walk to work because of how busy the streets are here. \n\nLast night she told me how she helped a lot of homeless people on her way home from work. I told her it was great. While I was making dinner she started asking me how much money do I usually give away. I told her about $125 a month maybe. She continued to bring up how she helped a lot of people. \n\nWhile we were eating she brought it up again. She said \u201cyou said you give about $125 a month right babe?\u201d I nodded because I was chewing still. Next she says \u201cI outran you this week!\u201d I didn\u2019t know wtf she was talking about and I guess she could tell by the look on my face. \n\nLong story short, she said she gave every homeless person she saw some money. When I asked how much she said all of the money in her wallet. I asked how much again. She told me about $200 like it was nothing.\n\nI instantly said what the fuck? She was surprised at my reaction like I would be happy about it. We argued about it. $200 is a lot of money for us. We already payed our rent and utilities but now we only have $100 until April 15th. I told her that she acted senselessly. \n\nShe\u2019s been ignoring me ever since and locked me out of our bedroom last night. I slept on the couch. \n\nNow I\u2019m wondering if I was the asshole for being mad. After all, those people do need it more than us. But I still feel like she shouldn\u2019t have given away that much when we can barely afford it. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. Let's break down the situation. The couple makes $60k a year and next year the guy will be making $100k alone. They have rent and bills that take up a significant portion of their income. The husband gives around $125 a month to homeless people, which the wife admires. She starts doing her own charity, but then one day she gives away $200 in a week. The husband is upset because they can barely afford their expenses, leading to an argument and them sleeping separately.\n\nFirst, the context of their finances is important. They have a tight budget. Rent is $1200 and other bills $500, plus student loans. After that, they have only a couple hundred for food and essentials. So $200 is a non-trivial amount for them. The wife gave all the money in her wallet, which was $200, to homeless people in one week. The husband is upset because this seems like an irresponsible use of their money when they're already stretched thin. \n\nThe wife's perspective might be that she's helping people in need, and she's been inspired by her husband's actions. She might not realize the financial impact of such a large sum suddenly. On the other hand, the husband is managing their finances and sees this as a mistake, especially since they have upcoming expenses until April 15th. \n\nThe question is whether the husband is wrong to be angry. From a financial responsibility standpoint, giving away $200 when they can't afford it might be unwise. But the wife might see it as compassionate. The key factors are communication and financial planning. If they didn't discuss their budget or charitable giving, then maybe the wife didn't consider the financial impact. However, the husband could have been more open about their budget to ensure both are on the same page. \n\nThe answer likely hinges on whether the wife's action was reckless given their financial situation. Since the husband clearly states they can't afford it and this caused them to have only $100 left until April 15th, the wife's action was imprudent. The husband's anger is a reaction to a financial decision that affects both of them. Therefore, the wife might be at fault for not considering the budget, but the husband could also be at fault for not setting clearer boundaries. However, the main issue is the wife's $200 giving, which the husband sees as wrong. \n\nConsidering the options, the answer is probably B (the author is not in the wrong) because the wife's action was irresponsible with their shared finances, even if the intent was good. The husband is justified in being upset because they have to survive on a limited budget, and giving away a significant portion without discussion is problematic.\n"
