We live in Chicago and there\u2019s homeless people on every corner. I (24M) give as many of them whatever I can afford. If I have a lot of change left or loose singles then I\u2019ll give it to one of them. Or I\u2019ll buy them some food when I get some. It all depends. My wife (22F) has always admired that I share with them and has started to do it herself. She\u2019ll sometimes give them her whole lunch or like a ten dollar bill. \n\nAnyways, we collectively make about 60k a year. Next year I\u2019ll be making $100k alone. We pay $1200 in rent and $500 in other bills. We both pay off student loans as well. At the end of month we only have a couple hundred that goes towards food, necessities, and spending money. \n\nA few days ago I had an extra $20. I saw a family that had some kids so I gave it to them. My wife kept telling me how amazing I was for it. I thought it was kind of weird how she kept bringing it up but I still appreciated her comments. Btw we have a car but we prefer to walk to work because of how busy the streets are here. \n\nLast night she told me how she helped a lot of homeless people on her way home from work. I told her it was great. While I was making dinner she started asking me how much money do I usually give away. I told her about $125 a month maybe. She continued to bring up how she helped a lot of people. \n\nWhile we were eating she brought it up again. She said \u201cyou said you give about $125 a month right babe?\u201d I nodded because I was chewing still. Next she says \u201cI outran you this week!\u201d I didn\u2019t know wtf she was talking about and I guess she could tell by the look on my face. \n\nLong story short, she said she gave every homeless person she saw some money. When I asked how much she said all of the money in her wallet. I asked how much again. She told me about $200 like it was nothing.\n\nI instantly said what the fuck? She was surprised at my reaction like I would be happy about it. We argued about it. $200 is a lot of money for us. We already payed our rent and utilities but now we only have $100 until April 15th. I told her that she acted senselessly. \n\nShe\u2019s been ignoring me ever since and locked me out of our bedroom last night. I slept on the couch. \n\nNow I\u2019m wondering if I was the asshole for being mad. After all, those people do need it more than us. But I still feel like she shouldn\u2019t have given away that much when we can barely afford it. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. So the question is whether the author is in the wrong for being upset that his wife gave away $200 to homeless people. The user thinks the author is in the wrong, but I need to see if that's the case.\n\nFirst, let's look at their financial situation. They make $60k a year together, with the husband expecting to make $100k next year alone. Their rent is $1200 and other bills $500. They have student loans, and at the end of the month, they only have a couple hundred left for food and other expenses. So $200 is a significant chunk of their available money each month.\n\nThe wife gave $200 all at once, which the author found shocking. They had already paid rent and utilities, so the $200 was part of their remaining budget. The author is concerned about their financial stability, especially since they can barely afford their expenses. He argues that she acted senselessly, which makes sense because they have a tight budget.\n\nOn the other hand, the wife admires the author's charitable actions and started giving herself. She might feel that helping is important, and she was surprised the author was upset. She even mentions she \"outran\" him in giving, which implies she thought she was doing something praiseworthy.\n\nNow, the key issue is whether the author is wrong for being upset. Financial decisions in a relationship often require mutual agreement. If the wife gave away $200 without discussing it with her partner and it caused financial strain, then the author has a valid reason to be upset. However, if the wife believed she was acting in line with their shared values and didn't realize the impact, maybe the author should have communicated his concerns earlier.\n\nBut the author had previously given around $125 a month, and the wife gave $200 in a week. The amount she gave is double what he usually gives, which is a lot. The argument is about whether it's reasonable to give that amount without discussing it. The fact that they can barely afford their expenses suggests that $200 is a significant portion of their discretionary income. The author's reaction is about financial responsibility, while the wife's is about charity.\n\nIn many relationships, major financial decisions require discussion. Giving away $200 unexpectedly could be seen as not considering the partner's perspective. However, the wife might not have thought of it as a major expense, especially if she's been giving regularly. But given their budget, it's a large sum.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? If the wife didn't communicate her intent to give a large amount and it caused financial stress, then the author isn't wrong to be upset. The wife should have discussed such a significant expenditure. On the flip side, if they had shared values on charity and the author didn't set boundaries before, maybe he's responsible for not communicating that. But from the context, it seems like the author had given money before, but the wife's amount was much higher without prior discussion.\n\nTherefore, the author isn't in the wrong. The wife's action was impulsive and didn't consider their financial situation. The author has the right to be upset. So the answer would be B (the author is not in the wrong).\n"
