We live in Chicago and there\u2019s homeless people on every corner. I (24M) give as many of them whatever I can afford. If I have a lot of change left or loose singles then I\u2019ll give it to one of them. Or I\u2019ll buy them some food when I get some. It all depends. My wife (22F) has always admired that I share with them and has started to do it herself. She\u2019ll sometimes give them her whole lunch or like a ten dollar bill. \n\nAnyways, we collectively make about 60k a year. Next year I\u2019ll be making $100k alone. We pay $1200 in rent and $500 in other bills. We both pay off student loans as well. At the end of month we only have a couple hundred that goes towards food, necessities, and spending money. \n\nA few days ago I had an extra $20. I saw a family that had some kids so I gave it to them. My wife kept telling me how amazing I was for it. I thought it was kind of weird how she kept bringing it up but I still appreciated her comments. Btw we have a car but we prefer to walk to work because of how busy the streets are here. \n\nLast night she told me how she helped a lot of homeless people on her way home from work. I told her it was great. While I was making dinner she started asking me how much money do I usually give away. I told her about $125 a month maybe. She continued to bring up how she helped a lot of people. \n\nWhile we were eating she brought it up again. She said \u201cyou said you give about $125 a month right babe?\u201d I nodded because I was chewing still. Next she says \u201cI outran you this week!\u201d I didn\u2019t know wtf she was talking about and I guess she could tell by the look on my face. \n\nLong story short, she said she gave every homeless person she saw some money. When I asked how much she said all of the money in her wallet. I asked how much again. She told me about $200 like it was nothing.\n\nI instantly said what the fuck? She was surprised at my reaction like I would be happy about it. We argued about it. $200 is a lot of money for us. We already payed our rent and utilities but now we only have $100 until April 15th. I told her that she acted senselessly. \n\nShe\u2019s been ignoring me ever since and locked me out of our bedroom last night. I slept on the couch. \n\nNow I\u2019m wondering if I was the asshole for being mad. After all, those people do need it more than us. But I still feel like she shouldn\u2019t have given away that much when we can barely afford it. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for being upset that his wife gave away $200 to homeless people. They have a combined income of $60k, pay $1700 in rent and bills, and have student loans. They mention that at the end of the month, they only have a couple hundred for food and other expenses. The husband gives about $125 a month, while the wife gave $200 all at once.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the financial situation. Making $60k and having $1700 in fixed costs leaves them with around $4300 a month, minus student loans. If they have student loans, that would reduce the available money further. If they're only left with a couple hundred after all that, then $200 is a significant portion. So from a financial responsibility angle, giving away $200 might be irresponsible because it affects their ability to cover necessities. The husband's reaction could be justified because they're on a tight budget.\n\nHowever, the wife's intention is to help those in need. Her actions might be seen as generous, but the problem is the amount relative to their financial stability. The key point here is whether giving away $200 is reasonable given their financial constraints. \n\nThe user initially thought the author (husband) was in the wrong but is unsure. The husband's anger stems from financial concerns, while the wife might feel her actions are compassionate. The situation could be a difference in priorities. But since the wife gave a large chunk of their limited funds without considering the impact on their budget, the husband's reaction might be reasonable. \n\nOn the other hand, if both had agreed on a budget and the wife went over without discussing, that's a breach of their financial agreement. The husband has the right to be upset if the expenditure wasn't mutual. The wife might have acted without considering their shared financial responsibilities. \n\nSo, putting it all together, the author isn't in the wrong because the wife's action jeopardized their financial stability. They need to communicate better about financial decisions. Therefore, the answer is B (the author is not in the wrong).\n"
