We live in Chicago and there\u2019s homeless people on every corner. I (24M) give as many of them whatever I can afford. If I have a lot of change left or loose singles then I\u2019ll give it to one of them. Or I\u2019ll buy them some food when I get some. It all depends. My wife (22F) has always admired that I share with them and has started to do it herself. She\u2019ll sometimes give them her whole lunch or like a ten dollar bill. \n\nAnyways, we collectively make about 60k a year. Next year I\u2019ll be making $100k alone. We pay $1200 in rent and $500 in other bills. We both pay off student loans as well. At the end of month we only have a couple hundred that goes towards food, necessities, and spending money. \n\nA few days ago I had an extra $20. I saw a family that had some kids so I gave it to them. My wife kept telling me how amazing I was for it. I thought it was kind of weird how she kept bringing it up but I still appreciated her comments. Btw we have a car but we prefer to walk to work because of how busy the streets are here. \n\nLast night she told me how she helped a lot of homeless people on her way home from work. I told her it was great. While I was making dinner she started asking me how much money do I usually give away. I told her about $125 a month maybe. She continued to bring up how she helped a lot of people. \n\nWhile we were eating she brought it up again. She said \u201cyou said you give about $125 a month right babe?\u201d I nodded because I was chewing still. Next she says \u201cI outran you this week!\u201d I didn\u2019t know wtf she was talking about and I guess she could tell by the look on my face. \n\nLong story short, she said she gave every homeless person she saw some money. When I asked how much she said all of the money in her wallet. I asked how much again. She told me about $200 like it was nothing.\n\nI instantly said what the fuck? She was surprised at my reaction like I would be happy about it. We argued about it. $200 is a lot of money for us. We already payed our rent and utilities but now we only have $100 until April 15th. I told her that she acted senselessly. \n\nShe\u2019s been ignoring me ever since and locked me out of our bedroom last night. I slept on the couch. \n\nNow I\u2019m wondering if I was the asshole for being mad. After all, those people do need it more than us. But I still feel like she shouldn\u2019t have given away that much when we can barely afford it. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to figure this out. So the question is whether the author (the husband) is wrong for being upset that his wife gave $200 to homeless people. Let's break down the situation.\n\nFirst, the couple's financial situation: they make $60k a year together, but next year the husband will be making $100k alone. They pay $1200 rent and $500 in other bills, which totals $1700 a month. After rent and bills, they have a couple hundred left for food, necessities, and spending. That's not a lot. So when the wife gives away $200, which is a significant portion of their remaining money, it's a big hit.\n\nThe husband gives about $125 a month, which he can afford because he's careful with how much he gives. The wife, on the other hand, gave $200 in a week by giving all the money in her wallet to every homeless person she saw. The husband was upset because that $200 is a large chunk of their budget, especially since they only have $100 left after paying rent and utilities until April 15th. The wife seems to think that giving to the homeless is more important than their own financial stability, but the husband is concerned about their ability to manage expenses.\n\nNow, considering the values here. Altruism is important, but so is financial responsibility, especially when you're on a tight budget. The wife gave $200 without considering the couple's financial constraints, which led to a conflict. The husband's reaction is about the financial impact, not the act of giving itself. He's not against helping, but the amount given is causing them financial stress. The wife might not have communicated her intent to give that much, so maybe she should have discussed it with him first. However, the husband's anger might come off as dismissive of her compassionate actions, but given their financial situation, his concern is valid.\n\nIn terms of responsibility, both partners should communicate about money. The wife gave a significant amount without considering the budget, and the husband's reaction is based on their financial reality. So whether the author is in the wrong depends on balancing compassion and financial prudence. Since the wife's action impacted their budget negatively, the husband's reaction isn't entirely unfounded. But he could have handled it more kindly. However, the question is if he's in the wrong. Since the wife's action was irresponsible financially, and the husband is concerned about their future, he's not necessarily in the wrong. So the answer would be B (No).\n"
