We live in Chicago and there\u2019s homeless people on every corner. I (24M) give as many of them whatever I can afford. If I have a lot of change left or loose singles then I\u2019ll give it to one of them. Or I\u2019ll buy them some food when I get some. It all depends. My wife (22F) has always admired that I share with them and has started to do it herself. She\u2019ll sometimes give them her whole lunch or like a ten dollar bill. \n\nAnyways, we collectively make about 60k a year. Next year I\u2019ll be making $100k alone. We pay $1200 in rent and $500 in other bills. We both pay off student loans as well. At the end of month we only have a couple hundred that goes towards food, necessities, and spending money. \n\nA few days ago I had an extra $20. I saw a family that had some kids so I gave it to them. My wife kept telling me how amazing I was for it. I thought it was kind of weird how she kept bringing it up but I still appreciated her comments. Btw we have a car but we prefer to walk to work because of how busy the streets are here. \n\nLast night she told me how she helped a lot of homeless people on her way home from work. I told her it was great. While I was making dinner she started asking me how much money do I usually give away. I told her about $125 a month maybe. She continued to bring up how she helped a lot of people. \n\nWhile we were eating she brought it up again. She said \u201cyou said you give about $125 a month right babe?\u201d I nodded because I was chewing still. Next she says \u201cI outran you this week!\u201d I didn\u2019t know wtf she was talking about and I guess she could tell by the look on my face. \n\nLong story short, she said she gave every homeless person she saw some money. When I asked how much she said all of the money in her wallet. I asked how much again. She told me about $200 like it was nothing.\n\nI instantly said what the fuck? She was surprised at my reaction like I would be happy about it. We argued about it. $200 is a lot of money for us. We already payed our rent and utilities but now we only have $100 until April 15th. I told her that she acted senselessly. \n\nShe\u2019s been ignoring me ever since and locked me out of our bedroom last night. I slept on the couch. \n\nNow I\u2019m wondering if I was the asshole for being mad. After all, those people do need it more than us. But I still feel like she shouldn\u2019t have given away that much when we can barely afford it. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user wants to know if the author is in the wrong for being upset that his wife gave away $200 to homeless people. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the couple's financial situation: they make about $60k a year together, and next year the husband will be making $100k alone. Their expenses include $1200 rent and $500 in other bills, plus student loans. At the end of the month, they have only a couple hundred left for food and other needs. So $200 is a significant chunk of their remaining money. The husband gives around $125 a month, and the wife gave $200 in a week. \n\nThe husband is upset because they can't afford that. The wife, on the other hand, is proud of her actions, even to the point of teasing him about it. The key here is whether the husband is wrong for being angry. \n\nFinancial responsibility is a mutual concern in a relationship. Both partners should ideally agree on major expenses, especially when it's a significant portion of their budget. The wife giving away $200 without discussing it might be seen as not considering their financial constraints. The husband's reaction is about the impact on their shared finances, not about the act of giving itself. \n\nThe wife's approach seems impulsive and without prior communication. Even if giving to the homeless is a good deed, if it's causing financial strain, it's something to discuss. The husband isn't against giving, as he gives regularly, but the amount his wife gave is problematic. \n\nSo, is he in the wrong? He's not against charity, just the financial impact. The wife didn't consider the budget. Therefore, the husband's anger is valid. Answer B.\n"
