We live in Chicago and there\u2019s homeless people on every corner. I (24M) give as many of them whatever I can afford. If I have a lot of change left or loose singles then I\u2019ll give it to one of them. Or I\u2019ll buy them some food when I get some. It all depends. My wife (22F) has always admired that I share with them and has started to do it herself. She\u2019ll sometimes give them her whole lunch or like a ten dollar bill. \n\nAnyways, we collectively make about 60k a year. Next year I\u2019ll be making $100k alone. We pay $1200 in rent and $500 in other bills. We both pay off student loans as well. At the end of month we only have a couple hundred that goes towards food, necessities, and spending money. \n\nA few days ago I had an extra $20. I saw a family that had some kids so I gave it to them. My wife kept telling me how amazing I was for it. I thought it was kind of weird how she kept bringing it up but I still appreciated her comments. Btw we have a car but we prefer to walk to work because of how busy the streets are here. \n\nLast night she told me how she helped a lot of homeless people on her way home from work. I told her it was great. While I was making dinner she started asking me how much money do I usually give away. I told her about $125 a month maybe. She continued to bring up how she helped a lot of people. \n\nWhile we were eating she brought it up again. She said \u201cyou said you give about $125 a month right babe?\u201d I nodded because I was chewing still. Next she says \u201cI outran you this week!\u201d I didn\u2019t know wtf she was talking about and I guess she could tell by the look on my face. \n\nLong story short, she said she gave every homeless person she saw some money. When I asked how much she said all of the money in her wallet. I asked how much again. She told me about $200 like it was nothing.\n\nI instantly said what the fuck? She was surprised at my reaction like I would be happy about it. We argued about it. $200 is a lot of money for us. We already payed our rent and utilities but now we only have $100 until April 15th. I told her that she acted senselessly. \n\nShe\u2019s been ignoring me ever since and locked me out of our bedroom last night. I slept on the couch. \n\nNow I\u2019m wondering if I was the asshole for being mad. After all, those people do need it more than us. But I still feel like she shouldn\u2019t have given away that much when we can barely afford it. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author (the husband) is in the wrong for being upset that his wife gave $200 to homeless people. The key points here are their financial situation and their values.\n\nFirst, their combined income is $60k a year, with the husband expecting to make $100k alone next year. Their expenses include $1200 rent and $500 in other bills, plus student loans. Each month, they have only a couple hundred dollars left for food, necessities, and spending. So $200 is a significant portion of their discretionary income.\n\nThe wife gave all the money in her wallet to homeless people, which the husband found excessive because they can't afford it. He gave around $125 a month, which he felt was manageable. The wife's $200 was more than that, and it caused tension because they were already tight on money. The husband's reaction was anger, leading to a fight and them sleeping separately.\n\nNow, the question is whether he's in the wrong. On one hand, giving to others is a good thing, and the wife was following his example. On the other, their financial situation is precarious, and the $200 could have been necessary for their needs. The husband's frustration is about the financial impact, not the act of giving itself. He's not against helping but thinks there's a balance. The wife, however, might believe that when you have the means, you should give generously.\n\nBut here, the issue is that they don't have much to spare. The wife gave a large portion of their limited budget. The husband's reaction could be seen as prioritizing their financial stability over her impulse to give. However, it's also possible that he could have communicated better about financial boundaries beforehand. The wife might not have realized the impact of her actions because she was inspired by his giving but didn't consider the total amount.\n\nIn terms of right or wrong, both have valid points. The husband's anger is understandable given their financial constraints. The wife's action, while generous, wasn't discussed in the context of their budget. The problem might be a lack of prior communication about how much they're willing to give. The husband's reaction was frustration, but he's not opposing charity; he's upset about the financial strain. The wife might feel that her generosity is being criticized, which could hurt her feelings.\n\nIn relationships, differing values can lead to conflict. Since they didn't have a conversation about their giving limits, both might be at fault. However, the husband's anger might be more about the financial reality, which is a practical concern. The wife's action was impulsive without considering the couple's budget. So, maybe the husband isn't entirely in the wrong, but he could have handled it differently, and the wife should have discussed the amount with him before giving.\n"
