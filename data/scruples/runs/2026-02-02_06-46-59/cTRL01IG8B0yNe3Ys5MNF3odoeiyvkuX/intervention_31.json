We live in Chicago and there\u2019s homeless people on every corner. I (24M) give as many of them whatever I can afford. If I have a lot of change left or loose singles then I\u2019ll give it to one of them. Or I\u2019ll buy them some food when I get some. It all depends. My wife (22F) has always admired that I share with them and has started to do it herself. She\u2019ll sometimes give them her whole lunch or like a ten dollar bill. \n\nAnyways, we collectively make about 60k a year. Next year I\u2019ll be making $100k alone. We pay $1200 in rent and $500 in other bills. We both pay off student loans as well. At the end of month we only have a couple hundred that goes towards food, necessities, and spending money. \n\nA few days ago I had an extra $20. I saw a family that had some kids so I gave it to them. My wife kept telling me how amazing I was for it. I thought it was kind of weird how she kept bringing it up but I still appreciated her comments. Btw we have a car but we prefer to walk to work because of how busy the streets are here. \n\nLast night she told me how she helped a lot of homeless people on her way home from work. I told her it was great. While I was making dinner she started asking me how much money do I usually give away. I told her about $125 a month maybe. She continued to bring up how she helped a lot of people. \n\nWhile we were eating she brought it up again. She said \u201cyou said you give about $125 a month right babe?\u201d I nodded because I was chewing still. Next she says \u201cI outran you this week!\u201d I didn\u2019t know wtf she was talking about and I guess she could tell by the look on my face. \n\nLong story short, she said she gave every homeless person she saw some money. When I asked how much she said all of the money in her wallet. I asked how much again. She told me about $200 like it was nothing.\n\nI instantly said what the fuck? She was surprised at my reaction like I would be happy about it. We argued about it. $200 is a lot of money for us. We already payed our rent and utilities but now we only have $100 until April 15th. I told her that she acted senselessly. \n\nShe\u2019s been ignoring me ever since and locked me out of our bedroom last night. I slept on the couch. \n\nNow I\u2019m wondering if I was the asshole for being mad. After all, those people do need it more than us. But I still feel like she shouldn\u2019t have given away that much when we can barely afford it. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author (the husband) is in the wrong after getting angry that his wife gave away $200 to homeless people. The context is that their finances are tight: they make $60k a year, pay $1200 rent, $500 in bills, and have student loans. They have a few hundred left for food and other expenses.\n\nThe wife had given $200, which the husband views as a significant portion of their monthly budget. They had already paid rent and utilities, leaving only $100 until mid-April. The husband feels she acted senselessly, leading to an argument and the wife locking him out. The husband is wondering if he was in the wrong for being upset.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The wife is giving to homeless people, which is a charitable act. She might feel strongly about helping others, especially if she's been admiring her husband's previous donations. The husband, on the other hand, is concerned about their financial stability. $200 is a big chunk of their remaining money, and he's worried about covering their needs until the next paycheck.\n\nNow, the question is whether the husband's anger makes him the asshole. Arguments could be made for both sides. On one hand, the wife used her own money, and the husband's reaction might be seen as dismissive of her values. On the other hand, they share finances, and large unexpected expenses can disrupt their budget, causing stress. \n\nBut wait, the wife gave all the money in her wallet. If they have a shared account, that money isn't just hers\u2014it's part of their joint resources. If they don't have a shared account and she keeps her own money, then it's her to spend. However, the original question mentions that they have a car but walk to work, live in Chicago, and have a tight budget. It's unclear if they have separate or joint finances. If they have joint accounts, then her giving away $200 is affecting their shared funds, which the husband has a right to be upset about, especially if it impacts their ability to meet other obligations.\n\nThe key points here are communication and financial planning. If the wife made a large donation without discussing it with the husband, that's a problem, especially when their finances are tight. The husband's frustration is valid because unplanned expenses can create financial strain. However, the wife's intention to help others is also commendable. The issue might be a lack of communication rather than one person being wrong.\n\nThe husband's anger is understandable given their financial situation. But the way he reacted\u2014calling her actions senseless and leading to a physical separation (sleeping on the couch and being locked out) might be harsh. The wife might feel her values are being attacked, which could be hurtful. \n\nSo, is the husband in the wrong? If the wife used her own money and the husband's reaction was about control or lack of trust in her judgment, then maybe he's in the wrong. But if the money was part of shared resources and she didn't consult him, he's not wrong to be upset. The answer depends on whether the money was hers alone or part of their joint finances. The scenario doesn't specify, but since they mention having to budget together (\"we\" make money, \"we\" pay bills), it's likely joint. Therefore, the wife's action without discussion is problematic, but the husband's reaction might be too harsh. However, given the financial context, the husband's concern is valid. The answer is probably B (not in the wrong) because the husband's concern about their financial stability is justified, especially if the money was part of shared funds. The wife should have discussed the large donation, and the husband's anger is a result of valid financial stress.\n"
