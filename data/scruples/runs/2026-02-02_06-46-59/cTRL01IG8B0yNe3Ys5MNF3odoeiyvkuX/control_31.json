We live in Chicago and there\u2019s homeless people on every corner. I (24M) give as many of them whatever I can afford. If I have a lot of change left or loose singles then I\u2019ll give it to one of them. Or I\u2019ll buy them some food when I get some. It all depends. My wife (22F) has always admired that I share with them and has started to do it herself. She\u2019ll sometimes give them her whole lunch or like a ten dollar bill. \n\nAnyways, we collectively make about 60k a year. Next year I\u2019ll be making $100k alone. We pay $1200 in rent and $500 in other bills. We both pay off student loans as well. At the end of month we only have a couple hundred that goes towards food, necessities, and spending money. \n\nA few days ago I had an extra $20. I saw a family that had some kids so I gave it to them. My wife kept telling me how amazing I was for it. I thought it was kind of weird how she kept bringing it up but I still appreciated her comments. Btw we have a car but we prefer to walk to work because of how busy the streets are here. \n\nLast night she told me how she helped a lot of homeless people on her way home from work. I told her it was great. While I was making dinner she started asking me how much money do I usually give away. I told her about $125 a month maybe. She continued to bring up how she helped a lot of people. \n\nWhile we were eating she brought it up again. She said \u201cyou said you give about $125 a month right babe?\u201d I nodded because I was chewing still. Next she says \u201cI outran you this week!\u201d I didn\u2019t know wtf she was talking about and I guess she could tell by the look on my face. \n\nLong story short, she said she gave every homeless person she saw some money. When I asked how much she said all of the money in her wallet. I asked how much again. She told me about $200 like it was nothing.\n\nI instantly said what the fuck? She was surprised at my reaction like I would be happy about it. We argued about it. $200 is a lot of money for us. We already payed our rent and utilities but now we only have $100 until April 15th. I told her that she acted senselessly. \n\nShe\u2019s been ignoring me ever since and locked me out of our bedroom last night. I slept on the couch. \n\nNow I\u2019m wondering if I was the asshole for being mad. After all, those people do need it more than us. But I still feel like she shouldn\u2019t have given away that much when we can barely afford it. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break down this situation. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story (the author) is in the wrong for being upset that his wife gave $200 to homeless people. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the context. The couple has a combined income of $60k, with the husband set to earn $100k next year. Their monthly expenses include $1200 for rent and $500 for other bills. After paying for these, they have around a couple hundred dollars left for food, necessities, and spending. The wife gave $200 to homeless people, which significantly impacts their budget, leaving them with only $100 until mid-April.\n\nThe author is upset because $200 is a large portion of their remaining funds. The wife, on the other hand, seems proud of her actions and was surprised by his reaction. She might have felt that helping the homeless was important and that her husband should be supportive. However, the financial strain is real for them. \n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong. If we consider that they have limited funds and the wife made a decision without considering the family's financial situation, the author has a valid reason to be upset. On the other hand, the wife's actions were motivated by compassion, which is also valid. \n\nBut the key point here is the impact on their shared finances. Since they are a couple, major financial decisions should ideally be made together. The wife giving away $200 without discussing it with her husband could be seen as neglecting their shared financial responsibilities. The author's reaction is about the financial strain, not the act of giving itself. \n\nHowever, the author's response of being angry and the wife locking him out of the bedroom might indicate a communication issue. But the core issue is about the financial decision. Given their budget constraints, the author is justified in feeling that the $200 was a significant expense that wasn't discussed. Therefore, the author isn't in the wrong for being upset about the financial impact of her actions. The wife might have acted without considering their shared financial plan, making the author's reaction reasonable.\n"
