We live in Chicago and there\u2019s homeless people on every corner. I (24M) give as many of them whatever I can afford. If I have a lot of change left or loose singles then I\u2019ll give it to one of them. Or I\u2019ll buy them some food when I get some. It all depends. My wife (22F) has always admired that I share with them and has started to do it herself. She\u2019ll sometimes give them her whole lunch or like a ten dollar bill. \n\nAnyways, we collectively make about 60k a year. Next year I\u2019ll be making $100k alone. We pay $1200 in rent and $500 in other bills. We both pay off student loans as well. At the end of month we only have a couple hundred that goes towards food, necessities, and spending money. \n\nA few days ago I had an extra $20. I saw a family that had some kids so I gave it to them. My wife kept telling me how amazing I was for it. I thought it was kind of weird how she kept bringing it up but I still appreciated her comments. Btw we have a car but we prefer to walk to work because of how busy the streets are here. \n\nLast night she told me how she helped a lot of homeless people on her way home from work. I told her it was great. While I was making dinner she started asking me how much money do I usually give away. I told her about $125 a month maybe. She continued to bring up how she helped a lot of people. \n\nWhile we were eating she brought it up again. She said \u201cyou said you give about $125 a month right babe?\u201d I nodded because I was chewing still. Next she says \u201cI outran you this week!\u201d I didn\u2019t know wtf she was talking about and I guess she could tell by the look on my face. \n\nLong story short, she said she gave every homeless person she saw some money. When I asked how much she said all of the money in her wallet. I asked how much again. She told me about $200 like it was nothing.\n\nI instantly said what the fuck? She was surprised at my reaction like I would be happy about it. We argued about it. $200 is a lot of money for us. We already payed our rent and utilities but now we only have $100 until April 15th. I told her that she acted senselessly. \n\nShe\u2019s been ignoring me ever since and locked me out of our bedroom last night. I slept on the couch. \n\nNow I\u2019m wondering if I was the asshole for being mad. After all, those people do need it more than us. But I still feel like she shouldn\u2019t have given away that much when we can barely afford it. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for being upset that his wife gave $200 to homeless people. The situation is that they have a tight budget, making around $60k a year with the husband set to make $100k next year. Their expenses include $1200 rent and $500 in bills, and they have student loans. They have a few hundred left for food and other needs.\n\nThe wife gave away $200, which the husband feels is too much given their financial situation. He's upset because they're already spending down to $100 until mid-April. The user initially thinks the author is in the wrong but wants confirmation.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. On one hand, giving to those in need is a compassionate act. The wife admires the husband's generosity and is trying to emulate it. Her actions might come from a good place. However, the financial aspect is crucial here. If the couple can't afford such a large gift without compromising their basic needs, it's a problem. \n\nThe husband's reaction is about financial responsibility. They're on a tight budget, and $200 could affect their ability to cover essentials. Even though the wife's intent was good, the impact on their finances is real. The author's anger might be seen as prioritizing money over compassion, but he's also trying to manage their shared resources. \n\nThen there's the communication aspect. The wife didn't check with him about the $200, which could cause conflict. The husband felt blindsided, which is understandable. But was $200 an overreaction from him? If they have agreed on a donation amount, then the wife might have overstepped. But if they didn't discuss it, maybe they need better communication.\n\nThe key points are: 1) Financial situation is tight. 2) $200 is a significant portion of their monthly discretionary funds. 3) The wife's action was spontaneous without prior discussion. 4) The husband's reaction is about financial responsibility, which is valid in their context.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? If the wife gave away a large sum without considering their budget, maybe the husband is justified in being upset. But if giving to others is a shared value, his reaction could be seen as prioritizing money over their shared values. However, given the context of their financial limitations, the husband's concern is valid. Therefore, the answer might be B (not in the wrong), as he's trying to manage their finances responsibly.\n"
