We live in Chicago and there\u2019s homeless people on every corner. I (24M) give as many of them whatever I can afford. If I have a lot of change left or loose singles then I\u2019ll give it to one of them. Or I\u2019ll buy them some food when I get some. It all depends. My wife (22F) has always admired that I share with them and has started to do it herself. She\u2019ll sometimes give them her whole lunch or like a ten dollar bill. \n\nAnyways, we collectively make about 60k a year. Next year I\u2019ll be making $100k alone. We pay $1200 in rent and $500 in other bills. We both pay off student loans as well. At the end of month we only have a couple hundred that goes towards food, necessities, and spending money. \n\nA few days ago I had an extra $20. I saw a family that had some kids so I gave it to them. My wife kept telling me how amazing I was for it. I thought it was kind of weird how she kept bringing it up but I still appreciated her comments. Btw we have a car but we prefer to walk to work because of how busy the streets are here. \n\nLast night she told me how she helped a lot of homeless people on her way home from work. I told her it was great. While I was making dinner she started asking me how much money do I usually give away. I told her about $125 a month maybe. She continued to bring up how she helped a lot of people. \n\nWhile we were eating she brought it up again. She said \u201cyou said you give about $125 a month right babe?\u201d I nodded because I was chewing still. Next she says \u201cI outran you this week!\u201d I didn\u2019t know wtf she was talking about and I guess she could tell by the look on my face. \n\nLong story short, she said she gave every homeless person she saw some money. When I asked how much she said all of the money in her wallet. I asked how much again. She told me about $200 like it was nothing.\n\nI instantly said what the fuck? She was surprised at my reaction like I would be happy about it. We argued about it. $200 is a lot of money for us. We already payed our rent and utilities but now we only have $100 until April 15th. I told her that she acted senselessly. \n\nShe\u2019s been ignoring me ever since and locked me out of our bedroom last night. I slept on the couch. \n\nNow I\u2019m wondering if I was the asshole for being mad. After all, those people do need it more than us. But I still feel like she shouldn\u2019t have given away that much when we can barely afford it. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that the husband gave about $125 a month to homeless people, and the wife gave $200 in a week. The husband got upset because they can't afford that, especially since their finances are tight. They make $60k a year, with the husband about to make $100k, but they have a lot of expenses like rent and student loans.\n\nFirst, I need to understand both sides. The wife is doing something she admires in her husband, which is giving to those in need. She might feel that helping is important and that the money is better spent on people in need rather than on themselves. However, the husband is concerned about their financial stability. Giving away $200 when they only have a couple hundred left after bills could be a problem, especially since they need to cover food and other essentials.\n\nThe key points here are financial responsibility and communication. The wife didn't check with the husband before giving away the money, which might have been a breach of trust or lack of communication. The husband might feel that they should have a budget and that she didn't involve him in the decision. On the other hand, the wife might believe that giving to the homeless is a moral obligation and that the husband should be supportive.\n\nBut the question is whether the author is in the wrong. The husband's reaction is based on financial concerns. If their budget doesn't have room for such expenditures, then maybe the wife shouldn't be giving that much without discussion. However, the wife was trying to follow her husband's example. There's also the aspect of how much each person is giving. The husband gives $125 a month, which is more spread out, while the wife gave $200 in a week. That's a significant difference. The husband might feel that $200 is an emergency fund or needed for basics.\n\nAnother angle is the emotional impact. The wife was surprised at his reaction, expecting praise, but instead she was met with anger. This could indicate a lack of understanding between them about their priorities. The husband might not have communicated his financial limits clearly, but the wife also didn't consider the household budget before giving away a large sum.\n\nIn terms of right and wrong, it's about shared responsibility in a relationship. Both should be on the same page regarding spending, especially when it affects their shared finances. The wife giving away money without consultation could be seen as irresponsible, but the husband might have failed to set clear boundaries or discuss their budget properly. However, the husband's anger might be justified if the $200 creates a financial strain. It's a tricky situation where both could have handled it better, but the question is specifically about the author (husband) being in the wrong.\n\nIf the wife acted without considering the household's financial plan, then she's partly at fault. But the husband didn't establish a budget or discuss giving amounts with her. However, since the wife gave a large sum without checking in, the husband's reaction might be understandable. It's possible that the husband isn't the asshole here because the sudden large expenditure could jeopardize their shared financial stability. But some might argue that the wife was just trying to help and the husband overreacted. Still, in a partnership, managing finances together is important, so both have some responsibility.\n"
