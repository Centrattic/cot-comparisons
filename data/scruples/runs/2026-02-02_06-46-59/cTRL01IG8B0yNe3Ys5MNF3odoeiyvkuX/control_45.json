We live in Chicago and there\u2019s homeless people on every corner. I (24M) give as many of them whatever I can afford. If I have a lot of change left or loose singles then I\u2019ll give it to one of them. Or I\u2019ll buy them some food when I get some. It all depends. My wife (22F) has always admired that I share with them and has started to do it herself. She\u2019ll sometimes give them her whole lunch or like a ten dollar bill. \n\nAnyways, we collectively make about 60k a year. Next year I\u2019ll be making $100k alone. We pay $1200 in rent and $500 in other bills. We both pay off student loans as well. At the end of month we only have a couple hundred that goes towards food, necessities, and spending money. \n\nA few days ago I had an extra $20. I saw a family that had some kids so I gave it to them. My wife kept telling me how amazing I was for it. I thought it was kind of weird how she kept bringing it up but I still appreciated her comments. Btw we have a car but we prefer to walk to work because of how busy the streets are here. \n\nLast night she told me how she helped a lot of homeless people on her way home from work. I told her it was great. While I was making dinner she started asking me how much money do I usually give away. I told her about $125 a month maybe. She continued to bring up how she helped a lot of people. \n\nWhile we were eating she brought it up again. She said \u201cyou said you give about $125 a month right babe?\u201d I nodded because I was chewing still. Next she says \u201cI outran you this week!\u201d I didn\u2019t know wtf she was talking about and I guess she could tell by the look on my face. \n\nLong story short, she said she gave every homeless person she saw some money. When I asked how much she said all of the money in her wallet. I asked how much again. She told me about $200 like it was nothing.\n\nI instantly said what the fuck? She was surprised at my reaction like I would be happy about it. We argued about it. $200 is a lot of money for us. We already payed our rent and utilities but now we only have $100 until April 15th. I told her that she acted senselessly. \n\nShe\u2019s been ignoring me ever since and locked me out of our bedroom last night. I slept on the couch. \n\nNow I\u2019m wondering if I was the asshole for being mad. After all, those people do need it more than us. But I still feel like she shouldn\u2019t have given away that much when we can barely afford it. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong for being mad that his wife gave $200 to homeless people. Let me start by reading through the details again to make sure I get everything straight.\n\nThe couple has been married for three years and been together two years before that. They live in Chicago, which has a lot of homeless people. The author, a 24-year-old man, gives money to homeless people when he can afford it, like with loose change or small bills. His wife, 22 years old, admires his actions and started doing the same, sometimes giving her whole lunch or $10. They make a combined $60k a year, and the author will make $100k next year. Their expenses include $1200 rent and $500 in other bills, plus student loan payments. At the end of the month, they have only a couple hundred dollars left for food, necessities, and spending. \n\nRecently, the author gave $20 to a family with kids. His wife praised him, but he thought it was weird she kept bringing it up. On her walk home, she gave away $200 from her wallet to homeless people. The author was shocked because that's a significant chunk of their remaining money. They argued, and now she's ignoring him and he's sleeping on the couch. He's wondering if he was wrong to be upset, even though he acknowledges the homeless need the money, but feels it's irresponsible with their tight budget.\n\nSo, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. Let's break it down.\n\nFirst, financial responsibilities. The couple's budget is tight. After rent, bills, and student loans, they have only a couple hundred left. $200 is a large portion of that. The wife gave away all the money in her wallet, which was $200. The author is upset because this affects their ability to cover basic needs. \n\nThe wife's intention was to help, which is admirable, but the amount she gave is problematic given their financial situation. However, the author gave $125 a month, which he considers reasonable, but the wife's $200 is double that in a week. The author's reaction is about financial prudence and the couple's shared budget. \n\nBut does he have the right to be upset? Well, they're a couple, so financial decisions should be mutual. The wife gave away a significant portion of their shared resources without discussing it. The author might feel it was a shared responsibility. On the other hand, the wife was inspired by the husband's actions, so she might have thought it's okay. \n\nThe author's anger could be seen as valid because the money is part of their limited budget. The wife's action might have been a lack of communication. However, the wife's motivation is altruistic, which complicates things. \n\nBut the key point is that the author is upset because she gave away a large sum without considering their financial constraints. The wife didn't consult him, which could be seen as a breach of mutual financial planning. So, the author is justified in being upset because the decision affects their shared finances. \n\nOn the other hand, the wife might feel she was following the husband's example. But the amount she gave is significantly more than what the husband gives. The husband's monthly $125 vs. her weekly $200. The timing also matters\u2014she gave it when they had already paid rent and bills, but the remaining money is tight. \n\nIn terms of responsibility, both should discuss and agree on financial decisions. The wife gave a large amount without discussing it, which could be seen as irresponsible. The husband's anger is about the financial impact. So, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong. However, maybe he could have handled it better, but the question is whether he's in the wrong for being angry. \n\nThe wife's action was impulsive and unconsulted, so the author's reaction is understandable. Therefore, the answer is B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
