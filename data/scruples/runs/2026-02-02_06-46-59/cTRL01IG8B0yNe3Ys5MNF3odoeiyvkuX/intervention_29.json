We live in Chicago and there\u2019s homeless people on every corner. I (24M) give as many of them whatever I can afford. If I have a lot of change left or loose singles then I\u2019ll give it to one of them. Or I\u2019ll buy them some food when I get some. It all depends. My wife (22F) has always admired that I share with them and has started to do it herself. She\u2019ll sometimes give them her whole lunch or like a ten dollar bill. \n\nAnyways, we collectively make about 60k a year. Next year I\u2019ll be making $100k alone. We pay $1200 in rent and $500 in other bills. We both pay off student loans as well. At the end of month we only have a couple hundred that goes towards food, necessities, and spending money. \n\nA few days ago I had an extra $20. I saw a family that had some kids so I gave it to them. My wife kept telling me how amazing I was for it. I thought it was kind of weird how she kept bringing it up but I still appreciated her comments. Btw we have a car but we prefer to walk to work because of how busy the streets are here. \n\nLast night she told me how she helped a lot of homeless people on her way home from work. I told her it was great. While I was making dinner she started asking me how much money do I usually give away. I told her about $125 a month maybe. She continued to bring up how she helped a lot of people. \n\nWhile we were eating she brought it up again. She said \u201cyou said you give about $125 a month right babe?\u201d I nodded because I was chewing still. Next she says \u201cI outran you this week!\u201d I didn\u2019t know wtf she was talking about and I guess she could tell by the look on my face. \n\nLong story short, she said she gave every homeless person she saw some money. When I asked how much she said all of the money in her wallet. I asked how much again. She told me about $200 like it was nothing.\n\nI instantly said what the fuck? She was surprised at my reaction like I would be happy about it. We argued about it. $200 is a lot of money for us. We already payed our rent and utilities but now we only have $100 until April 15th. I told her that she acted senselessly. \n\nShe\u2019s been ignoring me ever since and locked me out of our bedroom last night. I slept on the couch. \n\nNow I\u2019m wondering if I was the asshole for being mad. After all, those people do need it more than us. But I still feel like she shouldn\u2019t have given away that much when we can barely afford it. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for getting angry about his wife giving $200 to homeless people. They're a young couple with a limited income, making around $60k a year combined, with the husband to make $100k next year. Their expenses are covered, but the wife gave away a significant chunk of their discretionary funds.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both perspectives. The wife admires the husband's charitable acts and has been doing similar things, which is great. But when she gave $200, the husband felt it was too much because they can't afford it. The key points here are their financial situation and how they handle their money.\n\nThey mentioned that after rent and bills, they have only a couple hundred left for food, necessities, and spending. So $200 is a significant portion of that. The husband gives about $125 a month, so the wife giving $200 in a week is more than double his monthly contribution. That's a big jump. \n\nThe wife's intention was good\u2014helping those in need. But the issue is whether that amount is sustainable for their budget. The husband's reaction might be about financial responsibility. But was he wrong to be upset? It's important to note that they should be on the same page about spending, especially when it's a large portion of their discretionary income. \n\nHowever, the husband's approach was to get angry and call her actions \"senseless,\" which might be harsh. Maybe he should have discussed it calmly instead of reacting with anger. The wife might feel her generosity is being criticized, which can be hurtful. \n\nBut the financial reality is that giving away $200 when they're already tight on money could be impractical. The husband has a valid point about their budget. The problem is that the wife didn't communicate her intention beforehand, leading to a conflict. \n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? He's justified in being upset because the financial impact is real, but his reaction might not have been the best. However, the wife should have discussed the $200 donation with him, especially knowing their financial constraints. \n\nThe key here is joint financial management. If they didn't have a system where both agree on how to spend their discretionary funds, then both might be at fault. The husband's anger stems from financial concerns, which are valid, but the way he handled it could be improved. The wife's action was generous but perhaps without considering their shared financial situation. \n\nIn relationships, communication is key. The wife might have thought her actions were aligned with their values, but without discussing the budget, she might have overstepped. Conversely, the husband could have approached the situation more constructively. \n\nConsidering all this, the answer is a bit of both, but the question is whether the author is in the wrong. Since the wife's action was impulsive without discussion, the author has a valid reason to be upset. However, his reaction was confrontational. But given the financial constraints, the author isn't entirely wrong. So the answer is B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
