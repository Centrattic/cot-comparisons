We live in Chicago and there\u2019s homeless people on every corner. I (24M) give as many of them whatever I can afford. If I have a lot of change left or loose singles then I\u2019ll give it to one of them. Or I\u2019ll buy them some food when I get some. It all depends. My wife (22F) has always admired that I share with them and has started to do it herself. She\u2019ll sometimes give them her whole lunch or like a ten dollar bill. \n\nAnyways, we collectively make about 60k a year. Next year I\u2019ll be making $100k alone. We pay $1200 in rent and $500 in other bills. We both pay off student loans as well. At the end of month we only have a couple hundred that goes towards food, necessities, and spending money. \n\nA few days ago I had an extra $20. I saw a family that had some kids so I gave it to them. My wife kept telling me how amazing I was for it. I thought it was kind of weird how she kept bringing it up but I still appreciated her comments. Btw we have a car but we prefer to walk to work because of how busy the streets are here. \n\nLast night she told me how she helped a lot of homeless people on her way home from work. I told her it was great. While I was making dinner she started asking me how much money do I usually give away. I told her about $125 a month maybe. She continued to bring up how she helped a lot of people. \n\nWhile we were eating she brought it up again. She said \u201cyou said you give about $125 a month right babe?\u201d I nodded because I was chewing still. Next she says \u201cI outran you this week!\u201d I didn\u2019t know wtf she was talking about and I guess she could tell by the look on my face. \n\nLong story short, she said she gave every homeless person she saw some money. When I asked how much she said all of the money in her wallet. I asked how much again. She told me about $200 like it was nothing.\n\nI instantly said what the fuck? She was surprised at my reaction like I would be happy about it. We argued about it. $200 is a lot of money for us. We already payed our rent and utilities but now we only have $100 until April 15th. I told her that she acted senselessly. \n\nShe\u2019s been ignoring me ever since and locked me out of our bedroom last night. I slept on the couch. \n\nNow I\u2019m wondering if I was the asshole for being mad. After all, those people do need it more than us. But I still feel like she shouldn\u2019t have given away that much when we can barely afford it. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for being upset that his wife gave away $200 to homeless people. I need to analyze the situation carefully.\n\nFirst, the couple's financial situation: they make $60k a year together, with the husband set to make $100k alone next year. They pay $1200 rent and $500 in other bills, so that's $1700 a month. Their income after rent and bills would be around $60k - $20,400 (rent) - $6,000 (other bills) = $33,600 left for the year, which is about $2,800 a month. Divided by 12 months, that's roughly $2833 per month. But they have student loans, so after that, they have a couple hundred left for food and other expenses. So $200 is a significant portion of their discretionary income.\n\nThe husband gives about $125 a month, which he mentions. The wife gave $200 in one week. The author is upset because it's a large chunk of their budget, and they're already tight on money. The wife might feel that helping the homeless is important, but the husband is concerned about their financial stability.\n\nArguments for the author being in the wrong: Maybe he's being overly strict. They both agree to help, and the wife might feel it's her choice to give more. The husband's own giving is about $125 a month, so maybe he's okay with that amount but not the wife's larger giving. However, if they have a shared budget, both should be on the same page. The wife giving $200 without discussing could be seen as not considering their finances, but the husband's reaction of anger and sleeping on the couch might be harsh, especially if they both value giving. \n\nArguments for the author not being in the wrong: The $200 is a significant expense. They can barely afford their necessities, so losing $200 could cause financial stress. The wife might not have considered the impact on their budget. The author is responsible for their shared finances, so he has a right to be concerned. However, they should have discussed their giving habits beforehand to avoid this conflict.\n\nIt's a balance between personal values and financial responsibility. If they have a shared budget, both should be involved in financial decisions. The wife giving $200 without consultation could be seen as irresponsible, but the husband's reaction might be too harsh. Maybe the issue is communication. The author is not the asshole for being upset about the financial impact, but perhaps the wife should have discussed it. However, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. Since the wife gave without discussing, but the husband's reaction is anger and punishment (sleeping on the couch), maybe the author is not in the wrong. Alternatively, if both value giving, the husband's reaction is disproportionate. But given the financial constraints, it's understandable he's upset. So the answer is B (author not in the wrong).\n"
