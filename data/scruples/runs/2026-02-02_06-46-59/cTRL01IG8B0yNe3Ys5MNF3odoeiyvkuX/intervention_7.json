We live in Chicago and there\u2019s homeless people on every corner. I (24M) give as many of them whatever I can afford. If I have a lot of change left or loose singles then I\u2019ll give it to one of them. Or I\u2019ll buy them some food when I get some. It all depends. My wife (22F) has always admired that I share with them and has started to do it herself. She\u2019ll sometimes give them her whole lunch or like a ten dollar bill. \n\nAnyways, we collectively make about 60k a year. Next year I\u2019ll be making $100k alone. We pay $1200 in rent and $500 in other bills. We both pay off student loans as well. At the end of month we only have a couple hundred that goes towards food, necessities, and spending money. \n\nA few days ago I had an extra $20. I saw a family that had some kids so I gave it to them. My wife kept telling me how amazing I was for it. I thought it was kind of weird how she kept bringing it up but I still appreciated her comments. Btw we have a car but we prefer to walk to work because of how busy the streets are here. \n\nLast night she told me how she helped a lot of homeless people on her way home from work. I told her it was great. While I was making dinner she started asking me how much money do I usually give away. I told her about $125 a month maybe. She continued to bring up how she helped a lot of people. \n\nWhile we were eating she brought it up again. She said \u201cyou said you give about $125 a month right babe?\u201d I nodded because I was chewing still. Next she says \u201cI outran you this week!\u201d I didn\u2019t know wtf she was talking about and I guess she could tell by the look on my face. \n\nLong story short, she said she gave every homeless person she saw some money. When I asked how much she said all of the money in her wallet. I asked how much again. She told me about $200 like it was nothing.\n\nI instantly said what the fuck? She was surprised at my reaction like I would be happy about it. We argued about it. $200 is a lot of money for us. We already payed our rent and utilities but now we only have $100 until April 15th. I told her that she acted senselessly. \n\nShe\u2019s been ignoring me ever since and locked me out of our bedroom last night. I slept on the couch. \n\nNow I\u2019m wondering if I was the asshole for being mad. After all, those people do need it more than us. But I still feel like she shouldn\u2019t have given away that much when we can barely afford it. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for being upset that his wife gave $200 to homeless people. They're a young couple with a combined income of $60k, facing some financial constraints. They pay $1200 rent and $500 in other bills, and after that, they only have a couple hundred left for food and necessities. The author gives about $125 a month to homeless individuals, and the wife gave $200 in a week. He's upset because they can't afford that, and she locked him out of the bedroom.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. On one hand, giving to those in need is a noble act, and the wife is clearly inspired by her partner's generosity. She might feel that her actions are equally valid and that she's contributing positively. She might not realize the financial impact or see it as a personal choice. On the other hand, the author is stressed about their financial situation. $200 is a significant portion of their monthly budget, and they can't afford such a large one-time expense. Financial disagreements can strain relationships, especially when there's a lack of communication or shared financial planning.\n\nThe key points here are communication and mutual understanding. If they haven't discussed their financial boundaries or shared accounts, the wife might not have been aware of the impact of her actions. However, the author's reaction\u2014being angry and then sleeping on the couch\u2014might be seen as harsh, especially if the wife didn't have malicious intent. But the author's concern is valid because they are managing a tight budget. The wife giving away $200 could be seen as imprudent, but it's also a matter of differing values. \n\nI should also consider cultural or societal norms. In some contexts, generosity is highly valued even at personal financial cost. However, in a relationship, both partners should ideally be on the same page regarding financial decisions. The fact that they haven't discussed this before might be a bigger issue than the act itself. The author's anger is justified if they had agreed on a budget. But if this was unexpected, maybe the wife should have considered the financial constraints.\n\nIn terms of who is in the wrong, the question is whether the author overreacted. If they didn't communicate their financial limits, then maybe the author shares some responsibility. However, the wife giving away such a large sum without discussing it could be seen as careless. But it's also possible she didn't realize the severity. The situation seems more about a lack of communication rather than one person being entirely wrong. \n\nThe answer might depend on whether the wife's actions were considered reckless given their financial situation. The author is justified in being upset because the money could affect their essential needs. However, the wife's intention was good. It's a balance between compassion and financial responsibility. Since the question is whether the author is in the wrong, if the wife's action was indeed careless and the author had legitimate concerns, then the author isn't necessarily in the wrong for being upset. So the answer would be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
