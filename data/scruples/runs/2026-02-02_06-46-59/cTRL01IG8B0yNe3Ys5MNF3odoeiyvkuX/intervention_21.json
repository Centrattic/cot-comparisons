We live in Chicago and there\u2019s homeless people on every corner. I (24M) give as many of them whatever I can afford. If I have a lot of change left or loose singles then I\u2019ll give it to one of them. Or I\u2019ll buy them some food when I get some. It all depends. My wife (22F) has always admired that I share with them and has started to do it herself. She\u2019ll sometimes give them her whole lunch or like a ten dollar bill. \n\nAnyways, we collectively make about 60k a year. Next year I\u2019ll be making $100k alone. We pay $1200 in rent and $500 in other bills. We both pay off student loans as well. At the end of month we only have a couple hundred that goes towards food, necessities, and spending money. \n\nA few days ago I had an extra $20. I saw a family that had some kids so I gave it to them. My wife kept telling me how amazing I was for it. I thought it was kind of weird how she kept bringing it up but I still appreciated her comments. Btw we have a car but we prefer to walk to work because of how busy the streets are here. \n\nLast night she told me how she helped a lot of homeless people on her way home from work. I told her it was great. While I was making dinner she started asking me how much money do I usually give away. I told her about $125 a month maybe. She continued to bring up how she helped a lot of people. \n\nWhile we were eating she brought it up again. She said \u201cyou said you give about $125 a month right babe?\u201d I nodded because I was chewing still. Next she says \u201cI outran you this week!\u201d I didn\u2019t know wtf she was talking about and I guess she could tell by the look on my face. \n\nLong story short, she said she gave every homeless person she saw some money. When I asked how much she said all of the money in her wallet. I asked how much again. She told me about $200 like it was nothing.\n\nI instantly said what the fuck? She was surprised at my reaction like I would be happy about it. We argued about it. $200 is a lot of money for us. We already payed our rent and utilities but now we only have $100 until April 15th. I told her that she acted senselessly. \n\nShe\u2019s been ignoring me ever since and locked me out of our bedroom last night. I slept on the couch. \n\nNow I\u2019m wondering if I was the asshole for being mad. After all, those people do need it more than us. But I still feel like she shouldn\u2019t have given away that much when we can barely afford it. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The main issue is whether the author is in the wrong for being upset that his wife gave $200 to homeless people when they have a tight budget.\n\nFirst, their income is $60k collectively this year, and the author will make $100k alone next year. Their expenses include $1200 rent and $500 in bills. After paying rent and utilities, they have a couple hundred for food and other needs. So, $200 is a significant portion of their available money each month.\n\nThe wife gave $200 in one week. The author is upset because it's a large amount for their budget. He points out they already paid rent and utilities, leaving them with $100 until April 15th. This seems like a financial strain for them.\n\nThe wife admired the author's giving in the past but this time went much further. The author gave about $125 a month, while she gave $200 in a week. The author feels this is senseless given their financial situation. The wife, on the other hand, might feel her actions were generous and important, even if it caused a conflict.\n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong for being upset. On one hand, the wife's action was generous, but it's a large portion of their available funds. On the other hand, the author's reaction might be seen as not supporting his wife's compassion, especially since he himself gives to the homeless.\n\nBut considering their financial constraints, $200 is a significant amount. The author's anger isn't about the act itself but the financial impact. The wife didn't consider the budget, leading to potential financial stress. The author's reaction, while harsh, is based on their shared financial situation. However, the way he reacted\u2014calling her actions senseless and sleeping on the couch\u2014might be seen as dismissive of her values.\n\nIn terms of right or wrong, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong for being upset about the financial aspect. But his reaction might be too severe. The wife also didn't communicate her intentions or check their finances before giving away such a large amount. Both could be at fault, but the question is specifically about the author. Since the wife acted without considering their budget, the author's anger is somewhat justified, so he isn't in the wrong. Answer B.\n"
