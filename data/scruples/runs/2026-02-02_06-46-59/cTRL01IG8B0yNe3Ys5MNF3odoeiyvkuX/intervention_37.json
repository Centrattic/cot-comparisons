We live in Chicago and there\u2019s homeless people on every corner. I (24M) give as many of them whatever I can afford. If I have a lot of change left or loose singles then I\u2019ll give it to one of them. Or I\u2019ll buy them some food when I get some. It all depends. My wife (22F) has always admired that I share with them and has started to do it herself. She\u2019ll sometimes give them her whole lunch or like a ten dollar bill. \n\nAnyways, we collectively make about 60k a year. Next year I\u2019ll be making $100k alone. We pay $1200 in rent and $500 in other bills. We both pay off student loans as well. At the end of month we only have a couple hundred that goes towards food, necessities, and spending money. \n\nA few days ago I had an extra $20. I saw a family that had some kids so I gave it to them. My wife kept telling me how amazing I was for it. I thought it was kind of weird how she kept bringing it up but I still appreciated her comments. Btw we have a car but we prefer to walk to work because of how busy the streets are here. \n\nLast night she told me how she helped a lot of homeless people on her way home from work. I told her it was great. While I was making dinner she started asking me how much money do I usually give away. I told her about $125 a month maybe. She continued to bring up how she helped a lot of people. \n\nWhile we were eating she brought it up again. She said \u201cyou said you give about $125 a month right babe?\u201d I nodded because I was chewing still. Next she says \u201cI outran you this week!\u201d I didn\u2019t know wtf she was talking about and I guess she could tell by the look on my face. \n\nLong story short, she said she gave every homeless person she saw some money. When I asked how much she said all of the money in her wallet. I asked how much again. She told me about $200 like it was nothing.\n\nI instantly said what the fuck? She was surprised at my reaction like I would be happy about it. We argued about it. $200 is a lot of money for us. We already payed our rent and utilities but now we only have $100 until April 15th. I told her that she acted senselessly. \n\nShe\u2019s been ignoring me ever since and locked me out of our bedroom last night. I slept on the couch. \n\nNow I\u2019m wondering if I was the asshole for being mad. After all, those people do need it more than us. But I still feel like she shouldn\u2019t have given away that much when we can barely afford it. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for being upset his wife gave $200 to homeless people. The situation is that they make $60k combined, with the husband set to make $100k next year. Their expenses are around $1700 a month for rent and bills, plus student loans. They have a tight budget, with only a couple hundred left for food and other needs each month. The wife gave away $200, which the husband found excessive, leading to an argument.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The husband's perspective is that they can't afford that kind of spending. Their budget is already tight, and $200 could be a significant portion of their available funds. He's concerned about their financial stability, especially since they have to plan for rent, bills, and other necessities. His reaction might stem from wanting to manage their finances responsibly, especially with upcoming plans or unexpected expenses.\n\nOn the wife's side, she admires her husband's generosity and felt compelled to do the same. She might see helping the homeless as a moral obligation, especially given their presence in Chicago. She might not realize how impactful $200 is on their budget. Her giving could be an act of empathy and compassion, trying to follow her partner's example.\n\nNow, financial decisions in a relationship often require mutual agreement. If they have a set budget and she gave away funds without discussing it, that could be an issue. The husband might feel that she didn't consider the financial implications, while she might feel that he's being too restrictive about their charitable giving.\n\nThe key points here are: 1) Communication about finances, 2) Prioritization of needs vs. wants, 3) Mutual respect in decision-making.\n\nIf the wife gave away money without consulting him, especially on an amount that affects their monthly budget, the husband has a valid concern. However, if they had discussed their charitable goals beforehand and the wife felt comfortable acting within that framework, the husband's anger might be unwarranted.\n\nBut given that their budget is tight and the $200 could impact their ability to cover other expenses, the husband's reaction isn't entirely unreasonable. The problem is that they might not have a clear agreement on how to handle discretionary spending on charitable acts. The wife might not have realized the financial impact, but the husband should also consider that her action was motivated by compassion. However, the fact that they argue about this and she didn't consult him first might place the blame on her for not being considerate of their financial situation.\n\nBut in terms of whether the author (the husband) is in the wrong for being mad\u2014there's a balance between empathy and financial responsibility. His anger comes from a place of concern for their financial health, but his approach might come off as dismissive of her values. If he's been giving smaller amounts and praised for it, perhaps he feels she overstepped. However, the issue is that they didn't have a prior discussion about their financial boundaries regarding charitable giving. So the fault could be shared, but since the question is about the author's wrongness, his reaction is justified to some extent. However, his response (anger, argument) might not be the healthiest way to address it. \n\nIn conclusion, the husband isn't in the wrong entirely because the financial strain is real, but his approach could be better. However, the question is whether he's in the wrong. The wife's action without prior discussion is problematic, but the husband's reaction is also a valid response to financial stress. The answer might hinge on whether the husband's reaction is disproportionate. Since $200 is a significant portion of their monthly discretionary funds, his anger is understandable. Therefore, the answer is B (author is not in the wrong).\n"
