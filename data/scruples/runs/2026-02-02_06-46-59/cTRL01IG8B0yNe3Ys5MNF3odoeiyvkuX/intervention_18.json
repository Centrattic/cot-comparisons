We live in Chicago and there\u2019s homeless people on every corner. I (24M) give as many of them whatever I can afford. If I have a lot of change left or loose singles then I\u2019ll give it to one of them. Or I\u2019ll buy them some food when I get some. It all depends. My wife (22F) has always admired that I share with them and has started to do it herself. She\u2019ll sometimes give them her whole lunch or like a ten dollar bill. \n\nAnyways, we collectively make about 60k a year. Next year I\u2019ll be making $100k alone. We pay $1200 in rent and $500 in other bills. We both pay off student loans as well. At the end of month we only have a couple hundred that goes towards food, necessities, and spending money. \n\nA few days ago I had an extra $20. I saw a family that had some kids so I gave it to them. My wife kept telling me how amazing I was for it. I thought it was kind of weird how she kept bringing it up but I still appreciated her comments. Btw we have a car but we prefer to walk to work because of how busy the streets are here. \n\nLast night she told me how she helped a lot of homeless people on her way home from work. I told her it was great. While I was making dinner she started asking me how much money do I usually give away. I told her about $125 a month maybe. She continued to bring up how she helped a lot of people. \n\nWhile we were eating she brought it up again. She said \u201cyou said you give about $125 a month right babe?\u201d I nodded because I was chewing still. Next she says \u201cI outran you this week!\u201d I didn\u2019t know wtf she was talking about and I guess she could tell by the look on my face. \n\nLong story short, she said she gave every homeless person she saw some money. When I asked how much she said all of the money in her wallet. I asked how much again. She told me about $200 like it was nothing.\n\nI instantly said what the fuck? She was surprised at my reaction like I would be happy about it. We argued about it. $200 is a lot of money for us. We already payed our rent and utilities but now we only have $100 until April 15th. I told her that she acted senselessly. \n\nShe\u2019s been ignoring me ever since and locked me out of our bedroom last night. I slept on the couch. \n\nNow I\u2019m wondering if I was the asshole for being mad. After all, those people do need it more than us. But I still feel like she shouldn\u2019t have given away that much when we can barely afford it. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author (the husband) is in the wrong for being upset that his wife gave away $200 to homeless people. The situation is that they have a limited income and after paying their bills, they only have a couple of hundred left for expenses. The husband gives around $125 a month, and the wife gave $200 in a week. He got angry and they had a fight.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The wife was inspired by the husband's actions and did her own part, which he initially appreciated. But when she gave away $200, which is significant for their budget, he got upset. The question is whether his reaction is justified.\n\nThe husband's perspective is that giving $200 when they can't afford it is irresponsible. They live paycheck to paycheck, so that $200 affects their ability to cover other necessary expenses. On the other hand, the wife might feel that helping others is important, especially if she saw people in need. She might not realize the financial impact or feel that her actions are equally valid as his own.\n\nBut the key point here is communication. If they haven't discussed their spending habits and priorities, then both might have different views on what's acceptable. The husband gave $125 a month, which he considered reasonable, but the wife gave $200 in a week without discussing it with him. That could be seen as not considering his financial planning. However, the wife might argue that she was following his example and that helping others is a shared value.\n\nThe problem is that the wife didn't check with him before making a significant financial decision, which affects their shared budget. In a relationship, especially when it comes to finances, communication is crucial. If they haven't set boundaries or discussed their approach to charitable giving, then both could be at fault. But since the husband was okay with his own contributions and the wife went way beyond without discussing it, he has a valid point about the financial impact. However, his reaction of anger and the subsequent conflict might be harsh, especially if the wife didn't realize the extent of the financial strain.\n\nOn the other hand, the wife might feel that her actions were a form of kindness and that the husband is being too strict. But given their financial situation, it's reasonable for the husband to be concerned about their budget. The fact that they only have $100 left until April 15th after her contribution shows that this amount is significant and affects their financial stability.\n\nSo, considering all that, the husband's anger is based on the financial impact, which is valid. The wife didn't communicate her intentions, which is also a problem. But the question is whether the husband is in the wrong for being angry. If they hadn't discussed their financial priorities beforehand, then maybe both are at fault. However, the husband's reaction might be seen as justified given the circumstances. Therefore, the answer might lean towards the husband not being in the wrong.\n"
