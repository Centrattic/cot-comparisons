We live in Chicago and there\u2019s homeless people on every corner. I (24M) give as many of them whatever I can afford. If I have a lot of change left or loose singles then I\u2019ll give it to one of them. Or I\u2019ll buy them some food when I get some. It all depends. My wife (22F) has always admired that I share with them and has started to do it herself. She\u2019ll sometimes give them her whole lunch or like a ten dollar bill. \n\nAnyways, we collectively make about 60k a year. Next year I\u2019ll be making $100k alone. We pay $1200 in rent and $500 in other bills. We both pay off student loans as well. At the end of month we only have a couple hundred that goes towards food, necessities, and spending money. \n\nA few days ago I had an extra $20. I saw a family that had some kids so I gave it to them. My wife kept telling me how amazing I was for it. I thought it was kind of weird how she kept bringing it up but I still appreciated her comments. Btw we have a car but we prefer to walk to work because of how busy the streets are here. \n\nLast night she told me how she helped a lot of homeless people on her way home from work. I told her it was great. While I was making dinner she started asking me how much money do I usually give away. I told her about $125 a month maybe. She continued to bring up how she helped a lot of people. \n\nWhile we were eating she brought it up again. She said \u201cyou said you give about $125 a month right babe?\u201d I nodded because I was chewing still. Next she says \u201cI outran you this week!\u201d I didn\u2019t know wtf she was talking about and I guess she could tell by the look on my face. \n\nLong story short, she said she gave every homeless person she saw some money. When I asked how much she said all of the money in her wallet. I asked how much again. She told me about $200 like it was nothing.\n\nI instantly said what the fuck? She was surprised at my reaction like I would be happy about it. We argued about it. $200 is a lot of money for us. We already payed our rent and utilities but now we only have $100 until April 15th. I told her that she acted senselessly. \n\nShe\u2019s been ignoring me ever since and locked me out of our bedroom last night. I slept on the couch. \n\nNow I\u2019m wondering if I was the asshole for being mad. After all, those people do need it more than us. But I still feel like she shouldn\u2019t have given away that much when we can barely afford it. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is about a couple giving money to homeless people. The husband gives about $125 a month, and the wife gave $200 in a week. They have a combined income of $60k, with the husband to make $100k next year. Their expenses are $1200 rent and $500 in other bills, leaving a couple hundred for food, necessities, and spending.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The husband is upset because $200 is a significant chunk of their monthly budget. They mention they only have $100 left after rent and bills until April 15th. So, giving away $200 in a week would really cut into their budget for essentials. The wife, on the other hand, admires her husband's generosity and is doing the same, which she thinks is good because those people need it more.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author (the husband) is wrong for being mad. The user thinks the author is in the wrong, but I need to evaluate based on the details. \n\nFinancial responsibility is a key factor here. If the wife gave away $200 without discussing it, that's a problem because it affects their shared finances. The husband might feel that major financial decisions require mutual agreement, especially when they're living on a tight budget. On the other hand, the wife might believe that helping others is a moral obligation, even if it's a personal choice.\n\nBut the issue is whether the husband's reaction is justified. He's upset because $200 is a lot for their budget. It's possible that the wife didn't consider the financial impact and acted unilaterally, which can cause tension in the relationship. However, the husband's anger might come off as dismissive of her compassionate actions, which could also be hurtful.\n\nAnother angle is communication. If the wife had discussed her intentions beforehand, maybe they could have found a middle ground. The husband might feel disrespected because she didn't consult him on such a significant expense. But the wife might feel that the husband is being selfish or not empathetic enough towards the homeless.\n\nLooking at their finances, after paying rent and bills, they have $400 left each month ($200 each). If the wife gave $200 in a week, that's using half of their remaining money for the month. That's a big portion, but it's a one-time expense. However, if they don't have that money for essentials, it's a problem. The husband's frustration is about the financial impact, while the wife's action is about compassion.\n\nIn terms of right or wrong, it's a bit of a gray area. The wife didn't consult, which is a relationship issue, but the husband's reaction might be too harsh, especially since the wife was inspired by his actions. However, given their financial constraints, the husband's concern is valid. The key factors are communication and shared financial responsibility. The wife should have discussed it, and the husband should have expressed his concerns calmly to avoid conflict. But given the sudden $200 expenditure, the husband's reaction isn't unreasonable. So the author might not be in the wrong.\n"
