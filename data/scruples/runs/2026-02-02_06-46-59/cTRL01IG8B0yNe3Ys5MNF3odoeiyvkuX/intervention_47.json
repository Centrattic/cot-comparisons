We live in Chicago and there\u2019s homeless people on every corner. I (24M) give as many of them whatever I can afford. If I have a lot of change left or loose singles then I\u2019ll give it to one of them. Or I\u2019ll buy them some food when I get some. It all depends. My wife (22F) has always admired that I share with them and has started to do it herself. She\u2019ll sometimes give them her whole lunch or like a ten dollar bill. \n\nAnyways, we collectively make about 60k a year. Next year I\u2019ll be making $100k alone. We pay $1200 in rent and $500 in other bills. We both pay off student loans as well. At the end of month we only have a couple hundred that goes towards food, necessities, and spending money. \n\nA few days ago I had an extra $20. I saw a family that had some kids so I gave it to them. My wife kept telling me how amazing I was for it. I thought it was kind of weird how she kept bringing it up but I still appreciated her comments. Btw we have a car but we prefer to walk to work because of how busy the streets are here. \n\nLast night she told me how she helped a lot of homeless people on her way home from work. I told her it was great. While I was making dinner she started asking me how much money do I usually give away. I told her about $125 a month maybe. She continued to bring up how she helped a lot of people. \n\nWhile we were eating she brought it up again. She said \u201cyou said you give about $125 a month right babe?\u201d I nodded because I was chewing still. Next she says \u201cI outran you this week!\u201d I didn\u2019t know wtf she was talking about and I guess she could tell by the look on my face. \n\nLong story short, she said she gave every homeless person she saw some money. When I asked how much she said all of the money in her wallet. I asked how much again. She told me about $200 like it was nothing.\n\nI instantly said what the fuck? She was surprised at my reaction like I would be happy about it. We argued about it. $200 is a lot of money for us. We already payed our rent and utilities but now we only have $100 until April 15th. I told her that she acted senselessly. \n\nShe\u2019s been ignoring me ever since and locked me out of our bedroom last night. I slept on the couch. \n\nNow I\u2019m wondering if I was the asshole for being mad. After all, those people do need it more than us. But I still feel like she shouldn\u2019t have given away that much when we can barely afford it. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author (the husband) is in the wrong for being upset that his wife gave away $200 to homeless people. They have a combined income of $60k, next year he'll make $100k alone. Their expenses are rent ($1200) and other bills ($500), with a bit left for food and other needs. The wife gave away $200, which seems like a significant chunk of their monthly budget.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the financial situation. If they only have a couple hundred left each month after rent, bills, and student loans, $200 is a big portion. The husband gives around $125 a month, so the wife giving $200 in a week would be way more than that. The husband is upset because they can't afford it, but the wife is doing it out of good intentions. \n\nThe wife's actions might be seen as selfless, but the husband's concern is about their financial stability. They live in Chicago where homeless people are common, so the wife might have encountered many and given to each, adding up to $200. The conflict arises from differing priorities: one values immediate charitable acts, the other the financial responsibility for their future and current needs.\n\nIs the husband in the wrong for being upset? Well, the wife's actions are impulsive and without prior discussion. They are a couple, so major financial decisions should be mutual. She gave away a large sum without considering their budget. The husband has a right to be upset because it affects their ability to meet other expenses. However, his response of anger and locking her out might be harsh. But the core issue is the financial decision. \n\nThe wife's admiration for the husband's smaller donations might have led her to overdo it. The key point is whether giving $200 was irresponsible given their budget. Since they can barely afford their expenses, $200 is significant. The husband's reaction is about financial prudence, while the wife's is about compassion. \n\nIn many relationships, financial decisions are shared. The wife didn't consult him, which is a problem. So, the husband is not in the wrong for being angry about an unplanned large expenditure. However, the way he reacted (sleeping on the couch) might be extreme. But the main issue is her action, not his reaction. Therefore, the husband isn't in the wrong.\n"
