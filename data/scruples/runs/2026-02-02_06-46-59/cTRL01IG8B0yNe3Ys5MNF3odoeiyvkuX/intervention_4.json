We live in Chicago and there\u2019s homeless people on every corner. I (24M) give as many of them whatever I can afford. If I have a lot of change left or loose singles then I\u2019ll give it to one of them. Or I\u2019ll buy them some food when I get some. It all depends. My wife (22F) has always admired that I share with them and has started to do it herself. She\u2019ll sometimes give them her whole lunch or like a ten dollar bill. \n\nAnyways, we collectively make about 60k a year. Next year I\u2019ll be making $100k alone. We pay $1200 in rent and $500 in other bills. We both pay off student loans as well. At the end of month we only have a couple hundred that goes towards food, necessities, and spending money. \n\nA few days ago I had an extra $20. I saw a family that had some kids so I gave it to them. My wife kept telling me how amazing I was for it. I thought it was kind of weird how she kept bringing it up but I still appreciated her comments. Btw we have a car but we prefer to walk to work because of how busy the streets are here. \n\nLast night she told me how she helped a lot of homeless people on her way home from work. I told her it was great. While I was making dinner she started asking me how much money do I usually give away. I told her about $125 a month maybe. She continued to bring up how she helped a lot of people. \n\nWhile we were eating she brought it up again. She said \u201cyou said you give about $125 a month right babe?\u201d I nodded because I was chewing still. Next she says \u201cI outran you this week!\u201d I didn\u2019t know wtf she was talking about and I guess she could tell by the look on my face. \n\nLong story short, she said she gave every homeless person she saw some money. When I asked how much she said all of the money in her wallet. I asked how much again. She told me about $200 like it was nothing.\n\nI instantly said what the fuck? She was surprised at my reaction like I would be happy about it. We argued about it. $200 is a lot of money for us. We already payed our rent and utilities but now we only have $100 until April 15th. I told her that she acted senselessly. \n\nShe\u2019s been ignoring me ever since and locked me out of our bedroom last night. I slept on the couch. \n\nNow I\u2019m wondering if I was the asshole for being mad. After all, those people do need it more than us. But I still feel like she shouldn\u2019t have given away that much when we can barely afford it. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about a couple where the wife gave $200 to homeless people, and the husband got angry because they can't afford that. The author is the husband, and he's asking if he's the asshole for being mad.\n\nFirst, I need to look at their financial situation. They make $60k a year together, with the husband set to make $100k alone next year. They have $1200 in rent and $500 in other bills, and after paying student loans, they have a couple hundred left for food and other needs. So, $200 is a significant chunk of their monthly budget. The wife gave away all the money in her wallet, which was $200, without discussing it with her husband. The husband felt it was irresponsible because it affects their finances, but the wife was doing it for good reasons.\n\nOn one hand, giving to those in need is a compassionate act. The wife admired the husband's giving and wanted to do the same, which shows she values kindness. However, financial decisions in a relationship should ideally be a mutual agreement, especially when the amount is significant. The husband might feel that the wife made a unilateral decision that impacts both of them, leading to stress about their budget.\n\nThe key points here are communication and financial responsibility. The wife gave away $200 without considering the couple's financial constraints, which the husband finds unreasonable. The husband's anger stems from financial pressure, not the act of giving itself. The wife, on the other hand, sees it as helping others and might not realize the financial implications. \n\nBut is the husband wrong for being upset? He's not against giving\u2014he gives money too, but in a more measured way. The issue is the amount and the suddenness. The wife's action left them with only $100 until mid-April, which is tight. The husband's reaction is about financial management, which is valid. However, his response (being angry, sleeping on the couch) might have been harsh. \n\nIn terms of right and wrong, it's a bit of a gray area. The wife could have discussed the $200 giving with her husband first, considering their budget. The husband's anger is understandable given their financial situation, but his reaction might come off as dismissive of her compassionate actions. However, since they are a couple, shared financial decisions are important. The author (husband) isn't necessarily in the wrong for being upset, but maybe the wife could have communicated better. \n\nSo, considering all factors, the husband isn't in the wrong because he's justified in being concerned about their finances. However, the wife also has a valid point in wanting to help. The main issue is communication. The answer would be B (author not in the wrong) because his concern is valid given their financial constraints.\n"
