We live in Chicago and there\u2019s homeless people on every corner. I (24M) give as many of them whatever I can afford. If I have a lot of change left or loose singles then I\u2019ll give it to one of them. Or I\u2019ll buy them some food when I get some. It all depends. My wife (22F) has always admired that I share with them and has started to do it herself. She\u2019ll sometimes give them her whole lunch or like a ten dollar bill. \n\nAnyways, we collectively make about 60k a year. Next year I\u2019ll be making $100k alone. We pay $1200 in rent and $500 in other bills. We both pay off student loans as well. At the end of month we only have a couple hundred that goes towards food, necessities, and spending money. \n\nA few days ago I had an extra $20. I saw a family that had some kids so I gave it to them. My wife kept telling me how amazing I was for it. I thought it was kind of weird how she kept bringing it up but I still appreciated her comments. Btw we have a car but we prefer to walk to work because of how busy the streets are here. \n\nLast night she told me how she helped a lot of homeless people on her way home from work. I told her it was great. While I was making dinner she started asking me how much money do I usually give away. I told her about $125 a month maybe. She continued to bring up how she helped a lot of people. \n\nWhile we were eating she brought it up again. She said \u201cyou said you give about $125 a month right babe?\u201d I nodded because I was chewing still. Next she says \u201cI outran you this week!\u201d I didn\u2019t know wtf she was talking about and I guess she could tell by the look on my face. \n\nLong story short, she said she gave every homeless person she saw some money. When I asked how much she said all of the money in her wallet. I asked how much again. She told me about $200 like it was nothing.\n\nI instantly said what the fuck? She was surprised at my reaction like I would be happy about it. We argued about it. $200 is a lot of money for us. We already payed our rent and utilities but now we only have $100 until April 15th. I told her that she acted senselessly. \n\nShe\u2019s been ignoring me ever since and locked me out of our bedroom last night. I slept on the couch. \n\nNow I\u2019m wondering if I was the asshole for being mad. After all, those people do need it more than us. But I still feel like she shouldn\u2019t have given away that much when we can barely afford it. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for being upset that his wife gave away $200 to homeless people. They have a combined income of $60k, with the husband set to make $100k next year. Their expenses are $1200 for rent, $500 for other bills, and they both have student loans. At the end of the month, they only have a couple hundred left for food and other needs.\n\nSo, the key points here are their financial situation and their values around giving. The husband gives about $125 a month, while the wife gave $200 in a week. The husband is upset because $200 is a significant portion of their remaining money after bills. The wife seems to have done this impulsively, giving all her wallet money to homeless people. \n\nFirst, I need to consider if the husband is wrong to be upset. The couple's finances are tight, so $200 is a big chunk. The husband is making an effort to give, but in a more measured way. The wife's action might have been spontaneous, which could lead to tension if not discussed beforehand. \n\nOn the other hand, the wife admires the husband's giving and tried to emulate it. She might feel that helping others is important, even if it's a larger sum. But they might not have a shared agreement on how much to allocate for such giving. \n\nThe husband's reaction\u2014being angry and causing a fight\u2014could be seen as valid because of the financial strain. However, maybe he should have discussed his concerns calmly instead of being dismissive. The wife might not have realized the impact of her action. \n\nIs the husband wrong? If they didn't have a prior agreement on giving, then both might share some responsibility. The wife gave without considering the household budget, and the husband reacted harshly without understanding her perspective. \n\nBut the main question is whether the author (husband) is in the wrong. His anger is based on financial reality, which is legitimate. However, his approach of being upset and causing a rift might not be the best way to handle it. \n\nIn terms of right or wrong, maybe the husband isn't entirely wrong because the financial situation is tight. But he could have handled it better. The wife also didn't communicate her intentions beforehand. However, since the question is about the husband's wrongness, the answer hinges on whether his reaction is justified. \n\nConsidering all that, the answer might be B (author is not in the wrong) because his financial concerns are valid, especially given their budget. But some might argue he should be more understanding. However, given the context, his reaction is understandable.\n"
