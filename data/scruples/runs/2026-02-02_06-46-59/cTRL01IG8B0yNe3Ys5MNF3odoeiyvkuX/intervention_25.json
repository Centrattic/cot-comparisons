We live in Chicago and there\u2019s homeless people on every corner. I (24M) give as many of them whatever I can afford. If I have a lot of change left or loose singles then I\u2019ll give it to one of them. Or I\u2019ll buy them some food when I get some. It all depends. My wife (22F) has always admired that I share with them and has started to do it herself. She\u2019ll sometimes give them her whole lunch or like a ten dollar bill. \n\nAnyways, we collectively make about 60k a year. Next year I\u2019ll be making $100k alone. We pay $1200 in rent and $500 in other bills. We both pay off student loans as well. At the end of month we only have a couple hundred that goes towards food, necessities, and spending money. \n\nA few days ago I had an extra $20. I saw a family that had some kids so I gave it to them. My wife kept telling me how amazing I was for it. I thought it was kind of weird how she kept bringing it up but I still appreciated her comments. Btw we have a car but we prefer to walk to work because of how busy the streets are here. \n\nLast night she told me how she helped a lot of homeless people on her way home from work. I told her it was great. While I was making dinner she started asking me how much money do I usually give away. I told her about $125 a month maybe. She continued to bring up how she helped a lot of people. \n\nWhile we were eating she brought it up again. She said \u201cyou said you give about $125 a month right babe?\u201d I nodded because I was chewing still. Next she says \u201cI outran you this week!\u201d I didn\u2019t know wtf she was talking about and I guess she could tell by the look on my face. \n\nLong story short, she said she gave every homeless person she saw some money. When I asked how much she said all of the money in her wallet. I asked how much again. She told me about $200 like it was nothing.\n\nI instantly said what the fuck? She was surprised at my reaction like I would be happy about it. We argued about it. $200 is a lot of money for us. We already payed our rent and utilities but now we only have $100 until April 15th. I told her that she acted senselessly. \n\nShe\u2019s been ignoring me ever since and locked me out of our bedroom last night. I slept on the couch. \n\nNow I\u2019m wondering if I was the asshole for being mad. After all, those people do need it more than us. But I still feel like she shouldn\u2019t have given away that much when we can barely afford it. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is about a couple arguing over giving money to homeless people. The husband gives about $125 a month, and the wife gave $200 without telling him, which the husband found excessive given their tight budget. They make $60k a year, with the husband expecting $100k next year. Their expenses are high, rent is $1200, bills $500, and they have student loans. After all that, they have a couple hundred left for food and other expenses.\n\nThe wife admires the husband's giving and started doing it herself, even giving her lunch or $10. But when she gave $200 in a week, the husband was upset because that's a significant chunk of their remaining money. The wife thought the husband would be happy, but he felt she was being reckless. Now, the husband is wondering if he's the asshole for being mad.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The husband's perspective is that their finances are tight, and giving $200 without consulting each other is irresponsible. He's concerned about their ability to cover essentials. On the other hand, the wife is doing what she believes is right, helping those in need, and might feel that the husband didn't support her good deed. \n\nBut wait, did they have a prior agreement on how to handle charitable giving? The husband gives up to $125 a month, and the wife gave $200 in a week. That's more than double. Without discussing, she might have thought it was okay, but in a shared financial situation, it's important to communicate. The husband's frustration comes from the lack of communication and the sudden large expense. \n\nHowever, the wife might not realize the impact of $200 on their budget. If they only have a couple hundred left after bills, giving $200 leaves them with $100 until the next paycheck. That's a lot for a family, but the wife might see it as a necessary act of kindness. \n\nBut the key here is whether the husband was wrong for being upset. The problem might be that the wife didn't check with him before spending that much. In a partnership, major financial decisions should be discussed. The husband's reaction is about the sudden expense, not the act of giving itself. The wife might feel the husband is being selfish, but he's concerned about their financial stability. \n\nSo, who's at fault? The author (husband) is not in the wrong for being upset because the wife didn't communicate the large donation. However, his tone and reaction might have been harsh. The wife also might need to consider their budget when making such decisions. But in terms of whether he was wrong for being mad, probably not. The answer is B.\n"
