We live in Chicago and there\u2019s homeless people on every corner. I (24M) give as many of them whatever I can afford. If I have a lot of change left or loose singles then I\u2019ll give it to one of them. Or I\u2019ll buy them some food when I get some. It all depends. My wife (22F) has always admired that I share with them and has started to do it herself. She\u2019ll sometimes give them her whole lunch or like a ten dollar bill. \n\nAnyways, we collectively make about 60k a year. Next year I\u2019ll be making $100k alone. We pay $1200 in rent and $500 in other bills. We both pay off student loans as well. At the end of month we only have a couple hundred that goes towards food, necessities, and spending money. \n\nA few days ago I had an extra $20. I saw a family that had some kids so I gave it to them. My wife kept telling me how amazing I was for it. I thought it was kind of weird how she kept bringing it up but I still appreciated her comments. Btw we have a car but we prefer to walk to work because of how busy the streets are here. \n\nLast night she told me how she helped a lot of homeless people on her way home from work. I told her it was great. While I was making dinner she started asking me how much money do I usually give away. I told her about $125 a month maybe. She continued to bring up how she helped a lot of people. \n\nWhile we were eating she brought it up again. She said \u201cyou said you give about $125 a month right babe?\u201d I nodded because I was chewing still. Next she says \u201cI outran you this week!\u201d I didn\u2019t know wtf she was talking about and I guess she could tell by the look on my face. \n\nLong story short, she said she gave every homeless person she saw some money. When I asked how much she said all of the money in her wallet. I asked how much again. She told me about $200 like it was nothing.\n\nI instantly said what the fuck? She was surprised at my reaction like I would be happy about it. We argued about it. $200 is a lot of money for us. We already payed our rent and utilities but now we only have $100 until April 15th. I told her that she acted senselessly. \n\nShe\u2019s been ignoring me ever since and locked me out of our bedroom last night. I slept on the couch. \n\nNow I\u2019m wondering if I was the asshole for being mad. After all, those people do need it more than us. But I still feel like she shouldn\u2019t have given away that much when we can barely afford it. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for being upset that his wife gave away $200 to homeless people. The context is that their combined income is $60k, and the author will make $100k next year. They have a car but walk to work. Their monthly expenses are rent and bills, with a couple hundred left for food and necessities.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both perspectives. The author gave about $125 a month, which is manageable since they have some leftover money. The wife gave $200 in a single week. The key point here is whether the wife's action was within their agreed-upon financial boundaries. \n\nThe author might feel that giving $200 all at once is irresponsible because they can't afford it. If they have only $100 left until the next pay, that's a problem. The wife, on the other hand, might see it as a good deed, helping those in need. But the issue is the unspoken assumptions in their relationship. The author contributes a certain amount, and the wife gave more without discussing it. \n\nCommunication is crucial here. The wife didn't check with the husband before giving away a significant portion of their funds, which might lead to financial strain. The husband's reaction, while maybe harsh, is about their shared financial situation. The wife's surprise at his anger suggests she didn't realize the impact. \n\nAlso, the fact that the wife locked him out of the bedroom and he slept on the couch shows tension. But the main question is about the wrong. If the husband's concern is about their financial stability, then he's not in the wrong for being upset. However, if the wife acted without considering their budget, she might be at fault. The answer likely depends on whether the $200 was from their shared funds or hers alone. If it's shared, then giving without discussion is an issue. If it's her separate money, maybe not. But the husband's mention of their funds left until April suggests it was shared. \n\nSo, the author is not in the wrong for being mad because the wife made a financial decision without communication, affecting their shared resources. The answer would be B.\n"
