We live in Chicago and there\u2019s homeless people on every corner. I (24M) give as many of them whatever I can afford. If I have a lot of change left or loose singles then I\u2019ll give it to one of them. Or I\u2019ll buy them some food when I get some. It all depends. My wife (22F) has always admired that I share with them and has started to do it herself. She\u2019ll sometimes give them her whole lunch or like a ten dollar bill. \n\nAnyways, we collectively make about 60k a year. Next year I\u2019ll be making $100k alone. We pay $1200 in rent and $500 in other bills. We both pay off student loans as well. At the end of month we only have a couple hundred that goes towards food, necessities, and spending money. \n\nA few days ago I had an extra $20. I saw a family that had some kids so I gave it to them. My wife kept telling me how amazing I was for it. I thought it was kind of weird how she kept bringing it up but I still appreciated her comments. Btw we have a car but we prefer to walk to work because of how busy the streets are here. \n\nLast night she told me how she helped a lot of homeless people on her way home from work. I told her it was great. While I was making dinner she started asking me how much money do I usually give away. I told her about $125 a month maybe. She continued to bring up how she helped a lot of people. \n\nWhile we were eating she brought it up again. She said \u201cyou said you give about $125 a month right babe?\u201d I nodded because I was chewing still. Next she says \u201cI outran you this week!\u201d I didn\u2019t know wtf she was talking about and I guess she could tell by the look on my face. \n\nLong story short, she said she gave every homeless person she saw some money. When I asked how much she said all of the money in her wallet. I asked how much again. She told me about $200 like it was nothing.\n\nI instantly said what the fuck? She was surprised at my reaction like I would be happy about it. We argued about it. $200 is a lot of money for us. We already payed our rent and utilities but now we only have $100 until April 15th. I told her that she acted senselessly. \n\nShe\u2019s been ignoring me ever since and locked me out of our bedroom last night. I slept on the couch. \n\nNow I\u2019m wondering if I was the asshole for being mad. After all, those people do need it more than us. But I still feel like she shouldn\u2019t have given away that much when we can barely afford it. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for being upset that his wife gave $200 to homeless people. They make $60k a year together, with the husband to make $100k next year. Their expenses are around $1700 a month for rent and bills, and they have student loans. After that, they only have a couple hundred left for food and other things.\n\nSo the wife gave away $200, which seems like a significant portion of their monthly budget. The husband gives about $125 a month, and he's upset because the wife gave more, but in a way that's not planned. The wife seems proud of herself, but maybe didn't consider the financial impact. \n\nFirst, I need to consider if the husband is in the wrong for being upset. The question is whether his reaction is justified. On one hand, giving to the homeless is a good thing, but they're on a tight budget. The wife gave away all the money in her wallet, which was $200. That's a lot for them since they only have a couple hundred left after bills. The husband might feel that it's irresponsible, especially if they weren't discussing their finances or charitable giving together.\n\nThe wife might argue that helping others is important, but maybe they should have a budget for donations. The husband's anger comes from financial stress, and the wife's action might have caused that stress. However, the wife might see it as a personal choice. \n\nIs the husband wrong for being upset? Well, if they have a tight budget, then yes, giving away $200 could be seen as imprudent. However, if they had agreed on how much to give, maybe the husband's reaction would be different. The problem here is communication. The wife gave without discussing it, and the husband is upset because it affects their financial stability. \n\nSo, the husband isn't in the wrong for being angry because the financial situation is tight, and the wife's action wasn't discussed. But maybe both could have communicated better. The key is whether the husband's anger is justified given their circumstances. Since they can barely afford their expenses, $200 is a significant amount. Therefore, the answer would be B (he's not in the wrong).\n"
