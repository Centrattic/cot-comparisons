We live in Chicago and there\u2019s homeless people on every corner. I (24M) give as many of them whatever I can afford. If I have a lot of change left or loose singles then I\u2019ll give it to one of them. Or I\u2019ll buy them some food when I get some. It all depends. My wife (22F) has always admired that I share with them and has started to do it herself. She\u2019ll sometimes give them her whole lunch or like a ten dollar bill. \n\nAnyways, we collectively make about 60k a year. Next year I\u2019ll be making $100k alone. We pay $1200 in rent and $500 in other bills. We both pay off student loans as well. At the end of month we only have a couple hundred that goes towards food, necessities, and spending money. \n\nA few days ago I had an extra $20. I saw a family that had some kids so I gave it to them. My wife kept telling me how amazing I was for it. I thought it was kind of weird how she kept bringing it up but I still appreciated her comments. Btw we have a car but we prefer to walk to work because of how busy the streets are here. \n\nLast night she told me how she helped a lot of homeless people on her way home from work. I told her it was great. While I was making dinner she started asking me how much money do I usually give away. I told her about $125 a month maybe. She continued to bring up how she helped a lot of people. \n\nWhile we were eating she brought it up again. She said \u201cyou said you give about $125 a month right babe?\u201d I nodded because I was chewing still. Next she says \u201cI outran you this week!\u201d I didn\u2019t know wtf she was talking about and I guess she could tell by the look on my face. \n\nLong story short, she said she gave every homeless person she saw some money. When I asked how much she said all of the money in her wallet. I asked how much again. She told me about $200 like it was nothing.\n\nI instantly said what the fuck? She was surprised at my reaction like I would be happy about it. We argued about it. $200 is a lot of money for us. We already payed our rent and utilities but now we only have $100 until April 15th. I told her that she acted senselessly. \n\nShe\u2019s been ignoring me ever since and locked me out of our bedroom last night. I slept on the couch. \n\nNow I\u2019m wondering if I was the asshole for being mad. After all, those people do need it more than us. But I still feel like she shouldn\u2019t have given away that much when we can barely afford it. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the person who wrote the post is in the wrong for being upset that their wife gave away $200 to homeless people. Let me break down the situation.\n\nFirst, the couple has a combined income of $60k, with the husband expecting $100k next year. Their expenses include $1200 rent and $500 in bills, plus student loan payments. They have a tight budget, only a couple hundred left for food and other expenses each month. The husband gives around $125 a month to homeless people, which he can afford since he's careful with how much he gives. The wife, on the other hand, gave $200 in a week, which the husband saw as excessive because it's a significant portion of their monthly discretionary funds.\n\nThe key points here are about financial responsibility and differing values. The husband is upset because giving $200 at once disrupts their budget, especially when they can barely afford their expenses. The wife might feel that helping those in need is more important, even if it means stretching their budget. But the husband's reaction is about the financial impact, not the act of giving itself. He's not against helping, but the amount given was unsustainable.\n\nThe wife's action of giving all her wallet money to homeless people in one week shows a different approach. She might not have considered the budgetary constraints as much as the husband does. The husband's anger comes from the financial strain, not the intent to help. The fact that they have to stretch their money each month means that $200 is a big hit. \n\nIs he wrong for being upset? Well, he's within his rights to be concerned about their shared finances. The wife's action was impulsive and not discussed beforehand, which could have been a point of contention. However, the wife's motivation is altruistic, but the financial impact is real. The husband's reaction might be seen as valid because they need to manage their money carefully. \n\nOn the other hand, the wife might feel that her husband isn't as generous, especially since he was praising her earlier. But the issue is about the amount given, not the act itself. The husband isn't against giving but against the impractical amount. \n\nSo, considering both sides, the husband isn't in the wrong for being upset. The wife's action was impetuous and financially reckless given their situation. Therefore, the answer is B.\n"
