We live in Chicago and there\u2019s homeless people on every corner. I (24M) give as many of them whatever I can afford. If I have a lot of change left or loose singles then I\u2019ll give it to one of them. Or I\u2019ll buy them some food when I get some. It all depends. My wife (22F) has always admired that I share with them and has started to do it herself. She\u2019ll sometimes give them her whole lunch or like a ten dollar bill. \n\nAnyways, we collectively make about 60k a year. Next year I\u2019ll be making $100k alone. We pay $1200 in rent and $500 in other bills. We both pay off student loans as well. At the end of month we only have a couple hundred that goes towards food, necessities, and spending money. \n\nA few days ago I had an extra $20. I saw a family that had some kids so I gave it to them. My wife kept telling me how amazing I was for it. I thought it was kind of weird how she kept bringing it up but I still appreciated her comments. Btw we have a car but we prefer to walk to work because of how busy the streets are here. \n\nLast night she told me how she helped a lot of homeless people on her way home from work. I told her it was great. While I was making dinner she started asking me how much money do I usually give away. I told her about $125 a month maybe. She continued to bring up how she helped a lot of people. \n\nWhile we were eating she brought it up again. She said \u201cyou said you give about $125 a month right babe?\u201d I nodded because I was chewing still. Next she says \u201cI outran you this week!\u201d I didn\u2019t know wtf she was talking about and I guess she could tell by the look on my face. \n\nLong story short, she said she gave every homeless person she saw some money. When I asked how much she said all of the money in her wallet. I asked how much again. She told me about $200 like it was nothing.\n\nI instantly said what the fuck? She was surprised at my reaction like I would be happy about it. We argued about it. $200 is a lot of money for us. We already payed our rent and utilities but now we only have $100 until April 15th. I told her that she acted senselessly. \n\nShe\u2019s been ignoring me ever since and locked me out of our bedroom last night. I slept on the couch. \n\nNow I\u2019m wondering if I was the asshole for being mad. After all, those people do need it more than us. But I still feel like she shouldn\u2019t have given away that much when we can barely afford it. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about a couple in Chicago who both give to homeless people. The author gives around $125 a month, and his wife gave $200 in one week. The couple's finances are tight with a combined income of $60k, high rent and student loans. The husband is upset about the $200, thinking it's too much, and they had a fight about it.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the financial context. Their income is $60k, paying $1200 rent and $500 in bills. After that, they have a couple hundred left for food, necessities, and spending. So $200 is a significant chunk of their monthly disposable income. The wife gave that all away in a week, which might be a problem because they're already tight on money. \n\nBut then there's the moral aspect. The husband supports giving to the homeless, but the amount his wife gave was more than he had allocated. The question is whether being upset about the financial impact makes him the asshole. \n\nOn one hand, the wife's action was generous, but if they can't afford it, it's a problem. The husband has a right to be concerned about their budget. On the other hand, the wife might feel that helping is important, even if it's a large amount. \n\nThe key points are communication and financial responsibility. Did the wife discuss the $200 giving with the husband before doing it? If they have a shared budget, using a large portion without discussion could be an issue. The husband's reaction might be valid because it affects their financial stability. \n\nHowever, the author's initial statement says they both give, and the wife was inspired by him. The husband gave $125/month, but the wife gave $200 in a week. The problem is the sudden, large expenditure. The husband's anger is about the financial impact, not the act of giving itself. \n\nThe wife might not realize how significant $200 is to their budget. The husband could have handled it better, like discussing it calmly instead of lashing out. But the wife's action might be seen as irresponsible if they agreed on a budget. \n\nSo, the answer depends on whether the wife's action was within their agreed-upon financial boundaries. If they didn't discuss it and she spent a large portion without input, the husband has a right to be upset. But if the wife thought it was okay, maybe the husband overreacted. \n\nIn terms of the AITA standard, the author is not in the wrong if his concern is about the financial impact. The wife's action caused financial strain, so the husband's reaction is justified. Therefore, the answer is B.\n"
