We live in Chicago and there\u2019s homeless people on every corner. I (24M) give as many of them whatever I can afford. If I have a lot of change left or loose singles then I\u2019ll give it to one of them. Or I\u2019ll buy them some food when I get some. It all depends. My wife (22F) has always admired that I share with them and has started to do it herself. She\u2019ll sometimes give them her whole lunch or like a ten dollar bill. \n\nAnyways, we collectively make about 60k a year. Next year I\u2019ll be making $100k alone. We pay $1200 in rent and $500 in other bills. We both pay off student loans as well. At the end of month we only have a couple hundred that goes towards food, necessities, and spending money. \n\nA few days ago I had an extra $20. I saw a family that had some kids so I gave it to them. My wife kept telling me how amazing I was for it. I thought it was kind of weird how she kept bringing it up but I still appreciated her comments. Btw we have a car but we prefer to walk to work because of how busy the streets are here. \n\nLast night she told me how she helped a lot of homeless people on her way home from work. I told her it was great. While I was making dinner she started asking me how much money do I usually give away. I told her about $125 a month maybe. She continued to bring up how she helped a lot of people. \n\nWhile we were eating she brought it up again. She said \u201cyou said you give about $125 a month right babe?\u201d I nodded because I was chewing still. Next she says \u201cI outran you this week!\u201d I didn\u2019t know wtf she was talking about and I guess she could tell by the look on my face. \n\nLong story short, she said she gave every homeless person she saw some money. When I asked how much she said all of the money in her wallet. I asked how much again. She told me about $200 like it was nothing.\n\nI instantly said what the fuck? She was surprised at my reaction like I would be happy about it. We argued about it. $200 is a lot of money for us. We already payed our rent and utilities but now we only have $100 until April 15th. I told her that she acted senselessly. \n\nShe\u2019s been ignoring me ever since and locked me out of our bedroom last night. I slept on the couch. \n\nNow I\u2019m wondering if I was the asshole for being mad. After all, those people do need it more than us. But I still feel like she shouldn\u2019t have given away that much when we can barely afford it. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, so the user is asking if the author is in the wrong for getting angry that their wife gave away $200 to homeless people. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the couple's financial situation: they make $60k together, but next year the author will be making $100k alone. Their current expenses are $1200 for rent and $500 for other bills, plus student loans. At the end of the month, they have a couple hundred dollars for food, essentials, and spending. So $200 is a significant portion of their remaining budget. If they've already paid rent and utilities, losing $200 would leave them with only $100 until April 15th, which is tight. That seems like a real financial stressor.\n\nThe author gives around $125 a month, which he mentions is what he can afford. The wife, on the other hand, gave $200 in a week, which is more than double his monthly giving. The key here is that they're discussing how much they can afford. The wife's action might have been impulsive or without considering their shared finances. Even though she admired his giving before, giving all her cash at once could be seen as irresponsible if it affects their ability to cover necessary expenses.\n\nThe author's reaction was frustration and anger, which is understandable given the financial constraints. The wife's surprise at his reaction suggests she didn't see the issue, which might indicate a lack of communication about their financial priorities and limits. The fact that they both have student loans to pay means their budget is tight, and sudden large expenditures could disrupt their financial stability.\n\nHowever, the wife's intention was to help, which is noble. The conflict arises from differing views on how to manage charitable giving within their budget. The author's anger is valid because it's about their shared money, but maybe he could have handled it more calmly and discussed their budgeting for such contributions. On the other hand, the wife should have checked in with him before giving away such a large amount, especially when they have a limited budget. \n\nSo, considering both perspectives, the wife's action was excessive given their financial situation, and the author has a right to be upset. But the author's reaction of anger and the wife locking him out the bedroom complicates things. The question is whether the author is in the wrong. Since the wife gave away a significant portion of their shared funds without discussing it, the author's frustration is justified. The answer leans towards B (No, the author is not in the wrong), but there's room for both sides. The main point is that both should communicate better about financial decisions, but the author's reaction is understandable given the circumstances.\n"
