We live in Chicago and there\u2019s homeless people on every corner. I (24M) give as many of them whatever I can afford. If I have a lot of change left or loose singles then I\u2019ll give it to one of them. Or I\u2019ll buy them some food when I get some. It all depends. My wife (22F) has always admired that I share with them and has started to do it herself. She\u2019ll sometimes give them her whole lunch or like a ten dollar bill. \n\nAnyways, we collectively make about 60k a year. Next year I\u2019ll be making $100k alone. We pay $1200 in rent and $500 in other bills. We both pay off student loans as well. At the end of month we only have a couple hundred that goes towards food, necessities, and spending money. \n\nA few days ago I had an extra $20. I saw a family that had some kids so I gave it to them. My wife kept telling me how amazing I was for it. I thought it was kind of weird how she kept bringing it up but I still appreciated her comments. Btw we have a car but we prefer to walk to work because of how busy the streets are here. \n\nLast night she told me how she helped a lot of homeless people on her way home from work. I told her it was great. While I was making dinner she started asking me how much money do I usually give away. I told her about $125 a month maybe. She continued to bring up how she helped a lot of people. \n\nWhile we were eating she brought it up again. She said \u201cyou said you give about $125 a month right babe?\u201d I nodded because I was chewing still. Next she says \u201cI outran you this week!\u201d I didn\u2019t know wtf she was talking about and I guess she could tell by the look on my face. \n\nLong story short, she said she gave every homeless person she saw some money. When I asked how much she said all of the money in her wallet. I asked how much again. She told me about $200 like it was nothing.\n\nI instantly said what the fuck? She was surprised at my reaction like I would be happy about it. We argued about it. $200 is a lot of money for us. We already payed our rent and utilities but now we only have $100 until April 15th. I told her that she acted senselessly. \n\nShe\u2019s been ignoring me ever since and locked me out of our bedroom last night. I slept on the couch. \n\nNow I\u2019m wondering if I was the asshole for being mad. After all, those people do need it more than us. But I still feel like she shouldn\u2019t have given away that much when we can barely afford it. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for getting mad that his wife gave $200 to homeless people. They have a tight budget, making $60k together and next year the husband will make $100k alone. Their expenses include rent, bills, student loans, and they have only a couple hundred left for food and other needs each month.\n\nSo the husband gives about $125 a month, which he can afford since he says he gives when he has loose change or extra. The wife gave $200 all at once, which the husband found shocking because that's a significant chunk of their remaining money each month. They had already paid rent and utilities, but now they only have $100 until the 15th. \n\nThe user wants to know if the husband is wrong for being upset. The options are A (yes, he's wrong) or B (no). \n\nFirst, financial priorities matter. If they can't afford to give that much, then giving $200 might be irresponsible. The wife gave all the money in her wallet, which the husband considers senseless. But maybe the wife feels strongly about helping and sees it as their moral duty. However, the key point is their financial situation. If giving away $200 puts their own needs at risk, then the husband has a valid concern. He might feel it's impractical, while she might feel it's compassionate. \n\nBut is he wrong for being upset? If the couple hasn't agreed on a budget for charitable giving, then both might have different views. However, since they have limited funds, the husband is worried about their ability to manage expenses. The wife might not have considered the financial impact, but her intention was to help. \n\nIn terms of responsibility, if they can't afford it, then the husband has a right to be concerned. On the other hand, if they had a different agreement, maybe the husband overreacted. But given the context, the husband's reaction seems justified because $200 is a large portion of their discretionary income. The wife might need to be more mindful of their financial constraints. \n\nSo the answer would be B (No, the author is not in the wrong). He has a right to be upset because the donation could affect their financial stability. They need to communicate better about their financial priorities.\n"
