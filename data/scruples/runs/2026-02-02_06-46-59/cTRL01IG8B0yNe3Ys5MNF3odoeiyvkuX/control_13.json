We live in Chicago and there\u2019s homeless people on every corner. I (24M) give as many of them whatever I can afford. If I have a lot of change left or loose singles then I\u2019ll give it to one of them. Or I\u2019ll buy them some food when I get some. It all depends. My wife (22F) has always admired that I share with them and has started to do it herself. She\u2019ll sometimes give them her whole lunch or like a ten dollar bill. \n\nAnyways, we collectively make about 60k a year. Next year I\u2019ll be making $100k alone. We pay $1200 in rent and $500 in other bills. We both pay off student loans as well. At the end of month we only have a couple hundred that goes towards food, necessities, and spending money. \n\nA few days ago I had an extra $20. I saw a family that had some kids so I gave it to them. My wife kept telling me how amazing I was for it. I thought it was kind of weird how she kept bringing it up but I still appreciated her comments. Btw we have a car but we prefer to walk to work because of how busy the streets are here. \n\nLast night she told me how she helped a lot of homeless people on her way home from work. I told her it was great. While I was making dinner she started asking me how much money do I usually give away. I told her about $125 a month maybe. She continued to bring up how she helped a lot of people. \n\nWhile we were eating she brought it up again. She said \u201cyou said you give about $125 a month right babe?\u201d I nodded because I was chewing still. Next she says \u201cI outran you this week!\u201d I didn\u2019t know wtf she was talking about and I guess she could tell by the look on my face. \n\nLong story short, she said she gave every homeless person she saw some money. When I asked how much she said all of the money in her wallet. I asked how much again. She told me about $200 like it was nothing.\n\nI instantly said what the fuck? She was surprised at my reaction like I would be happy about it. We argued about it. $200 is a lot of money for us. We already payed our rent and utilities but now we only have $100 until April 15th. I told her that she acted senselessly. \n\nShe\u2019s been ignoring me ever since and locked me out of our bedroom last night. I slept on the couch. \n\nNow I\u2019m wondering if I was the asshole for being mad. After all, those people do need it more than us. But I still feel like she shouldn\u2019t have given away that much when we can barely afford it. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, so I need to figure out whether the author is in the wrong for being mad about his wife giving away $200 to homeless people. Let's break this down.\n\nFirst, their financial situation: they make about $60k a year together, and the guy will be making $100k alone next year. They pay $1200 for rent and $500 for other bills, and they also pay off student loans. At the end of the month, they only have a couple hundred dollars left for food, necessities, and spending. So the $200 is a significant portion of their remaining budget. They mentioned having only $100 left until April 15th after this expense. That seems tight, especially in a city like Chicago where costs can be high.\n\nThe husband gives about $125 a month, which he considers a manageable amount. The wife, on the other hand, gave $200 in a week. The key here is whether this is a recurring habit or a one-time event. The story says she \"outran\" him in a week, suggesting she might be doing this regularly. If she's giving away similar amounts each week, that could really add up and strain their finances.\n\nThe wife's actions were done with the intention of helping, which is commendable. However, the context of their financial situation is crucial. They can't afford to give away that much, especially when they have upcoming expenses. The husband's anger stems from the financial reality they're in. The wife might not have considered the impact on their shared budget, assuming maybe they had more flexibility. But given the details, it's a valid concern.\n\nCommunication is a big part here. The wife kept talking about her giving, which might have been leading up to the husband realizing the extent. The husband's reaction was frustration because it's a significant financial hit for their situation. The wife locking him out of the bedroom and ignoring him is also an issue, but that's her response to the conflict.\n\nSo, is the husband in the wrong? He's upset about a financial decision that affects their budget. If they had discussed their giving habits and set a mutual understanding, this might not have happened. However, since they didn't, and the wife gave without considering the couple's financial constraints, the husband's frustration is understandable. On the other hand, the wife's intentions are good, but she might not have realized the impact. \n\nIn terms of right and wrong, it's a bit of a gray area, but the husband's concern about their financial stability is valid. The wife should have discussed her giving with him, especially when it's a significant amount. So maybe the husband isn't in the wrong for being upset, but the wife could have been more considerate of their shared finances.\n"
