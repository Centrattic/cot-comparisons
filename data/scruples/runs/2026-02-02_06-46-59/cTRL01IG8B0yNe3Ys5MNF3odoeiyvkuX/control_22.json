We live in Chicago and there\u2019s homeless people on every corner. I (24M) give as many of them whatever I can afford. If I have a lot of change left or loose singles then I\u2019ll give it to one of them. Or I\u2019ll buy them some food when I get some. It all depends. My wife (22F) has always admired that I share with them and has started to do it herself. She\u2019ll sometimes give them her whole lunch or like a ten dollar bill. \n\nAnyways, we collectively make about 60k a year. Next year I\u2019ll be making $100k alone. We pay $1200 in rent and $500 in other bills. We both pay off student loans as well. At the end of month we only have a couple hundred that goes towards food, necessities, and spending money. \n\nA few days ago I had an extra $20. I saw a family that had some kids so I gave it to them. My wife kept telling me how amazing I was for it. I thought it was kind of weird how she kept bringing it up but I still appreciated her comments. Btw we have a car but we prefer to walk to work because of how busy the streets are here. \n\nLast night she told me how she helped a lot of homeless people on her way home from work. I told her it was great. While I was making dinner she started asking me how much money do I usually give away. I told her about $125 a month maybe. She continued to bring up how she helped a lot of people. \n\nWhile we were eating she brought it up again. She said \u201cyou said you give about $125 a month right babe?\u201d I nodded because I was chewing still. Next she says \u201cI outran you this week!\u201d I didn\u2019t know wtf she was talking about and I guess she could tell by the look on my face. \n\nLong story short, she said she gave every homeless person she saw some money. When I asked how much she said all of the money in her wallet. I asked how much again. She told me about $200 like it was nothing.\n\nI instantly said what the fuck? She was surprised at my reaction like I would be happy about it. We argued about it. $200 is a lot of money for us. We already payed our rent and utilities but now we only have $100 until April 15th. I told her that she acted senselessly. \n\nShe\u2019s been ignoring me ever since and locked me out of our bedroom last night. I slept on the couch. \n\nNow I\u2019m wondering if I was the asshole for being mad. After all, those people do need it more than us. But I still feel like she shouldn\u2019t have given away that much when we can barely afford it. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. So the user is asking whether the author (the husband) is in the wrong for being upset that his wife gave away $200 to homeless people. Let me break down the situation.\n\nFirst, their finances: they make around $60k a year combined, and the husband will be making $100k alone next year. Their rent is $1,200 and other bills $500. They both have student loans. At the end of the month, they have only a couple hundred dollars left for food and other expenses. So their budget is tight. The husband gives about $125 a month to homeless people, which they can afford since they have a little left after bills. The wife gave $200 in a week, which is a significant chunk of their remaining money. \n\nThe wife admires the husband's giving and started doing it herself, but her contribution was more than double his monthly amount in a week. The husband was surprised and upset because $200 would leave them with only $100 until mid-April. They ended up arguing, and the wife locked him out of the bedroom.\n\nNow, the key points here are financial responsibility and communication. The wife's action, while generous, might be seen as irresponsible given their financial situation. The husband is concerned about their ability to manage expenses, which is valid, especially since they have tight funds. However, the wife might feel that helping is important and that the husband is being too focused on money. \n\nBut the question is whether the husband is in the wrong. The husband's reaction is based on the couple's financial constraints. He's upset because the $200 was a large portion of their available funds, which could affect their ability to cover other necessities. On the other hand, the wife might have felt that she was just following his example, albeit more generously. \n\nThe husband's anger might be justified because without prior discussion, giving away such a large amount without considering the household budget could be seen as not considering the couple's financial planning. However, the wife might argue that she's just as entitled to make her own charitable decisions. \n\nBut in a relationship, especially when finances are tight, communication is key. The wife gave away a significant sum without discussing it with her husband, which the husband finds irresponsible. The husband's reaction could be seen as valid because it's about managing shared finances responsibly. \n\nOn the other hand, if the wife had discussed her intentions with her husband first, maybe they could have found a middle ground. But since she didn't, the husband's frustration is understandable. \n\nSo, considering all that, the husband isn't in the wrong for being upset. The wife's action was generous but potentially careless in their financial context. The husband has a right to be concerned about their shared financial stability. Therefore, the answer would be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
