We live in Chicago and there\u2019s homeless people on every corner. I (24M) give as many of them whatever I can afford. If I have a lot of change left or loose singles then I\u2019ll give it to one of them. Or I\u2019ll buy them some food when I get some. It all depends. My wife (22F) has always admired that I share with them and has started to do it herself. She\u2019ll sometimes give them her whole lunch or like a ten dollar bill. \n\nAnyways, we collectively make about 60k a year. Next year I\u2019ll be making $100k alone. We pay $1200 in rent and $500 in other bills. We both pay off student loans as well. At the end of month we only have a couple hundred that goes towards food, necessities, and spending money. \n\nA few days ago I had an extra $20. I saw a family that had some kids so I gave it to them. My wife kept telling me how amazing I was for it. I thought it was kind of weird how she kept bringing it up but I still appreciated her comments. Btw we have a car but we prefer to walk to work because of how busy the streets are here. \n\nLast night she told me how she helped a lot of homeless people on her way home from work. I told her it was great. While I was making dinner she started asking me how much money do I usually give away. I told her about $125 a month maybe. She continued to bring up how she helped a lot of people. \n\nWhile we were eating she brought it up again. She said \u201cyou said you give about $125 a month right babe?\u201d I nodded because I was chewing still. Next she says \u201cI outran you this week!\u201d I didn\u2019t know wtf she was talking about and I guess she could tell by the look on my face. \n\nLong story short, she said she gave every homeless person she saw some money. When I asked how much she said all of the money in her wallet. I asked how much again. She told me about $200 like it was nothing.\n\nI instantly said what the fuck? She was surprised at my reaction like I would be happy about it. We argued about it. $200 is a lot of money for us. We already payed our rent and utilities but now we only have $100 until April 15th. I told her that she acted senselessly. \n\nShe\u2019s been ignoring me ever since and locked me out of our bedroom last night. I slept on the couch. \n\nNow I\u2019m wondering if I was the asshole for being mad. After all, those people do need it more than us. But I still feel like she shouldn\u2019t have given away that much when we can barely afford it. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for getting angry at his wife for giving $200 to homeless people. \n\nFirst, I need to look at both sides. The author's side: they have a combined income of $60k, with him making $100k next year. Their expenses are $1200 for rent and $500 for other bills, plus student loans. At the end of the month, they only have a couple hundred left for food, necessities, and spending. So giving away $200 is a significant chunk of their limited funds. The author gives around $125 a month, which he thinks is reasonable, but the wife gave $200 in a week. The author is upset because they can't afford it, and they need the money for other essentials.\n\nNow the wife's side: she admires the author's generosity and is doing it herself. She's proud of her own contributions and even mentions \"outrunning\" him in giving. She gave all the money in her wallet, which was $200. She might not realize the financial strain it puts on their budget. She was excited and maybe didn't consider the author's perspective, leading to conflict.\n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong for being upset. The wife's action was generous, but the key point is their financial situation. The couple isn't wealthy, and the $200 is a significant portion of their remaining monthly budget. The author has a right to be concerned about their financial stability and to discuss this with his wife. However, maybe his reaction was too harsh. He could have been more understanding, but the financial reality is that they can't afford such a large expense. \n\nThe wife might need to consider the couple's budget when making such decisions. While her intentions are good, the amount is problematic given their circumstances. The author's anger is about the financial impact, not the act of giving itself. So, the author isn't wrong to be upset about the financial strain. The wife might be wrong in not discussing the budget before giving that much. \n\nBut maybe the author could have communicated better about the budget to prevent this. However, the user's initial thought was that the author is in the wrong, but based on the analysis, the author has valid concerns. The answer would be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
