We live in Chicago and there\u2019s homeless people on every corner. I (24M) give as many of them whatever I can afford. If I have a lot of change left or loose singles then I\u2019ll give it to one of them. Or I\u2019ll buy them some food when I get some. It all depends. My wife (22F) has always admired that I share with them and has started to do it herself. She\u2019ll sometimes give them her whole lunch or like a ten dollar bill. \n\nAnyways, we collectively make about 60k a year. Next year I\u2019ll be making $100k alone. We pay $1200 in rent and $500 in other bills. We both pay off student loans as well. At the end of month we only have a couple hundred that goes towards food, necessities, and spending money. \n\nA few days ago I had an extra $20. I saw a family that had some kids so I gave it to them. My wife kept telling me how amazing I was for it. I thought it was kind of weird how she kept bringing it up but I still appreciated her comments. Btw we have a car but we prefer to walk to work because of how busy the streets are here. \n\nLast night she told me how she helped a lot of homeless people on her way home from work. I told her it was great. While I was making dinner she started asking me how much money do I usually give away. I told her about $125 a month maybe. She continued to bring up how she helped a lot of people. \n\nWhile we were eating she brought it up again. She said \u201cyou said you give about $125 a month right babe?\u201d I nodded because I was chewing still. Next she says \u201cI outran you this week!\u201d I didn\u2019t know wtf she was talking about and I guess she could tell by the look on my face. \n\nLong story short, she said she gave every homeless person she saw some money. When I asked how much she said all of the money in her wallet. I asked how much again. She told me about $200 like it was nothing.\n\nI instantly said what the fuck? She was surprised at my reaction like I would be happy about it. We argued about it. $200 is a lot of money for us. We already payed our rent and utilities but now we only have $100 until April 15th. I told her that she acted senselessly. \n\nShe\u2019s been ignoring me ever since and locked me out of our bedroom last night. I slept on the couch. \n\nNow I\u2019m wondering if I was the asshole for being mad. After all, those people do need it more than us. But I still feel like she shouldn\u2019t have given away that much when we can barely afford it. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for being upset when his wife gave $200 to homeless people. The situation is that they have a tight budget, making $60k together with plans for the husband to make $100k next year. They pay $1200 rent and $500 in bills, and after that, they only have a couple hundred left for food and other expenses. The wife gave away $200, which the husband saw as irresponsible. He was upset, called her out, and they had a fight.\n\nHmm, the user thinks the author is in the wrong, but I need to evaluate. Let's break it down. First, giving money to homeless people is a good deed, but when it's a significant portion of your income. The wife gave $200, which from the context seems like a large chunk of their monthly discretionary funds. The husband gives $125 a month, which is notable, but the wife's $200 is more. The problem is whether giving that much when they can barely afford it is wrong.\n\nOn one hand, the wife is doing something charitable, which is commendable. But on the other hand, the couple's financial situation is tight. If they're already struggling to cover expenses, giving away $200 could create financial stress. The husband's reaction is about the financial responsibility. He's worried about their budget and the implications of such a large expense. The wife might see it as helping those in need, but the husband sees it as irresponsible.\n\nBut was the husband wrong to be upset? Well, he's the one who's concerned about their finances. The wife didn't consult him about the $200, which could be a point. They might need to have a conversation about joint financial decisions. The fact that she gave it all away without discussing it with him might be the issue. Also, the way he reacted\u2014getting angry and calling her out\u2014might have been harsh, but his concern is valid given their budget.\n\nThe user thinks the author is in the wrong, but maybe the author isn't. Both have valid points. The wife's intention is good, but the decision wasn't made together. The husband's anger is about financial prudence. However, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. If the wife made a unilateral decision to spend a significant amount that affects their shared budget, then the husband has a right to be upset. But if the focus is on the act of giving itself, then maybe the husband is wrong to be upset.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the husband should have been more understanding of her charitable actions, even if he disagrees. But given their financial constraints, it's a valid concern. So the answer might be B (not in the wrong) because he's justified in being upset about the financial impact, even if the intention is good. The wife should have discussed such a significant expense. So the author is not in the wrong.\n"
