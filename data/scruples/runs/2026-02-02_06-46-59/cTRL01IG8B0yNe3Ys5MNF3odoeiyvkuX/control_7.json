We live in Chicago and there\u2019s homeless people on every corner. I (24M) give as many of them whatever I can afford. If I have a lot of change left or loose singles then I\u2019ll give it to one of them. Or I\u2019ll buy them some food when I get some. It all depends. My wife (22F) has always admired that I share with them and has started to do it herself. She\u2019ll sometimes give them her whole lunch or like a ten dollar bill. \n\nAnyways, we collectively make about 60k a year. Next year I\u2019ll be making $100k alone. We pay $1200 in rent and $500 in other bills. We both pay off student loans as well. At the end of month we only have a couple hundred that goes towards food, necessities, and spending money. \n\nA few days ago I had an extra $20. I saw a family that had some kids so I gave it to them. My wife kept telling me how amazing I was for it. I thought it was kind of weird how she kept bringing it up but I still appreciated her comments. Btw we have a car but we prefer to walk to work because of how busy the streets are here. \n\nLast night she told me how she helped a lot of homeless people on her way home from work. I told her it was great. While I was making dinner she started asking me how much money do I usually give away. I told her about $125 a month maybe. She continued to bring up how she helped a lot of people. \n\nWhile we were eating she brought it up again. She said \u201cyou said you give about $125 a month right babe?\u201d I nodded because I was chewing still. Next she says \u201cI outran you this week!\u201d I didn\u2019t know wtf she was talking about and I guess she could tell by the look on my face. \n\nLong story short, she said she gave every homeless person she saw some money. When I asked how much she said all of the money in her wallet. I asked how much again. She told me about $200 like it was nothing.\n\nI instantly said what the fuck? She was surprised at my reaction like I would be happy about it. We argued about it. $200 is a lot of money for us. We already payed our rent and utilities but now we only have $100 until April 15th. I told her that she acted senselessly. \n\nShe\u2019s been ignoring me ever since and locked me out of our bedroom last night. I slept on the couch. \n\nNow I\u2019m wondering if I was the asshole for being mad. After all, those people do need it more than us. But I still feel like she shouldn\u2019t have given away that much when we can barely afford it. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is about a couple arguing over giving money to homeless people. The husband gives around $125 a month, and the wife gave $200 in a week. Their finances are tight, making $60k a year, with the husband set to make $100k next year. They have $1200 rent and $500 in other bills. At the end of the month, they only have a couple hundred for food and other expenses.\n\nThe wife admires the husband's generosity and started giving money too. She gave her whole lunch or $10 sometimes. But this time, she gave $200 all at once. The husband got angry because they can't afford that, especially since they only have $100 left until April 15th. The wife was surprised he was mad and now she's ignoring him.\n\nSo, the question is whether the husband is in the wrong. Let's break it down. On one hand, giving to the homeless is a good cause, and the wife is following her husband's example. But they have a limited budget, and the wife's $200 could be a significant portion of their monthly expenses. The husband might feel that such a large sum is irresponsible when they're struggling to make ends meet. \n\nThe wife might think that helping is more important than saving, especially if she sees immediate need. But the husband's reaction is about their financial responsibility. They need to communicate better about their spending priorities. Maybe the wife didn't realize the impact of her $200 donation. However, the husband could have been more understanding of her intentions, even if he disagreed with the amount.\n\nBut considering their financial situation, giving away $200 when they only have $100 left until the next paycheck is risky. It could lead to them being unable to cover necessary expenses. The husband has a right to be concerned about their financial stability. The wife might not have considered the long-term impact of her donation. So, while both have valid points, the husband's anger is about financial responsibility. The wife's action was impulsive and didn't consider their budget, which is a shared responsibility in a marriage. Therefore, the husband isn't in the wrong for being upset. But maybe he could have handled it better without being so harsh. However, the question is about being in the wrong, not about handling it well. The wife made a decision that affected their finances without considering the budget, which the husband has a right to be upset about. So the answer would be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
