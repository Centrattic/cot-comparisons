We live in Chicago and there\u2019s homeless people on every corner. I (24M) give as many of them whatever I can afford. If I have a lot of change left or loose singles then I\u2019ll give it to one of them. Or I\u2019ll buy them some food when I get some. It all depends. My wife (22F) has always admired that I share with them and has started to do it herself. She\u2019ll sometimes give them her whole lunch or like a ten dollar bill. \n\nAnyways, we collectively make about 60k a year. Next year I\u2019ll be making $100k alone. We pay $1200 in rent and $500 in other bills. We both pay off student loans as well. At the end of month we only have a couple hundred that goes towards food, necessities, and spending money. \n\nA few days ago I had an extra $20. I saw a family that had some kids so I gave it to them. My wife kept telling me how amazing I was for it. I thought it was kind of weird how she kept bringing it up but I still appreciated her comments. Btw we have a car but we prefer to walk to work because of how busy the streets are here. \n\nLast night she told me how she helped a lot of homeless people on her way home from work. I told her it was great. While I was making dinner she started asking me how much money do I usually give away. I told her about $125 a month maybe. She continued to bring up how she helped a lot of people. \n\nWhile we were eating she brought it up again. She said \u201cyou said you give about $125 a month right babe?\u201d I nodded because I was chewing still. Next she says \u201cI outran you this week!\u201d I didn\u2019t know wtf she was talking about and I guess she could tell by the look on my face. \n\nLong story short, she said she gave every homeless person she saw some money. When I asked how much she said all of the money in her wallet. I asked how much again. She told me about $200 like it was nothing.\n\nI instantly said what the fuck? She was surprised at my reaction like I would be happy about it. We argued about it. $200 is a lot of money for us. We already payed our rent and utilities but now we only have $100 until April 15th. I told her that she acted senselessly. \n\nShe\u2019s been ignoring me ever since and locked me out of our bedroom last night. I slept on the couch. \n\nNow I\u2019m wondering if I was the asshole for being mad. After all, those people do need it more than us. But I still feel like she shouldn\u2019t have given away that much when we can barely afford it. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for being upset that his wife gave $200 to homeless people. The situation is that they make $60k a year together, with the husband set to earn $100k next year. Their expenses include $1200 rent and $500 in other bills, and they have student loans. They have a bit over a couple hundred left for food and other expenses each month.\n\nThe husband gives around $125 a month to homeless people, which he can manage because he's careful with his spending. The wife, on the other hand, gave $200 in a week, which the husband found excessive given their financial situation. He got angry, and they had an argument. The user thinks the author (the husband) is in the wrong but wants my opinion.\n\nFirst, I need to evaluate the financial context. Their combined income is $60k, and after rent and bills, they have limited funds. Giving $200 from their shared budget could be a significant portion of their remaining money, especially if it's all from their savings towards food and other necessities. The wife gave away all the money in her wallet, which might have been part of their shared funds. The husband might feel that this was an irresponsible use of their limited resources, even if the intention was good.\n\nOn the other hand, the wife might see her actions as compassionate and in line with their husband's own charitable actions. She might not have realized the financial strain it would cause, possibly because they didn't have a clear agreement on how much each should contribute. The husband's reaction could be seen as valid if they have a tight budget and the $200 significantly impacts their ability to cover essential expenses. However, his anger and the way he reacted might have been harsh, especially if he didn't communicate his concerns earlier or if they didn't have a discussion about their giving habits.\n\nThe key points here are about financial management in a relationship. Both partners should ideally be on the same page regarding how they handle money, especially when it comes to charitable giving. If the wife gave away the money without discussing it, it could be seen as not respecting their shared financial goals. However, the husband's reaction\u2014getting angry and sleeping on the couch\u2014might be disproportionate if the wife didn't maliciously spend the money. \n\nIt's also important to consider that giving to homeless people is a value judgment. While some might prioritize their own financial stability, others might prioritize helping others even if it's tight. The husband's perspective is that $200 is a significant chunk of their budget, so his concern is understandable. The wife might not have realized the impact of her actions because she admired his giving before.\n\nIn terms of whether the author is in the wrong, it's a bit of a gray area. If they didn't have a prior agreement on giving habits, the wife might be at fault for not discussing the $200. However, the husband could have communicated his concerns about their budget earlier. The fact that he was giving $125 a month suggests he's comfortable with some level of giving, but the wife's $200 might exceed what they can comfortably afford together. The author's anger might be justified if he feels it's a misuse of funds, but his reaction could have been more constructive.\n\nSo, considering all that, the answer would be that the author is not in the wrong because his concern is valid given their financial situation. However, there's room for improvement in how they communicate and manage their finances together.\n"
