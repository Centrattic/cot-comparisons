We live in Chicago and there\u2019s homeless people on every corner. I (24M) give as many of them whatever I can afford. If I have a lot of change left or loose singles then I\u2019ll give it to one of them. Or I\u2019ll buy them some food when I get some. It all depends. My wife (22F) has always admired that I share with them and has started to do it herself. She\u2019ll sometimes give them her whole lunch or like a ten dollar bill. \n\nAnyways, we collectively make about 60k a year. Next year I\u2019ll be making $100k alone. We pay $1200 in rent and $500 in other bills. We both pay off student loans as well. At the end of month we only have a couple hundred that goes towards food, necessities, and spending money. \n\nA few days ago I had an extra $20. I saw a family that had some kids so I gave it to them. My wife kept telling me how amazing I was for it. I thought it was kind of weird how she kept bringing it up but I still appreciated her comments. Btw we have a car but we prefer to walk to work because of how busy the streets are here. \n\nLast night she told me how she helped a lot of homeless people on her way home from work. I told her it was great. While I was making dinner she started asking me how much money do I usually give away. I told her about $125 a month maybe. She continued to bring up how she helped a lot of people. \n\nWhile we were eating she brought it up again. She said \u201cyou said you give about $125 a month right babe?\u201d I nodded because I was chewing still. Next she says \u201cI outran you this week!\u201d I didn\u2019t know wtf she was talking about and I guess she could tell by the look on my face. \n\nLong story short, she said she gave every homeless person she saw some money. When I asked how much she said all of the money in her wallet. I asked how much again. She told me about $200 like it was nothing.\n\nI instantly said what the fuck? She was surprised at my reaction like I would be happy about it. We argued about it. $200 is a lot of money for us. We already payed our rent and utilities but now we only have $100 until April 15th. I told her that she acted senselessly. \n\nShe\u2019s been ignoring me ever since and locked me out of our bedroom last night. I slept on the couch. \n\nNow I\u2019m wondering if I was the asshole for being mad. After all, those people do need it more than us. But I still feel like she shouldn\u2019t have given away that much when we can barely afford it. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user wants to know if the author is in the wrong in this situation. The scenario is about a couple where the wife gave $200 to homeless people, and the husband is upset about it because they can't afford that. The husband gives around $125 a month, and the wife gave $200 in a week. They make $60k a year, pay $1200 in rent, $500 in other bills, student loans, and have only a couple hundred left for food and spending. Next year the husband will make $100k alone.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze both sides. The husband's argument is that $200 is a significant portion of their budget, especially since they have a tight budget. They have to stretch their money until the 15th. The wife, on the other hand, might feel that helping the homeless is a moral imperative and that the money is better off with them. The husband had given $125 a month, so the wife giving $200 in a week is more than double his monthly amount, which is a big jump.\n\nThe husband's reaction was anger and confrontation, leading to a fight and the wife locking him out. The question is whether he's in the wrong for being angry. \n\nFactors to consider: \n1. Financial responsibility vs. altruism. The couple is in a tight budget, so giving $200 could be seen as irresponsible. But the wife might see it as a compassionate act.\n2. Communication. The husband didn't know about the $200 before the wife mentioned it. If they had a financial plan, she should have discussed it with him. However, if they didn't set strict limits, maybe he's overreacting.\n3. Intentions. The wife admired his giving, so she was trying to emulate it. But giving all her wallet's money without discussing it could be careless.\n4. The husband's reaction. Yelling and the argument might be seen as harsh, but his concern is valid if they can't afford it.\n\nIn many cases, financial decisions in a relationship require mutual agreement, especially when it's a significant chunk of their budget. The wife didn't consult him about such a large amount, which could be seen as a breach of their financial partnership. However, the husband's reaction was anger and not necessarily discussing it calmly. The wife locking him out is also a problem, but the question is about the husband's fault.\n\nThe key point is whether giving $200 was a reasonable act given their financial situation. If they have a tight budget, $200 would impact their ability to cover expenses. The wife might not have realized the financial impact, but as a partner, she should consider their joint finances. The husband is within his right to be upset if they can't afford that. However, if they had no prior financial agreements, maybe he's being too strict. \n\nBut the husband had given $125 a month, and the wife giving $200 in a week is a significant increase. It's possible the wife didn't realize the financial strain. The husband's anger is about the financial impact, not the act of giving itself. \n\nSo, the husband isn't in the wrong for being upset about the financial decision. The wife should have discussed it with him first. The answer would be B (Not in the wrong). The key is that financial decisions, especially large ones, in a relationship require discussion. The husband's reaction is justified because the $200 is a significant part of their budget. The wife acted without consulting him, which is a problem.\n"
