We live in Chicago and there\u2019s homeless people on every corner. I (24M) give as many of them whatever I can afford. If I have a lot of change left or loose singles then I\u2019ll give it to one of them. Or I\u2019ll buy them some food when I get some. It all depends. My wife (22F) has always admired that I share with them and has started to do it herself. She\u2019ll sometimes give them her whole lunch or like a ten dollar bill. \n\nAnyways, we collectively make about 60k a year. Next year I\u2019ll be making $100k alone. We pay $1200 in rent and $500 in other bills. We both pay off student loans as well. At the end of month we only have a couple hundred that goes towards food, necessities, and spending money. \n\nA few days ago I had an extra $20. I saw a family that had some kids so I gave it to them. My wife kept telling me how amazing I was for it. I thought it was kind of weird how she kept bringing it up but I still appreciated her comments. Btw we have a car but we prefer to walk to work because of how busy the streets are here. \n\nLast night she told me how she helped a lot of homeless people on her way home from work. I told her it was great. While I was making dinner she started asking me how much money do I usually give away. I told her about $125 a month maybe. She continued to bring up how she helped a lot of people. \n\nWhile we were eating she brought it up again. She said \u201cyou said you give about $125 a month right babe?\u201d I nodded because I was chewing still. Next she says \u201cI outran you this week!\u201d I didn\u2019t know wtf she was talking about and I guess she could tell by the look on my face. \n\nLong story short, she said she gave every homeless person she saw some money. When I asked how much she said all of the money in her wallet. I asked how much again. She told me about $200 like it was nothing.\n\nI instantly said what the fuck? She was surprised at my reaction like I would be happy about it. We argued about it. $200 is a lot of money for us. We already payed our rent and utilities but now we only have $100 until April 15th. I told her that she acted senselessly. \n\nShe\u2019s been ignoring me ever since and locked me out of our bedroom last night. I slept on the couch. \n\nNow I\u2019m wondering if I was the asshole for being mad. After all, those people do need it more than us. But I still feel like she shouldn\u2019t have given away that much when we can barely afford it. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is a 24-year-old guy who's been married for three years. They make about $60k a year together, with him set to earn $100k next year. Their expenses are $1200 for rent and $500 for other bills, plus student loans. At the end of the month, they have only a few hundred dollars left for food, necessities, and spending. He gives around $125 a month to homeless people, and his wife admires that. But she gave away $200 in one instance, which made him angry because they can't afford it, and now they only have $100 until April 15th. He said she acted senselessly, and they had an argument.\n\nSo the question is whether he's the asshole for being mad. The key points here are the amount of money given, the couple's financial situation, and communication. The wife's action of giving $200 might be seen as a one-time thing, maybe she had the funds from a specific source like a bonus, or maybe it's part of her own giving habits. However, the husband's frustration is about their budgeting. If they had a system where they both agreed on how to handle such donations, and she went beyond that without discussing it, that's an issue. On the other hand, if this was a spontaneous act and he didn't have prior expectations, maybe his reaction is harsh. \n\nTheir financial situation is tight, with only a couple hundred left after bills. The $200 donation could impact their ability to cover basic needs. The husband mentions that they already paid rent and utilities, so the $200 is from their savings or spending money. The wife might believe in more immediate giving, while the husband is concerned about financial responsibility and planning. This is a common conflict in relationships regarding budgeting and personal spending. \n\nThe husband's reaction might be seen as valid if they hadn't discussed their financial boundaries. But he could also be seen as being inconsiderate if his wife's actions were done in good faith. The fact that he got angry and they had a fight leading to her locking him out complicates things. Maybe he should have communicated his concerns earlier, but she did give without considering the impact on their finances. \n\nIn the end, it's a matter of communication and mutual agreement. If they hadn't talked about how much they each can comfortably give, both might have valid points. However, the wife giving all the money in her wallet without checking in could be seen as irresponsible given their budget. The husband has a right to be upset if it affects their financial stability. So the answer is B, the author is not in the wrong because the wife's action may have been impulsive and without considering their shared financial constraints.\n"
