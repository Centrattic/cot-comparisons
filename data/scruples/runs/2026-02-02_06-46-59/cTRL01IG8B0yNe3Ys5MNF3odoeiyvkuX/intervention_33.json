We live in Chicago and there\u2019s homeless people on every corner. I (24M) give as many of them whatever I can afford. If I have a lot of change left or loose singles then I\u2019ll give it to one of them. Or I\u2019ll buy them some food when I get some. It all depends. My wife (22F) has always admired that I share with them and has started to do it herself. She\u2019ll sometimes give them her whole lunch or like a ten dollar bill. \n\nAnyways, we collectively make about 60k a year. Next year I\u2019ll be making $100k alone. We pay $1200 in rent and $500 in other bills. We both pay off student loans as well. At the end of month we only have a couple hundred that goes towards food, necessities, and spending money. \n\nA few days ago I had an extra $20. I saw a family that had some kids so I gave it to them. My wife kept telling me how amazing I was for it. I thought it was kind of weird how she kept bringing it up but I still appreciated her comments. Btw we have a car but we prefer to walk to work because of how busy the streets are here. \n\nLast night she told me how she helped a lot of homeless people on her way home from work. I told her it was great. While I was making dinner she started asking me how much money do I usually give away. I told her about $125 a month maybe. She continued to bring up how she helped a lot of people. \n\nWhile we were eating she brought it up again. She said \u201cyou said you give about $125 a month right babe?\u201d I nodded because I was chewing still. Next she says \u201cI outran you this week!\u201d I didn\u2019t know wtf she was talking about and I guess she could tell by the look on my face. \n\nLong story short, she said she gave every homeless person she saw some money. When I asked how much she said all of the money in her wallet. I asked how much again. She told me about $200 like it was nothing.\n\nI instantly said what the fuck? She was surprised at my reaction like I would be happy about it. We argued about it. $200 is a lot of money for us. We already payed our rent and utilities but now we only have $100 until April 15th. I told her that she acted senselessly. \n\nShe\u2019s been ignoring me ever since and locked me out of our bedroom last night. I slept on the couch. \n\nNow I\u2019m wondering if I was the asshole for being mad. After all, those people do need it more than us. But I still feel like she shouldn\u2019t have given away that much when we can barely afford it. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author (the husband) is in the wrong for being upset that his wife gave $200 to homeless people. The situation is that they have a tight budget\u2014$60k combined income, $1200 rent, $500 in other bills, student loans, and only a couple hundred left for food and spending each month. The husband gives about $125 a month to homeless individuals, and the wife gave $200 in a week without consulting him. They had an argument, and now she's ignoring him.\n\nHmm. The husband is upset because $200 is a significant portion of their budget. They have only $100 left until the next pay period after this expense. The wife, on the other hand, was praised when he gave money before, so she might feel that she's following his example. But the issue is the sudden large amount without discussing it.\n\nI need to consider both sides. The husband's perspective is that they can't afford such a large expense without communication. The wife's perspective is that she's helping people in need, which is a positive act, but maybe didn't realize the financial strain. \n\nIs the husband wrong for being upset? Well, financial decisions in a relationship usually require discussion, especially when it's a significant chunk of their budget. The wife giving away $200 without talking to him might be reckless, but the husband's reaction might be overly harsh, considering he himself gives money. However, his frustration is valid given their financial situation. \n\nOn the other hand, the wife might not have realized the impact of her actions. But the key point is that they should have a conversation about how they handle charitable giving as a couple. The husband is upset because the $200 was given without mutual agreement, which affects their shared finances. So, maybe the husband isn't entirely wrong. But is he the asshole?\n\nIn terms of right or wrong, it's a bit of a gray area. However, the husband's anger might be justified because the wife spent a large amount without discussing it. But the wife was trying to do something good, which is commendable. However, in a shared financial situation, both partners should agree on major expenses. The husband's reaction could be seen as valid because the wife didn't consider the financial implications for their household. \n\nAlternatively, if the husband had set boundaries about how much they can give together, the wife might have known her limit. But he didn't explicitly set those boundaries. So maybe the husband also has some responsibility to communicate his financial limits to her. However, she exceeded his expectations. \n\nI think the main issue is the lack of communication. The husband is upset because he didn't know about the $200 expense, which affects their shared money. The wife didn't consult him, which is a problem. Therefore, the husband's anger is understandable. But the wife's intention to help others is positive. \n\nSo, is the author (husband) in the wrong? If he's upset because she didn't consult him, that makes sense. However, if he's being overly critical without considering her motivations, maybe not. But given the financial constraints, his reaction is justified. Therefore, the answer might be B (he's not in the wrong). But I need to check again.\n\nThe question is whether he's in the wrong. The wife gave a significant amount without discussing, which impacted their budget. The husband is upset, which is valid. So the husband isn't in the wrong for being mad. The wife should have talked to him. So answer B.\n"
