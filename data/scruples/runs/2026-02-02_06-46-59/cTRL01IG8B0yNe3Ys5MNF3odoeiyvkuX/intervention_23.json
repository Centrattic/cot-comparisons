We live in Chicago and there\u2019s homeless people on every corner. I (24M) give as many of them whatever I can afford. If I have a lot of change left or loose singles then I\u2019ll give it to one of them. Or I\u2019ll buy them some food when I get some. It all depends. My wife (22F) has always admired that I share with them and has started to do it herself. She\u2019ll sometimes give them her whole lunch or like a ten dollar bill. \n\nAnyways, we collectively make about 60k a year. Next year I\u2019ll be making $100k alone. We pay $1200 in rent and $500 in other bills. We both pay off student loans as well. At the end of month we only have a couple hundred that goes towards food, necessities, and spending money. \n\nA few days ago I had an extra $20. I saw a family that had some kids so I gave it to them. My wife kept telling me how amazing I was for it. I thought it was kind of weird how she kept bringing it up but I still appreciated her comments. Btw we have a car but we prefer to walk to work because of how busy the streets are here. \n\nLast night she told me how she helped a lot of homeless people on her way home from work. I told her it was great. While I was making dinner she started asking me how much money do I usually give away. I told her about $125 a month maybe. She continued to bring up how she helped a lot of people. \n\nWhile we were eating she brought it up again. She said \u201cyou said you give about $125 a month right babe?\u201d I nodded because I was chewing still. Next she says \u201cI outran you this week!\u201d I didn\u2019t know wtf she was talking about and I guess she could tell by the look on my face. \n\nLong story short, she said she gave every homeless person she saw some money. When I asked how much she said all of the money in her wallet. I asked how much again. She told me about $200 like it was nothing.\n\nI instantly said what the fuck? She was surprised at my reaction like I would be happy about it. We argued about it. $200 is a lot of money for us. We already payed our rent and utilities but now we only have $100 until April 15th. I told her that she acted senselessly. \n\nShe\u2019s been ignoring me ever since and locked me out of our bedroom last night. I slept on the couch. \n\nNow I\u2019m wondering if I was the asshole for being mad. After all, those people do need it more than us. But I still feel like she shouldn\u2019t have given away that much when we can barely afford it. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for being upset that his wife gave $200 to homeless people. Let me break down the situation.\n\nFirst, the couple's financial situation: they make around $60k together, and the husband will make $100k next year. They have $1200 rent and $500 in other bills, plus student loans. At the end of the month, they have only a couple hundred for food and other expenses. So their budget is tight. The author gives about $125 a month to homeless people, which he can afford because he says he gives when he can. The wife, on the other hand, gave $200 all at once, which the husband found excessive and upset him because they had limited funds left after rent and bills.\n\nThe key points here are financial responsibility versus compassionate giving. The author is upset because $200 is a significant portion of their remaining money, which they need for essentials. The wife might feel that helping others is important, even if it's a one-time expense. But from a financial standpoint, giving away a large chunk of their budget when they're already tight could be seen as irresponsible. The husband's reaction is based on their financial reality, while the wife's might be motivated by empathy. However, communication is a big issue here. The wife gave the $200 without discussing it with her husband, which caused conflict. The husband's anger isn't about the act of giving itself but the lack of communication and the financial impact. So, is the husband in the wrong? Well, he's justified in being concerned about their finances, especially since they have limited funds. But maybe he could have been more understanding of her intentions. However, since the question is whether he's in the wrong for being angry, the financial context supports his perspective. The wife's action might be seen as impulsive without considering their shared budget. Therefore, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
