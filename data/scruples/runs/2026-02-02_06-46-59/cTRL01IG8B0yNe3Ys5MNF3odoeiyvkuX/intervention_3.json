We live in Chicago and there\u2019s homeless people on every corner. I (24M) give as many of them whatever I can afford. If I have a lot of change left or loose singles then I\u2019ll give it to one of them. Or I\u2019ll buy them some food when I get some. It all depends. My wife (22F) has always admired that I share with them and has started to do it herself. She\u2019ll sometimes give them her whole lunch or like a ten dollar bill. \n\nAnyways, we collectively make about 60k a year. Next year I\u2019ll be making $100k alone. We pay $1200 in rent and $500 in other bills. We both pay off student loans as well. At the end of month we only have a couple hundred that goes towards food, necessities, and spending money. \n\nA few days ago I had an extra $20. I saw a family that had some kids so I gave it to them. My wife kept telling me how amazing I was for it. I thought it was kind of weird how she kept bringing it up but I still appreciated her comments. Btw we have a car but we prefer to walk to work because of how busy the streets are here. \n\nLast night she told me how she helped a lot of homeless people on her way home from work. I told her it was great. While I was making dinner she started asking me how much money do I usually give away. I told her about $125 a month maybe. She continued to bring up how she helped a lot of people. \n\nWhile we were eating she brought it up again. She said \u201cyou said you give about $125 a month right babe?\u201d I nodded because I was chewing still. Next she says \u201cI outran you this week!\u201d I didn\u2019t know wtf she was talking about and I guess she could tell by the look on my face. \n\nLong story short, she said she gave every homeless person she saw some money. When I asked how much she said all of the money in her wallet. I asked how much again. She told me about $200 like it was nothing.\n\nI instantly said what the fuck? She was surprised at my reaction like I would be happy about it. We argued about it. $200 is a lot of money for us. We already payed our rent and utilities but now we only have $100 until April 15th. I told her that she acted senselessly. \n\nShe\u2019s been ignoring me ever since and locked me out of our bedroom last night. I slept on the couch. \n\nNow I\u2019m wondering if I was the asshole for being mad. After all, those people do need it more than us. But I still feel like she shouldn\u2019t have given away that much when we can barely afford it. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for being upset that his wife gave away $200 to homeless people. \n\nFirst, the couple's financial situation: they make $60k a year now, with the husband set to make $100k next year. Their expenses include $1200 rent, $500 in other bills, and student loan payments. After that, they only have a couple hundred left for food, necessities, and spending. So, $200 is a significant chunk of their monthly budget.\n\nThe wife gave away $200, which they had already paid their rent and utilities, leaving them with $100 until the 15th. The husband gives about $125 a month, which is less than the wife's one-time donation. The key issue here is whether the husband is justified in being upset about the $200 donation given their financial constraints.\n\nOn one hand, the wife is giving to those in need, which is admirable. The husband acknowledges that the homeless need the money more, but he's concerned about their own financial stability. On the other hand, the wife might feel that her generosity is being criticized when she's trying to help. \n\nHowever, considering their tight budget, $200 is a substantial amount. The husband's reaction stems from financial concern, which is valid. The wife might not have considered the immediate budgetary impact, even if her intentions are good. The fact that they have to stretch their money for basic needs means that unexpected large expenses (even charitable ones) can cause strain.\n\nIt's a balance between compassion and financial responsibility. The husband isn't wrong to be upset about the financial impact, especially since the donation was a significant portion of their remaining funds. The wife might need to be more mindful of their budget when making such decisions. \n\nUltimately, the husband's reaction is about their shared financial goals. If they haven't discussed their spending priorities, this incident highlights a need for communication. But given the context, the husband isn't in the wrong for being upset about the financial strain caused by the donation.\n"
