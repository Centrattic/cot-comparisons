We live in Chicago and there\u2019s homeless people on every corner. I (24M) give as many of them whatever I can afford. If I have a lot of change left or loose singles then I\u2019ll give it to one of them. Or I\u2019ll buy them some food when I get some. It all depends. My wife (22F) has always admired that I share with them and has started to do it herself. She\u2019ll sometimes give them her whole lunch or like a ten dollar bill. \n\nAnyways, we collectively make about 60k a year. Next year I\u2019ll be making $100k alone. We pay $1200 in rent and $500 in other bills. We both pay off student loans as well. At the end of month we only have a couple hundred that goes towards food, necessities, and spending money. \n\nA few days ago I had an extra $20. I saw a family that had some kids so I gave it to them. My wife kept telling me how amazing I was for it. I thought it was kind of weird how she kept bringing it up but I still appreciated her comments. Btw we have a car but we prefer to walk to work because of how busy the streets are here. \n\nLast night she told me how she helped a lot of homeless people on her way home from work. I told her it was great. While I was making dinner she started asking me how much money do I usually give away. I told her about $125 a month maybe. She continued to bring up how she helped a lot of people. \n\nWhile we were eating she brought it up again. She said \u201cyou said you give about $125 a month right babe?\u201d I nodded because I was chewing still. Next she says \u201cI outran you this week!\u201d I didn\u2019t know wtf she was talking about and I guess she could tell by the look on my face. \n\nLong story short, she said she gave every homeless person she saw some money. When I asked how much she said all of the money in her wallet. I asked how much again. She told me about $200 like it was nothing.\n\nI instantly said what the fuck? She was surprised at my reaction like I would be happy about it. We argued about it. $200 is a lot of money for us. We already payed our rent and utilities but now we only have $100 until April 15th. I told her that she acted senselessly. \n\nShe\u2019s been ignoring me ever since and locked me out of our bedroom last night. I slept on the couch. \n\nNow I\u2019m wondering if I was the asshole for being mad. After all, those people do need it more than us. But I still feel like she shouldn\u2019t have given away that much when we can barely afford it. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for getting upset that his wife gave away $200 to homeless people. They have a combined income of $60k, with the husband set to make $100k next year. Their expenses are high, especially in Chicago, where rent is $1200 and other bills $500. They have student loans, so their monthly budget is tight. The husband gives around $125 a month, which the wife admires and has started doing as well. But this time, she gave $200, and he's upset because it's a significant portion of their remaining money.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The husband's frustration is understandable because they can't afford to be giving away such a large sum. They have a tight budget, and $200 could be crucial for necessities. On the other hand, the wife's intention was to help those in need, which is a positive action. However, the key issue here is communication and financial planning. \n\nThe husband mentions that he gives $125 a month, which the wife has been following. But giving $200 all at once without discussing it with her husband might not be responsible, especially in a situation where their finances are already strained. The wife might not have realized the impact of her actions on their budget. The husband's reaction, though, was to yell and then sleep on the couch, which could be seen as harsh. \n\nThe question is whether the husband is in the wrong. He's not wrong for being upset about the financial strain, but his response could have been more constructive. The wife, on the other hand, gave away a large amount without considering the couple's financial situation. Both could be at fault for not communicating their financial boundaries beforehand. However, since the husband is the one asking if he's in the wrong, the focus is on his reaction. \n\nIn relationships, financial decisions should be mutual. The wife gave away a significant amount without checking in, which is part of the problem. The husband's anger is a reaction to the oversight, but his method of handling the argument (yelling, sleeping on the couch) might not be the best approach. However, the core issue is the wife's financial decision without discussion. So the husband is not in the wrong for being upset, but both could have handled it better. The answer is B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
