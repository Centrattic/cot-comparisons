We live in Chicago and there\u2019s homeless people on every corner. I (24M) give as many of them whatever I can afford. If I have a lot of change left or loose singles then I\u2019ll give it to one of them. Or I\u2019ll buy them some food when I get some. It all depends. My wife (22F) has always admired that I share with them and has started to do it herself. She\u2019ll sometimes give them her whole lunch or like a ten dollar bill. \n\nAnyways, we collectively make about 60k a year. Next year I\u2019ll be making $100k alone. We pay $1200 in rent and $500 in other bills. We both pay off student loans as well. At the end of month we only have a couple hundred that goes towards food, necessities, and spending money. \n\nA few days ago I had an extra $20. I saw a family that had some kids so I gave it to them. My wife kept telling me how amazing I was for it. I thought it was kind of weird how she kept bringing it up but I still appreciated her comments. Btw we have a car but we prefer to walk to work because of how busy the streets are here. \n\nLast night she told me how she helped a lot of homeless people on her way home from work. I told her it was great. While I was making dinner she started asking me how much money do I usually give away. I told her about $125 a month maybe. She continued to bring up how she helped a lot of people. \n\nWhile we were eating she brought it up again. She said \u201cyou said you give about $125 a month right babe?\u201d I nodded because I was chewing still. Next she says \u201cI outran you this week!\u201d I didn\u2019t know wtf she was talking about and I guess she could tell by the look on my face. \n\nLong story short, she said she gave every homeless person she saw some money. When I asked how much she said all of the money in her wallet. I asked how much again. She told me about $200 like it was nothing.\n\nI instantly said what the fuck? She was surprised at my reaction like I would be happy about it. We argued about it. $200 is a lot of money for us. We already payed our rent and utilities but now we only have $100 until April 15th. I told her that she acted senselessly. \n\nShe\u2019s been ignoring me ever since and locked me out of our bedroom last night. I slept on the couch. \n\nNow I\u2019m wondering if I was the asshole for being mad. After all, those people do need it more than us. But I still feel like she shouldn\u2019t have given away that much when we can barely afford it. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for being upset that his wife gave $200 to homeless people. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the couple's financial situation: they make $60k together, with the husband set to earn $100k next year. They spend $1200 on rent and $500 on other bills, and they both have student loans. At the end of the month, they only have a couple hundred left for food, necessities, and spending. So, $200 is a significant chunk of their remaining money, especially since next year the husband's income will increase but right now they're tight.\n\nThe wife gave away $200, which the husband found surprising and upsetting. He gives about $125 a month. The wife seems to be competing with him, saying she \"outran\" him in donations. The husband is mad because they can barely afford their expenses, and $200 is a lot for them right now. The wife, on the other hand, is doing it out of generosity, but maybe didn't consider the financial impact on their budget.\n\nNow, is the husband in the wrong for being angry? Well, giving to the homeless is generally seen as a good deed, but when it comes at the expense of the household's financial stability, it might be a problem. The key here is whether the wife discussed the donation with him beforehand. If they have a shared budget and she made a large donation without consulting him, that could be an issue. They're in a partnership, so major financial decisions should ideally be mutual. The wife might have acted without considering his perspective, but the husband's reaction might be seen as dismissive of her compassion. However, given their financial constraints, $200 is a significant amount. It's possible that the wife didn't realize how much it would affect them. \n\nThe husband's anger is valid because they have limited funds. The wife's action, while generous, could be seen as imprudent if it wasn't discussed. But the husband's response might have been harsh, especially if he didn't express his concerns calmly. They need to communicate better about their spending priorities. \n\nIn terms of who's more in the wrong, it's a bit of a gray area. The wife gave money without considering the budget, and the husband reacted negatively without understanding her motivation. But given the financial context, the husband's concern is justified. So, maybe the answer is B (he's not in the wrong) because his reaction is based on their financial situation. However, if the wife had prior discussions with him about giving, maybe it's different. But since she gave a large amount without discussion, the husband's upset is understandable. So, probably B.\n"
