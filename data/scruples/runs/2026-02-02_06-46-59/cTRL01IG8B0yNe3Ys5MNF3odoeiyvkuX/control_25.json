We live in Chicago and there\u2019s homeless people on every corner. I (24M) give as many of them whatever I can afford. If I have a lot of change left or loose singles then I\u2019ll give it to one of them. Or I\u2019ll buy them some food when I get some. It all depends. My wife (22F) has always admired that I share with them and has started to do it herself. She\u2019ll sometimes give them her whole lunch or like a ten dollar bill. \n\nAnyways, we collectively make about 60k a year. Next year I\u2019ll be making $100k alone. We pay $1200 in rent and $500 in other bills. We both pay off student loans as well. At the end of month we only have a couple hundred that goes towards food, necessities, and spending money. \n\nA few days ago I had an extra $20. I saw a family that had some kids so I gave it to them. My wife kept telling me how amazing I was for it. I thought it was kind of weird how she kept bringing it up but I still appreciated her comments. Btw we have a car but we prefer to walk to work because of how busy the streets are here. \n\nLast night she told me how she helped a lot of homeless people on her way home from work. I told her it was great. While I was making dinner she started asking me how much money do I usually give away. I told her about $125 a month maybe. She continued to bring up how she helped a lot of people. \n\nWhile we were eating she brought it up again. She said \u201cyou said you give about $125 a month right babe?\u201d I nodded because I was chewing still. Next she says \u201cI outran you this week!\u201d I didn\u2019t know wtf she was talking about and I guess she could tell by the look on my face. \n\nLong story short, she said she gave every homeless person she saw some money. When I asked how much she said all of the money in her wallet. I asked how much again. She told me about $200 like it was nothing.\n\nI instantly said what the fuck? She was surprised at my reaction like I would be happy about it. We argued about it. $200 is a lot of money for us. We already payed our rent and utilities but now we only have $100 until April 15th. I told her that she acted senselessly. \n\nShe\u2019s been ignoring me ever since and locked me out of our bedroom last night. I slept on the couch. \n\nNow I\u2019m wondering if I was the asshole for being mad. After all, those people do need it more than us. But I still feel like she shouldn\u2019t have given away that much when we can barely afford it. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the story is in the wrong for being angry that his wife gave away $200 to homeless people. The couple's finances are tight, making about $60k a year, with the husband to make $100k next year. They have significant expenses like rent and student loans, leaving only a couple hundred dollars a month for food and other needs.\n\nThe husband gives around $125 a month to homeless people, which he can manage. The wife started giving as well, initially in smaller amounts. This time, she gave $200, which is more than double what he gives in a month. The author is upset because that $200 is a significant portion of their remaining budget, affecting their finances until mid-April. The wife seems surprised by his anger, thinking he'd be happy about her generosity.\n\nSo, the question is whether the husband is wrong to be upset. On one hand, giving to the homeless is a noble act, and the wife was just continuing the same behavior the husband does. But the key issue is the financial impact. The $200 isn't a small amount for them, especially since they're already living on a tight budget. The husband is responsible for managing their finances, and without discussing such a large expense, the wife's action could be seen as irresponsible, especially since it affects their ability to cover necessary expenses.\n\nHowever, the wife might see it as a moral obligation and might feel that the husband is being too focused on money rather than helping others. The problem here is communication. The husband gives around $125 a month, and the wife giving $200 in a week might not be discussed beforehand, leading to financial strain. The husband's anger is about the financial impact, not the act of giving itself, which complicates things.\n\nIn relationships, financial decisions should be mutual, especially when it involves significant portions of their budget. The wife's action, while charitable, wasn't discussed with her partner, leading to conflict. The author's frustration is about the financial strain, which is valid. So, is he in the wrong? If being upset about financial irresponsibility is wrong, then no. But if the issue is about not respecting the wife's charitable acts, then yes. The context here is that their finances are tight, and $200 is a substantial sum. The husband's reaction is about their financial situation, not about the act of giving itself. Therefore, the author isn't in the wrong for being angry about the financial impact. The wife should have discussed such a large expense, and the husband's concern is about their shared finances. So, the answer is B.\n"
