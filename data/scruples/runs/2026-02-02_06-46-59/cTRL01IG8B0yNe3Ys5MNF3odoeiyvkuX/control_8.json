We live in Chicago and there\u2019s homeless people on every corner. I (24M) give as many of them whatever I can afford. If I have a lot of change left or loose singles then I\u2019ll give it to one of them. Or I\u2019ll buy them some food when I get some. It all depends. My wife (22F) has always admired that I share with them and has started to do it herself. She\u2019ll sometimes give them her whole lunch or like a ten dollar bill. \n\nAnyways, we collectively make about 60k a year. Next year I\u2019ll be making $100k alone. We pay $1200 in rent and $500 in other bills. We both pay off student loans as well. At the end of month we only have a couple hundred that goes towards food, necessities, and spending money. \n\nA few days ago I had an extra $20. I saw a family that had some kids so I gave it to them. My wife kept telling me how amazing I was for it. I thought it was kind of weird how she kept bringing it up but I still appreciated her comments. Btw we have a car but we prefer to walk to work because of how busy the streets are here. \n\nLast night she told me how she helped a lot of homeless people on her way home from work. I told her it was great. While I was making dinner she started asking me how much money do I usually give away. I told her about $125 a month maybe. She continued to bring up how she helped a lot of people. \n\nWhile we were eating she brought it up again. She said \u201cyou said you give about $125 a month right babe?\u201d I nodded because I was chewing still. Next she says \u201cI outran you this week!\u201d I didn\u2019t know wtf she was talking about and I guess she could tell by the look on my face. \n\nLong story short, she said she gave every homeless person she saw some money. When I asked how much she said all of the money in her wallet. I asked how much again. She told me about $200 like it was nothing.\n\nI instantly said what the fuck? She was surprised at my reaction like I would be happy about it. We argued about it. $200 is a lot of money for us. We already payed our rent and utilities but now we only have $100 until April 15th. I told her that she acted senselessly. \n\nShe\u2019s been ignoring me ever since and locked me out of our bedroom last night. I slept on the couch. \n\nNow I\u2019m wondering if I was the asshole for being mad. After all, those people do need it more than us. But I still feel like she shouldn\u2019t have given away that much when we can barely afford it. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for being upset that his wife gave $200 to homeless people. The situation is that they have a tight budget, making $60k a year with the husband expecting $100k next year. Their expenses are high, and they can only save a few hundred a month. The wife gave away $200, which the husband considered a significant amount given their financial situation.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both perspectives. The wife was inspired by the husband's own charitable actions and saw giving to the homeless as important. She might feel that helping those in need is more important than saving, especially if they can afford it. However, the husband feels that $200 is a substantial sum for their budget, especially since they had already paid their rent and bills but now only have $100 left until the next pay date. That $200 could affect their ability to manage other expenses like groceries or unexpected costs.\n\nFrom a financial responsibility standpoint, the wife gave a large portion of their available funds without consulting the husband. Even if her intentions were good, it's about shared responsibility in a relationship. The husband might feel that such decisions should be made together, especially when it's a significant part of their budget. On the other hand, the wife might believe that if they can afford it, it's okay to give, and she might not realize the impact it has on their finances.\n\nThe key points here are communication and shared financial decisions. In a marriage, major financial commitments should be discussed. The wife gave $200 without prior discussion, which the husband found problematic. The husband's reaction might come off as harsh, but his concern is about the practicality of their financial situation. The wife's actions, while generous, could be seen as not considering the couple's financial planning.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? The husband is justified in being upset because the wife unilaterally gave away a significant portion of their shared money, which affects their budget. However, the wife's intention was to help, which is commendable. The main issue is the lack of communication and shared decision-making. The husband's anger is valid due to the financial implications, but he could have handled the situation more calmly. The wife could have discussed the amount with him before giving it away. Therefore, the husband is not in the wrong for being upset, but there's also room for both to improve communication. The answer is B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
