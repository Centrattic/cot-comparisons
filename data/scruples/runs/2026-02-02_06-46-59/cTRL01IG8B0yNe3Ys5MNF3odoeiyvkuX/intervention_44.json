We live in Chicago and there\u2019s homeless people on every corner. I (24M) give as many of them whatever I can afford. If I have a lot of change left or loose singles then I\u2019ll give it to one of them. Or I\u2019ll buy them some food when I get some. It all depends. My wife (22F) has always admired that I share with them and has started to do it herself. She\u2019ll sometimes give them her whole lunch or like a ten dollar bill. \n\nAnyways, we collectively make about 60k a year. Next year I\u2019ll be making $100k alone. We pay $1200 in rent and $500 in other bills. We both pay off student loans as well. At the end of month we only have a couple hundred that goes towards food, necessities, and spending money. \n\nA few days ago I had an extra $20. I saw a family that had some kids so I gave it to them. My wife kept telling me how amazing I was for it. I thought it was kind of weird how she kept bringing it up but I still appreciated her comments. Btw we have a car but we prefer to walk to work because of how busy the streets are here. \n\nLast night she told me how she helped a lot of homeless people on her way home from work. I told her it was great. While I was making dinner she started asking me how much money do I usually give away. I told her about $125 a month maybe. She continued to bring up how she helped a lot of people. \n\nWhile we were eating she brought it up again. She said \u201cyou said you give about $125 a month right babe?\u201d I nodded because I was chewing still. Next she says \u201cI outran you this week!\u201d I didn\u2019t know wtf she was talking about and I guess she could tell by the look on my face. \n\nLong story short, she said she gave every homeless person she saw some money. When I asked how much she said all of the money in her wallet. I asked how much again. She told me about $200 like it was nothing.\n\nI instantly said what the fuck? She was surprised at my reaction like I would be happy about it. We argued about it. $200 is a lot of money for us. We already payed our rent and utilities but now we only have $100 until April 15th. I told her that she acted senselessly. \n\nShe\u2019s been ignoring me ever since and locked me out of our bedroom last night. I slept on the couch. \n\nNow I\u2019m wondering if I was the asshole for being mad. After all, those people do need it more than us. But I still feel like she shouldn\u2019t have given away that much when we can barely afford it. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for being upset that his wife gave $200 to homeless people. Let's break down the situation.\n\nFirst, they make $60k a year together, which is split between rent ($1200), bills ($500), student loans, and then they have a couple hundred left for food and other expenses. The author gives about $125 a month to homeless people, which he can afford. His wife gave $200 all at once, which is more than his monthly total. \n\nThe key points here are their financial situation and communication. They have a tight budget, and $200 is a significant portion of their remaining money each month. The author is upset because this amount is affecting their budget, which makes sense given their constraints. The wife, on the other hand, might not realize the impact or might feel it's an important value to her to give that money.\n\nThe wife's action was a one-time expenditure, whereas the author's is a monthly habit. Giving all the cash you have in your wallet to multiple homeless people is a big decision, especially if you're on a tight budget. The author's reaction might come from a place of financial responsibility, but maybe he should have discussed it with her beforehand. However, the wife gave without considering the budget, which could be the issue.\n\nCommunication is crucial here. The wife didn't check in with him about the $200, and the author didn't express his concerns until after the fact. Both might have some responsibility in this. But the question is whether the author is in the wrong. If he's angry about a one-time large donation that they can't really afford, maybe he's being unreasonable. But considering their budget, $200 is a significant chunk, so his concern is valid. \n\nAlso, the wife might feel that helping others is a priority, and the author's anger could be seen as dismissing her values. However, their financial situation does require careful management. It's a balance between personal values and financial responsibility. \n\nIn terms of right and wrong, it's a bit of a gray area. But given the circumstances, the author's reaction is understandable because the $200 is affecting their budget. However, he could have communicated his concerns earlier. But since the wife gave without discussing it, maybe she's at fault too. \n\nThe user initially thought the author is in the wrong, but maybe the answer is B (not in the wrong) because he has a valid financial reason to be upset. The wife acted without considering the budget, so the author isn't entirely wrong to be mad.\n"
