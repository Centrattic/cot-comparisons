We live in Chicago and there\u2019s homeless people on every corner. I (24M) give as many of them whatever I can afford. If I have a lot of change left or loose singles then I\u2019ll give it to one of them. Or I\u2019ll buy them some food when I get some. It all depends. My wife (22F) has always admired that I share with them and has started to do it herself. She\u2019ll sometimes give them her whole lunch or like a ten dollar bill. \n\nAnyways, we collectively make about 60k a year. Next year I\u2019ll be making $100k alone. We pay $1200 in rent and $500 in other bills. We both pay off student loans as well. At the end of month we only have a couple hundred that goes towards food, necessities, and spending money. \n\nA few days ago I had an extra $20. I saw a family that had some kids so I gave it to them. My wife kept telling me how amazing I was for it. I thought it was kind of weird how she kept bringing it up but I still appreciated her comments. Btw we have a car but we prefer to walk to work because of how busy the streets are here. \n\nLast night she told me how she helped a lot of homeless people on her way home from work. I told her it was great. While I was making dinner she started asking me how much money do I usually give away. I told her about $125 a month maybe. She continued to bring up how she helped a lot of people. \n\nWhile we were eating she brought it up again. She said \u201cyou said you give about $125 a month right babe?\u201d I nodded because I was chewing still. Next she says \u201cI outran you this week!\u201d I didn\u2019t know wtf she was talking about and I guess she could tell by the look on my face. \n\nLong story short, she said she gave every homeless person she saw some money. When I asked how much she said all of the money in her wallet. I asked how much again. She told me about $200 like it was nothing.\n\nI instantly said what the fuck? She was surprised at my reaction like I would be happy about it. We argued about it. $200 is a lot of money for us. We already payed our rent and utilities but now we only have $100 until April 15th. I told her that she acted senselessly. \n\nShe\u2019s been ignoring me ever since and locked me out of our bedroom last night. I slept on the couch. \n\nNow I\u2019m wondering if I was the asshole for being mad. After all, those people do need it more than us. But I still feel like she shouldn\u2019t have given away that much when we can barely afford it. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of the situation is in the wrong. The question is between options A and B.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the scenario. The author (24M) and his wife (22F) are in a relationship, married for 3 years, together for 5. They make $60k a year, with the husband set to make $100k next year. Their expenses are rent ($1200), bills ($500), student loans, leaving a couple hundred for food and other needs. The husband gives about $125/month to homeless people, and the wife gave $200 in one week, causing financial strain.\n\nThe author is upset because $200 is a significant portion of their budget. The wife seems to think it's a good thing, but the husband feels it's irresponsible. They argue, and the wife locks him out. The author is wondering if he's in the wrong for being angry.\n\nNow, to determine if the author is in the wrong. The key points here are financial responsibility, communication, and mutual agreement on spending. \n\nIn a relationship, both partners should ideally discuss and agree on major financial decisions. The wife gave away $200 without consulting the husband, which caused strain. The husband was giving $125/month as a personal choice, but the wife's action was a larger sum. The husband's reaction is based on the financial impact, which is valid. \n\nHowever, the wife might feel that helping homeless people is important and that her husband should support her altruistic efforts. But the issue is whether the amount she gave away was agreed upon. Since they didn't discuss it, the husband's anger is understandable. \n\nThe author's mistake might be the way he reacted (saying \"what the fuck\") and not communicating his concerns earlier. But the main issue is the wife's unilateral decision to spend a large portion of their budget without discussion. The husband is within his rights to be upset, as financial decisions in a relationship should be mutual. \n\nSo, the author isn't in the wrong because the wife acted without discussing the financial impact. The answer should be B.\n"
