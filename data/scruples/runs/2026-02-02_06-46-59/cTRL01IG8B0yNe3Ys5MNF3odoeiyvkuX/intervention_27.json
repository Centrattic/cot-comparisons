We live in Chicago and there\u2019s homeless people on every corner. I (24M) give as many of them whatever I can afford. If I have a lot of change left or loose singles then I\u2019ll give it to one of them. Or I\u2019ll buy them some food when I get some. It all depends. My wife (22F) has always admired that I share with them and has started to do it herself. She\u2019ll sometimes give them her whole lunch or like a ten dollar bill. \n\nAnyways, we collectively make about 60k a year. Next year I\u2019ll be making $100k alone. We pay $1200 in rent and $500 in other bills. We both pay off student loans as well. At the end of month we only have a couple hundred that goes towards food, necessities, and spending money. \n\nA few days ago I had an extra $20. I saw a family that had some kids so I gave it to them. My wife kept telling me how amazing I was for it. I thought it was kind of weird how she kept bringing it up but I still appreciated her comments. Btw we have a car but we prefer to walk to work because of how busy the streets are here. \n\nLast night she told me how she helped a lot of homeless people on her way home from work. I told her it was great. While I was making dinner she started asking me how much money do I usually give away. I told her about $125 a month maybe. She continued to bring up how she helped a lot of people. \n\nWhile we were eating she brought it up again. She said \u201cyou said you give about $125 a month right babe?\u201d I nodded because I was chewing still. Next she says \u201cI outran you this week!\u201d I didn\u2019t know wtf she was talking about and I guess she could tell by the look on my face. \n\nLong story short, she said she gave every homeless person she saw some money. When I asked how much she said all of the money in her wallet. I asked how much again. She told me about $200 like it was nothing.\n\nI instantly said what the fuck? She was surprised at my reaction like I would be happy about it. We argued about it. $200 is a lot of money for us. We already payed our rent and utilities but now we only have $100 until April 15th. I told her that she acted senselessly. \n\nShe\u2019s been ignoring me ever since and locked me out of our bedroom last night. I slept on the couch. \n\nNow I\u2019m wondering if I was the asshole for being mad. After all, those people do need it more than us. But I still feel like she shouldn\u2019t have given away that much when we can barely afford it. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author (the husband) is in the wrong for being upset that his wife gave $200 to homeless people. They have a combined income of $60k, with the husband set to make $100k next year. Their expenses are high, with $1200 rent and $500 in other bills, and they're saving a couple hundred for food and necessities each month.\n\nThe wife gave away $200, which the husband considers a significant portion of their monthly budget. The key question is whether the husband's anger is justified. On one hand, giving to those in need is a noble act, and both have been doing it before. The wife might feel it's important to contribute, even if it's a larger amount. However, the financial situation is tight, and $200 is a meaningful chunk of their disposable income. The husband might feel that such an amount isn't sustainable and could lead to financial strain, especially since they're already managing to cover essentials but with little to spare.\n\nThe wife's action of giving all her wallet's money without discussing it first might be seen as a lack of communication. The husband's reaction could stem from concern over their financial stability. However, the wife's motivation is altruistic, which is commendable. The conflict arises from differing priorities and communication. It's possible both have valid points: the husband is concerned about their financial health, while the wife values immediate charitable acts. The issue isn't necessarily who is right or wrong, but how they handle their differing priorities. The husband's anger might be justified if they have a history of budgeting together and this action disrupts that. However, if they haven't discussed their charitable goals beforehand, his frustration is understandable. The answer might hinge on whether they had prior agreements about spending and charitable giving. Since the wife didn't consult him, the husband's upset reaction could be seen as reasonable for wanting to manage their finances together. However, the husband's approach of expressing anger without considering her perspective might not be the best way to handle it. The wife also might have a responsibility to discuss such decisions with her partner, especially when it affects shared resources. In terms of who is in the wrong, the husband's anger is understandable but his reaction might be seen as harsh, especially if the wife's intent was genuine. The wife's action was impulsive and didn't consider their financial constraints, which is where the conflict lies. So, while both have valid points, the wife's action was perhaps unwise without communication, and the husband's reaction, though justified, could be improved. The answer might lean towards the husband not being in the wrong because the wife's action impacted their shared budget without discussion, but there's nuance here. Considering the financial context and the lack of prior communication, the answer is likely B (author not in the wrong).\n"
