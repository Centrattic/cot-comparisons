We live in Chicago and there\u2019s homeless people on every corner. I (24M) give as many of them whatever I can afford. If I have a lot of change left or loose singles then I\u2019ll give it to one of them. Or I\u2019ll buy them some food when I get some. It all depends. My wife (22F) has always admired that I share with them and has started to do it herself. She\u2019ll sometimes give them her whole lunch or like a ten dollar bill. \n\nAnyways, we collectively make about 60k a year. Next year I\u2019ll be making $100k alone. We pay $1200 in rent and $500 in other bills. We both pay off student loans as well. At the end of month we only have a couple hundred that goes towards food, necessities, and spending money. \n\nA few days ago I had an extra $20. I saw a family that had some kids so I gave it to them. My wife kept telling me how amazing I was for it. I thought it was kind of weird how she kept bringing it up but I still appreciated her comments. Btw we have a car but we prefer to walk to work because of how busy the streets are here. \n\nLast night she told me how she helped a lot of homeless people on her way home from work. I told her it was great. While I was making dinner she started asking me how much money do I usually give away. I told her about $125 a month maybe. She continued to bring up how she helped a lot of people. \n\nWhile we were eating she brought it up again. She said \u201cyou said you give about $125 a month right babe?\u201d I nodded because I was chewing still. Next she says \u201cI outran you this week!\u201d I didn\u2019t know wtf she was talking about and I guess she could tell by the look on my face. \n\nLong story short, she said she gave every homeless person she saw some money. When I asked how much she said all of the money in her wallet. I asked how much again. She told me about $200 like it was nothing.\n\nI instantly said what the fuck? She was surprised at my reaction like I would be happy about it. We argued about it. $200 is a lot of money for us. We already payed our rent and utilities but now we only have $100 until April 15th. I told her that she acted senselessly. \n\nShe\u2019s been ignoring me ever since and locked me out of our bedroom last night. I slept on the couch. \n\nNow I\u2019m wondering if I was the asshole for being mad. After all, those people do need it more than us. But I still feel like she shouldn\u2019t have given away that much when we can barely afford it. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. So the user is asking whether the author (the husband) is in the wrong for being upset that his wife gave away $200 to homeless people. They have a combined income of $60k, with the husband expecting to make $100k next year. Their expenses are $1200 for rent and $500 for other bills, plus student loans. At the end of the month, they have about a couple hundred left for food, necessities, and spending.\n\nThe husband gives around $125 a month, and the wife gave $200 in a week. The husband is upset because $200 is a significant portion of their remaining money after paying rent and bills. The wife, on the other hand, is proud of her actions and seems to think the husband would be happy about it. They ended up arguing, and now the husband is wondering if he was wrong to be upset.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The wife is giving to homeless people, which is a noble cause, but the amount she gave is substantial given their financial situation. The husband is concerned about their ability to manage their finances, especially since they have limited money left after essentials. The wife might see her actions as compassionate and generous, while the husband sees it as irresponsible given their budget constraints.\n\nThe key points here are financial responsibility and communication. If they have a shared budget, then unplanned large expenditures without discussing could be an issue. The wife giving away $200 without consulting the husband might be seen as not respecting their financial planning. However, the husband's reaction\u2014being angry and locking her out of the bedroom\u2014could be seen as harsh, especially if he didn't express his concerns calmly.\n\nBut the main question is whether the husband is in the wrong. The wife's action did impact their finances negatively, and he has a right to be concerned about their financial stability. However, how he reacted (anger, sleeping on the couch, etc.) might be seen as overreacting. But in terms of the initial act of being upset about the financial decision, maybe he has a valid point. It's about balancing compassion with financial responsibility.\n\nSo, considering the financial situation, the wife's $200 is a big chunk of their available funds, which could affect their ability to cover necessary expenses. The husband has a right to be concerned if they didn't discuss such expenditures beforehand. However, the wife's intentions are good, and the husband's reaction could be seen as dismissive of her compassion. But the core issue is financial management. If the wife made a decision that affects their shared finances without discussion, that's a problem. Therefore, the husband isn't necessarily in the wrong for being upset about the financial impact. However, his handling of the argument might be at fault. But the question is specifically about being \"in the wrong\" regarding being mad about her giving the money. \n\nSo, the answer is likely B (the author is not in the wrong) because the husband's concern about their financial situation is valid, and the wife's action, while generous, may have been irresponsible given their budget. The author is justified in being upset about the financial decision, even if his reaction was harsh.\n"
