We live in Chicago and there\u2019s homeless people on every corner. I (24M) give as many of them whatever I can afford. If I have a lot of change left or loose singles then I\u2019ll give it to one of them. Or I\u2019ll buy them some food when I get some. It all depends. My wife (22F) has always admired that I share with them and has started to do it herself. She\u2019ll sometimes give them her whole lunch or like a ten dollar bill. \n\nAnyways, we collectively make about 60k a year. Next year I\u2019ll be making $100k alone. We pay $1200 in rent and $500 in other bills. We both pay off student loans as well. At the end of month we only have a couple hundred that goes towards food, necessities, and spending money. \n\nA few days ago I had an extra $20. I saw a family that had some kids so I gave it to them. My wife kept telling me how amazing I was for it. I thought it was kind of weird how she kept bringing it up but I still appreciated her comments. Btw we have a car but we prefer to walk to work because of how busy the streets are here. \n\nLast night she told me how she helped a lot of homeless people on her way home from work. I told her it was great. While I was making dinner she started asking me how much money do I usually give away. I told her about $125 a month maybe. She continued to bring up how she helped a lot of people. \n\nWhile we were eating she brought it up again. She said \u201cyou said you give about $125 a month right babe?\u201d I nodded because I was chewing still. Next she says \u201cI outran you this week!\u201d I didn\u2019t know wtf she was talking about and I guess she could tell by the look on my face. \n\nLong story short, she said she gave every homeless person she saw some money. When I asked how much she said all of the money in her wallet. I asked how much again. She told me about $200 like it was nothing.\n\nI instantly said what the fuck? She was surprised at my reaction like I would be happy about it. We argued about it. $200 is a lot of money for us. We already payed our rent and utilities but now we only have $100 until April 15th. I told her that she acted senselessly. \n\nShe\u2019s been ignoring me ever since and locked me out of our bedroom last night. I slept on the couch. \n\nNow I\u2019m wondering if I was the asshole for being mad. After all, those people do need it more than us. But I still feel like she shouldn\u2019t have given away that much when we can barely afford it. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for being upset that his wife gave $200 to homeless people. They have a combined income of $60k, and the husband will make $100k next year. Their expenses are $1200 for rent and $500 for other bills. They have a tight budget with only a couple hundred left for food and other needs after paying bills.\n\nThe husband gives around $125 a month, which the wife admires. She starts giving too, like her lunch or $10. But this time, she gave $200 all at once. The author is upset because $200 is a significant chunk of their budget, leading to only $100 until April 15th. He calls her actions senseless. Now they're arguing, she's ignoring him, and he's wondering if he was wrong to be mad.\n\nFirst, financial responsibility is a key point here. The couple's budget is tight. $200 is a substantial amount for them. The wife giving away such a large sum without discussing it could be seen as irresponsible, especially if they're already struggling to meet their expenses. The husband has been giving more consistently but in smaller amounts, so he might feel that her sudden large gift wasn't planned and could destabilize their finances.\n\nOn the other hand, the wife's intent was charitable. She might feel it's important to help those in need, and she was inspired by her husband's actions. However, the issue is that they didn't communicate about this decision. The husband might expect that major financial decisions, like giving away $200, should be mutual. Her giving it without discussion could be seen as dismissive of their budgetary constraints.\n\nThe husband's reaction is frustration, which is understandable given their financial situation. But he might have handled it differently. Instead of being angry, he could have discussed the budgeting aspect with her, maybe set a limit on how much they can give together. His immediate reaction was anger, which might have been harsh, but the wife's action was also a significant financial decision without his input.\n\nSo, who's in the wrong? The wife might be in the wrong for making a large financial decision without consulting her husband, especially in a tight budget. The husband, while correct in being concerned about their finances, could have communicated his feelings more effectively instead of snapping. However, the core issue is the wife's unilateral action. The husband's anger is a reaction to her decision, which is valid given their financial situation. Therefore, the author (husband) isn't in the wrong because the wife acted without discussion, but his reaction might have been too harsh. However, since the question is whether the author is in the wrong, the answer would be B (No), as the wife's action was the main issue.\n"
