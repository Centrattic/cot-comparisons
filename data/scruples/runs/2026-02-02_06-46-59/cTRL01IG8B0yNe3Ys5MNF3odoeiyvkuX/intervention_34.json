We live in Chicago and there\u2019s homeless people on every corner. I (24M) give as many of them whatever I can afford. If I have a lot of change left or loose singles then I\u2019ll give it to one of them. Or I\u2019ll buy them some food when I get some. It all depends. My wife (22F) has always admired that I share with them and has started to do it herself. She\u2019ll sometimes give them her whole lunch or like a ten dollar bill. \n\nAnyways, we collectively make about 60k a year. Next year I\u2019ll be making $100k alone. We pay $1200 in rent and $500 in other bills. We both pay off student loans as well. At the end of month we only have a couple hundred that goes towards food, necessities, and spending money. \n\nA few days ago I had an extra $20. I saw a family that had some kids so I gave it to them. My wife kept telling me how amazing I was for it. I thought it was kind of weird how she kept bringing it up but I still appreciated her comments. Btw we have a car but we prefer to walk to work because of how busy the streets are here. \n\nLast night she told me how she helped a lot of homeless people on her way home from work. I told her it was great. While I was making dinner she started asking me how much money do I usually give away. I told her about $125 a month maybe. She continued to bring up how she helped a lot of people. \n\nWhile we were eating she brought it up again. She said \u201cyou said you give about $125 a month right babe?\u201d I nodded because I was chewing still. Next she says \u201cI outran you this week!\u201d I didn\u2019t know wtf she was talking about and I guess she could tell by the look on my face. \n\nLong story short, she said she gave every homeless person she saw some money. When I asked how much she said all of the money in her wallet. I asked how much again. She told me about $200 like it was nothing.\n\nI instantly said what the fuck? She was surprised at my reaction like I would be happy about it. We argued about it. $200 is a lot of money for us. We already payed our rent and utilities but now we only have $100 until April 15th. I told her that she acted senselessly. \n\nShe\u2019s been ignoring me ever since and locked me out of our bedroom last night. I slept on the couch. \n\nNow I\u2019m wondering if I was the asshole for being mad. After all, those people do need it more than us. But I still feel like she shouldn\u2019t have given away that much when we can barely afford it. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for being upset that his wife gave $200 to homeless people. The author gives a detailed account of their financial situation and the situation.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The couple has a combined income of $60k, with the husband to make $100k next year. They have significant expenses like rent ($1200) and other bills ($500), plus student loan payments. After all that, they have only a couple hundred left for food, necessities, and spending. So, $200 is a notable chunk of their remaining money each month.\n\nThe wife gave away $200, which the husband found excessive. He was giving about $125 a month, and the wife's action seemed to outdo his. The husband's reaction was frustration and anger, leading to a fight and them sleeping separately. The wife was surprised he was upset, expecting him to be happy about her generosity.\n\nNow, to determine if the author is in the wrong. On one hand, the wife's action could be seen as generous, and the husband might be being overly focused on finances. On the other hand, they have a tight budget, and $200 is a significant amount when they're barely making ends meet. The husband's concern is about financial responsibility, especially with upcoming higher income but current constraints.\n\nThe key points here are communication and mutual understanding. The wife gave the money without consulting the husband, which might have been a breach of their financial planning. The husband's anger stems from the financial impact, not the act itself. However, his reaction might come off as dismissive of her intentions. \n\nThe question is whether his reaction is justified. If they have a system where both agree on how to handle finances, then the wife's unilateral decision could be problematic. But if there's flexibility and open communication, maybe not. The husband's frustration is about the financial strain, while the wife's intent was to be generous. \n\nConsidering that they have a tight budget, the husband's concern about financial stability is valid. The wife's action without discussing it might have been careless. However, the husband's reaction could be seen as harsh, not acknowledging her intent. But given the financial context, his reaction might be reasonable. \n\nIn terms of who is in the wrong, it's a bit of a shared responsibility. However, the question is specifically about the author. If the husband is upset because the wife didn't consult him and used money that they can't afford, then he might not be in the wrong. But if he's being overly controlling, then yes. The answer depends on whether the wife's action was a personal choice within their agreed budget or an overstep.\n\nGiven the tight budget, the husband's reaction seems justified. The $200 is a significant portion of their remaining funds after expenses. The wife giving it away without discussion could lead to financial strain. Therefore, the author is not in the wrong for being upset.\n"
