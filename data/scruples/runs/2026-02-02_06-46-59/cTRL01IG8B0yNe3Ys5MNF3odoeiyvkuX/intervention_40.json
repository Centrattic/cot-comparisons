We live in Chicago and there\u2019s homeless people on every corner. I (24M) give as many of them whatever I can afford. If I have a lot of change left or loose singles then I\u2019ll give it to one of them. Or I\u2019ll buy them some food when I get some. It all depends. My wife (22F) has always admired that I share with them and has started to do it herself. She\u2019ll sometimes give them her whole lunch or like a ten dollar bill. \n\nAnyways, we collectively make about 60k a year. Next year I\u2019ll be making $100k alone. We pay $1200 in rent and $500 in other bills. We both pay off student loans as well. At the end of month we only have a couple hundred that goes towards food, necessities, and spending money. \n\nA few days ago I had an extra $20. I saw a family that had some kids so I gave it to them. My wife kept telling me how amazing I was for it. I thought it was kind of weird how she kept bringing it up but I still appreciated her comments. Btw we have a car but we prefer to walk to work because of how busy the streets are here. \n\nLast night she told me how she helped a lot of homeless people on her way home from work. I told her it was great. While I was making dinner she started asking me how much money do I usually give away. I told her about $125 a month maybe. She continued to bring up how she helped a lot of people. \n\nWhile we were eating she brought it up again. She said \u201cyou said you give about $125 a month right babe?\u201d I nodded because I was chewing still. Next she says \u201cI outran you this week!\u201d I didn\u2019t know wtf she was talking about and I guess she could tell by the look on my face. \n\nLong story short, she said she gave every homeless person she saw some money. When I asked how much she said all of the money in her wallet. I asked how much again. She told me about $200 like it was nothing.\n\nI instantly said what the fuck? She was surprised at my reaction like I would be happy about it. We argued about it. $200 is a lot of money for us. We already payed our rent and utilities but now we only have $100 until April 15th. I told her that she acted senselessly. \n\nShe\u2019s been ignoring me ever since and locked me out of our bedroom last night. I slept on the couch. \n\nNow I\u2019m wondering if I was the asshole for being mad. After all, those people do need it more than us. But I still feel like she shouldn\u2019t have given away that much when we can barely afford it. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that the author gave $125 a month to homeless people, and his wife gave $200 in a week. He got upset because they can't afford it, but she was trying to match or exceed his generosity. \n\nFirst, the financial context: they make $60k a year, with the husband set to make $100k soon. Their rent is $1200, other bills $500, and student loans. After expenses, they have a couple hundred left for food, necessities, and spending. So $200 is a significant chunk of their budget. The author is frustrated because giving $200 when they're already tight on money seems irresponsible to him. \n\nBut the wife admires his giving and tried to do the same. She might feel that they're both helping others, and she's proud of her own contributions. She might have thought it's okay because they can afford it, or maybe she didn't realize the impact. The author's reaction was shock and anger, which led to an argument and sleeping on the couch. \n\nThe author's point is that $200 is a lot for them right now. The wife's point is that the homeless need it more. The question is whether the author is wrong for being mad. \n\nI need to consider both sides. On one hand, they have a limited budget, and sudden large expenses can cause stress. The author might feel that his wife didn't consult him or consider their finances. On the other hand, giving to those in need is a moral choice. Maybe the author is being too strict, not allowing for personal contributions. \n\nBut since they're a couple, managing finances together is important. If the wife gave away $200 without discussing it, maybe she overstepped. However, the author might have set the precedent by giving regularly and praising her for it. The wife might have thought it's okay to do the same. \n\nThe key points are communication and financial planning. If they didn't have a shared budget that accounts for charitable giving, then maybe both have responsibilities. The author's anger might stem from the unexpected expense, while the wife felt she was following his example. \n\nIn conclusion, maybe the author isn't entirely in the wrong because the financial situation is tight, but the wife might have a point in trying to help. However, the author's reaction was harsh, and poor communication might be the real issue. Since the question is whether the author is in the wrong, the answer might be B (No), as he's justified in being upset about the financial impact, but there's room for better communication.\n"
