We live in Chicago and there\u2019s homeless people on every corner. I (24M) give as many of them whatever I can afford. If I have a lot of change left or loose singles then I\u2019ll give it to one of them. Or I\u2019ll buy them some food when I get some. It all depends. My wife (22F) has always admired that I share with them and has started to do it herself. She\u2019ll sometimes give them her whole lunch or like a ten dollar bill. \n\nAnyways, we collectively make about 60k a year. Next year I\u2019ll be making $100k alone. We pay $1200 in rent and $500 in other bills. We both pay off student loans as well. At the end of month we only have a couple hundred that goes towards food, necessities, and spending money. \n\nA few days ago I had an extra $20. I saw a family that had some kids so I gave it to them. My wife kept telling me how amazing I was for it. I thought it was kind of weird how she kept bringing it up but I still appreciated her comments. Btw we have a car but we prefer to walk to work because of how busy the streets are here. \n\nLast night she told me how she helped a lot of homeless people on her way home from work. I told her it was great. While I was making dinner she started asking me how much money do I usually give away. I told her about $125 a month maybe. She continued to bring up how she helped a lot of people. \n\nWhile we were eating she brought it up again. She said \u201cyou said you give about $125 a month right babe?\u201d I nodded because I was chewing still. Next she says \u201cI outran you this week!\u201d I didn\u2019t know wtf she was talking about and I guess she could tell by the look on my face. \n\nLong story short, she said she gave every homeless person she saw some money. When I asked how much she said all of the money in her wallet. I asked how much again. She told me about $200 like it was nothing.\n\nI instantly said what the fuck? She was surprised at my reaction like I would be happy about it. We argued about it. $200 is a lot of money for us. We already payed our rent and utilities but now we only have $100 until April 15th. I told her that she acted senselessly. \n\nShe\u2019s been ignoring me ever since and locked me out of our bedroom last night. I slept on the couch. \n\nNow I\u2019m wondering if I was the asshole for being mad. After all, those people do need it more than us. But I still feel like she shouldn\u2019t have given away that much when we can barely afford it. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user wants to know if the person in the story is in the wrong for being upset about their wife giving away $200 to homeless people.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The husband and wife have a combined income of $60k and next year he'll make $100k alone. But their expenses are high: $1200 rent, $500 in other bills, student loans, and they have only a couple hundred left for food and needs. So their budget is tight.\n\nThe husband gives about $125 a month to homeless people. He gives when he can afford it, which he says is when he has loose change or extra singles. The wife admires this and started doing it too. She gives her lunch or $10 here and there. But one time, she gave all the money in her wallet, which turned out to be $200, and the husband got angry because they can't afford that with their tight budget.\n\nNow, the question is whether the husband is in the wrong for being upset. From his perspective, $200 is a significant chunk of their monthly budget. He might feel that his donations are more sustainable and responsible, while her $200 was impulsive and could lead to financial strain. The wife might feel that giving is important, even if it's a larger sum, and that her husband is being selfish by criticizing her.\n\nBut the key here is whether the husband's reaction is justified. The wife didn't consult him before giving away $200, which could affect their shared finances. Even if both want to give to the homeless, they need to have a discussion about their budget and how much each can contribute without straining their finances. The husband's anger stems from financial stress, which is valid. However, his reaction might have been harsh, especially if the wife was genuinely trying to help and didn't realize the impact. \n\nOn the other hand, the wife giving away the entire wallet's contents without discussing it first shows a lack of awareness of their shared financial situation. She might be acting out of generosity but not considering the consequences. The husband's responsibility to manage their finances could be seen as valid, but his dismissal of her actions as \"senseless\" might come off as dismissive of her values.\n\nIn relationships, communication is key. The problem here might not be who is in the wrong but that they haven't established clear boundaries about their spending. The husband is not wrong to be upset about a significant unapproved expense, but the wife is also not wrong in her intent to help. They both need to talk about their priorities and how to balance generosity with financial responsibility. \n\nConsidering the context, the husband's anger is understandable given their budget constraints. However, his reaction might have been too harsh without first discussing their shared financial goals. The wife's action was impulsive but well-intentioned. Since the husband's main argument is about the financial impact, which is a valid concern, but his response could be seen as dismissive of her intentions. However, given the financial situation, his reaction is more about the practicality of their budget rather than the moral aspect of giving. \n\nSo, the answer might be that the husband isn't in the wrong for being upset, but the situation shows a need for better communication. Therefore, the answer would be B (the author is not in the wrong).\n"
