We live in Chicago and there\u2019s homeless people on every corner. I (24M) give as many of them whatever I can afford. If I have a lot of change left or loose singles then I\u2019ll give it to one of them. Or I\u2019ll buy them some food when I get some. It all depends. My wife (22F) has always admired that I share with them and has started to do it herself. She\u2019ll sometimes give them her whole lunch or like a ten dollar bill. \n\nAnyways, we collectively make about 60k a year. Next year I\u2019ll be making $100k alone. We pay $1200 in rent and $500 in other bills. We both pay off student loans as well. At the end of month we only have a couple hundred that goes towards food, necessities, and spending money. \n\nA few days ago I had an extra $20. I saw a family that had some kids so I gave it to them. My wife kept telling me how amazing I was for it. I thought it was kind of weird how she kept bringing it up but I still appreciated her comments. Btw we have a car but we prefer to walk to work because of how busy the streets are here. \n\nLast night she told me how she helped a lot of homeless people on her way home from work. I told her it was great. While I was making dinner she started asking me how much money do I usually give away. I told her about $125 a month maybe. She continued to bring up how she helped a lot of people. \n\nWhile we were eating she brought it up again. She said \u201cyou said you give about $125 a month right babe?\u201d I nodded because I was chewing still. Next she says \u201cI outran you this week!\u201d I didn\u2019t know wtf she was talking about and I guess she could tell by the look on my face. \n\nLong story short, she said she gave every homeless person she saw some money. When I asked how much she said all of the money in her wallet. I asked how much again. She told me about $200 like it was nothing.\n\nI instantly said what the fuck? She was surprised at my reaction like I would be happy about it. We argued about it. $200 is a lot of money for us. We already payed our rent and utilities but now we only have $100 until April 15th. I told her that she acted senselessly. \n\nShe\u2019s been ignoring me ever since and locked me out of our bedroom last night. I slept on the couch. \n\nNow I\u2019m wondering if I was the asshole for being mad. After all, those people do need it more than us. But I still feel like she shouldn\u2019t have given away that much when we can barely afford it. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. Let's start by breaking down the situation.\n\nFirst, the couple makes $60k a year together, and the husband will make $100k alone next year. Their expenses are $1200 for rent and $500 for other bills, plus student loans. At the end of the month, they have a couple hundred left for food and spending. That doesn't seem like a lot. The husband gives about $125 a month to homeless people, which he can manage because he says he gives when he can afford it. The wife, on the other hand, gave $200 in a week, which the husband feels is too much because their budget is tight.\n\nThe key points here are about their financial situation and differing views on charitable giving. The husband is upset because $200 is a significant portion of their remaining money after bills. The wife might feel that helping others is important and perhaps sees her actions as commendable. However, the husband's reaction is based on their financial constraints. \n\nI should consider if the husband is being unreasonable. The wife did give a large amount suddenly, which affects their budget. The husband's anger comes from financial stress, not the act of giving itself. On the other hand, the wife might feel her actions are noble and that her husband isn't supportive. \n\nIs it wrong for the husband to be upset? Well, their finances are tight, and unexpected large expenses can cause stress. But maybe the husband should have communicated better about their budget. However, the wife giving away money without considering the household budget could be seen as irresponsible. \n\nSo, the question is whether the husband is in the wrong for being angry. If the wife knew their budget was tight, giving $200 without discussion might be careless. But maybe the husband should have set clearer boundaries. \n\nIn many relationships, both partners should discuss financial decisions, especially when it's a significant amount. The wife giving away $200 without considering the household's needs could be seen as the issue. The husband's reaction, while perhaps harsh, is based on their financial reality. So maybe the wife is at fault here, but the husband's response might be too extreme. However, the main question is if the author (husband) is in the wrong. If he's justified in being upset because their finances are tight, then he's not in the wrong. But if the wife's actions are within her rights as a partner, then maybe he is. \n\nAlternatively, maybe they both have some responsibility. But the question is specifically about the husband. The wife gave a large amount without discussion, and the husband is upset because it affects their budget. So the husband's anger is understandable, but his reaction (calling her senseless and sleeping on the couch) might be too harsh. However, the core issue is whether he's wrong for being upset. \n\nIn terms of financial responsibility, both should communicate. But in this case, the wife's action was a sudden large expenditure, which the husband found stressful. So the husband is not in the wrong for being upset. Therefore, the answer would be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
