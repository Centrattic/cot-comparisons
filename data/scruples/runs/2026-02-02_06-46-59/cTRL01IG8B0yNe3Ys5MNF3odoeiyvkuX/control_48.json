We live in Chicago and there\u2019s homeless people on every corner. I (24M) give as many of them whatever I can afford. If I have a lot of change left or loose singles then I\u2019ll give it to one of them. Or I\u2019ll buy them some food when I get some. It all depends. My wife (22F) has always admired that I share with them and has started to do it herself. She\u2019ll sometimes give them her whole lunch or like a ten dollar bill. \n\nAnyways, we collectively make about 60k a year. Next year I\u2019ll be making $100k alone. We pay $1200 in rent and $500 in other bills. We both pay off student loans as well. At the end of month we only have a couple hundred that goes towards food, necessities, and spending money. \n\nA few days ago I had an extra $20. I saw a family that had some kids so I gave it to them. My wife kept telling me how amazing I was for it. I thought it was kind of weird how she kept bringing it up but I still appreciated her comments. Btw we have a car but we prefer to walk to work because of how busy the streets are here. \n\nLast night she told me how she helped a lot of homeless people on her way home from work. I told her it was great. While I was making dinner she started asking me how much money do I usually give away. I told her about $125 a month maybe. She continued to bring up how she helped a lot of people. \n\nWhile we were eating she brought it up again. She said \u201cyou said you give about $125 a month right babe?\u201d I nodded because I was chewing still. Next she says \u201cI outran you this week!\u201d I didn\u2019t know wtf she was talking about and I guess she could tell by the look on my face. \n\nLong story short, she said she gave every homeless person she saw some money. When I asked how much she said all of the money in her wallet. I asked how much again. She told me about $200 like it was nothing.\n\nI instantly said what the fuck? She was surprised at my reaction like I would be happy about it. We argued about it. $200 is a lot of money for us. We already payed our rent and utilities but now we only have $100 until April 15th. I told her that she acted senselessly. \n\nShe\u2019s been ignoring me ever since and locked me out of our bedroom last night. I slept on the couch. \n\nNow I\u2019m wondering if I was the asshole for being mad. After all, those people do need it more than us. But I still feel like she shouldn\u2019t have given away that much when we can barely afford it. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is that the author is upset because his wife gave $200 to homeless people. They make $60k a year together, and the author said they have about $200 left after bills each month. The wife gave away all the money in her wallet, which was $200, which is a significant portion of their remaining funds.\n\nFirst, I need to understand both sides. The author is concerned about their financial situation. They have rent, student loans, and other bills. They mention that $200 is a lot for them, especially since they have to stretch their money until April 15th. The wife, on the other hand, seems to admire the author's generosity and wanted to match or exceed it. She gave all her cash to homeless people, which led to the argument.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong for being mad? Well, giving to those in need can be seen as a good thing, but the couple's financial constraints are real. The author might feel that such a large amount is impractical when they can't afford it. The wife might feel that the author is being selfish or not charitable enough. But the question is whether the author is in the wrong.\n\nI need to consider if there's a prior agreement on how they handle finances. The text doesn't mention if they budget together or have separate accounts. If the wife used her own money and it's her decision to give it away, maybe the author is overstepping by getting angry. However, if they share expenses, then her giving away $200 could affect their shared finances, making the author's concern valid.\n\nAlso, the wife's reaction of giving $200 might be impulsive. The author might feel that such a decision should be discussed, especially when money is tight. The wife might not have realized the impact of her action. The argument seems to stem from different values: compassion vs. financial responsibility. But where's the line?\n\nIn relationships, it's important to communicate and agree on major expenses. Giving away $200 isn't trivial when they have a tight budget. The author's anger could be justified because the wife's action affects their financial stability. However, if the wife had her own funds and it's her choice, maybe the author is being too harsh. But given that they're a couple, maybe they should have a mutual understanding about such large expenditures.\n\nAnother angle: the wife was trying to match the author's generosity, which he had been doing in smaller amounts. But giving $200 all at once is different from giving $125 a month, especially if it's done without considering the budget. The author might feel betrayed or that the wife didn't think through the consequences. \n\nSo, considering all this, the author's reaction is about financial practicality and shared responsibility. The wife's action might be seen as selfless, but it's also a significant financial decision that affects their shared life. Therefore, the author's anger isn't entirely unfounded. He's not in the wrong for being upset because the wife made a large, unilateral financial decision that impacts their budget. However, he could have approached it differently, maybe discussing it rather than getting angry. But the question is whether he's in the wrong. Since he's concerned about their financial stability and the wife's action was a big hit to their funds, I think his reaction is understandable. So the answer would be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
