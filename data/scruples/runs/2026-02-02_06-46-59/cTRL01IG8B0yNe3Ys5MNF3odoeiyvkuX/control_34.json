We live in Chicago and there\u2019s homeless people on every corner. I (24M) give as many of them whatever I can afford. If I have a lot of change left or loose singles then I\u2019ll give it to one of them. Or I\u2019ll buy them some food when I get some. It all depends. My wife (22F) has always admired that I share with them and has started to do it herself. She\u2019ll sometimes give them her whole lunch or like a ten dollar bill. \n\nAnyways, we collectively make about 60k a year. Next year I\u2019ll be making $100k alone. We pay $1200 in rent and $500 in other bills. We both pay off student loans as well. At the end of month we only have a couple hundred that goes towards food, necessities, and spending money. \n\nA few days ago I had an extra $20. I saw a family that had some kids so I gave it to them. My wife kept telling me how amazing I was for it. I thought it was kind of weird how she kept bringing it up but I still appreciated her comments. Btw we have a car but we prefer to walk to work because of how busy the streets are here. \n\nLast night she told me how she helped a lot of homeless people on her way home from work. I told her it was great. While I was making dinner she started asking me how much money do I usually give away. I told her about $125 a month maybe. She continued to bring up how she helped a lot of people. \n\nWhile we were eating she brought it up again. She said \u201cyou said you give about $125 a month right babe?\u201d I nodded because I was chewing still. Next she says \u201cI outran you this week!\u201d I didn\u2019t know wtf she was talking about and I guess she could tell by the look on my face. \n\nLong story short, she said she gave every homeless person she saw some money. When I asked how much she said all of the money in her wallet. I asked how much again. She told me about $200 like it was nothing.\n\nI instantly said what the fuck? She was surprised at my reaction like I would be happy about it. We argued about it. $200 is a lot of money for us. We already payed our rent and utilities but now we only have $100 until April 15th. I told her that she acted senselessly. \n\nShe\u2019s been ignoring me ever since and locked me out of our bedroom last night. I slept on the couch. \n\nNow I\u2019m wondering if I was the asshole for being mad. After all, those people do need it more than us. But I still feel like she shouldn\u2019t have given away that much when we can barely afford it. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author (a man) is in the wrong for being upset that his wife gave away $200 to homeless people. Their finances are tight: they make around $60k together, he'll make $100k next year, but currently, after rent ($1200), bills ($500), and student loans, they only have a couple hundred left for food and expenses.\n\nThe husband gives about $125 a month to homelessness, which the wife admires and has started doing too. She gave $200 all at once, which he saw as excessive. The wife was proud of herself, but the husband was upset because that $200 is a significant chunk of their remaining money each month. They ended up arguing, and the wife ignored him and locked him out.\n\nSo, is the husband in the wrong for being angry? Well, both are giving to the homeless, which is a good thing, but the issue is the amount. The wife gave $200, which he considers irresponsible given their financial situation. The wife might feel it's important to help, but the husband is concerned about their budget. \n\nFrom a financial perspective, if they have only a couple hundred left after fixed expenses, $200 is a big hit. The husband's reaction is about financial responsibility. He's not against helping, just the amount. The wife might feel her actions are justified, but maybe she didn't consider the impact on their budget. \n\nHowever, the husband could have communicated better. Instead of getting angry, maybe he could have discussed their budgeting for charitable giving. But he's also right to be concerned about their financial stability. \n\nIs he in the wrong? It's a bit of a gray area. The wife's action was impulsive, but the husband's reaction might be inconsiderate of her motivations. But given the financial constraints, his concern is valid. Probably, the answer is B (not the asshole) because the financial pressure is real, and $200 is a significant amount for them. The wife could have discussed it beforehand, but the husband isn't wrong to be upset.\n"
