We live in Chicago and there\u2019s homeless people on every corner. I (24M) give as many of them whatever I can afford. If I have a lot of change left or loose singles then I\u2019ll give it to one of them. Or I\u2019ll buy them some food when I get some. It all depends. My wife (22F) has always admired that I share with them and has started to do it herself. She\u2019ll sometimes give them her whole lunch or like a ten dollar bill. \n\nAnyways, we collectively make about 60k a year. Next year I\u2019ll be making $100k alone. We pay $1200 in rent and $500 in other bills. We both pay off student loans as well. At the end of month we only have a couple hundred that goes towards food, necessities, and spending money. \n\nA few days ago I had an extra $20. I saw a family that had some kids so I gave it to them. My wife kept telling me how amazing I was for it. I thought it was kind of weird how she kept bringing it up but I still appreciated her comments. Btw we have a car but we prefer to walk to work because of how busy the streets are here. \n\nLast night she told me how she helped a lot of homeless people on her way home from work. I told her it was great. While I was making dinner she started asking me how much money do I usually give away. I told her about $125 a month maybe. She continued to bring up how she helped a lot of people. \n\nWhile we were eating she brought it up again. She said \u201cyou said you give about $125 a month right babe?\u201d I nodded because I was chewing still. Next she says \u201cI outran you this week!\u201d I didn\u2019t know wtf she was talking about and I guess she could tell by the look on my face. \n\nLong story short, she said she gave every homeless person she saw some money. When I asked how much she said all of the money in her wallet. I asked how much again. She told me about $200 like it was nothing.\n\nI instantly said what the fuck? She was surprised at my reaction like I would be happy about it. We argued about it. $200 is a lot of money for us. We already payed our rent and utilities but now we only have $100 until April 15th. I told her that she acted senselessly. \n\nShe\u2019s been ignoring me ever since and locked me out of our bedroom last night. I slept on the couch. \n\nNow I\u2019m wondering if I was the asshole for being mad. After all, those people do need it more than us. But I still feel like she shouldn\u2019t have given away that much when we can barely afford it. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that the wife gave $200 to homeless people, and the husband is upset about it. They have a combined income of $60k a year, with the husband expecting to make $100k next year. Their expenses include $1200 rent and $500 in other bills, plus student loan payments. At the end of the month, they have only a couple hundred dollars left for food, necessities, and spending.\n\nThe husband gives about $125 a month, which he says depends on what he can afford. The wife, on the other hand, gave away $200 in one week, which is more than his monthly amount. The husband is upset because that $200 is a significant portion of their remaining money after bills, leaving them with only $100 until mid-April. The wife seems to be proud of giving more, but the husband feels it's irresponsible given their financial situation.\n\nSo, the key points here are financial responsibility vs. charitable giving. The couple's finances are tight, and the wife's action of giving away a large portion of their discretionary income might be seen as not considering their financial stability. The husband is concerned about their ability to cover upcoming expenses, which is valid. On the other hand, the wife might believe in helping others as much as possible, even if it strains their budget.\n\nBut the question is whether the author (the husband) is in the wrong. The husband's reaction is based on their financial constraints. He's upset because the $200 is a significant amount for them, and he feels she acted senselessly. However, the wife might feel that her charitable actions are justified, especially since the husband has been giving as well. \n\nIt's important to consider if there was prior discussion about their budget and charitable giving. If they have a shared budget and agreed on how much to spend on such causes, then one might be in the wrong for exceeding that. But if there was no prior agreement, both could be at fault. The husband is reacting to an unplanned expenditure that affects their finances, while the wife might feel her contribution is equally valid.\n\nIn this case, the husband's concern is about their financial stability, which is reasonable. The wife giving away a large sum without discussing it could be seen as not considering their shared financial responsibilities. Therefore, the husband might not be in the wrong for being upset. However, it's a common issue where both parties have different values and priorities. But since the question is whether the author (husband) is in the wrong, the answer would likely be B (No), because his reaction is based on their financial situation, and he has a valid concern about their budget.\n"
