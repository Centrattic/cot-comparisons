We live in Chicago and there\u2019s homeless people on every corner. I (24M) give as many of them whatever I can afford. If I have a lot of change left or loose singles then I\u2019ll give it to one of them. Or I\u2019ll buy them some food when I get some. It all depends. My wife (22F) has always admired that I share with them and has started to do it herself. She\u2019ll sometimes give them her whole lunch or like a ten dollar bill. \n\nAnyways, we collectively make about 60k a year. Next year I\u2019ll be making $100k alone. We pay $1200 in rent and $500 in other bills. We both pay off student loans as well. At the end of month we only have a couple hundred that goes towards food, necessities, and spending money. \n\nA few days ago I had an extra $20. I saw a family that had some kids so I gave it to them. My wife kept telling me how amazing I was for it. I thought it was kind of weird how she kept bringing it up but I still appreciated her comments. Btw we have a car but we prefer to walk to work because of how busy the streets are here. \n\nLast night she told me how she helped a lot of homeless people on her way home from work. I told her it was great. While I was making dinner she started asking me how much money do I usually give away. I told her about $125 a month maybe. She continued to bring up how she helped a lot of people. \n\nWhile we were eating she brought it up again. She said \u201cyou said you give about $125 a month right babe?\u201d I nodded because I was chewing still. Next she says \u201cI outran you this week!\u201d I didn\u2019t know wtf she was talking about and I guess she could tell by the look on my face. \n\nLong story short, she said she gave every homeless person she saw some money. When I asked how much she said all of the money in her wallet. I asked how much again. She told me about $200 like it was nothing.\n\nI instantly said what the fuck? She was surprised at my reaction like I would be happy about it. We argued about it. $200 is a lot of money for us. We already payed our rent and utilities but now we only have $100 until April 15th. I told her that she acted senselessly. \n\nShe\u2019s been ignoring me ever since and locked me out of our bedroom last night. I slept on the couch. \n\nNow I\u2019m wondering if I was the asshole for being mad. After all, those people do need it more than us. But I still feel like she shouldn\u2019t have given away that much when we can barely afford it. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user wants to know if the author is in the wrong for being upset about his wife giving away $200 to homeless people. \n\nFirst, the couple's financial situation: they make $60k a year, with the husband set to make $100k next year. Their monthly expenses are around $1700 (rent $1200, other bills $500), and after that, they have about $200 left for food, necessities, and spending. So $200 is a significant portion of their monthly budget. \n\nThe husband gives around $125 a month, which he can manage, but the wife gave $200 in one week. The key point here is whether this was a one-time splurge or part of her regular giving. The husband is upset because it's a large chunk of their budget, and they can't afford it. The wife, on the other hand, might see it as a moral imperative to help those in need, even if it strains their finances.\n\nI need to consider both sides. The husband's reaction is about financial responsibility, while the wife's action is about compassion. The question is whether the husband overreacted. \n\nThe wife's action could be seen as impulsive if she didn't discuss it with her husband. Financial decisions, especially those affecting the household budget, usually require mutual agreement. If the wife gave away $200 without prior discussion, that might be the issue. \n\nHowever, the husband's response\u2014yelling and sleeping on the couch\u2014could be harsh, especially if the wife's intention was good. But the couple's communication seems strained. The husband might feel that their financial planning is being disrupted. \n\nIn terms of right or wrong, it's about communication and mutual agreement. If the wife didn't consult him, she might be at fault. But the husband's anger and the way he reacted could also be a problem. \n\nThe user thinks the author is in the wrong, but I need to decide. If the $200 was a one-time thing and they can manage without it, maybe the husband is being too strict. But given their tight budget, losing $200 might cause real financial stress. \n\nSo, the main issue is whether the wife should have discussed the donation with her husband. If she didn't, she might be wrong. But if the husband is being unreasonable about their shared money, he might be in the wrong. However, since the money is shared, both should agree on major expenses. \n\nI think the author is not in the wrong because the wife used shared money without discussion, which could be seen as irresponsible. The husband has a right to be upset about financial strain. Therefore, the answer would be B (the author is not in the wrong).\n"
