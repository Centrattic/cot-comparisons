We live in Chicago and there\u2019s homeless people on every corner. I (24M) give as many of them whatever I can afford. If I have a lot of change left or loose singles then I\u2019ll give it to one of them. Or I\u2019ll buy them some food when I get some. It all depends. My wife (22F) has always admired that I share with them and has started to do it herself. She\u2019ll sometimes give them her whole lunch or like a ten dollar bill. \n\nAnyways, we collectively make about 60k a year. Next year I\u2019ll be making $100k alone. We pay $1200 in rent and $500 in other bills. We both pay off student loans as well. At the end of month we only have a couple hundred that goes towards food, necessities, and spending money. \n\nA few days ago I had an extra $20. I saw a family that had some kids so I gave it to them. My wife kept telling me how amazing I was for it. I thought it was kind of weird how she kept bringing it up but I still appreciated her comments. Btw we have a car but we prefer to walk to work because of how busy the streets are here. \n\nLast night she told me how she helped a lot of homeless people on her way home from work. I told her it was great. While I was making dinner she started asking me how much money do I usually give away. I told her about $125 a month maybe. She continued to bring up how she helped a lot of people. \n\nWhile we were eating she brought it up again. She said \u201cyou said you give about $125 a month right babe?\u201d I nodded because I was chewing still. Next she says \u201cI outran you this week!\u201d I didn\u2019t know wtf she was talking about and I guess she could tell by the look on my face. \n\nLong story short, she said she gave every homeless person she saw some money. When I asked how much she said all of the money in her wallet. I asked how much again. She told me about $200 like it was nothing.\n\nI instantly said what the fuck? She was surprised at my reaction like I would be happy about it. We argued about it. $200 is a lot of money for us. We already payed our rent and utilities but now we only have $100 until April 15th. I told her that she acted senselessly. \n\nShe\u2019s been ignoring me ever since and locked me out of our bedroom last night. I slept on the couch. \n\nNow I\u2019m wondering if I was the asshole for being mad. After all, those people do need it more than us. But I still feel like she shouldn\u2019t have given away that much when we can barely afford it. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for being upset that his wife gave away $200 to homeless people. The situation is that they have a combined income of $60k a year, with the husband expecting to make $100k alone next year. Their expenses are $1200 for rent and $500 for other bills, plus student loans. They have a couple hundred left each month for food and other necessities.\n\nSo, the wife gave away $200 in one go, which the husband seems to see as a significant portion of their monthly budget. He's upset because they're already tight on money after paying rent and utilities, and now they have only $100 left until the 15th. The wife, on the other hand, was surprised by his reaction, expecting him to be happy since it's a charitable act.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The husband is concerned about their financial stability, especially since they have a limited amount each month. The wife is following the husband's example of giving to homeless people, but did so in a way that he finds excessive. \n\nThe key points here are financial responsibility and differing values. The husband might feel that such a large one-time donation could lead to them not having enough for their own needs. The wife might see it as helping those in need, especially if she believes they need it more. \n\nHowever, the husband had previously given away $125 a month, which is less than the $200 his wife gave. So, if he was okay with that amount, why is he upset about her giving more? Unless the issue is that she did it all at once, which could affect their short-term cash flow. \n\nAlso, their communication seems to be a problem. The wife didn't check with him before giving away the money, which he might see as a lack of teamwork in managing finances. On the other hand, the husband's reaction was immediate anger (\"what the fuck\") and not discussing it calmly. \n\nFinancial decisions in a relationship usually require mutual agreement. If both are giving, but the wife's action caused a noticeable dent in their budget, maybe the husband is right to be concerned. But if they hadn't discussed their approach to charitable giving before, the wife might have acted without considering his perspective.\n\nThe husband's argument is about the couple's ability to afford it. The wife's argument is about the importance of helping. Without prior discussion on how much they can allocate for such purposes, the wife might have overstepped, especially if the $200 wasn't from a shared account but her personal money. Wait, the original statement says they each pay off student loans, so maybe they have separate finances? The husband mentioned their collective income but it's unclear if they have a joint account. If the $200 was from her own money, maybe the husband shouldn't be upset. But if they share funds, then giving without discussing could be an issue.\n\nThe husband also points out that they have a limited amount each month, and this $200 could affect their spending. The wife might not realize the impact of a one-time expense versus monthly. The husband's reaction could be seen as valid if they're not in a position to spend that much on non-essentials without consulting each other. \n\nIn terms of being an asshole, if the husband was angry without considering that she might have used her own money, he could be at fault. But if they share finances and she made a big decision without talking to him, he's not in the wrong. The wife might have acted impulsively, leading to tension. The husband's frustration is about financial planning, which is important in a relationship. \n\nSo, the answer might be B (No, the author is not in the wrong) because managing shared finances requires communication and mutual agreement. The wife giving $200 without discussing it could be seen as irresponsible, especially if it strains their budget. However, if they have separate finances and the $200 was her personal money, the husband's reaction might be unwarranted. The original post doesn't specify if they have a joint account. The husband mentions they \"collectively make about 60k a year,\" and they each pay their own student loans. It's possible they have separate accounts. If that's the case, the wife using her own money to give away $200 wouldn't be the husband's problem. But the husband's reaction could still be seen as dismissive of her values. \n\nBut the husband says they \"only have a couple hundred that goes towards food, necessities, and spending money.\" If the wife's $200 comes out of that small amount, it's a valid concern. Also, the way he responded (\"what the fuck\") is harsh, but not necessarily in the wrong if he's genuinely worried about their financial situation. The wife might have acted without considering the couple's overall budget. So, the author isn't in the wrong because the wife's action impacted their shared financial situation without prior discussion. Hence, the answer is B.\n"
