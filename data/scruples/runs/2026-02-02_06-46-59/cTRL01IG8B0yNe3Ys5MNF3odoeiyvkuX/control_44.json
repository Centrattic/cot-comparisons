We live in Chicago and there\u2019s homeless people on every corner. I (24M) give as many of them whatever I can afford. If I have a lot of change left or loose singles then I\u2019ll give it to one of them. Or I\u2019ll buy them some food when I get some. It all depends. My wife (22F) has always admired that I share with them and has started to do it herself. She\u2019ll sometimes give them her whole lunch or like a ten dollar bill. \n\nAnyways, we collectively make about 60k a year. Next year I\u2019ll be making $100k alone. We pay $1200 in rent and $500 in other bills. We both pay off student loans as well. At the end of month we only have a couple hundred that goes towards food, necessities, and spending money. \n\nA few days ago I had an extra $20. I saw a family that had some kids so I gave it to them. My wife kept telling me how amazing I was for it. I thought it was kind of weird how she kept bringing it up but I still appreciated her comments. Btw we have a car but we prefer to walk to work because of how busy the streets are here. \n\nLast night she told me how she helped a lot of homeless people on her way home from work. I told her it was great. While I was making dinner she started asking me how much money do I usually give away. I told her about $125 a month maybe. She continued to bring up how she helped a lot of people. \n\nWhile we were eating she brought it up again. She said \u201cyou said you give about $125 a month right babe?\u201d I nodded because I was chewing still. Next she says \u201cI outran you this week!\u201d I didn\u2019t know wtf she was talking about and I guess she could tell by the look on my face. \n\nLong story short, she said she gave every homeless person she saw some money. When I asked how much she said all of the money in her wallet. I asked how much again. She told me about $200 like it was nothing.\n\nI instantly said what the fuck? She was surprised at my reaction like I would be happy about it. We argued about it. $200 is a lot of money for us. We already payed our rent and utilities but now we only have $100 until April 15th. I told her that she acted senselessly. \n\nShe\u2019s been ignoring me ever since and locked me out of our bedroom last night. I slept on the couch. \n\nNow I\u2019m wondering if I was the asshole for being mad. After all, those people do need it more than us. But I still feel like she shouldn\u2019t have given away that much when we can barely afford it. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of this Reddit-style story is in the wrong. The situation involves the author being upset that his wife gave $200 to homeless people, and they're struggling financially. The couple makes $60k a year, with the author set to earn $100k next year. Their expenses include $1200 rent and $500 in other bills, plus student loans. After expenses, they have a couple hundred dollars left for food and necessities.\n\nThe wife gave $200 all at once to homeless people, which the author sees as irresponsible because they can't afford it. He got angry, they argued, and now she's ignoring him. The question is if he's the asshole.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The author and wife both give to homeless people, which is a good thing. However, the wife gave a significant portion of their monthly budget in one go. The couple is living on a tight budget, so $200 is a big chunk. The author is upset because it affects their financial stability. On the other hand, the wife might feel strongly about helping others and didn't realize the impact on their finances.\n\nKey points to analyze: financial responsibility, communication, and differing values. The wife didn't check with the author before giving away the money, which could be seen as a lack of financial planning. However, both have been giving before, and the wife was inspired by the author's actions. The author's reaction might be valid because the couple needs to manage their money together. But maybe he should have communicated his concerns earlier about their giving habits. If they hadn't discussed boundaries before, it's a communication issue. The wife, on the other hand, might have felt it was her choice to help, but in a shared household, major expenses should be discussed.\n\nAlso, the wife's statement about \"outrunning\" him in donations could be aprovocative. The author might feel disrespected if she's one-upping him without considering their finances. However, the author's anger and the fact that he slept on the couch might indicate he overreacted. But given their financial situation, his concern is understandable.\n\nIn relationships, financial decisions should be mutual. If the wife gave away $200 without discussing it, that's a problem. The author is in the right to be upset because it's a shared responsibility. However, if they hadn't set boundaries before, maybe the author should have brought up his concerns earlier. Still, the wife giving such a large sum without consultation is a breach of financial trust. So the author isn't in the wrong for being mad, but maybe both sides have some responsibility. However, according to the \"AITA\" framework, the main question is whether the author's reaction is justified. Given their financial constraints, his anger is valid. So the answer is B (author not in the wrong).\n"
