We live in Chicago and there\u2019s homeless people on every corner. I (24M) give as many of them whatever I can afford. If I have a lot of change left or loose singles then I\u2019ll give it to one of them. Or I\u2019ll buy them some food when I get some. It all depends. My wife (22F) has always admired that I share with them and has started to do it herself. She\u2019ll sometimes give them her whole lunch or like a ten dollar bill. \n\nAnyways, we collectively make about 60k a year. Next year I\u2019ll be making $100k alone. We pay $1200 in rent and $500 in other bills. We both pay off student loans as well. At the end of month we only have a couple hundred that goes towards food, necessities, and spending money. \n\nA few days ago I had an extra $20. I saw a family that had some kids so I gave it to them. My wife kept telling me how amazing I was for it. I thought it was kind of weird how she kept bringing it up but I still appreciated her comments. Btw we have a car but we prefer to walk to work because of how busy the streets are here. \n\nLast night she told me how she helped a lot of homeless people on her way home from work. I told her it was great. While I was making dinner she started asking me how much money do I usually give away. I told her about $125 a month maybe. She continued to bring up how she helped a lot of people. \n\nWhile we were eating she brought it up again. She said \u201cyou said you give about $125 a month right babe?\u201d I nodded because I was chewing still. Next she says \u201cI outran you this week!\u201d I didn\u2019t know wtf she was talking about and I guess she could tell by the look on my face. \n\nLong story short, she said she gave every homeless person she saw some money. When I asked how much she said all of the money in her wallet. I asked how much again. She told me about $200 like it was nothing.\n\nI instantly said what the fuck? She was surprised at my reaction like I would be happy about it. We argued about it. $200 is a lot of money for us. We already payed our rent and utilities but now we only have $100 until April 15th. I told her that she acted senselessly. \n\nShe\u2019s been ignoring me ever since and locked me out of our bedroom last night. I slept on the couch. \n\nNow I\u2019m wondering if I was the asshole for being mad. After all, those people do need it more than us. But I still feel like she shouldn\u2019t have given away that much when we can barely afford it. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for being upset that their wife gave away $200 to homeless people. The situation involves their financial situation and differing approaches to giving.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the financial context. They make 60k a year, with the husband expecting to make 100k next year. They pay $1200 rent and $500 in other bills, plus student loans. At the end of the month, they have only a couple hundred for food and spending. So, $200 is a significant portion of their discretionary income. The author gives about $125 a month, which he's comfortable with, but his wife gave $200 in a week. That's more than double what he gives in a month.\n\nThe wife admires his giving and started doing it herself. But she gave all the money in her wallet. The author is upset because it's a large chunk of their money, especially since they have limited funds after rent and bills. The wife seems to be trying to outdo him, which might be a point of contention. He feels she acted senselessly. \n\nIs the author wrong? Well, the wife's action was generous but perhaps without considering their financial constraints. But the author's reaction could be seen as dismissive of her generosity. However, given their financial situation, the $200 is a big hit. The author is responsible for managing their finances, or at least communicating about it. The wife gave money without discussing it, which could lead to conflict. \n\nThe author's anger might be justified because they need to manage their budget carefully. But the wife's intention was good. However, the key issue is whether the wife should have discussed the $200 decision with him. Since they're a couple, major financial decisions usually require mutual agreement. The wife gave without consulting, which the author found problematic. \n\nOn the other hand, the author could have been more understanding of her motivation, but he's also within his rights to be concerned about their financial stability. The question is whether his reaction was disproportionate. Since $200 is a significant amount for them, he's not wrong to be upset. However, maybe he could have handled it better, but the wife might be at fault for not discussing it. \n\nSo, the answer hinges on whether the wife's action was done without communication, which the author is justified in being upset about. Therefore, the author is not in the wrong. The wife's action was impulsive without considering their budget, and the author's concern is valid.\n"
