We live in Chicago and there\u2019s homeless people on every corner. I (24M) give as many of them whatever I can afford. If I have a lot of change left or loose singles then I\u2019ll give it to one of them. Or I\u2019ll buy them some food when I get some. It all depends. My wife (22F) has always admired that I share with them and has started to do it herself. She\u2019ll sometimes give them her whole lunch or like a ten dollar bill. \n\nAnyways, we collectively make about 60k a year. Next year I\u2019ll be making $100k alone. We pay $1200 in rent and $500 in other bills. We both pay off student loans as well. At the end of month we only have a couple hundred that goes towards food, necessities, and spending money. \n\nA few days ago I had an extra $20. I saw a family that had some kids so I gave it to them. My wife kept telling me how amazing I was for it. I thought it was kind of weird how she kept bringing it up but I still appreciated her comments. Btw we have a car but we prefer to walk to work because of how busy the streets are here. \n\nLast night she told me how she helped a lot of homeless people on her way home from work. I told her it was great. While I was making dinner she started asking me how much money do I usually give away. I told her about $125 a month maybe. She continued to bring up how she helped a lot of people. \n\nWhile we were eating she brought it up again. She said \u201cyou said you give about $125 a month right babe?\u201d I nodded because I was chewing still. Next she says \u201cI outran you this week!\u201d I didn\u2019t know wtf she was talking about and I guess she could tell by the look on my face. \n\nLong story short, she said she gave every homeless person she saw some money. When I asked how much she said all of the money in her wallet. I asked how much again. She told me about $200 like it was nothing.\n\nI instantly said what the fuck? She was surprised at my reaction like I would be happy about it. We argued about it. $200 is a lot of money for us. We already payed our rent and utilities but now we only have $100 until April 15th. I told her that she acted senselessly. \n\nShe\u2019s been ignoring me ever since and locked me out of our bedroom last night. I slept on the couch. \n\nNow I\u2019m wondering if I was the asshole for being mad. After all, those people do need it more than us. But I still feel like she shouldn\u2019t have given away that much when we can barely afford it. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for being upset that his wife gave away $200 to homeless people. The couple's financial situation is tight\u2014they make $60k a year, have $1200 in rent, $500 in other bills, and both have student loan payments. At the end of the month, they only have a couple hundred left for food and other expenses.\n\nThe author gives around $125 a month, while his wife gave $200 in a week. He's upset because $200 is a significant portion of their monthly budget. The wife seems proud of her actions, maybe even trying to outdo him, as she mentioned \"outran you this week.\" \n\nFirst, I need to consider the financial aspect. $200 in a week is about $800 a month, which is more than double his contribution. Since their finances are already stretched thin, this could be a problem. The wife didn't consult him before giving away such a large amount, which might indicate a lack of communication about their shared finances. Money is a shared responsibility in a marriage, so both should have a say in major expenses.\n\nOn the other hand, giving to the homeless is a charitable act. The wife might feel strongly about helping others and sees it as a priority. However, the way she did it\u2014without discussing it with her husband\u2014could be an issue. The author's reaction is about the financial strain, not the act of giving itself, but his anger might come off as dismissive of her charitable intentions. \n\nThe wife's comment about \"outrunning\" him suggests a competitive attitude, which isn't healthy. But the core issue is financial management. The author's anger is valid because the $200 was a significant portion of their budget. However, his approach, calling her actions \"senseless\" and reacting strongly, might have been harsh. \n\nIn a relationship, it's important to communicate financial decisions. The wife should have discussed her intentions to give so much money, especially when their funds are tight. The author, on the other hand, could have expressed his concerns more calmly instead of being confrontational. \n\nOverall, the mistake here is on both sides. The wife gave without consulting, and the author reacted poorly. But considering the financial impact, the author's concern is justified. However, the way he handled the situation might not be the best approach. The question is whether he's in the wrong. If the answer is whether he's the asshole, it's a bit of a gray area. But since the user says they think the author is in the wrong, but the actual answer might depend on perspectives.\n"
