We live in Chicago and there\u2019s homeless people on every corner. I (24M) give as many of them whatever I can afford. If I have a lot of change left or loose singles then I\u2019ll give it to one of them. Or I\u2019ll buy them some food when I get some. It all depends. My wife (22F) has always admired that I share with them and has started to do it herself. She\u2019ll sometimes give them her whole lunch or like a ten dollar bill. \n\nAnyways, we collectively make about 60k a year. Next year I\u2019ll be making $100k alone. We pay $1200 in rent and $500 in other bills. We both pay off student loans as well. At the end of month we only have a couple hundred that goes towards food, necessities, and spending money. \n\nA few days ago I had an extra $20. I saw a family that had some kids so I gave it to them. My wife kept telling me how amazing I was for it. I thought it was kind of weird how she kept bringing it up but I still appreciated her comments. Btw we have a car but we prefer to walk to work because of how busy the streets are here. \n\nLast night she told me how she helped a lot of homeless people on her way home from work. I told her it was great. While I was making dinner she started asking me how much money do I usually give away. I told her about $125 a month maybe. She continued to bring up how she helped a lot of people. \n\nWhile we were eating she brought it up again. She said \u201cyou said you give about $125 a month right babe?\u201d I nodded because I was chewing still. Next she says \u201cI outran you this week!\u201d I didn\u2019t know wtf she was talking about and I guess she could tell by the look on my face. \n\nLong story short, she said she gave every homeless person she saw some money. When I asked how much she said all of the money in her wallet. I asked how much again. She told me about $200 like it was nothing.\n\nI instantly said what the fuck? She was surprised at my reaction like I would be happy about it. We argued about it. $200 is a lot of money for us. We already payed our rent and utilities but now we only have $100 until April 15th. I told her that she acted senselessly. \n\nShe\u2019s been ignoring me ever since and locked me out of our bedroom last night. I slept on the couch. \n\nNow I\u2019m wondering if I was the asshole for being mad. After all, those people do need it more than us. But I still feel like she shouldn\u2019t have given away that much when we can barely afford it. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for being upset that his wife gave away $200 to homeless people. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, their financial situation: they make $60k together, with the husband expecting $100k next year. They pay $1200 rent and $500 in other bills, and after paying student loans, they have only a couple hundred left each month for food and other expenses. So $200 is a significant chunk of their monthly budget, especially since they're tight on cash.\n\nThe wife gave away $200 all at once, which the husband found shocking. He gives about $125 a month, so her giving double that in a week is a big jump. The wife was proud of herself and brought it up multiple times, which might have been annoying to him. He felt it was reckless because they can't afford it right now. The wife, on the other hand, might see her actions as compassionate, helping people in need.\n\nNow, considering both sides. The husband has a right to be concerned about their finances. They have bills, loans, and need to budget carefully. Giving away $200 without discussing it with him could be seen as not being considerate of their shared financial responsibilities. But the wife is also inspired by his generosity and is trying to contribute, which is commendable.\n\nThe key points here are communication and financial planning. If they haven't discussed their budget and how much they're willing to spend on donations, then both might be at fault. The wife giving away a large sum without consulting him could be an issue, but the husband's reaction of anger and locking her out might be too harsh. However, given their financial constraints, his concern is valid. It's a matter of balancing compassion with practicality.\n\nIn terms of who's in the wrong, it's a bit of a gray area. The wife's actions might be impulsive without considering their budget, but the husband's reaction could be overly harsh. However, since the question is whether the author (the husband) is in the wrong, I need to assess if his anger is justified. Given their financial situation, it's reasonable for him to be upset about a large unexpected expense. The wife should have discussed it, but the husband's response might have been too strong. Still, the immediate reaction to being angry is understandable. So the answer would be that the author is not in the wrong (B), as his concern for their finances is valid, even if the wife's approach was poor.\n"
