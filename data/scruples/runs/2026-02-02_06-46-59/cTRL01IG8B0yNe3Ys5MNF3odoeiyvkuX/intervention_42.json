We live in Chicago and there\u2019s homeless people on every corner. I (24M) give as many of them whatever I can afford. If I have a lot of change left or loose singles then I\u2019ll give it to one of them. Or I\u2019ll buy them some food when I get some. It all depends. My wife (22F) has always admired that I share with them and has started to do it herself. She\u2019ll sometimes give them her whole lunch or like a ten dollar bill. \n\nAnyways, we collectively make about 60k a year. Next year I\u2019ll be making $100k alone. We pay $1200 in rent and $500 in other bills. We both pay off student loans as well. At the end of month we only have a couple hundred that goes towards food, necessities, and spending money. \n\nA few days ago I had an extra $20. I saw a family that had some kids so I gave it to them. My wife kept telling me how amazing I was for it. I thought it was kind of weird how she kept bringing it up but I still appreciated her comments. Btw we have a car but we prefer to walk to work because of how busy the streets are here. \n\nLast night she told me how she helped a lot of homeless people on her way home from work. I told her it was great. While I was making dinner she started asking me how much money do I usually give away. I told her about $125 a month maybe. She continued to bring up how she helped a lot of people. \n\nWhile we were eating she brought it up again. She said \u201cyou said you give about $125 a month right babe?\u201d I nodded because I was chewing still. Next she says \u201cI outran you this week!\u201d I didn\u2019t know wtf she was talking about and I guess she could tell by the look on my face. \n\nLong story short, she said she gave every homeless person she saw some money. When I asked how much she said all of the money in her wallet. I asked how much again. She told me about $200 like it was nothing.\n\nI instantly said what the fuck? She was surprised at my reaction like I would be happy about it. We argued about it. $200 is a lot of money for us. We already payed our rent and utilities but now we only have $100 until April 15th. I told her that she acted senselessly. \n\nShe\u2019s been ignoring me ever since and locked me out of our bedroom last night. I slept on the couch. \n\nNow I\u2019m wondering if I was the asshole for being mad. After all, those people do need it more than us. But I still feel like she shouldn\u2019t have given away that much when we can barely afford it. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for being upset that his wife gave $200 to homeless people. The post provides context about their finances: they make around $60k combined, with the husband set to earn $100k next year. They pay $1200 in rent and $500 in other bills, and have student loans. At the end of the month, they only have a couple hundred left for food and other needs.\n\nThe key point here is the financial situation. The wife gave $200 all at once, which seems significant given their tight budget. The husband is upset because that money could have been used for their own expenses. The user thinks the author is in the wrong, but I need to evaluate both sides.\n\nFirst, the wife's act of giving is generous, and she's been inspired by her husband's own charitable efforts. However, the issue is the amount. If their budget is already stretched thin, giving away $200 could lead to financial strain. The husband's reaction is about financial responsibility, while the wife sees it as a good deed. \n\nBut is the husband wrong for being upset? Well, it's about differing priorities. The husband sees the $200 as necessary for their budget, while the wife sees it as a moral imperative. It's not about right or wrong, but communication and mutual understanding. The husband's anger might be valid because the money was needed, but his approach could be seen as dismissive of her values. However, the wife should have discussed such a large expenditure beforehand. \n\nGiven their financial constraints, the husband's concern is understandable. The wife's action, while generous, might be impractical given their situation. The husband isn't wrong for being upset because the financial impact is real. However, he could have approached the situation more calmly to discuss it rather than reacting with anger. But the question is whether he's in the wrong. Since he's justified in being concerned about their finances, the answer is B (he's not in the wrong). The wife should have communicated better, but the husband's reaction is based on valid financial concerns.\n"
