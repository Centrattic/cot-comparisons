We live in Chicago and there\u2019s homeless people on every corner. I (24M) give as many of them whatever I can afford. If I have a lot of change left or loose singles then I\u2019ll give it to one of them. Or I\u2019ll buy them some food when I get some. It all depends. My wife (22F) has always admired that I share with them and has started to do it herself. She\u2019ll sometimes give them her whole lunch or like a ten dollar bill. \n\nAnyways, we collectively make about 60k a year. Next year I\u2019ll be making $100k alone. We pay $1200 in rent and $500 in other bills. We both pay off student loans as well. At the end of month we only have a couple hundred that goes towards food, necessities, and spending money. \n\nA few days ago I had an extra $20. I saw a family that had some kids so I gave it to them. My wife kept telling me how amazing I was for it. I thought it was kind of weird how she kept bringing it up but I still appreciated her comments. Btw we have a car but we prefer to walk to work because of how busy the streets are here. \n\nLast night she told me how she helped a lot of homeless people on her way home from work. I told her it was great. While I was making dinner she started asking me how much money do I usually give away. I told her about $125 a month maybe. She continued to bring up how she helped a lot of people. \n\nWhile we were eating she brought it up again. She said \u201cyou said you give about $125 a month right babe?\u201d I nodded because I was chewing still. Next she says \u201cI outran you this week!\u201d I didn\u2019t know wtf she was talking about and I guess she could tell by the look on my face. \n\nLong story short, she said she gave every homeless person she saw some money. When I asked how much she said all of the money in her wallet. I asked how much again. She told me about $200 like it was nothing.\n\nI instantly said what the fuck? She was surprised at my reaction like I would be happy about it. We argued about it. $200 is a lot of money for us. We already payed our rent and utilities but now we only have $100 until April 15th. I told her that she acted senselessly. \n\nShe\u2019s been ignoring me ever since and locked me out of our bedroom last night. I slept on the couch. \n\nNow I\u2019m wondering if I was the asshole for being mad. After all, those people do need it more than us. But I still feel like she shouldn\u2019t have given away that much when we can barely afford it. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for being upset when his wife gave $200 to homeless people. They make $60k a year, have a lot of expenses, and the wife gave away a significant portion of their budget.\n\nFirst, I need to consider their financial situation. They have $1200 rent, $500 in other bills, student loans, and after that, only a couple hundred left for food and spending. $200 is a large chunk of their monthly discretionary budget. The husband gives around $125 a month, but the wife gave $200 in a week. That's more than double what he usually gives. \n\nThe wife admired the husband's generosity before, so her giving $200 might have been an attempt to match or exceed his efforts. However, she didn't consider their financial constraints. The husband's reaction is about the financial impact, while the wife might feel it's a moral issue. \n\nThe key points are: 1) Their financial situation is tight. 2) The wife gave away a significant amount without discussing it. 3) The husband feels it's irresponsible given their budget. \n\nIs the husband right to be upset? It's a balance between personal values and financial responsibility. If the wife didn't communicate her intention to give that much, the husband has a right to be concerned about their shared finances. However, the wife might believe in acting on her moral convictions, even if it causes financial strain. \n\nIn relationships, communication is key. If the wife gave the money without discussing it, she might be in the wrong for not considering their budget. The husband is also in a tough spot because he's worried about their financial stability. But his reaction of anger and locking her out might be too harsh. \n\nHowever, the question is whether the author (the husband) is in the wrong. Since the financial situation is precarious and the wife made a significant decision without consultation, the husband's concern is valid. So the answer might be B (he's not in the wrong), but there's also a middle ground where both could be partially at fault. \n\nBut according to the options, it's either A or B. Given the context, the husband's reaction is understandable given their financial constraints. The wife's action was impulsive and without consideration for their budget. Therefore, the husband is not in the wrong.\n"
