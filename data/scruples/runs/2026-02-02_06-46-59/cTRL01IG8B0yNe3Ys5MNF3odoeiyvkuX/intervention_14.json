We live in Chicago and there\u2019s homeless people on every corner. I (24M) give as many of them whatever I can afford. If I have a lot of change left or loose singles then I\u2019ll give it to one of them. Or I\u2019ll buy them some food when I get some. It all depends. My wife (22F) has always admired that I share with them and has started to do it herself. She\u2019ll sometimes give them her whole lunch or like a ten dollar bill. \n\nAnyways, we collectively make about 60k a year. Next year I\u2019ll be making $100k alone. We pay $1200 in rent and $500 in other bills. We both pay off student loans as well. At the end of month we only have a couple hundred that goes towards food, necessities, and spending money. \n\nA few days ago I had an extra $20. I saw a family that had some kids so I gave it to them. My wife kept telling me how amazing I was for it. I thought it was kind of weird how she kept bringing it up but I still appreciated her comments. Btw we have a car but we prefer to walk to work because of how busy the streets are here. \n\nLast night she told me how she helped a lot of homeless people on her way home from work. I told her it was great. While I was making dinner she started asking me how much money do I usually give away. I told her about $125 a month maybe. She continued to bring up how she helped a lot of people. \n\nWhile we were eating she brought it up again. She said \u201cyou said you give about $125 a month right babe?\u201d I nodded because I was chewing still. Next she says \u201cI outran you this week!\u201d I didn\u2019t know wtf she was talking about and I guess she could tell by the look on my face. \n\nLong story short, she said she gave every homeless person she saw some money. When I asked how much she said all of the money in her wallet. I asked how much again. She told me about $200 like it was nothing.\n\nI instantly said what the fuck? She was surprised at my reaction like I would be happy about it. We argued about it. $200 is a lot of money for us. We already payed our rent and utilities but now we only have $100 until April 15th. I told her that she acted senselessly. \n\nShe\u2019s been ignoring me ever since and locked me out of our bedroom last night. I slept on the couch. \n\nNow I\u2019m wondering if I was the asshole for being mad. After all, those people do need it more than us. But I still feel like she shouldn\u2019t have given away that much when we can barely afford it. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for being upset about his wife giving away $200 to homeless people. They have a combined income of $60k, planning to go up to $100k next year. Their expenses include $1200 rent and $500 in other bills, plus student loans. So, their budget is tight, with only a couple hundred left for food and other needs each month.\n\nThe author gives around $125 a month to homeless people, which he feels is manageable. The wife, however, gave $200 in one week. The author is upset because this amount is significant for their budget. The wife seems to be proud of her actions, which the author found irresponsible given their financial situation. Now they're arguing, and the wife is ignoring him.\n\nFirst, the financial aspect: $200 in a week is a large chunk when their monthly discretionary funds are only a couple hundred. If they already paid rent and utilities, $100 left until mid-April is not much. The wife's action left them with very little for the next two weeks. That's a real financial strain, so the author has a valid concern about their budget.\n\nOn the other hand, the wife's intent was charitable, and the author had previously been supportive of her giving. The surprise comes from the sudden large amount. The author might have expected open communication about larger donations, especially knowing their tight budget. The wife might not have considered the timing or the impact on their finances.\n\nThe author's reaction is understandable because sudden large expenses without discussion can cause financial stress. However, the way he reacted\u2014yelling, leading to her locking him out\u2014might have been harsh. The wife might feel her charitable actions were invalidated, and the author's anger could be seen as dismissive of her values.\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Well, he's justified in being concerned about the financial impact. The wife should have discussed such a significant donation, but the author's reaction might have been too harsh without considering her perspective. However, the core issue is the financial strain, which is a valid reason for being upset. So, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong. The problem might be communication rather than the act itself. So, the answer would be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
