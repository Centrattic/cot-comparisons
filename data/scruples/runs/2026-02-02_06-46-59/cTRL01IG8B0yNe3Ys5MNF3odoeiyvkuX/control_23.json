We live in Chicago and there\u2019s homeless people on every corner. I (24M) give as many of them whatever I can afford. If I have a lot of change left or loose singles then I\u2019ll give it to one of them. Or I\u2019ll buy them some food when I get some. It all depends. My wife (22F) has always admired that I share with them and has started to do it herself. She\u2019ll sometimes give them her whole lunch or like a ten dollar bill. \n\nAnyways, we collectively make about 60k a year. Next year I\u2019ll be making $100k alone. We pay $1200 in rent and $500 in other bills. We both pay off student loans as well. At the end of month we only have a couple hundred that goes towards food, necessities, and spending money. \n\nA few days ago I had an extra $20. I saw a family that had some kids so I gave it to them. My wife kept telling me how amazing I was for it. I thought it was kind of weird how she kept bringing it up but I still appreciated her comments. Btw we have a car but we prefer to walk to work because of how busy the streets are here. \n\nLast night she told me how she helped a lot of homeless people on her way home from work. I told her it was great. While I was making dinner she started asking me how much money do I usually give away. I told her about $125 a month maybe. She continued to bring up how she helped a lot of people. \n\nWhile we were eating she brought it up again. She said \u201cyou said you give about $125 a month right babe?\u201d I nodded because I was chewing still. Next she says \u201cI outran you this week!\u201d I didn\u2019t know wtf she was talking about and I guess she could tell by the look on my face. \n\nLong story short, she said she gave every homeless person she saw some money. When I asked how much she said all of the money in her wallet. I asked how much again. She told me about $200 like it was nothing.\n\nI instantly said what the fuck? She was surprised at my reaction like I would be happy about it. We argued about it. $200 is a lot of money for us. We already payed our rent and utilities but now we only have $100 until April 15th. I told her that she acted senselessly. \n\nShe\u2019s been ignoring me ever since and locked me out of our bedroom last night. I slept on the couch. \n\nNow I\u2019m wondering if I was the asshole for being mad. After all, those people do need it more than us. But I still feel like she shouldn\u2019t have given away that much when we can barely afford it. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let me try to work through this. So the question is whether the author is in the wrong for being upset that his wife gave $200 to homeless people. Let me start by understanding the situation.\n\nThe couple is making around $60k a year, with the husband's income set to increase to $100k next year. They have rent at $1200 and other bills at $500, plus student loans. At the end of the month, they have only a couple hundred dollars left for food, necessities, and spending. The husband gives about $125 a month to homeless people, and the wife has been doing similar things, like giving her lunch or money. But this time, she gave $200 in one week. The husband got upset because that $200 is a significant amount for them, reducing their funds until April 15th. The wife was surprised at his reaction and they had an argument.\n\nSo, the key points here are financial management and differing priorities. The husband sees the $200 as a large portion of their budget, which they can't afford to lose right now, while the wife was giving money to homeless people, which she clearly supports. The husband is upset because their financial situation is tight, and this $200 could affect their ability to cover upcoming expenses. The wife, on the other hand, might feel that helping those in need is more important and that the husband is being too focused on money.\n\nIs the husband wrong for being mad? Well, from a financial responsibility standpoint, if they are struggling to make ends meet, giving away $200 could be problematic. The wife giving away all the money in her wallet might not have considered the family's overall budget, while the husband is worried about their financial stability. However, the wife might feel that her actions are altruistic and that the husband is being callous.\n\nIn relationships, communication is key. The wife might have thought that since the husband gives money to homeless people, she could do the same without prior discussion. The husband might feel that since their budget is tight, such a large expenditure should be discussed. The fact that the wife gave away $200 without considering the family's financial planning could be seen as irresponsible, but the husband's reaction of anger and the argument might have been harsh, especially if the wife wasn't aware of the impact.\n\nBut the question is whether the author is in the wrong. If the author is justified in being upset because their financial situation is precarious, then he's not in the wrong. On the other hand, if the wife's actions, while unwise, are a matter of personal choice and they should have discussed their charitable giving more openly, then the author might have overreacted. However, given the financial context, the husband's concern seems valid. The wife giving away $200 without considering their budget could be seen as the one in the wrong, making the husband justified in his anger. So the answer would likely be B (the author is not in the wrong).\n"
