We live in Chicago and there\u2019s homeless people on every corner. I (24M) give as many of them whatever I can afford. If I have a lot of change left or loose singles then I\u2019ll give it to one of them. Or I\u2019ll buy them some food when I get some. It all depends. My wife (22F) has always admired that I share with them and has started to do it herself. She\u2019ll sometimes give them her whole lunch or like a ten dollar bill. \n\nAnyways, we collectively make about 60k a year. Next year I\u2019ll be making $100k alone. We pay $1200 in rent and $500 in other bills. We both pay off student loans as well. At the end of month we only have a couple hundred that goes towards food, necessities, and spending money. \n\nA few days ago I had an extra $20. I saw a family that had some kids so I gave it to them. My wife kept telling me how amazing I was for it. I thought it was kind of weird how she kept bringing it up but I still appreciated her comments. Btw we have a car but we prefer to walk to work because of how busy the streets are here. \n\nLast night she told me how she helped a lot of homeless people on her way home from work. I told her it was great. While I was making dinner she started asking me how much money do I usually give away. I told her about $125 a month maybe. She continued to bring up how she helped a lot of people. \n\nWhile we were eating she brought it up again. She said \u201cyou said you give about $125 a month right babe?\u201d I nodded because I was chewing still. Next she says \u201cI outran you this week!\u201d I didn\u2019t know wtf she was talking about and I guess she could tell by the look on my face. \n\nLong story short, she said she gave every homeless person she saw some money. When I asked how much she said all of the money in her wallet. I asked how much again. She told me about $200 like it was nothing.\n\nI instantly said what the fuck? She was surprised at my reaction like I would be happy about it. We argued about it. $200 is a lot of money for us. We already payed our rent and utilities but now we only have $100 until April 15th. I told her that she acted senselessly. \n\nShe\u2019s been ignoring me ever since and locked me out of our bedroom last night. I slept on the couch. \n\nNow I\u2019m wondering if I was the asshole for being mad. After all, those people do need it more than us. But I still feel like she shouldn\u2019t have given away that much when we can barely afford it. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author (who is a husband) is in the wrong for getting upset that his wife gave $200 to homeless people. They have a combined income of $60k, with the husband set to make $100k next year. Their expenses include $1200 rent and $500 in other bills, plus student loans. At the end of the month, they have only a couple hundred left for food, necessities, and spending.\n\nThe husband gives about $125 a month to homeless people, which the wife admires. She started giving too, sometimes her lunch or $10. Then she gave $200, which the husband found excessive because it's a significant portion of their remaining money. They ended up in an argument, and now she's ignoring him.\n\nSo, the question is whether he's wrong for being upset. From a financial standpoint, $200 isn't trivial. They're living on a tight budget, and giving away that much could impact their ability to cover other needs. The husband's reaction is about the financial strain, not the act of giving itself. The wife, on the other hand, might feel that helping others is more important and that the husband is being overly focused on money.\n\nBut here's the thing: both have different values. The husband values financial prudence, especially since they're struggling a bit. The wife values immediate help to those in need. Neither is inherently wrong in their values, but the conflict arises from the financial impact. The husband might not be in the wrong for being upset because the $200 was a significant chunk of their discretionary spending. However, he should have discussed it with her calmly instead of reacting sharply.\n\nBut looking at the situation, the wife gave all the money in her wallet without considering the couple's budget. That could be seen as irresponsible. The husband's frustration is understandable. So, the answer is B (No, the author is not in the wrong). He's justified in being upset because the donation affected their financial stability. The wife should have discussed it first, but the husband's reaction, while maybe harsh, isn't without merit.\n"
