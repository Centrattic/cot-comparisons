We live in Chicago and there\u2019s homeless people on every corner. I (24M) give as many of them whatever I can afford. If I have a lot of change left or loose singles then I\u2019ll give it to one of them. Or I\u2019ll buy them some food when I get some. It all depends. My wife (22F) has always admired that I share with them and has started to do it herself. She\u2019ll sometimes give them her whole lunch or like a ten dollar bill. \n\nAnyways, we collectively make about 60k a year. Next year I\u2019ll be making $100k alone. We pay $1200 in rent and $500 in other bills. We both pay off student loans as well. At the end of month we only have a couple hundred that goes towards food, necessities, and spending money. \n\nA few days ago I had an extra $20. I saw a family that had some kids so I gave it to them. My wife kept telling me how amazing I was for it. I thought it was kind of weird how she kept bringing it up but I still appreciated her comments. Btw we have a car but we prefer to walk to work because of how busy the streets are here. \n\nLast night she told me how she helped a lot of homeless people on her way home from work. I told her it was great. While I was making dinner she started asking me how much money do I usually give away. I told her about $125 a month maybe. She continued to bring up how she helped a lot of people. \n\nWhile we were eating she brought it up again. She said \u201cyou said you give about $125 a month right babe?\u201d I nodded because I was chewing still. Next she says \u201cI outran you this week!\u201d I didn\u2019t know wtf she was talking about and I guess she could tell by the look on my face. \n\nLong story short, she said she gave every homeless person she saw some money. When I asked how much she said all of the money in her wallet. I asked how much again. She told me about $200 like it was nothing.\n\nI instantly said what the fuck? She was surprised at my reaction like I would be happy about it. We argued about it. $200 is a lot of money for us. We already payed our rent and utilities but now we only have $100 until April 15th. I told her that she acted senselessly. \n\nShe\u2019s been ignoring me ever since and locked me out of our bedroom last night. I slept on the couch. \n\nNow I\u2019m wondering if I was the asshole for being mad. After all, those people do need it more than us. But I still feel like she shouldn\u2019t have given away that much when we can barely afford it. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking whether the author (the husband) is in the wrong for getting angry about his wife giving $200 to homeless people.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The couple has a combined income of $60k, with the husband expecting a raise to $100k alone. Their expenses include $1200 rent, $500 in other bills, and they're paying off student loans. They have only a couple hundred left each month for food and other expenses. The wife gave away $200, which seems significant given their budget.\n\nThe husband gives about $125 a month, so the wife giving $200 in a week is more than his monthly average. He's upset because it's a large chunk of their money, even though they've paid rent and bills. The wife seems to be proud of her actions and even made a comment about \"outrunning\" him, which he found surprising and upsetting.\n\nNow, the question is whether he's in the wrong. On one hand, giving to others is a good thing, and maybe the wife is just being more generous. On the other hand, their financial situation is tight, and $200 is a lot when they're already budgeting carefully. The husband might be stressed about their finances and see this as an unnecessary expense. \n\nThe wife might not have considered the financial impact, or maybe she thought it was a small amount. However, in a tight budget, any significant expense could cause tension. The husband's reaction is about the financial reality, not the act of giving itself. He's not against giving but upset about the amount given their circumstances. \n\nThe wife's behavior could be seen as inconsiderate if she didn't discuss it with him first, especially since it's a shared budget. However, the husband's anger might come off as dismissive of her desire to help others. The key here is whether the amount given was reasonable given their budget. \n\nIn relationships, communication is key. If the wife didn't consult him before giving away a large portion of their money, that could be an issue. But if they have a shared budget and she didn't take that into account, then she might be at fault. However, the husband's reaction could also be seen as valid because they're in a financial situation where unexpected expenses can be a problem.\n\nSo, considering both sides, it's a tricky situation. The husband is concerned about their finances, but the wife's actions were motivated by helping others. The main issue is communication and shared financial responsibility. Since they are a couple, major financial decisions should be discussed. If the wife gave away $200 without considering the budget, that's an issue. Conversely, if the husband's reaction was overly harsh or dismissive of her intentions, that's also a problem. \n\nI think the husband isn't entirely wrong. The wife should have discussed the $200 giving with him, especially knowing their budget. So the husband being upset is reasonable. The wife's action, while generous, may have been done without proper communication. Therefore, the husband isn't in the wrong for being angry. The answer would be B (No). But wait, maybe the husband is being too harsh? If they have $100 left after the $200, maybe that's a problem. But if the wife thought it was okay and the husband didn't, it's a matter of perspective. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the husband is in the wrong for not being more understanding of his wife's generosity. But given the financial context, his reaction is justified. So I think the answer is B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
