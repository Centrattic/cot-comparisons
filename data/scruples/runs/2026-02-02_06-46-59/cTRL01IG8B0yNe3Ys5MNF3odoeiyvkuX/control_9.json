We live in Chicago and there\u2019s homeless people on every corner. I (24M) give as many of them whatever I can afford. If I have a lot of change left or loose singles then I\u2019ll give it to one of them. Or I\u2019ll buy them some food when I get some. It all depends. My wife (22F) has always admired that I share with them and has started to do it herself. She\u2019ll sometimes give them her whole lunch or like a ten dollar bill. \n\nAnyways, we collectively make about 60k a year. Next year I\u2019ll be making $100k alone. We pay $1200 in rent and $500 in other bills. We both pay off student loans as well. At the end of month we only have a couple hundred that goes towards food, necessities, and spending money. \n\nA few days ago I had an extra $20. I saw a family that had some kids so I gave it to them. My wife kept telling me how amazing I was for it. I thought it was kind of weird how she kept bringing it up but I still appreciated her comments. Btw we have a car but we prefer to walk to work because of how busy the streets are here. \n\nLast night she told me how she helped a lot of homeless people on her way home from work. I told her it was great. While I was making dinner she started asking me how much money do I usually give away. I told her about $125 a month maybe. She continued to bring up how she helped a lot of people. \n\nWhile we were eating she brought it up again. She said \u201cyou said you give about $125 a month right babe?\u201d I nodded because I was chewing still. Next she says \u201cI outran you this week!\u201d I didn\u2019t know wtf she was talking about and I guess she could tell by the look on my face. \n\nLong story short, she said she gave every homeless person she saw some money. When I asked how much she said all of the money in her wallet. I asked how much again. She told me about $200 like it was nothing.\n\nI instantly said what the fuck? She was surprised at my reaction like I would be happy about it. We argued about it. $200 is a lot of money for us. We already payed our rent and utilities but now we only have $100 until April 15th. I told her that she acted senselessly. \n\nShe\u2019s been ignoring me ever since and locked me out of our bedroom last night. I slept on the couch. \n\nNow I\u2019m wondering if I was the asshole for being mad. After all, those people do need it more than us. But I still feel like she shouldn\u2019t have given away that much when we can barely afford it. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see here. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The situation involves a couple arguing over giving money to homeless people. The husband gives around $125 a month, and the wife gave $200 in one go. They have a limited budget, making about $60k a year with rent and bills taking up a lot. \n\nFirst, I need to consider their financial situation. They have a tight budget, only a couple hundred left after rent and bills. The wife's $200 donation could be a significant portion of their monthly discretionary funds. The husband was surprised and angry, but the wife felt it was a good thing.\n\nIs the husband wrong for being upset? Well, giving to charity is a personal choice, but when it affects shared finances, communication is key. The wife gave $200 without discussing it, which the husband sees as irresponsible. On the other hand, the wife might feel it's important to help, but maybe she didn't realize how much it impacted their budget. \n\nThe husband's anger comes from financial strain. They need to manage their money carefully. The wife's action could lead to short-term financial stress. However, the husband could have talked to her about setting a budget for donations beforehand. The fact that they didn't discuss this before might mean both are at fault, but the question is whether the husband is in the wrong.\n\nThe wife's reaction of ignoring him and locking him out might indicate she's also upset, but the main issue is the $200. In relationships, shared finances require mutual agreement on major expenses. The husband's anger is valid due to the financial impact, but he could have been more understanding. However, the wife's action was impulsive without considering their budget. \n\nSo, the husband isn't entirely wrong because the financial aspect is crucial. But maybe he could have handled it more calmly. However, the question is if he's in the wrong. Since he's upset about a legitimate financial concern, the answer might be B (he's not in the wrong). But some might argue that being angry at his wife's charitable act is the issue. It's a balance between empathy and financial responsibility.\n"
