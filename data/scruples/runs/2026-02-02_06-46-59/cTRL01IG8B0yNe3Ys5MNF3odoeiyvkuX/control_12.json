We live in Chicago and there\u2019s homeless people on every corner. I (24M) give as many of them whatever I can afford. If I have a lot of change left or loose singles then I\u2019ll give it to one of them. Or I\u2019ll buy them some food when I get some. It all depends. My wife (22F) has always admired that I share with them and has started to do it herself. She\u2019ll sometimes give them her whole lunch or like a ten dollar bill. \n\nAnyways, we collectively make about 60k a year. Next year I\u2019ll be making $100k alone. We pay $1200 in rent and $500 in other bills. We both pay off student loans as well. At the end of month we only have a couple hundred that goes towards food, necessities, and spending money. \n\nA few days ago I had an extra $20. I saw a family that had some kids so I gave it to them. My wife kept telling me how amazing I was for it. I thought it was kind of weird how she kept bringing it up but I still appreciated her comments. Btw we have a car but we prefer to walk to work because of how busy the streets are here. \n\nLast night she told me how she helped a lot of homeless people on her way home from work. I told her it was great. While I was making dinner she started asking me how much money do I usually give away. I told her about $125 a month maybe. She continued to bring up how she helped a lot of people. \n\nWhile we were eating she brought it up again. She said \u201cyou said you give about $125 a month right babe?\u201d I nodded because I was chewing still. Next she says \u201cI outran you this week!\u201d I didn\u2019t know wtf she was talking about and I guess she could tell by the look on my face. \n\nLong story short, she said she gave every homeless person she saw some money. When I asked how much she said all of the money in her wallet. I asked how much again. She told me about $200 like it was nothing.\n\nI instantly said what the fuck? She was surprised at my reaction like I would be happy about it. We argued about it. $200 is a lot of money for us. We already payed our rent and utilities but now we only have $100 until April 15th. I told her that she acted senselessly. \n\nShe\u2019s been ignoring me ever since and locked me out of our bedroom last night. I slept on the couch. \n\nNow I\u2019m wondering if I was the asshole for being mad. After all, those people do need it more than us. But I still feel like she shouldn\u2019t have given away that much when we can barely afford it. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author (the husband) is in the wrong after getting upset that his wife gave away $200 to homeless people. They make around $60k a year together, with the husband set to earn $100k next year. Their expenses include $1200 rent and $500 in other bills, plus student loans. So, at the end of the month, they have a couple hundred left for food and other needs.\n\nThe wife has been giving money to homeless people occasionally, sometimes her whole lunch or $10. The husband usually gives about $125 a month. But this time, the wife gave all the money in her wallet, which was $200. The husband got angry because they had already paid rent and utilities, and now they only have $100 left until the next paycheck. The wife was surprised by his reaction, thinking he'd be happy. They argued, and the wife locked him out of the bedroom.\n\nSo, the question is whether he's in the wrong. On one hand, giving to the homeless is a kind act. On the other, the couple is on a tight budget. The wife gave a significant portion of their remaining money without discussing it. The husband's reaction is based on financial strain. Do couples have a responsibility to discuss major expenses, even if they're charitable? The wife might feel passionate about helping, but if they can't afford it, it's a problem. The husband's anger could be seen as valid concern for their financial stability, but maybe he could have handled it better. The wife locking him out might be an overreaction too. So, the husband isn't necessarily in the wrong because they need to budget, but maybe he should have communicated more. However, the main issue is whether he was wrong to be upset. Since they can't afford that much, and the wife made a large decision without consulting him, the husband's reaction is understandable. The answer is B (No).\n"
