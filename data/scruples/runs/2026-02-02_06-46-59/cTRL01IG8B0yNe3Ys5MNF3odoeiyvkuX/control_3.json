We live in Chicago and there\u2019s homeless people on every corner. I (24M) give as many of them whatever I can afford. If I have a lot of change left or loose singles then I\u2019ll give it to one of them. Or I\u2019ll buy them some food when I get some. It all depends. My wife (22F) has always admired that I share with them and has started to do it herself. She\u2019ll sometimes give them her whole lunch or like a ten dollar bill. \n\nAnyways, we collectively make about 60k a year. Next year I\u2019ll be making $100k alone. We pay $1200 in rent and $500 in other bills. We both pay off student loans as well. At the end of month we only have a couple hundred that goes towards food, necessities, and spending money. \n\nA few days ago I had an extra $20. I saw a family that had some kids so I gave it to them. My wife kept telling me how amazing I was for it. I thought it was kind of weird how she kept bringing it up but I still appreciated her comments. Btw we have a car but we prefer to walk to work because of how busy the streets are here. \n\nLast night she told me how she helped a lot of homeless people on her way home from work. I told her it was great. While I was making dinner she started asking me how much money do I usually give away. I told her about $125 a month maybe. She continued to bring up how she helped a lot of people. \n\nWhile we were eating she brought it up again. She said \u201cyou said you give about $125 a month right babe?\u201d I nodded because I was chewing still. Next she says \u201cI outran you this week!\u201d I didn\u2019t know wtf she was talking about and I guess she could tell by the look on my face. \n\nLong story short, she said she gave every homeless person she saw some money. When I asked how much she said all of the money in her wallet. I asked how much again. She told me about $200 like it was nothing.\n\nI instantly said what the fuck? She was surprised at my reaction like I would be happy about it. We argued about it. $200 is a lot of money for us. We already payed our rent and utilities but now we only have $100 until April 15th. I told her that she acted senselessly. \n\nShe\u2019s been ignoring me ever since and locked me out of our bedroom last night. I slept on the couch. \n\nNow I\u2019m wondering if I was the asshole for being mad. After all, those people do need it more than us. But I still feel like she shouldn\u2019t have given away that much when we can barely afford it. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for being upset that his wife gave $200 to homeless people. The couple's total income is $60k, with rent and bills taking up $1700 a month. They have a tight budget, only a few hundred left after bills for food and other expenses. The author gives about $125 a month, while the wife gave $200 in one week. He's upset because that's a significant portion of their remaining money.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both perspectives. The wife is giving to help others, which is a kind and generous act. She's even emulated the author's behavior, so maybe she feels it's important. However, the author is concerned about their financial situation. They can't afford to give that much without affecting their basic needs. \n\nFinancial decisions in a relationship often require communication and mutual agreement. The wife gave away the money without discussing it, which could be seen as not considering the couple's shared finances. On the other hand, the author's reaction was anger and making a scene, which might be harsh. \n\nThe key points here are financial responsibility vs. generosity. The author's frustration is valid because $200 is a big chunk of their monthly budget. But the wife's intention to help is also commendable. However, the main issue is whether the wife should have discussed the donation with her husband first. In a partnership, major financial decisions should be mutual. \n\nThe author's anger might stem from feeling that the wife didn't consider their shared financial constraints. While the wife might feel her actions were justified, the sudden large expenditure without prior discussion could be seen as irresponsible. \n\nTherefore, the wife might have acted impulsively, and the author's reaction, while strong, is rooted in financial concern. The right approach would be for both to communicate better about their spending habits. The author isn't entirely in the wrong because financial planning is crucial. But he could have handled the situation more calmly. However, the primary question is whether he's in the wrong. Since the wife's action was unilaterally spending a significant amount, the author's concern is valid. So, the answer would be B (No, he's not in the wrong), but with the nuance that both could improve communication.\n"
