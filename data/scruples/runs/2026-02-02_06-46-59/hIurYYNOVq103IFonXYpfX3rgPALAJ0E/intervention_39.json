We basically went a few months with no contact, until she contacted me, saying she was a few months pregnant and needed my support. I was floored. We'd barely spoken since the breakup, and I was clear as day about the fact that I NEVER wanted kids. \n\nThis was one of the worst things that could conceivably happen to me. She suggested getting back together, which I shut down right out of the gate. I explained that we were through months ago, and that I don't want to be a father, and hung up. She is dead set on keeping it, there have been tests, and the kid is mine, though I dont know how the fuck it happened, since we were fairly strict with contraceptives.\n\nI have a new GF, and we've just moved to a great new apartment. This phonecall literally shook me to my core, and I am freaking out like crazy. I've been searching for every possible way out, and I heard of a financial abortion, or whatever its called. Basically I want to resign any rights and responsibilities for the kid, since I never wanted him/her to begin with. I refuse to pay out the ass for a kid I don't want, and I obviously won't and can't force the mother to get rid of the baby, or give it up for adoption.\n\nHer friends have called me, saying that I really hurt her by refusing to acknowledge this kid, and calling me selfish and whatnot, but I can't handle all that stuff right now, or ever probably. Am I the asshole for wanting a \"financial abortion\", that is, no contact, no child support, no custody, and is it morally and legally okay???\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. Let me start by breaking down the situation.\n\nThe author was in a relationship that ended a few months before. During that time, they were using contraception, but the girl got pregnant. Now, she wants to get back together, but the author doesn't want to be a father and has a new girlfriend. The author is considering a \"financial abortion,\" meaning he doesn't want any responsibility or contact with the child. The mother's friends are calling him selfish, and he's asking if he's in the wrong.\n\nFirst, I need to look at the legal aspects. In many places, once a child is born, the father typically has legal responsibilities, including child support, even if he doesn't want to be involved. There might be ways to contest paternity if there's doubt, but the author mentioned tests confirming it's his. If paternity is established, he can't just walk away legally. Legally, he might be in trouble if he refuses support.\n\nMorally, it's more complicated. People have different views on this. The author was clear about not wanting kids, but the fact that they were using contraception might not absolve him. The mother also made decisions here, including continuing the pregnancy. But some might argue that the father shares responsibility regardless. On the other hand, the author could be seen as abandoning a child he didn't want, which is hurtful.\n\nThe author's situation is stressful, especially with a new girlfriend and a new home. But his stance is to completely cut off all contact and responsibilities. That's where the conflict arises. Legally, he might not have a choice. Morally, some might say he's being selfish, while others might empathize with his situation.\n\nThe key points are: legal obligations exist once paternity is established. Morally, it's a gray area. The author's argument is that he never wanted the child and doesn't want responsibility. The mother's side is that he abandoned them. The friends' disapproval adds social pressure.\n\nI need to decide if he's in the wrong. Legally, he's likely obligated to provide support. Morally, it's more subjective. If the question is about being an asshole, the community might consider selfishness as the issue. However, the author's stance is firm. So, considering both legal and moral aspects, the answer might be A (he's in the wrong) because he's refusing responsibilities he's legally bound to fulfill, regardless of his feelings.\n"
