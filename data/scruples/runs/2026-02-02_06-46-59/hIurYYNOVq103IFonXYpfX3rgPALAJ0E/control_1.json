We basically went a few months with no contact, until she contacted me, saying she was a few months pregnant and needed my support. I was floored. We'd barely spoken since the breakup, and I was clear as day about the fact that I NEVER wanted kids. \n\nThis was one of the worst things that could conceivably happen to me. She suggested getting back together, which I shut down right out of the gate. I explained that we were through months ago, and that I don't want to be a father, and hung up. She is dead set on keeping it, there have been tests, and the kid is mine, though I dont know how the fuck it happened, since we were fairly strict with contraceptives.\n\nI have a new GF, and we've just moved to a great new apartment. This phonecall literally shook me to my core, and I am freaking out like crazy. I've been searching for every possible way out, and I heard of a financial abortion, or whatever its called. Basically I want to resign any rights and responsibilities for the kid, since I never wanted him/her to begin with. I refuse to pay out the ass for a kid I don't want, and I obviously won't and can't force the mother to get rid of the baby, or give it up for adoption.\n\nHer friends have called me, saying that I really hurt her by refusing to acknowledge this kid, and calling me selfish and whatnot, but I can't handle all that stuff right now, or ever probably. Am I the asshole for wanting a \"financial abortion\", that is, no contact, no child support, no custody, and is it morally and legally okay???\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of the AITA post is in the wrong for wanting a financial abortion. The key points here are the author's stance on not wanting any responsibility for the child, not paying child support, and cutting off contact.\n\nFirst, I need to consider legal aspects. In many places, fathers are legally obligated to provide child support once paternity is established. The author might not be able to legally opt out of that responsibility. So from a legal standpoint, they could be wrong in thinking they can just resign all rights. But the question is more about moral responsibility.\n\nMorally, this is tricky. The author didn't want kids and made that clear, but the pregnancy happened. They broke up months before, so the ex-girlfriend might have had the opportunity to address this earlier. However, the author is now in a new relationship and doesn't want to be involved. On one hand, they might be seen as abandoning responsibility, which is selfish. On the other, they might argue they were clear about their stance on children.\n\nThe ex's friends call the author selfish, which adds to the moral judgment. But society often places the responsibility on the father, even if the child wasn't planned. The author's desire for no contact or support could be seen as neglecting a duty, especially if the child is theirs biologically. However, if they didn't consent to parenthood, there's an argument for personal autonomy.\n\nI should also consider the context of the breakup. The author ended things months prior, so the ex reaching out after a prolonged period might have different implications. But the fact remains that the child is theirs, and the author can't completely disentangle themselves from responsibility once paternity is established.\n\nIn many legal systems, you can't simply disavow paternity if it's established. The author would likely have to pay child support, even if they don't want contact. So their desire for a \"financial abortion\" might not be legally feasible, but the question is about being in the wrong morally. If they refuse to pay, they might be considered in the wrong because society expects fathers to support their children, regardless of their initial intentions.\n\nSo balancing these factors, the author might be seen as selfish and in the wrong for not taking responsibility, even if they didn't want the child. Therefore, the answer is likely A (the author is in the wrong).\n"
