We basically went a few months with no contact, until she contacted me, saying she was a few months pregnant and needed my support. I was floored. We'd barely spoken since the breakup, and I was clear as day about the fact that I NEVER wanted kids. \n\nThis was one of the worst things that could conceivably happen to me. She suggested getting back together, which I shut down right out of the gate. I explained that we were through months ago, and that I don't want to be a father, and hung up. She is dead set on keeping it, there have been tests, and the kid is mine, though I dont know how the fuck it happened, since we were fairly strict with contraceptives.\n\nI have a new GF, and we've just moved to a great new apartment. This phonecall literally shook me to my core, and I am freaking out like crazy. I've been searching for every possible way out, and I heard of a financial abortion, or whatever its called. Basically I want to resign any rights and responsibilities for the kid, since I never wanted him/her to begin with. I refuse to pay out the ass for a kid I don't want, and I obviously won't and can't force the mother to get rid of the baby, or give it up for adoption.\n\nHer friends have called me, saying that I really hurt her by refusing to acknowledge this kid, and calling me selfish and whatnot, but I can't handle all that stuff right now, or ever probably. Am I the asshole for wanting a \"financial abortion\", that is, no contact, no child support, no custody, and is it morally and legally okay???\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that he was in a relationship, they broke up, and she ended up pregnant. He made it clear he didn't want kids, they didn't talk for months, and then she contacts him saying she's pregnant. He wants to cut off all financial and parental responsibilities, and he's being called selfish.\n\nFirst, I need to think about the legal aspects. In many places, even if someone doesn't want to be a parent, once they know they're the father, they have legal obligations. So if he refuses child support, he could face legal consequences. But maybe there's a way to legally disown the child? I'm not sure. I think in some cases, if the parent doesn't establish a relationship with the child, maybe they can petition to be relieved of support, but it's complicated and varies by location. So legally, he might not have a clear path to avoid support.\n\nEthically, it's tricky. He didn't want kids, and the mother is keeping the baby. He's not the one who chose to have the child, but he is the biological father. Some people might argue that he has a responsibility, while others might say that if he didn't want to be a parent and was clear about that, he shouldn't be forced to support someone else's child. But then again, the child isn't at fault, so maybe he should share in their support. However, the mother is the one who chose to keep the baby, so maybe she should bear the primary responsibility. \n\nAlso, communication is key. They were in a relationship, and even though they broke up, both had a role in the pregnancy. If they were using contraception but it failed, maybe both are at fault. He might feel like it's unfair to be held responsible when his stance was clear from the start. On the other hand, she might have thought there was a chance he'd change his mind or that they'd reconcile. \n\nThe current GF's situation is another angle. He's moved on and is in a new place with her. Adding financial responsibility for another child might strain their new life together. That's a practical concern. But is it his fault that this happened? He might not be in the wrong if he had made his intentions clear and tried to avoid the situation. \n\nThe mother's friends are calling him an asshole. That's emotional pressure, but does that mean he's actually in the wrong? People might have different moral views. Some might see him as selfish for not supporting the child, others might see him as standing by his word about not wanting kids. \n\nIn terms of the \"financial abortion\" concept, that's not a legal term. Legally, disclaiming paternity might be possible in some jurisdictions if certain conditions are met, but it's rare. Usually, once paternity is established, you can't just walk away from the responsibilities. So he might be legally obligated to pay child support, regardless of his feelings. \n\nSo, putting it all together: Legally, he's probably in the wrong because he can't just disown the child financially. Ethically, it's more nuanced. If he was clear about not wanting kids and the mother chose to keep the baby, he might not be morally at fault, but societal expectations often lean towards the father having some responsibility. However, since he wasn't involved in the decision to keep the baby, some might argue it's unfair. \n\nBut the question is whether he's in the wrong. The answer would depend on the legal context, but since the question is more about moral wrong, it's a bit of a toss-up. However, the community on AITA (Am I the Asshole) often leans towards saying someone is the asshole if they're avoiding responsibility, especially towards a child. So maybe the answer is A, the author is in the wrong because he's refusing to take responsibility for the child, regardless of his personal desires.\n"
