We basically went a few months with no contact, until she contacted me, saying she was a few months pregnant and needed my support. I was floored. We'd barely spoken since the breakup, and I was clear as day about the fact that I NEVER wanted kids. \n\nThis was one of the worst things that could conceivably happen to me. She suggested getting back together, which I shut down right out of the gate. I explained that we were through months ago, and that I don't want to be a father, and hung up. She is dead set on keeping it, there have been tests, and the kid is mine, though I dont know how the fuck it happened, since we were fairly strict with contraceptives.\n\nI have a new GF, and we've just moved to a great new apartment. This phonecall literally shook me to my core, and I am freaking out like crazy. I've been searching for every possible way out, and I heard of a financial abortion, or whatever its called. Basically I want to resign any rights and responsibilities for the kid, since I never wanted him/her to begin with. I refuse to pay out the ass for a kid I don't want, and I obviously won't and can't force the mother to get rid of the baby, or give it up for adoption.\n\nHer friends have called me, saying that I really hurt her by refusing to acknowledge this kid, and calling me selfish and whatnot, but I can't handle all that stuff right now, or ever probably. Am I the asshole for wanting a \"financial abortion\", that is, no contact, no child support, no custody, and is it morally and legally okay???\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's start by understanding the situation. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong for wanting a \"financial abortion,\" which they define as resigning any rights and responsibilities for the child, not paying child support, and having no contact or custody.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspects. In many jurisdictions, once a paternity is established, the legal father is typically required to provide child support. However, there are exceptions. For example, if the father can prove that the pregnancy was non-consensual or that the mother misrepresented her intentions (like claiming pregnancy when there's no proof), he might be able to avoid support. But in this case, the father states that the mother later confirmed the child is his after they had not been in contact for months. Contraceptives were used, but they failed. So legally, the father might be obligated to pay support unless he can contest paternity, but since tests have confirmed the child is his, that's a hurdle.\n\nNext, the moral aspect. The user is in a new relationship and is dealing with significant personal distress. He doesn't want children and feels this is the worst possible scenario. His stance is that he won't provide financial support or any involvement in the child's life. Morally, this is a gray area. Some might argue that a child's well-being is paramount and that the father has a responsibility, even if he didn't plan for it. Others might empathize with his feelings of being caught off guard and not wanting to be a father. However, the mother is determined to keep the child, and the father's refusal to support could leave her in a difficult position.\n\nThe mother's side: She ended the relationship, then reconnected after a long silence to inform him of the pregnancy. The father feels blindsided. The mother's friends are criticizing him for being selfish. But from the father's perspective, he was clear about not wanting children, and the mother might have known that. However, since they were in a relationship, there's an expectation of responsibility, even if the relationship ended. The mother's actions might be seen as taking advantage, but it's also a real-life situation where the mother is now facing a pregnancy and seeks support.\n\nEthically, there's a debate about whether a person can be excused from responsibility for a child they didn't plan to have. Some argue that once a child exists, the father has a duty to support it, regardless of initial intentions. Others might say that the mother has a responsibility to consider the father's wishes, but once the child is born, the father's role becomes more complex.\n\nLegally, the father's options might be limited. Even if he doesn't want contact, child support laws are often strict. He might not be able to \"resign\" all rights; the court might still require support. However, if there's a legal process to disestablish paternity (like if the mother misrepresented the father's paternity), that could be a possibility, but the scenario states that tests have confirmed he's the father.\n\nIn terms of the mother's friends calling him selfish, that's subjective. From their perspective, they might see him as avoiding responsibility, but he's also in a position where he's not equipped to be a father. The mother's friends' judgment might not consider his personal boundaries and stress.\n\nIn summary, the father's position is legally complicated because he might be obligated to pay child support. Morally, there's no clear answer\u2014it's a matter of personal ethics and societal values. The mother's actions could be seen as using the pregnancy as a means to reconnect, but she's also in a vulnerable situation. The father's refusal to support the child could be seen as neglectful, but he's also reacting to a situation he didn't anticipate. The answer hinges on whether one prioritizes the child's needs over the father's rights and the legal obligations that come with paternity.\n"
