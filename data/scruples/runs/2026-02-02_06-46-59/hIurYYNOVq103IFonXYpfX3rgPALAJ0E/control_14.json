We basically went a few months with no contact, until she contacted me, saying she was a few months pregnant and needed my support. I was floored. We'd barely spoken since the breakup, and I was clear as day about the fact that I NEVER wanted kids. \n\nThis was one of the worst things that could conceivably happen to me. She suggested getting back together, which I shut down right out of the gate. I explained that we were through months ago, and that I don't want to be a father, and hung up. She is dead set on keeping it, there have been tests, and the kid is mine, though I dont know how the fuck it happened, since we were fairly strict with contraceptives.\n\nI have a new GF, and we've just moved to a great new apartment. This phonecall literally shook me to my core, and I am freaking out like crazy. I've been searching for every possible way out, and I heard of a financial abortion, or whatever its called. Basically I want to resign any rights and responsibilities for the kid, since I never wanted him/her to begin with. I refuse to pay out the ass for a kid I don't want, and I obviously won't and can't force the mother to get rid of the baby, or give it up for adoption.\n\nHer friends have called me, saying that I really hurt her by refusing to acknowledge this kid, and calling me selfish and whatnot, but I can't handle all that stuff right now, or ever probably. Am I the asshole for wanting a \"financial abortion\", that is, no contact, no child support, no custody, and is it morally and legally okay???\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong. The situation is about a guy who had a previous relationship that ended, then found out his ex is pregnant. He never wanted kids, the relationship was over, and now he's dealing with this unexpected situation. He's considering a financial abortion, which means he wants to cut off all responsibility.\n\nFirst, I need to think about the legal aspects. In most places, fathers are legally obligated to provide child support, even if they don't want to be involved. So if he disclaims paternity, there might be legal hurdles. But if DNA tests confirm he's the father, he might not be able to avoid responsibility. Legally, he's probably on shaky ground if he wants to walk away completely.\n\nMorally, it's a tough call. He's clear he never wanted kids and the relationship is over. But having a child is a big responsibility. Even if he doesn't want to be a parent, the child has a right to financial support. The mother is keeping the child, so the father's obligation exists regardless of his feelings. His new partner and their new apartment might add stress, but that doesn't negate his responsibilities. He might feel like he's being selfish for not wanting to pay, but others, like his ex's friends, call him selfish, which adds social pressure.\n\nHe's also facing emotional turmoil. The breakup was months ago, and communication ceased. The sudden news of pregnancy is traumatic for him. He's trying to protect his current relationship and stability. But the mother wants to keep the child, so forcing an abortion isn't an option, which he already acknowledges.\n\nSo, from a legal standpoint, he's likely wrong to avoid responsibility. Morally, it's debatable. While he has his reasons, the child's needs and the mother's rights come into play. In many societies, the father's duty is seen as inherent once paternity is established. Therefore, the author is in the wrong because he can't legally and ethically avoid supporting his child. But maybe there's a nuance if he can disclaim paternity legally, but usually, once confirmed, he's stuck with the responsibility. So the answer is A.\n"
