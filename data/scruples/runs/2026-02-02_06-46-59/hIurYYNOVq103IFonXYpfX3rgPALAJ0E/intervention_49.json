We basically went a few months with no contact, until she contacted me, saying she was a few months pregnant and needed my support. I was floored. We'd barely spoken since the breakup, and I was clear as day about the fact that I NEVER wanted kids. \n\nThis was one of the worst things that could conceivably happen to me. She suggested getting back together, which I shut down right out of the gate. I explained that we were through months ago, and that I don't want to be a father, and hung up. She is dead set on keeping it, there have been tests, and the kid is mine, though I dont know how the fuck it happened, since we were fairly strict with contraceptives.\n\nI have a new GF, and we've just moved to a great new apartment. This phonecall literally shook me to my core, and I am freaking out like crazy. I've been searching for every possible way out, and I heard of a financial abortion, or whatever its called. Basically I want to resign any rights and responsibilities for the kid, since I never wanted him/her to begin with. I refuse to pay out the ass for a kid I don't want, and I obviously won't and can't force the mother to get rid of the baby, or give it up for adoption.\n\nHer friends have called me, saying that I really hurt her by refusing to acknowledge this kid, and calling me selfish and whatnot, but I can't handle all that stuff right now, or ever probably. Am I the asshole for wanting a \"financial abortion\", that is, no contact, no child support, no custody, and is it morally and legally okay???\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that he was in a relationship that turned into a breakup, and then the ex contacted him saying she's pregnant. He didn't want kids and made that clear, and now he's considering a \"financial abortion\" by not providing child support or any contact.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspects. In many places, fathers have legal responsibilities towards their children, including child support, regardless of whether they wanted the child or not. So, if the author is in a country where this is the case, he might not have a legal option to opt out. But maybe there are exceptions, like if he can prove the child isn't his or if he can establish that he's not financially responsible. But the mother mentioned tests confirming paternity, so that's probably not a way out.\n\nThen there's the moral side. He argues that he never wanted a child and didn't plan for it, so he doesn't want to be involved. But from a moral standpoint, some might argue that as a father, he has a responsibility to his child. Even if the relationship is over, the child is a part of both parents. However, others might say that the mother is the primary caregiver and should handle the responsibility if the father is unwilling. But I'm not sure if that's a valid moral stance. It might depend on cultural or personal beliefs.\n\nThe author's new relationship and living situation are mentioned, but that doesn't seem to affect the core issue of his responsibility. The ex's friends call him selfish, which adds a social pressure element. But is selfishness a moral failing here? If he's being selfish by not supporting a child he helped create, then maybe he is wrong. But if he's prioritizing his own well-being and life plans, there's a counterargument.\n\nAlso, the fact that they were using contraception but it failed complicates things. Neither party might have expected the pregnancy. However, responsibility is often placed on both parents. If he's the biological father, he might still be expected to contribute financially, regardless of his personal desires.\n\nLooking at possible legal options: in some jurisdictions, there might be a way to terminate parental rights, but that's usually a court process and not something the father can unilaterally decide. The mother would have to agree, or the court would need to see that it's in the child's best interest. If the mother wants to keep the child, the father can't just walk away legally. So, the author might be in the wrong if he tries to avoid legal obligations.\n\nMoral responsibility is trickier. Some people might say that he has a duty to his child, even if it's not ideal. Others might argue that he's not at fault for the situation and that the mother should take responsibility since she chose to carry the baby to term. But if the mother had the option of abortion or adoption and chose not to, maybe the father's hands are tied. However, he's still biologically connected and might be legally bound to provide support.\n\nSo, considering all these factors, the author might be in the wrong legally because he may be required to pay child support. Morally, it's a gray area. If society expects fathers to support their children regardless of the circumstances, he's in the wrong. If the moral responsibility is on the mother who chose to keep the child, he might not be. However, most legal systems and many moral frameworks would hold the father accountable. Therefore, the answer might lean towards A (he's in the wrong).\n"
