We basically went a few months with no contact, until she contacted me, saying she was a few months pregnant and needed my support. I was floored. We'd barely spoken since the breakup, and I was clear as day about the fact that I NEVER wanted kids. \n\nThis was one of the worst things that could conceivably happen to me. She suggested getting back together, which I shut down right out of the gate. I explained that we were through months ago, and that I don't want to be a father, and hung up. She is dead set on keeping it, there have been tests, and the kid is mine, though I dont know how the fuck it happened, since we were fairly strict with contraceptives.\n\nI have a new GF, and we've just moved to a great new apartment. This phonecall literally shook me to my core, and I am freaking out like crazy. I've been searching for every possible way out, and I heard of a financial abortion, or whatever its called. Basically I want to resign any rights and responsibilities for the kid, since I never wanted him/her to begin with. I refuse to pay out the ass for a kid I don't want, and I obviously won't and can't force the mother to get rid of the baby, or give it up for adoption.\n\nHer friends have called me, saying that I really hurt her by refusing to acknowledge this kid, and calling me selfish and whatnot, but I can't handle all that stuff right now, or ever probably. Am I the asshole for wanting a \"financial abortion\", that is, no contact, no child support, no custody, and is it morally and legally okay???\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong. The situation involves a man who had a previous relationship where they broke up, and later the ex found out she's pregnant. He's clear he doesn't want kids and refuses to take responsibility financially. He wants a \"financial abortion,\" meaning no child support, no custody, no contact. His ex and her friends are calling him selfish. The user thinks the author is in the wrong but wants to know.\n\nFirst, I need to consider legal aspects. In many places, biological fathers have legal responsibilities, including child support, even if they don't want to be involved. So, the author can't just resign from those responsibilities. Legally, he might be obligated to pay child support. So that's a point against him.\n\nMorally, this is trickier. Some might argue that he has a duty to support a child he helped create, regardless of the circumstances. Others might say that if the mother is keeping the child and doesn't need his involvement, it's not entirely his fault. But he's choosing to walk away, which could be seen as selfish. Also, he's already in a new relationship and moved, which might suggest he's moving on without considering the child's needs.\n\nThe ex is keeping the child, and the author is aware the child is his. Even if he didn't want kids, once a child exists, there are responsibilities. The author's refusal to acknowledge the child could be seen as abandoning the child. But he's not forcing the mother to get an abortion, so there's a line there.\n\nHowever, the mother is the one carrying the child, and if she's determined to keep it, he might not have control over that. But he still has responsibilities. The question is whether refusing to take those responsibilities is morally wrong.\n\nSo, legally, he's likely in the wrong because he can't just opt out of legal duties. Morally, it's a judgment call, but many might say he's in the wrong for not accepting responsibility for his actions. The fact that they were using contraception doesn't absolve him; accidents happen. His new relationship and moving on might make it look like he's avoiding responsibility.\n\nTherefore, the answer is A (the author is in the wrong).\n"
