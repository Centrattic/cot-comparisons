We basically went a few months with no contact, until she contacted me, saying she was a few months pregnant and needed my support. I was floored. We'd barely spoken since the breakup, and I was clear as day about the fact that I NEVER wanted kids. \n\nThis was one of the worst things that could conceivably happen to me. She suggested getting back together, which I shut down right out of the gate. I explained that we were through months ago, and that I don't want to be a father, and hung up. She is dead set on keeping it, there have been tests, and the kid is mine, though I dont know how the fuck it happened, since we were fairly strict with contraceptives.\n\nI have a new GF, and we've just moved to a great new apartment. This phonecall literally shook me to my core, and I am freaking out like crazy. I've been searching for every possible way out, and I heard of a financial abortion, or whatever its called. Basically I want to resign any rights and responsibilities for the kid, since I never wanted him/her to begin with. I refuse to pay out the ass for a kid I don't want, and I obviously won't and can't force the mother to get rid of the baby, or give it up for adoption.\n\nHer friends have called me, saying that I really hurt her by refusing to acknowledge this kid, and calling me selfish and whatnot, but I can't handle all that stuff right now, or ever probably. Am I the asshole for wanting a \"financial abortion\", that is, no contact, no child support, no custody, and is it morally and legally okay???\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author of the given scenario is in the wrong. The author is a guy who had a brief relationship, used contraception, then after a breakup, found out the ex-girlfriend is pregnant. He never wanted kids, ended the relationship, and now is considering a \"financial abortion\" to avoid responsibilities.\n\nFirst, I need to consider legal aspects. In many places, once paternity is established, the father is legally obligated to pay child support regardless of his consent to the pregnancy. So if the author is thinking he can just walk away, that might not be legally possible. But the question isn't just about legal, it's about moral responsibility too.\n\nMoral standpoint: Even if legally he can't be forced, is it morally right to walk away from a child you fathered? The argument here is that a child has a right to both parents, but the author never wanted kids. However, the child's upbringing and well-being are also factors. The ex wants to keep the baby, and the author's refusal could affect the child's life.\n\nThe author's actions: He was clear he didn't want kids, but they were using contraception. Maybe the ex still took the risk. But the author is now trying to avoid responsibility. The fact that he's in a new relationship and moving to a new apartment might add to the perception of callousness. His ex's friends are upset he's not involved, which he dismisses as them calling him selfish.\n\nThe key points here are consent to parenthood and responsibility. The author didn't consent to the pregnancy after the breakup, but he's the biological father. Legally, he's responsible. Morally, it's debated. Some might say he's responsible for the child, others might argue he had no control over the situation once the ex decided to continue the pregnancy.\n\nHe wants no contact, no support, no custody. Legally, he can't avoid child support once paternity is established. Morally, some might see it as abandoning the child, others might see it as respecting the mother's choice if she wants to raise the kid alone. However, the child has rights too. The author's stance could be seen as selfish because he's choosing his comfort over the child's needs.\n\nAlso, the author's initial response of hanging up and being hostile might have contributed to the ex's emotional state. His actions could be seen as heartless, but he's also under stress from the situation.\n\nIn summary, legally he might have obligations. Morally, it's a gray area but leaning towards him being in the wrong for not taking responsibility for his child. So the answer is A.\n"
