We basically went a few months with no contact, until she contacted me, saying she was a few months pregnant and needed my support. I was floored. We'd barely spoken since the breakup, and I was clear as day about the fact that I NEVER wanted kids. \n\nThis was one of the worst things that could conceivably happen to me. She suggested getting back together, which I shut down right out of the gate. I explained that we were through months ago, and that I don't want to be a father, and hung up. She is dead set on keeping it, there have been tests, and the kid is mine, though I dont know how the fuck it happened, since we were fairly strict with contraceptives.\n\nI have a new GF, and we've just moved to a great new apartment. This phonecall literally shook me to my core, and I am freaking out like crazy. I've been searching for every possible way out, and I heard of a financial abortion, or whatever its called. Basically I want to resign any rights and responsibilities for the kid, since I never wanted him/her to begin with. I refuse to pay out the ass for a kid I don't want, and I obviously won't and can't force the mother to get rid of the baby, or give it up for adoption.\n\nHer friends have called me, saying that I really hurt her by refusing to acknowledge this kid, and calling me selfish and whatnot, but I can't handle all that stuff right now, or ever probably. Am I the asshole for wanting a \"financial abortion\", that is, no contact, no child support, no custody, and is it morally and legally okay???\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA question is in the wrong. The situation involves a breakup, an unexpected pregnancy, and the man wanting to disengage financially and emotionally.\n\nFirst, the key points: They broke up months ago, the woman got pregnant, and she's now trying to get back together. The man is clear he doesn't want kids, and he's refusing to take responsibility for child support or any involvement. He's looking for a \"financial abortion,\" which I think refers to legally disclaiming paternity or avoiding child support.\n\nNow, considering responsibility: In many jurisdictions, biological fathers can be held responsible for child support if they're established as the legal father. Even if they didn't want the child, once paternity is established, they might have legal obligations. So the man's refusal could be legally challenging, but maybe there are ways to dispute paternity if he's not the biological father? Wait, the user mentioned tests confirmed the kid is his. So paternity is established. That makes it harder for him to disclaim responsibility.\n\nMorally, people have different views. Some might say that by contributing to the pregnancy, he has a moral obligation regardless of his wishes. Others might argue that if he didn't consent to being a parent, he shouldn't have to take on the responsibilities. But legally, it's more about the child's rights and the mother's rights.\n\nThe mother's friends are calling him selfish, which is a moral judgment. Selfishness is about putting one's own interests above others. If the child is his, the argument is that he's avoiding responsibility for someone else's well-being. But he's also dealing with his own stress and new relationship.\n\nLegally, in many places, a man can't just disclaim paternity once it's established. The court may require child support for the child's benefit. So, his desire to avoid financial support might not be legally feasible. Morally, it's a gray area. Some might see it as him walking away from a responsibility he helped create, others might understand his stance given his clear previous statements about not wanting kids.\n\nThe user thinks the author is in the wrong. The question is whether he is. Considering legal and moral aspects, the answer might be A (in the wrong), especially if he has legal obligations. But if the law allows him to disengage, maybe not. However, since the tests confirm paternity, legal responsibility is likely. So he might be in the wrong morally and legally. But the answer options are A or B. The user is asking for a verdict based on the scenario.\n"
