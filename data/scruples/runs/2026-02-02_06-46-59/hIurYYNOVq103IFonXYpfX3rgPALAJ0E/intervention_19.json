We basically went a few months with no contact, until she contacted me, saying she was a few months pregnant and needed my support. I was floored. We'd barely spoken since the breakup, and I was clear as day about the fact that I NEVER wanted kids. \n\nThis was one of the worst things that could conceivably happen to me. She suggested getting back together, which I shut down right out of the gate. I explained that we were through months ago, and that I don't want to be a father, and hung up. She is dead set on keeping it, there have been tests, and the kid is mine, though I dont know how the fuck it happened, since we were fairly strict with contraceptives.\n\nI have a new GF, and we've just moved to a great new apartment. This phonecall literally shook me to my core, and I am freaking out like crazy. I've been searching for every possible way out, and I heard of a financial abortion, or whatever its called. Basically I want to resign any rights and responsibilities for the kid, since I never wanted him/her to begin with. I refuse to pay out the ass for a kid I don't want, and I obviously won't and can't force the mother to get rid of the baby, or give it up for adoption.\n\nHer friends have called me, saying that I really hurt her by refusing to acknowledge this kid, and calling me selfish and whatnot, but I can't handle all that stuff right now, or ever probably. Am I the asshole for wanting a \"financial abortion\", that is, no contact, no child support, no custody, and is it morally and legally okay???\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is that the person dated a girl, they broke up, and then after some time, she comes back saying she's pregnant. The author was clear they don't want kids and the relationship ended. Now she wants to keep the baby and is asking for support. The author is considering a \"financial abortion,\" which I think means not taking any financial responsibility for the child.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspects. In many places, if you're the biological father, you're legally responsible for child support, even if you don't want to be involved. So trying to disavow all responsibility might not be possible legally. The author might not be able to opt out of child support if they're the father, unless there's some legal process to terminate parental rights, which is usually complicated and not just by saying they don't want to be involved.\n\nMorally, this is trickier. The author was in a relationship and the pregnancy happened. Even if they were using contraception, sometimes it fails. The question is whether the author is responsible for the child's well-being. The mother is keeping the baby, so the father's responsibility is a big part of the equation. The author is saying they don't want to be a father, but if they are the biological parent, they might have a moral obligation to help support the child. However, the author is also in a new relationship and their life has changed, so maybe they feel overwhelmed.\n\nBut then there's the other side: the author was clear about not wanting kids, and the breakup happened months before the pregnancy. The mother might have known about his stance on kids at the time. Still, once the child is born, the legal and moral responsibilities usually apply. The author's refusal to take any part could be seen as selfish because it's the child's right to have support from both parents. The friends calling him selfish might have a point, but the author is also in a tough spot.\n\nSo putting it all together, legally he's probably not allowed to just walk away. Morally, it's a gray area. But the question is whether he's in the wrong. Since the user thinks he is in the wrong, I need to see if that's justified. The author is not wrong in every aspect, but in terms of parental responsibility, he is. So maybe the answer is A (Yes, he's in the wrong) because he's trying to avoid a responsibility that he might legally and morally have.\n"
