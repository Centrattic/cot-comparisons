We basically went a few months with no contact, until she contacted me, saying she was a few months pregnant and needed my support. I was floored. We'd barely spoken since the breakup, and I was clear as day about the fact that I NEVER wanted kids. \n\nThis was one of the worst things that could conceivably happen to me. She suggested getting back together, which I shut down right out of the gate. I explained that we were through months ago, and that I don't want to be a father, and hung up. She is dead set on keeping it, there have been tests, and the kid is mine, though I dont know how the fuck it happened, since we were fairly strict with contraceptives.\n\nI have a new GF, and we've just moved to a great new apartment. This phonecall literally shook me to my core, and I am freaking out like crazy. I've been searching for every possible way out, and I heard of a financial abortion, or whatever its called. Basically I want to resign any rights and responsibilities for the kid, since I never wanted him/her to begin with. I refuse to pay out the ass for a kid I don't want, and I obviously won't and can't force the mother to get rid of the baby, or give it up for adoption.\n\nHer friends have called me, saying that I really hurt her by refusing to acknowledge this kid, and calling me selfish and whatnot, but I can't handle all that stuff right now, or ever probably. Am I the asshole for wanting a \"financial abortion\", that is, no contact, no child support, no custody, and is it morally and legally okay???\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for wanting a \"financial abortion,\" meaning he doesn't want any responsibility for the child. \n\nFirst, I need to consider legal aspects. In many places, once paternity is established, the father is legally required to provide financial support for the child. Even if he doesn't want to be involved, the law might say he has to pay child support. So, from a legal standpoint, the author might not have a choice in that area.\n\nMoral standpoint is trickier. The author was clear he didn't want kids, and the breakup had been months ago. The mother ended up pregnant and wants to keep the baby. The author feels shocked and is in a new relationship now. He's arguing that he doesn't want to be a father and can't take responsibility. But from a moral perspective, some might say that since the child is his, he has a responsibility to support it, even if he doesn't want to be involved. Others might argue that he was clear about his stance, and the mother should have considered that before continuing the pregnancy.\n\nAlso, the mother's friends are calling him selfish. That's a social judgment. But does that mean he's in the wrong? Maybe not. He's not forcing the mother to keep the baby; he's just stating his position. However, by not providing support, he's not helping the child, which some might see as neglectful regardless of the circumstances.\n\nThe situation is complicated. Legally, he might have no choice but to pay. Morally, it's a matter of personal ethics\u2014some would say he's responsible because he's the father, others might sympathize with his lack of desire to be a parent. The key points are communication (he made his stance clear), the unexpected pregnancy after a breakup, and his current situation with a new partner. \n\nI think the answer might be that he's in the wrong because, despite his initial clear stance, once a child is born, there are responsibilities. However, legally he might not have a say, but morally, some might argue he should support the child. So the answer could be A (the author is in the wrong), but I'm a bit conflicted. The user's own opinion was that the author is in the wrong, so maybe they lean that way too.\n"
