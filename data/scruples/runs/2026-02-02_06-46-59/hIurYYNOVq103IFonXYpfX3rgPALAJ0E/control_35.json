We basically went a few months with no contact, until she contacted me, saying she was a few months pregnant and needed my support. I was floored. We'd barely spoken since the breakup, and I was clear as day about the fact that I NEVER wanted kids. \n\nThis was one of the worst things that could conceivably happen to me. She suggested getting back together, which I shut down right out of the gate. I explained that we were through months ago, and that I don't want to be a father, and hung up. She is dead set on keeping it, there have been tests, and the kid is mine, though I dont know how the fuck it happened, since we were fairly strict with contraceptives.\n\nI have a new GF, and we've just moved to a great new apartment. This phonecall literally shook me to my core, and I am freaking out like crazy. I've been searching for every possible way out, and I heard of a financial abortion, or whatever its called. Basically I want to resign any rights and responsibilities for the kid, since I never wanted him/her to begin with. I refuse to pay out the ass for a kid I don't want, and I obviously won't and can't force the mother to get rid of the baby, or give it up for adoption.\n\nHer friends have called me, saying that I really hurt her by refusing to acknowledge this kid, and calling me selfish and whatnot, but I can't handle all that stuff right now, or ever probably. Am I the asshole for wanting a \"financial abortion\", that is, no contact, no child support, no custody, and is it morally and legally okay???\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking whether the person in the situation is in the wrong for wanting a \"financial abortion,\" meaning not taking any responsibility for the child. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspects. In most places, if a man is determined to be the legal father of a child, he's typically required to provide financial support. Even if he didn't want the child, once paternity is established, there's a legal obligation for child support. So the author might not be able to completely avoid that legally.\n\nThen there's the moral angle. The question is about whether he's being selfish. He never wanted kids, which he was clear about with the previous partner. However, the fact that they were using contraception but it still happened might be a point. But even so, once a child is born, there's a responsibility. The author is in a new relationship and has a new life, so he's probably under stress. His new girlfriend might support him, but morally, some might argue that he has a duty to the child regardless of his feelings towards the mother or the circumstances.\n\nAlso, the mother's perspective is important. She's going through a difficult situation and wants support. The author cutting off all contact could be seen as abandoning the mother and child, which could be hurtful. The friends calling him selfish might be biased, but there's a point where the child's needs come into play. The child has a right to financial support from both parents.\n\nOn the other hand, the author didn't want a child and was explicit about that. The pregnancy happened despite precautions, which is unfortunate. He's dealing with the fallout of a past relationship that didn't end well. The key here is whether not taking responsibility is morally right. Some might argue that he's not at fault because he was clear about his stance on children, but others would say that once a child is involved, responsibility is necessary regardless of the circumstances.\n\nLegally, he might not have a choice but to pay child support. So his desire for a \"financial abortion\" might not be feasible. Morally, it's a gray area. It's possible to sympathize with his position while still believing he has a responsibility. However, the consensus in many societies is that parents have obligations to their children, even if the circumstances were unplanned. Therefore, the author might be seen as in the wrong for avoiding those responsibilities.\n"
