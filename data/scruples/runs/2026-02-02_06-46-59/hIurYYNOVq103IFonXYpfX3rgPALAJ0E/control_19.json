We basically went a few months with no contact, until she contacted me, saying she was a few months pregnant and needed my support. I was floored. We'd barely spoken since the breakup, and I was clear as day about the fact that I NEVER wanted kids. \n\nThis was one of the worst things that could conceivably happen to me. She suggested getting back together, which I shut down right out of the gate. I explained that we were through months ago, and that I don't want to be a father, and hung up. She is dead set on keeping it, there have been tests, and the kid is mine, though I dont know how the fuck it happened, since we were fairly strict with contraceptives.\n\nI have a new GF, and we've just moved to a great new apartment. This phonecall literally shook me to my core, and I am freaking out like crazy. I've been searching for every possible way out, and I heard of a financial abortion, or whatever its called. Basically I want to resign any rights and responsibilities for the kid, since I never wanted him/her to begin with. I refuse to pay out the ass for a kid I don't want, and I obviously won't and can't force the mother to get rid of the baby, or give it up for adoption.\n\nHer friends have called me, saying that I really hurt her by refusing to acknowledge this kid, and calling me selfish and whatnot, but I can't handle all that stuff right now, or ever probably. Am I the asshole for wanting a \"financial abortion\", that is, no contact, no child support, no custody, and is it morally and legally okay???\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let me try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the \"AITA\" (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong.\n\nFirst, let me break down the situation. The author dated a girl for a few months, and it seemed like it could be long-term. They broke up and had no contact for months. Then the girl contacted him, saying she's pregnant and wants his support. He doesn't want kids, was clear about that, and they were using contraception. He refuses to get back together, denies paternity responsibilities, and wants a \"financial abortion\" \u2014 meaning no child support, no contact, no custody. The mother's friends are calling him selfish, and he's asking if he's the asshole.\n\nNow, I need to consider legal and moral aspects. Legally, in many places, fathers are required to provide financial support for their children regardless of whether they want the child or not. So if the paternity is confirmed, he might be legally obligated to pay child support. He can't just renounce his responsibilities. Morally, people might have different views. Some might see him as a coward for not taking responsibility, while others might sympathize if he was clear about not wanting children and the pregnancy was unexpected.\n\nBut here's the thing: even if the author didn't want children, once a child is born, legal responsibilities often come into play. The term \"financial abortion\" isn't a legal term; it's more about disclaiming paternity voluntarily. However, if the child is his, legally he might not be able to avoid responsibility. If the mother sues for child support, he could be forced to pay. So from a legal standpoint, he's not in the right if he's trying to avoid the responsibility.\n\nMorally, some would argue that once a child is born, the father has a duty. Others might argue that the mother should have been more careful with birth control, but that's a different angle. The key point here is that the author is trying to avoid responsibility that comes with parenthood, which many people would see as selfish or irresponsible. The fact that he had no contact and then the mother became pregnant despite precautions (but they were using contraception) adds complexity.\n\nThe mother's friends calling him selfish might be valid from a societal perspective, as people often expect fathers to step up. The author's new relationship and new apartment might also be seen as trying to move on without accountability. So combining legal obligations and moral expectations, the author is likely in the wrong. Answer A.\n"
