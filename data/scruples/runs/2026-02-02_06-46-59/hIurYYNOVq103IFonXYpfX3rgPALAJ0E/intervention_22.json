We basically went a few months with no contact, until she contacted me, saying she was a few months pregnant and needed my support. I was floored. We'd barely spoken since the breakup, and I was clear as day about the fact that I NEVER wanted kids. \n\nThis was one of the worst things that could conceivably happen to me. She suggested getting back together, which I shut down right out of the gate. I explained that we were through months ago, and that I don't want to be a father, and hung up. She is dead set on keeping it, there have been tests, and the kid is mine, though I dont know how the fuck it happened, since we were fairly strict with contraceptives.\n\nI have a new GF, and we've just moved to a great new apartment. This phonecall literally shook me to my core, and I am freaking out like crazy. I've been searching for every possible way out, and I heard of a financial abortion, or whatever its called. Basically I want to resign any rights and responsibilities for the kid, since I never wanted him/her to begin with. I refuse to pay out the ass for a kid I don't want, and I obviously won't and can't force the mother to get rid of the baby, or give it up for adoption.\n\nHer friends have called me, saying that I really hurt her by refusing to acknowledge this kid, and calling me selfish and whatnot, but I can't handle all that stuff right now, or ever probably. Am I the asshole for wanting a \"financial abortion\", that is, no contact, no child support, no custody, and is it morally and legally okay???\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for wanting to avoid financial responsibility for a child they didn't want. The situation is that the author was in a relationship, broke up, didn't have contact for months, then the ex contacts them saying she's pregnant. The author made their stance clear about not wanting kids, refuses to get back together, and now wants to avoid any financial obligations.\n\nFirst, I need to consider legal aspects. In many places, once paternity is established, fathers are legally obligated to pay child support. The author can't just \"resign\" their rights unless the mother agrees and the court approves. So legally, they might not have a choice. But the user is asking about moral/ethical wrong, not just legal.\n\nMorally, the author's stance seems harsh. Even if they didn't want kids, they are part of the child's biological makeup. Denying support could affect the child's well-being. However, the author is also in a new relationship and their new life is disrupted. The mother's friends are calling the author selfish, which adds to the conflict.\n\nThe author didn't use protection? They said they were \"fairly strict\" with contraceptives, but maybe there was a mistake. Fault isn't clear here. The mother could have considered adoption or termination, but she chose to carry the baby. Now the father is being asked to support the child.\n\nBut is it the author's fault? They made their intentions clear. The mother might have known his stance. However, once a child is born, the legal and moral responsibilities kick in regardless of initial intentions. So the author might not be at fault for their stance, but in terms of ethical responsibility, maybe they are. The question is whether wanting to avoid all responsibility is wrong.\n\nLegally, they might have no choice but to pay. Morally, some might argue that they have a duty to support the child they helped create. Others might see it as unfair if the father had no say in the matter. The author's main argument is that they didn't want the child and are being forced into parenthood. But the mother chose to carry the child. It's a tough call. \n\nConsidering societal norms, many would expect the father to take some responsibility. So maybe the author is in the wrong morally. But legally, it's a different story. The user's question is about being in the wrong, so likely the answer is A, yes, the author is in the wrong because they can't just avoid responsibility for a child they helped create, regardless of their initial wishes.\n"
