We basically went a few months with no contact, until she contacted me, saying she was a few months pregnant and needed my support. I was floored. We'd barely spoken since the breakup, and I was clear as day about the fact that I NEVER wanted kids. \n\nThis was one of the worst things that could conceivably happen to me. She suggested getting back together, which I shut down right out of the gate. I explained that we were through months ago, and that I don't want to be a father, and hung up. She is dead set on keeping it, there have been tests, and the kid is mine, though I dont know how the fuck it happened, since we were fairly strict with contraceptives.\n\nI have a new GF, and we've just moved to a great new apartment. This phonecall literally shook me to my core, and I am freaking out like crazy. I've been searching for every possible way out, and I heard of a financial abortion, or whatever its called. Basically I want to resign any rights and responsibilities for the kid, since I never wanted him/her to begin with. I refuse to pay out the ass for a kid I don't want, and I obviously won't and can't force the mother to get rid of the baby, or give it up for adoption.\n\nHer friends have called me, saying that I really hurt her by refusing to acknowledge this kid, and calling me selfish and whatnot, but I can't handle all that stuff right now, or ever probably. Am I the asshole for wanting a \"financial abortion\", that is, no contact, no child support, no custody, and is it morally and legally okay???\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's dive into this situation. The user is asking whether the person who wants to disavow all financial and parental responsibilities for an unexpected child is in the wrong. The scenario involves a past relationship, a breakup, pregnancy, and the man's refusal to engage further.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspects. In many places, once paternity is established, a man is legally obligated to provide child support. Even if he doesn't want custody or contact, he can't walk away from financial responsibilities. So legally, he might be in trouble if he tries to avoid that. But the question is more about moral and emotional wrongness, not just legal consequences.\n\nMoral standpoint is trickier. The man was clear about not wanting kids, and the woman became pregnant after a breakup. However, he's now trying to avoid any responsibility. The woman might feel betrayed, especially if she thought he was a potential long-term partner. But the man is also stressed due to his new relationship and living situation. \n\nI should also think about consent and responsibility. Even if the man didn't want kids, the act of having sex without ensuring 100% contraception means he shares some responsibility. The fact that they used contraceptives but failed could be a point, but it's not an excuse to avoid responsibility. \n\nThe man's new girlfriend and their stable life might add pressure, but that doesn't diminish his obligations. His refusal to pay child support could be seen as selfish, especially if the child is his. The woman's friends are calling him selfish, which suggests societal judgment. \n\nIs the man wrong? He's not willing to take on any parental role, which is his right, but legally and morally, he can't avoid financial support. So while he might not be \"evil,\" his stance is morally questionable. The woman is in a tough spot, and his refusal could hurt her and the child. So I lean towards him being in the wrong.\n"
