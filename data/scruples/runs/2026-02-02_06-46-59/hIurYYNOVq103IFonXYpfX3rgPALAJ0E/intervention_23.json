We basically went a few months with no contact, until she contacted me, saying she was a few months pregnant and needed my support. I was floored. We'd barely spoken since the breakup, and I was clear as day about the fact that I NEVER wanted kids. \n\nThis was one of the worst things that could conceivably happen to me. She suggested getting back together, which I shut down right out of the gate. I explained that we were through months ago, and that I don't want to be a father, and hung up. She is dead set on keeping it, there have been tests, and the kid is mine, though I dont know how the fuck it happened, since we were fairly strict with contraceptives.\n\nI have a new GF, and we've just moved to a great new apartment. This phonecall literally shook me to my core, and I am freaking out like crazy. I've been searching for every possible way out, and I heard of a financial abortion, or whatever its called. Basically I want to resign any rights and responsibilities for the kid, since I never wanted him/her to begin with. I refuse to pay out the ass for a kid I don't want, and I obviously won't and can't force the mother to get rid of the baby, or give it up for adoption.\n\nHer friends have called me, saying that I really hurt her by refusing to acknowledge this kid, and calling me selfish and whatnot, but I can't handle all that stuff right now, or ever probably. Am I the asshole for wanting a \"financial abortion\", that is, no contact, no child support, no custody, and is it morally and legally okay???\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. Let's start by breaking down the situation. The user dated a girl for a few months, and things ended. They didn't talk for a while, and then she called saying she's pregnant. He was clear he never wanted kids, and he shut down the idea of getting back together. Now he's considering a \"financial abortion,\" meaning he doesn't want to pay child support or have any contact or custody. The question is whether he's in the wrong.\n\nFirst, legally, in many places, fathers are responsible for child support regardless of their willingness to be involved. So even if he doesn't want to be part of the child's life, he might still be legally obligated to pay. But the author is asking if it's morally okay. The user mentioned that he's in a new relationship and moved to a new place, and the situation has caused him a lot of stress.\n\nMoral perspective: The author is a biological father, and some might argue that he has a responsibility to support his child, even if he's not willing to be a parent. However, others might say that he never wanted children, and it's not his fault they became pregnant, especially if they were using contraception. The mother did get pregnant against their previous agreement, and she's choosing to keep the child. If he didn't want a child, maybe the mother should have considered that before getting pregnant. But he's not the one to terminate it; that's her choice.\n\nThe mother's friends are calling him selfish. That's a common reaction when someone refuses child support. But is he the one at fault? He didn't force the pregnancy. The mother made the choice to carry the baby to term. However, he is still the father biologically, and in many societies, fathers are expected to provide financial support regardless of their desire to be parents. So even if he feels morally wronged, legally and socially, he might have obligations.\n\nOn the other hand, if he never wanted to be a father and the mother knew that, maybe she should have been more cautious. But in reality, people can change their minds, or circumstances can change. The fact that they used contraception but still got pregnant complicates things. Maybe there was a failure in the method, but that's not his responsibility.\n\nSo, the question is whether the author is in the wrong for wanting to avoid financial responsibilities. Legally, probably not in the sense that he can't be forced to pay if he successfully establishes paternity and the court orders it, but he can't avoid it by just refusing. Morally, it's a gray area. Some might say he's being selfish for not supporting his child, while others might argue he's protecting his own life and new relationship, which he didn't plan for. However, the child is a result of their relationship, and he did contribute to the pregnancy. So the moral responsibility could be seen as his to some extent.\n\nIn terms of legal aspects, the answer would depend on jurisdiction, but generally, fathers can be required to pay child support. The author's desire to avoid this might not be legally feasible. The user is asking if he's in the wrong, so the answer would hinge on moral judgment. If the society or community values parental responsibility, then he might be seen as the asshole for not supporting his child. But if the community understands his stance that he never wanted to be a parent, some might sympathize. However, the mother made the choice to keep the child, so he might still be expected to contribute.\n\nI think the key points are: the author's refusal to take responsibility, his biological role, the mother's choice to keep the baby, and societal expectations. The mother's friends' reactions suggest they think he's in the wrong. But the author is in a tough spot, but maybe he does have some responsibility. So leaning towards A, the author is in the wrong, but it's a close call.\n"
