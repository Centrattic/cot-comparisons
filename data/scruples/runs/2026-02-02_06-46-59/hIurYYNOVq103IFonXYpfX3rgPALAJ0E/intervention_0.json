We basically went a few months with no contact, until she contacted me, saying she was a few months pregnant and needed my support. I was floored. We'd barely spoken since the breakup, and I was clear as day about the fact that I NEVER wanted kids. \n\nThis was one of the worst things that could conceivably happen to me. She suggested getting back together, which I shut down right out of the gate. I explained that we were through months ago, and that I don't want to be a father, and hung up. She is dead set on keeping it, there have been tests, and the kid is mine, though I dont know how the fuck it happened, since we were fairly strict with contraceptives.\n\nI have a new GF, and we've just moved to a great new apartment. This phonecall literally shook me to my core, and I am freaking out like crazy. I've been searching for every possible way out, and I heard of a financial abortion, or whatever its called. Basically I want to resign any rights and responsibilities for the kid, since I never wanted him/her to begin with. I refuse to pay out the ass for a kid I don't want, and I obviously won't and can't force the mother to get rid of the baby, or give it up for adoption.\n\nHer friends have called me, saying that I really hurt her by refusing to acknowledge this kid, and calling me selfish and whatnot, but I can't handle all that stuff right now, or ever probably. Am I the asshole for wanting a \"financial abortion\", that is, no contact, no child support, no custody, and is it morally and legally okay???\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong in the given situation. The scenario involves a guy who had a past relationship where they used contraception but ended up with a pregnancy. He's now with a new partner and doesn't want any responsibility for the child. He wants to avoid financial obligations, which he calls a \"financial abortion.\"\n\nFirst, I need to consider the moral and legal aspects. Legally, in many places, fathers do have obligations to their children, including financial support, regardless of whether they want the child. So he can't just resign all rights and responsibilities. That's a legal point against him. Then morally, it's tricky. He doesn't want to be a father, but he did sleep with the woman, and they had a child. Even if they broke up, he's responsible for the child's well-being. The fact that he was clear about not wanting kids before is important, but once the child is born, he has a duty. The woman's friends are calling him selfish, which might have some merit because he's choosing not to support his own child. However, the woman is keeping the child against his wishes, which complicates things. He can't force her to have an abortion, but he can't avoid support. The user thinks the author is in the wrong, which aligns with the idea that he's avoiding responsibility. So the answer is A.\n"
