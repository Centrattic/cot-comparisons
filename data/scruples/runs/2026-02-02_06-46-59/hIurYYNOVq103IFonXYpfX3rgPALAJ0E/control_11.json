We basically went a few months with no contact, until she contacted me, saying she was a few months pregnant and needed my support. I was floored. We'd barely spoken since the breakup, and I was clear as day about the fact that I NEVER wanted kids. \n\nThis was one of the worst things that could conceivably happen to me. She suggested getting back together, which I shut down right out of the gate. I explained that we were through months ago, and that I don't want to be a father, and hung up. She is dead set on keeping it, there have been tests, and the kid is mine, though I dont know how the fuck it happened, since we were fairly strict with contraceptives.\n\nI have a new GF, and we've just moved to a great new apartment. This phonecall literally shook me to my core, and I am freaking out like crazy. I've been searching for every possible way out, and I heard of a financial abortion, or whatever its called. Basically I want to resign any rights and responsibilities for the kid, since I never wanted him/her to begin with. I refuse to pay out the ass for a kid I don't want, and I obviously won't and can't force the mother to get rid of the baby, or give it up for adoption.\n\nHer friends have called me, saying that I really hurt her by refusing to acknowledge this kid, and calling me selfish and whatnot, but I can't handle all that stuff right now, or ever probably. Am I the asshole for wanting a \"financial abortion\", that is, no contact, no child support, no custody, and is it morally and legally okay???\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong for wanting to disassociate from a child they didn't want, especially financially. \n\nFirst, the situation: They had a breakup months ago, then the ex contacts them saying she's pregnant and wants support. The author never wanted kids and is now in a new relationship, having moved to a new apartment. They don't want to be involved at all\u2014no child support, no custody, no contact. Their ex's friends are calling them selfish.\n\nMoral aspect: The father's desire not to have kids is personal, but once a child is born, there are ethical considerations. Many people might argue that a child isn't just a financial burden but also a parental responsibility. Even if the father didn't want the child, some would say he's still responsible for their well-being. However, others might empathize with his position, especially if the relationship was already over and they were using contraception. But the fact that the child is already conceived complicates things.\n\nLegal aspect: In most jurisdictions, fathers have legal responsibilities for their children, including financial support. Resigning those rights isn't as simple as a \"financial abortion.\" Legally, you can't just opt out; you have to be involved. The author would likely be required to pay child support unless there's a legal termination of parental rights, which isn't automatic. Termination usually requires the child to be adopted out or the parent to show neglect, etc., which might not apply here. So legally, the author is probably not allowed to walk away completely.\n\nThe ex's claims: She wants the author to acknowledge the child and be involved. The friends criticize him as selfish, but he's not denying the child's existence, just his responsibility. However, not providing financial support could be seen as neglecting a duty. The key here is whether he's proactive in avoiding responsibility, which is a legal obligation in most places.\n\nPersonal choice vs. responsibility: The author's original stance on not wanting kids is valid, but once the child is born, the legal and moral responsibilities kick in. The term \"financial abortion\" is a bit of a misnomer because it's not ending the pregnancy but transferring the burden. That might not be fair, but the author's position is within their rights, though not necessarily morally accepted by everyone.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? Morally, many would say yes because they're avoiding a responsibility they might have to a child. Legally, it's not as clear, but the author isn't allowed to just resign; they have to go through specific legal processes. The ex's friends might be right about the selfishness, but the author's decision is legally permissible if they can't be forced otherwise. However, the author's refusal to acknowledge the child might still be seen as morally wrong, even if legally possible. The answer likely hinges on the distinction between moral and legal wrongs. The question asks if they're in the wrong, which is a mix of both. The community might consider the legal obligation as a given, but the moral aspect is debatable. However, the author is not legally in the wrong for seeking to disassociate, but maybe morally. The options are A or B. The answer depends on whether the question is about legal or moral wrong. The user's story mentions both, so the answer might lean towards B (not in the wrong) because of legal rights, but the tone of the question might suggest considering moral aspects. But the options are Yes or No. Since the author can't just resign rights easily, maybe they are not in the wrong legally, but the friends are criticizing them morally. The AITA (Am I the Asshole) context usually considers social/ethical judgment, not just legal. However, the user is asking if the author is in the wrong. The answer here is probably A (Yes, the author is in the wrong) because, even though the father is not forced to get back together, he has a responsibility to support the child. Wanting to avoid all contact and support might be seen as morally wrong. But legally, they can't just opt out. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong, so the answer is A, but the explanation would need to clarify the legal vs. moral aspects. However, the options are A or B. The community's typical take is that not providing financial support is selfish, hence AITA. So the answer is A.\n"
