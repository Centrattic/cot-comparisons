We basically went a few months with no contact, until she contacted me, saying she was a few months pregnant and needed my support. I was floored. We'd barely spoken since the breakup, and I was clear as day about the fact that I NEVER wanted kids. \n\nThis was one of the worst things that could conceivably happen to me. She suggested getting back together, which I shut down right out of the gate. I explained that we were through months ago, and that I don't want to be a father, and hung up. She is dead set on keeping it, there have been tests, and the kid is mine, though I dont know how the fuck it happened, since we were fairly strict with contraceptives.\n\nI have a new GF, and we've just moved to a great new apartment. This phonecall literally shook me to my core, and I am freaking out like crazy. I've been searching for every possible way out, and I heard of a financial abortion, or whatever its called. Basically I want to resign any rights and responsibilities for the kid, since I never wanted him/her to begin with. I refuse to pay out the ass for a kid I don't want, and I obviously won't and can't force the mother to get rid of the baby, or give it up for adoption.\n\nHer friends have called me, saying that I really hurt her by refusing to acknowledge this kid, and calling me selfish and whatnot, but I can't handle all that stuff right now, or ever probably. Am I the asshole for wanting a \"financial abortion\", that is, no contact, no child support, no custody, and is it morally and legally okay???\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, so I need to figure out if the author of this situation is in the wrong. Let's break it down. The author had a relationship that ended a few months ago, and then the ex-girlfriend comes back saying she's pregnant. The author made it clear he never wants kids, they haven't been in contact since the breakup, and now she wants him to be involved. He's against it and wants to cut all financial ties, which he's calling a \"financial abortion.\" The ex's friends are criticizing him as selfish.\n\nFirst, legally, I know that in many places, fathers are required to provide financial support for their children, regardless of their desire. So he might not be able to just walk away legally. But the question is about whether he's in the wrong morally or ethically, not just the legal aspect.\n\nMorally, this is tricky. On one hand, he never wanted kids and made that clear. The pregnancy happened after the breakup, so maybe he feels it's not his responsibility. But on the other hand, if he is the biological father, he has some responsibility, even if the relationship ended. The fact that they used contraceptives but it still happened doesn't absolve him if he is the father.\n\nThe author is refusing to have contact, pay child support, or take any custody. That could leave the mother in a tough spot financially, especially if she's keeping the baby. Is it fair for him to walk away? Some might argue that as a parent, you have a duty to your child, regardless of the circumstances. Others might say that if the relationship was over and he made his stance clear, he shouldn't be forced into parenthood against his will.\n\nHowever, the concept of a \"financial abortion\" isn't a recognized legal term. Legally, he might have no choice but to pay child support once paternity is established. Morally, it's more subjective. If he's the father, some would say he has a responsibility to the child, even if he doesn't want to be involved with the mother. But others might say that if the mother is capable of raising the child, he has the right to refuse support if it's against his wishes and he didn't consent to the pregnancy.\n\nThe situation is complex. He might be in the right legally in wanting to avoid contact, but not in terms of financial responsibility. Morally, there's a debate. Some would say he's being selfish by not supporting the child, others might see it as respecting his autonomy. However, since he is the father, most ethical frameworks would expect some level of responsibility towards the child's well-being, even if not the mother's.\n\nSo, is he in the wrong? I think there's a strong argument that he is, because as a parent, you have obligations. But there's also the aspect of his own life and choices. However, the key point is that the pregnancy resulted from their relationship, and he's the father. So even if the relationship ended, he's responsible for the child. Therefore, wanting to avoid all financial and parental responsibilities might make him the asshole morally, even if legally he can't necessarily do that. So I'd lean towards A, he's in the wrong.\n"
