We basically went a few months with no contact, until she contacted me, saying she was a few months pregnant and needed my support. I was floored. We'd barely spoken since the breakup, and I was clear as day about the fact that I NEVER wanted kids. \n\nThis was one of the worst things that could conceivably happen to me. She suggested getting back together, which I shut down right out of the gate. I explained that we were through months ago, and that I don't want to be a father, and hung up. She is dead set on keeping it, there have been tests, and the kid is mine, though I dont know how the fuck it happened, since we were fairly strict with contraceptives.\n\nI have a new GF, and we've just moved to a great new apartment. This phonecall literally shook me to my core, and I am freaking out like crazy. I've been searching for every possible way out, and I heard of a financial abortion, or whatever its called. Basically I want to resign any rights and responsibilities for the kid, since I never wanted him/her to begin with. I refuse to pay out the ass for a kid I don't want, and I obviously won't and can't force the mother to get rid of the baby, or give it up for adoption.\n\nHer friends have called me, saying that I really hurt her by refusing to acknowledge this kid, and calling me selfish and whatnot, but I can't handle all that stuff right now, or ever probably. Am I the asshole for wanting a \"financial abortion\", that is, no contact, no child support, no custody, and is it morally and legally okay???\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for wanting a \"financial abortion,\" which I assume means cutting off all financial and parental ties to a child they didn't want and weren't involved with.\n\nFirst, the situation: The author had a relationship, broke up, had no contact for months. Then the ex contacts them saying she's pregnant. The author made it clear they don't want kids. The ex wants to keep the baby, and the author is now in a new relationship, moving into a new place, and is panicking about potential financial obligations. They want to legally disown the child to avoid support payments.\n\nLegally, in most jurisdictions, a biological father can't completely opt out of responsibility just because they don't want the child. Once paternity is established, there are legal obligations for child support. Even if the father didn't know about the pregnancy, once it's proven they're the parent, they can't just walk away. So the author's desire to avoid child support could be legally problematic. They might need to legally establish paternity and then seek to terminate parental rights, which is usually a complex process and not easily done unless there are extreme circumstances like abuse or abandonment.\n\nMorally, this is trickier. The author claims they never wanted kids and the pregnancy was a shock. They were clear about their stance before the breakup. But the ex didn't know about the pregnancy until after the breakup. The author might argue they were honest, but the ex might argue that the pregnancy happened during the relationship, so the author has a responsibility. The author's new partner and their new life could also play into the emotional stakes here. The author's refusal to get back together is understandable, but their refusal to have any involvement could be seen as selfish, especially if the child is born and needs support.\n\nThe ex's friends are calling the author selfish, which adds social pressure. But the author is also stressed and scared, which is valid. However, the legal obligation exists regardless of emotions. So the author might be in the wrong legally by trying to avoid responsibilities. Morally, it's a gray area, but since the question is about being \"in the wrong,\" and considering legal aspects, the answer might lean towards the author being in the wrong.\n\nBut wait, the user is asking if the author is in the wrong. If the law requires child support, then the author is legally obligated, so wanting to avoid that would be wrong. Legally and morally, they might both be in the wrong. However, the question is phrased as \"AITA\" (Am I the Asshole), which often considers both legal and moral angles. The author's refusal to accept responsibility could be seen as morally wrong too. So the answer is likely A (the author is in the wrong).\n"
