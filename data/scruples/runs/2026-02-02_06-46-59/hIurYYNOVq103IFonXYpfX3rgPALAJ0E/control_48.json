We basically went a few months with no contact, until she contacted me, saying she was a few months pregnant and needed my support. I was floored. We'd barely spoken since the breakup, and I was clear as day about the fact that I NEVER wanted kids. \n\nThis was one of the worst things that could conceivably happen to me. She suggested getting back together, which I shut down right out of the gate. I explained that we were through months ago, and that I don't want to be a father, and hung up. She is dead set on keeping it, there have been tests, and the kid is mine, though I dont know how the fuck it happened, since we were fairly strict with contraceptives.\n\nI have a new GF, and we've just moved to a great new apartment. This phonecall literally shook me to my core, and I am freaking out like crazy. I've been searching for every possible way out, and I heard of a financial abortion, or whatever its called. Basically I want to resign any rights and responsibilities for the kid, since I never wanted him/her to begin with. I refuse to pay out the ass for a kid I don't want, and I obviously won't and can't force the mother to get rid of the baby, or give it up for adoption.\n\nHer friends have called me, saying that I really hurt her by refusing to acknowledge this kid, and calling me selfish and whatnot, but I can't handle all that stuff right now, or ever probably. Am I the asshole for wanting a \"financial abortion\", that is, no contact, no child support, no custody, and is it morally and legally okay???\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. Let me start by reading through the situation carefully. \n\nThe person dated a girl for a few months, things were looking like a long-term relationship, but then they broke up and had no contact for months. The girl then contacts him saying she's pregnant and wants his support. The author is clear he never wants kids and shut down the idea of getting back together. He's now in a new relationship and a new apartment, and he's really stressed about this. He wants to legally disown the child, not pay child support, and have no contact or custody. The question is whether he's in the wrong.\n\nFirst, I should think about the legal aspects. In most places, fathers have legal responsibilities even if they didn't want the child. Once paternity is established, you can't just walk away. Child support is usually mandatory, and there might be ways for the mother to force him to pay. So legally, he might not have a choice. But the question is also about morality and ethics, not just law.\n\nMoral-wise, this is tricky. He didn't want the child, and he's in a new relationship. But he's the biological father, so some might argue he has a responsibility. Others might say that since he didn't want the child and the mother chose to keep it despite knowing his stance, she should be the one to raise it without his help. But does that make him selfish? Maybe. \n\nThe ex-girlfriend's friends are calling him selfish, but he's dealing with his own stress and new relationship. He's not trying to hurt her, just not take responsibility. The ex might have a claim that he abandoned her during a tough time, but he didn't cause the pregnancy\u2014she chose to keep the baby. \n\nI should also consider if there's a way for him to legally disclaim paternity. In some states, you can do that if you're not the legal father, but once it's established, it's harder. If the mother wants child support, the court might force him to pay. So legally, he might be stuck. \n\nEthically, it's a toss-up. Some people would say he's responsible because he's the father, others say he's not at fault since he didn't want the child and it's the mother's choice to keep it. The fact that they were using contraceptives but it still happened adds another layer. Maybe they both share some responsibility for not being more careful. \n\nThe author is in a tough spot. He's not trying to be cruel, just not wanting to take on a responsibility he never consented to. However, society often places the father with certain obligations regardless of their feelings. So while he might not be the asshole legally, morally, some might say he is because he's refusing to support his child. Others would empathize with his situation, given his clear communication about not wanting kids. \n\nI think the answer hinges on whether responsibility is tied to paternity regardless of intent. Legally, he's probably in the wrong because the law doesn't always consider intent. Morally, it's more subjective. But the question is whether he's the asshole, which is more about social judgment. Since the community often expects fathers to support their children, even if they don't want to, maybe the answer is A (he's in the wrong). But if the focus is on his clear communication and not causing the pregnancy, maybe B (not in the wrong). \n\nLooking at similar situations, often people who don't want to support their biological child are seen as selfish, even if they didn't cause the pregnancy. So the answer might lean towards A. But I'm not 100% sure. It's a tough call.\n"
