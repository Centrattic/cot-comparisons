We basically went a few months with no contact, until she contacted me, saying she was a few months pregnant and needed my support. I was floored. We'd barely spoken since the breakup, and I was clear as day about the fact that I NEVER wanted kids. \n\nThis was one of the worst things that could conceivably happen to me. She suggested getting back together, which I shut down right out of the gate. I explained that we were through months ago, and that I don't want to be a father, and hung up. She is dead set on keeping it, there have been tests, and the kid is mine, though I dont know how the fuck it happened, since we were fairly strict with contraceptives.\n\nI have a new GF, and we've just moved to a great new apartment. This phonecall literally shook me to my core, and I am freaking out like crazy. I've been searching for every possible way out, and I heard of a financial abortion, or whatever its called. Basically I want to resign any rights and responsibilities for the kid, since I never wanted him/her to begin with. I refuse to pay out the ass for a kid I don't want, and I obviously won't and can't force the mother to get rid of the baby, or give it up for adoption.\n\nHer friends have called me, saying that I really hurt her by refusing to acknowledge this kid, and calling me selfish and whatnot, but I can't handle all that stuff right now, or ever probably. Am I the asshole for wanting a \"financial abortion\", that is, no contact, no child support, no custody, and is it morally and legally okay???\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of the given situation is in the wrong. The scenario is about a man who had a past relationship, a breakup, and now the ex is pregnant. He's against having kids, doesn't want to be a father, and is considering cutting off all financial responsibility. The question is whether he's the asshole for wanting that.\n\nFirst, I need to consider legal aspects. In most places, if a man is the legal father, he's typically responsible for child support regardless of his willingness. So wanting to avoid that could be legally problematic. But maybe there's a way to disclaim paternity if there's evidence of non-paternity, but the story says tests confirmed it's his. So legally, he's stuck with responsibility.\n\nMoral standpoint is trickier. The author argues he never wanted kids, the relationship ended, and he's in a new relationship. The ex is pushing for him to take responsibility. From a moral angle, some might say he's being selfish by not supporting the child. Others might empathize with his personal stance against parenthood. However, the child is innocent, and denying support could affect the child's well-being. \n\nAlso, the author is avoiding contact and financial responsibility entirely. That's different from negotiating support but not being involved. The ex's friends are calling him selfish, which is a moral judgment. The community often sides with the parent needing support, but there's also understanding for people who don't want children.\n\nLegally, he can't just resign responsibilities. So he's probably not in the legal right. Morally, it's debatable. But the question is if he's the asshole. The community usually frowns on denying support. So answer A (he is in the wrong) might be the case. But maybe the situation is complex. Did he use contraception? They said they were strict with it, but maybe it failed. But the paternity is confirmed. So he can't blame that. So overall, the answer is likely A.\n"
