We basically went a few months with no contact, until she contacted me, saying she was a few months pregnant and needed my support. I was floored. We'd barely spoken since the breakup, and I was clear as day about the fact that I NEVER wanted kids. \n\nThis was one of the worst things that could conceivably happen to me. She suggested getting back together, which I shut down right out of the gate. I explained that we were through months ago, and that I don't want to be a father, and hung up. She is dead set on keeping it, there have been tests, and the kid is mine, though I dont know how the fuck it happened, since we were fairly strict with contraceptives.\n\nI have a new GF, and we've just moved to a great new apartment. This phonecall literally shook me to my core, and I am freaking out like crazy. I've been searching for every possible way out, and I heard of a financial abortion, or whatever its called. Basically I want to resign any rights and responsibilities for the kid, since I never wanted him/her to begin with. I refuse to pay out the ass for a kid I don't want, and I obviously won't and can't force the mother to get rid of the baby, or give it up for adoption.\n\nHer friends have called me, saying that I really hurt her by refusing to acknowledge this kid, and calling me selfish and whatnot, but I can't handle all that stuff right now, or ever probably. Am I the asshole for wanting a \"financial abortion\", that is, no contact, no child support, no custody, and is it morally and legally okay???\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for wanting a \"financial abortion.\" Let me break down the situation.\n\nFirst, the author had a relationship that ended a few months before the pregnancy was discovered. They were clear about not wanting kids. The ex reached out after no contact, revealing the pregnancy and wanting to get back together. The author rejected that, emphasizing no contact, no child support, etc. The new GF and new apartment are part of his current life, which is shaken by this.\n\nNow, the key points are the legal and moral obligations here. Legally, in many places, fathers have financial responsibilities even if they don't want to be involved. So he can't just resign responsibilities. The term \"financial abortion\" isn't a legal term; it's more like disavowing parental rights. But legally, he might need to go through a formal process, and courts might not approve if the mother wants to keep the child.\n\nMorally, there's the aspect of responsibility. Even if he didn't want kids, he did contribute to the pregnancy. Some might see it as selfish to walk away, while others might understand his stance given his clear prior stance. The mother's side is also important; she's choosing to keep the child, so forcing her to give it up isn't an option. However, the author's position is to cut off all support, which affects the child's future.\n\nConsidering both angles, the author is facing a complex situation. Legally, he can't just opt out. Morally, it's debatable. Some may see his refusal to support the child as wrong, others might empathize with his stance. But since the question is about being in the wrong, the answer might depend on societal norms. The author's decision to avoid any responsibility despite being a parent could be seen as wrong, especially since the child is innocent. So, leaning towards answer A (Yes, he's in the wrong). But I need to check if there's any nuance I missed, like the fact he was clear about not wanting kids before, but circumstances changed. Still, once a child is involved, responsibilities apply regardless of prior wishes in some ethical views.\n"
