We basically went a few months with no contact, until she contacted me, saying she was a few months pregnant and needed my support. I was floored. We'd barely spoken since the breakup, and I was clear as day about the fact that I NEVER wanted kids. \n\nThis was one of the worst things that could conceivably happen to me. She suggested getting back together, which I shut down right out of the gate. I explained that we were through months ago, and that I don't want to be a father, and hung up. She is dead set on keeping it, there have been tests, and the kid is mine, though I dont know how the fuck it happened, since we were fairly strict with contraceptives.\n\nI have a new GF, and we've just moved to a great new apartment. This phonecall literally shook me to my core, and I am freaking out like crazy. I've been searching for every possible way out, and I heard of a financial abortion, or whatever its called. Basically I want to resign any rights and responsibilities for the kid, since I never wanted him/her to begin with. I refuse to pay out the ass for a kid I don't want, and I obviously won't and can't force the mother to get rid of the baby, or give it up for adoption.\n\nHer friends have called me, saying that I really hurt her by refusing to acknowledge this kid, and calling me selfish and whatnot, but I can't handle all that stuff right now, or ever probably. Am I the asshole for wanting a \"financial abortion\", that is, no contact, no child support, no custody, and is it morally and legally okay???\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for wanting a \"financial abortion,\" meaning he doesn't want to have any contact, child support, custody, etc. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the situation: The author was in a relationship that ended months ago. They were using contraception, but the girl became pregnant. She reached out after months of no contact, and he's clear he never wants kids. Now she wants to get back together, but he refuses. He's worried about financial responsibilities and doesn't want to be involved. His new girlfriend is part of the picture now.\n\nSo, legally, paternity is established, and in most places, fathers are legally responsible for child support regardless of wanting to be involved. But the question is about morality and legal permissibility. The user is asking if he's in the wrong.\n\nLegally, the author can't just disown the child. Even if he doesn't want to be a father, once paternity is established, he's responsible for child support. However, he might have to go through legal processes to terminate parental rights, which is possible in some cases, especially if it's in the child's best interest. But that's a big ask and not straightforward.\n\nMorally, it's more complex. On one hand, he didn't plan for this and made his stance clear. On the other, he's a father now, and some argue that responsibility comes with parenthood. He's being called selfish by the mother's friends, which adds to the emotional aspect.\n\nThe user is asking if he's the asshole (AITA). The answer depends on societal views. Some might see him as responsible for his actions leading to the pregnancy, while others might sympathize with his stance on not wanting children. However, from a legal standpoint, he can't avoid financial responsibility, so he might be in the wrong legally, but the question is about moral wrong.\n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong. The options are A (yes) or B (no). The answer likely depends on the perspective. Legally, he can't avoid it, but morally, it's a tough call. However, given the community's typical response to such AITA questions, people might lean on the side that expecting him to take responsibility as a father, even if he didn't plan it. So he might be considered in the wrong for not wanting to accept any responsibility.\n"
