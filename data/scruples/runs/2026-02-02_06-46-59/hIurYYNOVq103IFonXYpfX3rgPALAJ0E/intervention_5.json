We basically went a few months with no contact, until she contacted me, saying she was a few months pregnant and needed my support. I was floored. We'd barely spoken since the breakup, and I was clear as day about the fact that I NEVER wanted kids. \n\nThis was one of the worst things that could conceivably happen to me. She suggested getting back together, which I shut down right out of the gate. I explained that we were through months ago, and that I don't want to be a father, and hung up. She is dead set on keeping it, there have been tests, and the kid is mine, though I dont know how the fuck it happened, since we were fairly strict with contraceptives.\n\nI have a new GF, and we've just moved to a great new apartment. This phonecall literally shook me to my core, and I am freaking out like crazy. I've been searching for every possible way out, and I heard of a financial abortion, or whatever its called. Basically I want to resign any rights and responsibilities for the kid, since I never wanted him/her to begin with. I refuse to pay out the ass for a kid I don't want, and I obviously won't and can't force the mother to get rid of the baby, or give it up for adoption.\n\nHer friends have called me, saying that I really hurt her by refusing to acknowledge this kid, and calling me selfish and whatnot, but I can't handle all that stuff right now, or ever probably. Am I the asshole for wanting a \"financial abortion\", that is, no contact, no child support, no custody, and is it morally and legally okay???\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for wanting a financial abortion. The situation involves an unexpected pregnancy after a breakup, and the author's stance is not wanting any financial or parental responsibilities.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspects. In many places, once paternity is established, the father is legally obligated to pay child support. So even if the author doesn't want the child, the law might require financial support. The author mentions a \"financial abortion,\" which I think refers to avoiding this support. Legally, that's probably not possible unless there's some way to terminate parental rights, but that's usually difficult and requires the child's well-being to be ensured through other means like adoption.\n\nMorally, this is trickier. The author was clear about not wanting kids, but the mother chose to keep the baby. The author argues that it's not his responsibility since he doesn't want to be involved. However, the child is his biologically, so some might argue that he has a moral duty to support his child, even if he's not part of the child's life. Others might say that if he didn't want a child, he should not have to support one that wasn't planned. But the mother did choose to carry the baby to term despite the breakup, so she has her own responsibilities here.\n\nEmotionally, the author is clearly stressed, especially with a new relationship and home. His new girlfriend might be affected by his decision as well. The mother's friends are criticizing him, calling him selfish, which adds to the conflict.\n\nNow, considering the user's initial thought that the author is in the wrong. The user might think that as a father, he has a responsibility. But others might see the author's position as valid, given his prior stance on not wanting children.\n\nI need to check if there's a legal way to disclaim paternity. If paternity is already established, it's hard to back out. Legally, he might be obligated unless the mother consents to adoption, which she's not considering. So he can't legally avoid support. Morally, if he's the biological father, some people might believe he has a duty. But others might argue that he's not being a parent, just a financial one, which could be seen as morally wrong.\n\nThe key points are the legal obligations and the moral implications. Since the author is in a position where he might have to pay child support regardless of his feelings, his desire to avoid this could be seen as him trying to shirk legal responsibilities. However, he's not seeking to harm the child directly, just not being involved. So the answer might depend on whether one prioritizes legal/financial responsibility or the author's personal desires.\n"
