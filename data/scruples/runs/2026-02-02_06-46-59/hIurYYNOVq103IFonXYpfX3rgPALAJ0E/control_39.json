We basically went a few months with no contact, until she contacted me, saying she was a few months pregnant and needed my support. I was floored. We'd barely spoken since the breakup, and I was clear as day about the fact that I NEVER wanted kids. \n\nThis was one of the worst things that could conceivably happen to me. She suggested getting back together, which I shut down right out of the gate. I explained that we were through months ago, and that I don't want to be a father, and hung up. She is dead set on keeping it, there have been tests, and the kid is mine, though I dont know how the fuck it happened, since we were fairly strict with contraceptives.\n\nI have a new GF, and we've just moved to a great new apartment. This phonecall literally shook me to my core, and I am freaking out like crazy. I've been searching for every possible way out, and I heard of a financial abortion, or whatever its called. Basically I want to resign any rights and responsibilities for the kid, since I never wanted him/her to begin with. I refuse to pay out the ass for a kid I don't want, and I obviously won't and can't force the mother to get rid of the baby, or give it up for adoption.\n\nHer friends have called me, saying that I really hurt her by refusing to acknowledge this kid, and calling me selfish and whatnot, but I can't handle all that stuff right now, or ever probably. Am I the asshole for wanting a \"financial abortion\", that is, no contact, no child support, no custody, and is it morally and legally okay???\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. Let me start by reading through the situation again to make sure I understand all the details.\n\nThe user is asking if the person who wrote this is in the wrong. The situation is about an unexpected pregnancy from a past relationship. The author was clear that he never wants kids, the relationship broke up months ago with no contact, and then the ex contacts him saying she's pregnant. He refuses to get back together and wants nothing to do with the child, even considering a \"financial abortion\" (which I think means not paying child support or having any legal responsibilities). His new girlfriend and new apartment are mentioned, indicating his current life is stable but this situation is causing him stress. His ex's friends are accusing him of being selfish, but he feels he can't handle the responsibilities of parenthood he never wanted.\n\nFirst, I should consider the legal aspects. In many places, once a child is born, the father has legal obligations, including child support, even if they don't want to be involved. So legally, he might not be able to just walk away. But the question is about moral responsibility, not just legal. \n\nMoral standpoint: Did he have a responsibility to prevent the pregnancy? He mentioned they used contraceptives, but they might not have been 100% effective. Also, he was clear about not wanting kids. However, when a pregnancy occurs, even if unintended, does he still have a moral obligation? Some might argue that he's responsible because it's his child, regardless of the circumstances. Others might say he's not responsible if he never wanted to be a parent and wasn't part of a committed relationship anymore.\n\nThe breakup was months prior, and they had no contact. The ex reached out after the fact. He was clear about his stance on not wanting kids. So he didn't intentionally cause the pregnancy, but he's now being asked to be involved. The mother is keeping the baby, so he's faced with either accepting responsibility or walking away. \n\nIn terms of parental responsibility, if he's the biological father, many cultures and ethical frameworks would argue that he has a duty to support his child, even if he didn't plan for it. However, if he's not the one who was in a committed relationship and the pregnancy happened after they broke up, some might argue that he's not in the wrong for wanting to avoid responsibilities he never consented to.\n\nAlso, the fact that he's in a new relationship and has a stable life now might be a factor. The mother's friends are calling him selfish, but he's not the one who decided to keep the baby. She had the choice to terminate or give up for adoption. He's not forcing her to keep the child, so he's not directly causing her emotional distress. \n\nBut then again, by refusing to take any responsibility, he might be leaving the mother to bear all the financial and emotional burdens, which could be seen as selfish. However, if he's not the one who is the child's parent in any other way besides biology, maybe it's not entirely his responsibility. \n\nI think the key points here are: 1) Did he have a responsibility to prevent the pregnancy? 2) Does being a biological father automatically make him morally responsible for child support and involvement? 3) What about the mother's role in deciding to keep the child?\n\nHe was clear about not wanting kids. The mother chose to carry the baby to term. So maybe he's not in the wrong for wanting to disassociate, but legally he might still have obligations. Morally, it's a gray area. Some people might think he's being selfish, while others might understand his stance given his clear prior communication about not wanting children. \n\nBut then again, if he's the biological father, some might argue that he's still responsible. However, if the mother is keeping the child, she has the primary responsibility, and he's not in a position to force her to abort or give up the child. So he's not violating her rights by not supporting, but she's the one making the choice to keep the child. \n\nIn terms of the \"AITA\" (Am I the Asshole) format, the community often considers intentions and whether the person is being unreasonable. The author's intentions were clear, but the situation has changed. If he's being asked to take on responsibilities he never wanted, and he's not in a relationship, maybe he's justified. But others might say that once a child exists, the father has responsibilities regardless. \n\nSo, the answer might depend on cultural and personal values. Legally, he's probably bound to pay child support if he's the father. Morally, it's a tough call. The question is whether he's in the wrong. The author is in the wrong if he's being selfish and avoiding responsibilities he should accept. Not in the wrong if the mother chose to keep the child despite his prior communication of not wanting to be a parent.\n\nI think the answer here is B (No, the author is not in the wrong) because he made his stance clear, didn't force the pregnancy, and the mother chose to keep the child. He's not responsible for her choice, and he's not avoiding responsibilities in a way that's directly his fault. However, legally, he might have obligations, but morally, considering the circumstances, he's not the asshole.\n"
