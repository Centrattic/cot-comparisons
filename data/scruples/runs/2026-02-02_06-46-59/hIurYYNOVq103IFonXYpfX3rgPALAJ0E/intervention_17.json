We basically went a few months with no contact, until she contacted me, saying she was a few months pregnant and needed my support. I was floored. We'd barely spoken since the breakup, and I was clear as day about the fact that I NEVER wanted kids. \n\nThis was one of the worst things that could conceivably happen to me. She suggested getting back together, which I shut down right out of the gate. I explained that we were through months ago, and that I don't want to be a father, and hung up. She is dead set on keeping it, there have been tests, and the kid is mine, though I dont know how the fuck it happened, since we were fairly strict with contraceptives.\n\nI have a new GF, and we've just moved to a great new apartment. This phonecall literally shook me to my core, and I am freaking out like crazy. I've been searching for every possible way out, and I heard of a financial abortion, or whatever its called. Basically I want to resign any rights and responsibilities for the kid, since I never wanted him/her to begin with. I refuse to pay out the ass for a kid I don't want, and I obviously won't and can't force the mother to get rid of the baby, or give it up for adoption.\n\nHer friends have called me, saying that I really hurt her by refusing to acknowledge this kid, and calling me selfish and whatnot, but I can't handle all that stuff right now, or ever probably. Am I the asshole for wanting a \"financial abortion\", that is, no contact, no child support, no custody, and is it morally and legally okay???\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the situation is in the wrong regarding wanting a \"financial abortion.\" The scenario is that he was in a relationship, things ended, they didn't talk for a while. Then she comes back saying she's pregnant and wants him to be involved. He was clear he doesn't want kids, and he refuses to get back together. Now he's with a new partner and wants to cut out any legal responsibility, so he's considering a financial abortion.\n\nFirst, I need to think about the legal aspects. In many places, fathers do have legal obligations to their children, including child support, even if they don't want to be involved. So from a legal standpoint, he can't just opt out. But he's asking if it's morally and legally okay. Legally, it's not okay; he would have to pay child support if the mother seeks it. Morally, it's more complex. He was a parent, so there's an argument that he has a responsibility. However, he was clear about not wanting kids, and the pregnancy happened despite precautions. \n\nThen there's the breakup aspect. They ended the relationship months before the pregnancy. She didn't reach out, and when she did, it was unexpected. The mother's friends are calling him selfish, but he's not in a position to be a father. Is he at fault for not wanting to be involved? Or is she at fault for getting pregnant after a breakup without communication? \n\nMoral responsibility: He was a contributing parent, so maybe he does have some responsibility. But he never wanted to be a father. The mother chose to keep the child, so she has the right to do that. He can't force an adoption or abortion, but he can't legally disown the child. So he's stuck in a situation where he's the legal father but doesn't want to be involved. \n\nThe user thinks he's in the wrong, but maybe that's because they believe he's responsible for the child. But he's also not in a position to support another child, and he was clear about his stance on kids. It's a tough situation. Legally, he's not in the right because he can't avoid responsibility. Morally, it's debatable. Some might say he's being selfish, others might understand his position. \n\nSo the answer depends on whether we prioritize legal obligations or moral judgment. The question is asking if he's in the wrong. Legally, he's definitely in the wrong if he tries to avoid child support. Morally, it's a gray area. The user is asking if he's the asshole, so in the context of the AITA (Am I the Asshole) framework, the community might see him as an asshole for not taking responsibility, even if the situation is complicated. But others might sympathize with his position given his prior stance on children. \n\nI think the answer is A, he's in the wrong, because legally he must support the child, and morally many would argue he has a responsibility as a parent. Even though the pregnancy was unexpected, being a parent is a lifelong commitment. So wanting to cut out responsibility could be seen as selfish. However, there's nuance here. But in the AITA context, they often lean towards the person avoiding responsibility being the asshole. So the answer is A.\n"
