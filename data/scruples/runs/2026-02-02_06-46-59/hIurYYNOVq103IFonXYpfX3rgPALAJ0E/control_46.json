We basically went a few months with no contact, until she contacted me, saying she was a few months pregnant and needed my support. I was floored. We'd barely spoken since the breakup, and I was clear as day about the fact that I NEVER wanted kids. \n\nThis was one of the worst things that could conceivably happen to me. She suggested getting back together, which I shut down right out of the gate. I explained that we were through months ago, and that I don't want to be a father, and hung up. She is dead set on keeping it, there have been tests, and the kid is mine, though I dont know how the fuck it happened, since we were fairly strict with contraceptives.\n\nI have a new GF, and we've just moved to a great new apartment. This phonecall literally shook me to my core, and I am freaking out like crazy. I've been searching for every possible way out, and I heard of a financial abortion, or whatever its called. Basically I want to resign any rights and responsibilities for the kid, since I never wanted him/her to begin with. I refuse to pay out the ass for a kid I don't want, and I obviously won't and can't force the mother to get rid of the baby, or give it up for adoption.\n\nHer friends have called me, saying that I really hurt her by refusing to acknowledge this kid, and calling me selfish and whatnot, but I can't handle all that stuff right now, or ever probably. Am I the asshole for wanting a \"financial abortion\", that is, no contact, no child support, no custody, and is it morally and legally okay???\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that he had a relationship, they broke up, and then the ex got pregnant. He never wanted kids and clearly said that before. Now she wants him to be involved, but he doesn't want any part of it. He wants to cut all ties and not pay child support. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspects. From what I know in many places, fathers are legally responsible for child support once paternity is established. Even if he doesn't want to be involved, he might still have to pay. So maybe he can't just walk away legally. But the question is about whether he's in the wrong morally, not just legally.\n\nMoral-wise, some people might say that he's responsible because he's the biological father. Even if he didn't want kids, once a child is born, there's a responsibility to support it. Others might argue that since he was clear about not wanting kids and they used contraception, maybe it's not entirely his fault. But then, contraceptive methods aren't 100% effective, so that might not absolve him of responsibility.\n\nHe has a new partner and a new life, and the situation is causing him a lot of stress. His ex's friends are calling him selfish, but he's not necessarily being cruel\u2014he's just not wanting to take on the responsibility. However, refusing to support a child he helped create could be seen as selfish. Even if the mother is keeping the child, he's part of the equation.\n\nOn the other hand, he's not forcing her to keep the child, but once she decides to keep it, he's part of the child's life in a legal and financial sense. So, morally, maybe he's in the wrong because he's choosing to ignore a responsibility that comes with being a father, regardless of his initial intentions.\n\nI think the answer here is A, meaning he's in the wrong. Even if legally he has options, morally, there's an expectation to support the child he's responsible for, even if it's not what he wanted. Refusing all contact and support could be seen as selfish and harmful to both the child and the mother.\n"
