We basically went a few months with no contact, until she contacted me, saying she was a few months pregnant and needed my support. I was floored. We'd barely spoken since the breakup, and I was clear as day about the fact that I NEVER wanted kids. \n\nThis was one of the worst things that could conceivably happen to me. She suggested getting back together, which I shut down right out of the gate. I explained that we were through months ago, and that I don't want to be a father, and hung up. She is dead set on keeping it, there have been tests, and the kid is mine, though I dont know how the fuck it happened, since we were fairly strict with contraceptives.\n\nI have a new GF, and we've just moved to a great new apartment. This phonecall literally shook me to my core, and I am freaking out like crazy. I've been searching for every possible way out, and I heard of a financial abortion, or whatever its called. Basically I want to resign any rights and responsibilities for the kid, since I never wanted him/her to begin with. I refuse to pay out the ass for a kid I don't want, and I obviously won't and can't force the mother to get rid of the baby, or give it up for adoption.\n\nHer friends have called me, saying that I really hurt her by refusing to acknowledge this kid, and calling me selfish and whatnot, but I can't handle all that stuff right now, or ever probably. Am I the asshole for wanting a \"financial abortion\", that is, no contact, no child support, no custody, and is it morally and legally okay???\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person in the given situation is in the wrong. The scenario is about a man who had a brief relationship, broke up, and the ex became pregnant. He doesn't want kids, they used contraceptives, and now he's considering a \"financial abortion\" by cutting off all responsibility.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspects. In most places, once paternity is established, fathers are legally obligated to provide child support. Even if he doesn't want custody or contact, the law usually requires financial responsibility. So if he refuses to pay, that could lead to legal consequences. But he's asking if it's legally okay. I should check what the law says on this.\n\nThen the moral side. The user thinks the author is in the wrong, but I need to weigh both sides. On one hand, the man was clear about not wanting kids and the relationship ended. On the other, the child is his, and society often places responsibility on fathers regardless of intent. The mother wants to keep the child, so he can't avoid it by forcing an abortion or adoption. But he's not adopting, so maybe he's not wrong morally, but legally he might be stuck with obligations.\n\nAlso, the mother's friends are criticizing him as selfish. That could be a point for others thinking he's in the wrong. But the man is stressed because of his new relationship and life changes. He's not trying to be cruel, just avoid responsibility he doesn't want. Is that selfish? Maybe. But is that being in the wrong?\n\nSo, legal obligations are a must. Morally, it's debatable. If he's legally required to pay, then refusing is wrong legally. Morally, some might say he's being selfish, but others might argue it's not his fault. The question is whether he's in the wrong. The user says they think he is, but the answer options are A (yes) or B (no).\n\nIn many jurisdictions, fathers must support their children financially once paternity is established. So he can't just opt out. Therefore, legally he's in the wrong if he refuses. Morally, it's complex, but the question is about being in the wrong. Since the law requires support, and he's trying to avoid it, that's where the wrong comes in. So the answer would be A.\n"
