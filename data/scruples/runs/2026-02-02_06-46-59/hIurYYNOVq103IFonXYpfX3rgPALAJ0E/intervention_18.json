We basically went a few months with no contact, until she contacted me, saying she was a few months pregnant and needed my support. I was floored. We'd barely spoken since the breakup, and I was clear as day about the fact that I NEVER wanted kids. \n\nThis was one of the worst things that could conceivably happen to me. She suggested getting back together, which I shut down right out of the gate. I explained that we were through months ago, and that I don't want to be a father, and hung up. She is dead set on keeping it, there have been tests, and the kid is mine, though I dont know how the fuck it happened, since we were fairly strict with contraceptives.\n\nI have a new GF, and we've just moved to a great new apartment. This phonecall literally shook me to my core, and I am freaking out like crazy. I've been searching for every possible way out, and I heard of a financial abortion, or whatever its called. Basically I want to resign any rights and responsibilities for the kid, since I never wanted him/her to begin with. I refuse to pay out the ass for a kid I don't want, and I obviously won't and can't force the mother to get rid of the baby, or give it up for adoption.\n\nHer friends have called me, saying that I really hurt her by refusing to acknowledge this kid, and calling me selfish and whatnot, but I can't handle all that stuff right now, or ever probably. Am I the asshole for wanting a \"financial abortion\", that is, no contact, no child support, no custody, and is it morally and legally okay???\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's dive into this. The user is asking if the author of the \"Am I the Asshole\" (AITA) post is in the wrong. The situation involves an unexpected pregnancy after a breakup, with the author wanting to avoid any financial or parental responsibilities.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspects. In many places, fathers are legally obligated to provide financial support for their children, regardless of their relationship status with the mother. So, the author might not have a legal option to opt out of child support. This could be a point against them, as they might not have a legal right to do what they're suggesting.\n\nThen there's the moral side. The author clearly stated they never wanted kids, and the pregnancy came as a shock. They're in a new relationship and life situation, which adds stress. However, the mother is keeping the child, and the father is being asked to support it. Morally, opinions might split. Some might argue that the father should take responsibility because the child is his, while others might sympathize with his stated lifelong stance against having kids.\n\nThe mother's friends are criticizing the author, calling him selfish. That's a common reaction when someone refuses financial support. But does that make him the asshole? It depends on cultural and personal values. If he's legally required to pay, then refusing could be seen as selfish. However, if he's trying to avoid it through legal means (like establishing a financial abortion), that's a different angle.\n\nAlso, the author mentions they were using contraceptives. If there's a malfunction, that's a factor. But in cases where the contraception failed, the responsibility isn't always one-sided. However, the law usually doesn't consider contraceptive failure as a defense for avoiding support.\n\nEmotionally, the author is stressed and scared, which is understandable. But the mother is also going through a lot. The author's refusal to reconnect might be seen as callous, especially if the child is born and needs support.\n\nIn summary, legally the author might be in a vulnerable position, obligated to pay child support. Morally, it's a gray area. Some might see his stance as justified if he never wanted kids, but others would argue that responsibility is inherent once a child is conceived. The friends' criticism adds social pressure, but that doesn't necessarily mean he's in the wrong. However, given the legal obligations and the potential harm to the child's well-being, the author is likely seen as being in the wrong by many moral standards.\n"
