We basically went a few months with no contact, until she contacted me, saying she was a few months pregnant and needed my support. I was floored. We'd barely spoken since the breakup, and I was clear as day about the fact that I NEVER wanted kids. \n\nThis was one of the worst things that could conceivably happen to me. She suggested getting back together, which I shut down right out of the gate. I explained that we were through months ago, and that I don't want to be a father, and hung up. She is dead set on keeping it, there have been tests, and the kid is mine, though I dont know how the fuck it happened, since we were fairly strict with contraceptives.\n\nI have a new GF, and we've just moved to a great new apartment. This phonecall literally shook me to my core, and I am freaking out like crazy. I've been searching for every possible way out, and I heard of a financial abortion, or whatever its called. Basically I want to resign any rights and responsibilities for the kid, since I never wanted him/her to begin with. I refuse to pay out the ass for a kid I don't want, and I obviously won't and can't force the mother to get rid of the baby, or give it up for adoption.\n\nHer friends have called me, saying that I really hurt her by refusing to acknowledge this kid, and calling me selfish and whatnot, but I can't handle all that stuff right now, or ever probably. Am I the asshole for wanting a \"financial abortion\", that is, no contact, no child support, no custody, and is it morally and legally okay???\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking whether the author of the story is in the wrong for wanting a \"financial abortion,\" which means not providing child support, no contact, and no custody. The situation is that the author dated someone, they broke up, and then discovered she's pregnant. He doesn't want kids and has a new relationship and good life now. He's refusing any responsibility, and her friends are calling him selfish.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspects. In most places, once paternity is established, a father has legal obligations to provide child support. Resigning rights isn't as simple as he thinks. Legally, he can't just walk away. There might be a process for termination of parental rights, but that's usually complex and requires court involvement. So from a legal standpoint, he might be on shaky ground if he refuses support without going through proper channels.\n\nThen the moral side. The author is a parent, whether he likes it or not. Not wanting to take responsibility could be seen as selfish. But the situation is complicated by the fact that he was clear about not wanting kids. However, the responsibility of contraception is shared between partners. Even if he said he didn't want kids, both should be cautious. If the child is his, then he's part of the baby's life now. The mother has her own reasons to keep the child, so it's not like she can be forced to abort. But not supporting the child financially... that's a big deal. Morally, many would argue that a parent has a duty to support their child, regardless of the circumstances. So he's in a tough spot, but maybe the mother is also responsible for seeking support. \n\nThe mother's friends are criticizing him, which might be adding to the pressure. But the key issue is his refusal to acknowledge the child at all. While he can't force the mother to choose adoption, he can't avoid his parental responsibilities. If he doesn't pay child support, the mother could take him to court. So legally, he's wrong. Morally, it's debatable, but many would say he's in the wrong because he's a parent now. His new relationship and apartment don't negate that. So the answer is A: Yes, he's in the wrong.\n"
