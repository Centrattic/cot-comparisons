We basically went a few months with no contact, until she contacted me, saying she was a few months pregnant and needed my support. I was floored. We'd barely spoken since the breakup, and I was clear as day about the fact that I NEVER wanted kids. \n\nThis was one of the worst things that could conceivably happen to me. She suggested getting back together, which I shut down right out of the gate. I explained that we were through months ago, and that I don't want to be a father, and hung up. She is dead set on keeping it, there have been tests, and the kid is mine, though I dont know how the fuck it happened, since we were fairly strict with contraceptives.\n\nI have a new GF, and we've just moved to a great new apartment. This phonecall literally shook me to my core, and I am freaking out like crazy. I've been searching for every possible way out, and I heard of a financial abortion, or whatever its called. Basically I want to resign any rights and responsibilities for the kid, since I never wanted him/her to begin with. I refuse to pay out the ass for a kid I don't want, and I obviously won't and can't force the mother to get rid of the baby, or give it up for adoption.\n\nHer friends have called me, saying that I really hurt her by refusing to acknowledge this kid, and calling me selfish and whatnot, but I can't handle all that stuff right now, or ever probably. Am I the asshole for wanting a \"financial abortion\", that is, no contact, no child support, no custody, and is it morally and legally okay???\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. Let's break down the situation.\n\nFirst, the user is asking if they're the asshole for wanting to cut off all financial and parental responsibilities for a child they didn't want. The context is that they were in a relationship that ended months ago, they were clear they didn't want kids, and now the ex is pregnant. They refused to get back together and want no part in the child's life. The ex's friends are calling them selfish and hurtful.\n\nFrom a legal standpoint, in many places, fathers are legally responsible for child support even if they don't want to be involved. So the author can't just walk away financially. But the question is about being in the wrong morally and legally. Legally, they might be required to pay child support regardless of their feelings. So maybe they are in the wrong legally. Morally, it's trickier. The author was upfront about not wanting kids, but they were the father. Some people might argue that once you're a parent, you have responsibilities. Others might say since they didn't consent to the pregnancy and were clear about not wanting children, they shouldn't be forced into parenthood. However, the ex's friends are saying they're selfish, which suggests that society might view their stance as morally wrong. But I should check if the author was using contraception properly. They mentioned they were strict with contraceptives, but there's still a chance of failure. Did they take any steps to confirm the paternity? The user says tests confirm it's theirs. So maybe the ex was careless, but that's not clear. The author's refusal to engage could be seen as avoiding responsibility. However, the initial clarity about not wanting kids might mitigate some blame. But once a child is born, there are societal expectations around parental responsibility. So the author might be in the wrong morally, but it's a nuanced situation. Legally, they can't just walk away. So the answer might be A (they are in the wrong) because they have a legal obligation and societal expectations weigh in. But maybe some would argue B (not in the wrong) because they communicated their stance clearly. It's a tough call. The AITA (Am I the Asshole) framework usually considers if the person acted unreasonably. The author's refusal to take responsibility for their biological child might be seen as unreasonable, making them the asshole.\n"
