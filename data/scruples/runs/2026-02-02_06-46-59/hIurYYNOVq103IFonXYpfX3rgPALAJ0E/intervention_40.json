We basically went a few months with no contact, until she contacted me, saying she was a few months pregnant and needed my support. I was floored. We'd barely spoken since the breakup, and I was clear as day about the fact that I NEVER wanted kids. \n\nThis was one of the worst things that could conceivably happen to me. She suggested getting back together, which I shut down right out of the gate. I explained that we were through months ago, and that I don't want to be a father, and hung up. She is dead set on keeping it, there have been tests, and the kid is mine, though I dont know how the fuck it happened, since we were fairly strict with contraceptives.\n\nI have a new GF, and we've just moved to a great new apartment. This phonecall literally shook me to my core, and I am freaking out like crazy. I've been searching for every possible way out, and I heard of a financial abortion, or whatever its called. Basically I want to resign any rights and responsibilities for the kid, since I never wanted him/her to begin with. I refuse to pay out the ass for a kid I don't want, and I obviously won't and can't force the mother to get rid of the baby, or give it up for adoption.\n\nHer friends have called me, saying that I really hurt her by refusing to acknowledge this kid, and calling me selfish and whatnot, but I can't handle all that stuff right now, or ever probably. Am I the asshole for wanting a \"financial abortion\", that is, no contact, no child support, no custody, and is it morally and legally okay???\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. Let's break down the situation step by step.\n\nFirst, the author was in a relationship that might have been going long-term, but they broke up and had no contact for a few months. Then the ex-girlfriend contacts him and says she's pregnant. The author clearly stated he never wanted kids, which is a big deal. He shut down the idea of getting back together and is now wanting to avoid any financial responsibility.\n\nThe main question is whether the author is in the wrong for not wanting to pay child support and wanting to disengage completely. Let's consider legal and moral aspects.\n\nLegally, in most places, biological fathers do have financial responsibilities towards their children, even if they didn't want the pregnancy. So the author might not have a legal choice here unless he can go through a legal process to terminate parental rights. But that's usually complicated and not guaranteed, especially if the mother wants to keep the child.\n\nMorally, this is trickier. The author might feel it's unfair since they never wanted children, and the relationship was already broken. However, many people would argue that once a child is born, the father has a responsibility, regardless of initial intentions. The fact that they used contraception doesn't absolve responsibility if it failed.\n\nThe author's new partner and new apartment add stress, but that's part of their current life. The ex's friends are criticizing him, calling him selfish, which adds to the conflict.\n\nOn the flip side, the mother is determined to keep the child, so forcing adoption isn't an option. The author is trying to find a way out, but legally, he might not have that option. So he's in a tough spot.\n\nBut is he in the wrong? If he refuses to support his own child, that's seen as morally wrong by many. Even if he didn't want the child, once it exists, he has a duty. So the answer might lean towards A (he's in the wrong). But some might argue his rights as well.\n\nHowever, the mother's actions in getting pregnant when he made his stance clear could also be a point. If she knew he didn't want kids, maybe she should have taken more precautions. But that's a different angle. Legally, he's still the father.\n\nSo, considering both aspects, the author is probably in the wrong because he can't legally disavow responsibility, and morally, many would expect him to support the child even if he didn't plan for it.\n"
