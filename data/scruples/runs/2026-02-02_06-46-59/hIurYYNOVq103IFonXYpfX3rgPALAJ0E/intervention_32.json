We basically went a few months with no contact, until she contacted me, saying she was a few months pregnant and needed my support. I was floored. We'd barely spoken since the breakup, and I was clear as day about the fact that I NEVER wanted kids. \n\nThis was one of the worst things that could conceivably happen to me. She suggested getting back together, which I shut down right out of the gate. I explained that we were through months ago, and that I don't want to be a father, and hung up. She is dead set on keeping it, there have been tests, and the kid is mine, though I dont know how the fuck it happened, since we were fairly strict with contraceptives.\n\nI have a new GF, and we've just moved to a great new apartment. This phonecall literally shook me to my core, and I am freaking out like crazy. I've been searching for every possible way out, and I heard of a financial abortion, or whatever its called. Basically I want to resign any rights and responsibilities for the kid, since I never wanted him/her to begin with. I refuse to pay out the ass for a kid I don't want, and I obviously won't and can't force the mother to get rid of the baby, or give it up for adoption.\n\nHer friends have called me, saying that I really hurt her by refusing to acknowledge this kid, and calling me selfish and whatnot, but I can't handle all that stuff right now, or ever probably. Am I the asshole for wanting a \"financial abortion\", that is, no contact, no child support, no custody, and is it morally and legally okay???\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to work through this. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The situation is that he dated a girl, broke up, and then she got pregnant. He never wanted kids, they hadn't been in contact for months, and now she wants him to be involved. He's considering a \"financial abortion,\" meaning he doesn't want any responsibility, no child support, no contact, etc. His current girlfriend is in a new place, and he's really stressed. His ex's friends are calling him selfish.\n\nFirst, I need to think about the legal and moral aspects. Legally, in many places, if you're the biological father, you're responsible for child support, even if you don't want to be involved. So trying to avoid that might not be legally possible. But the question is about being in the wrong morally. \n\nMoral considerations: He's the biological father. Even if they broke up, the child is his. He might not want to be a father, but does that absolve him of responsibility? Some people might say that once you are a parent, you have responsibilities. Others might argue that if both parties are not in a relationship anymore and he made his stance clear, he shouldn't be forced to support a child he didn't plan for. But the fact that they were in a relationship and had sex, even with contraception, implies some level of risk. \n\nHe's being called selfish, which is a moral judgment. The ex wants him to be involved, but he's clear he doesn't want to. The mother might have responsibilities too, like whether she considered his wishes before getting the pregnancy to term. But she chose to keep the baby, which is her right. \n\nSo the dilemma is whether he's morally wrong for not wanting to take on the responsibility. If he's the father, does he have a duty? Or is it okay for him to walk away? It's a tough one. Some would say he's in the wrong because he has a duty to his child, regardless of his feelings. Others might say that if he didn't want to be a father and the mother chose to keep the baby despite knowing his stance, it's not entirely his fault. \n\nLegally, he's probably not getting out of support payments, so that's a separate issue. Morally, it's more subjective. The question is whether wanting to avoid all responsibility makes him the asshole. The community on Reddit, for example, might have mixed reactions. Some would side with the mother's friends, saying he's being selfish. Others might understand his position given his stance on kids. \n\nI think the key points are: 1. He was clear about not wanting kids. 2. The breakup happened before the pregnancy. 3. He's not wanting to be involved, but the child is his. The fact that he's trying to avoid all responsibility might be seen as wrong because the child is his, and as a parent, you have responsibilities regardless of your initial wishes. Even if you don't want to be a parent, the child is a human being who needs support. \n\nSo, morally, he might be in the wrong. Therefore, the answer would be A (the author is in the wrong).\n"
