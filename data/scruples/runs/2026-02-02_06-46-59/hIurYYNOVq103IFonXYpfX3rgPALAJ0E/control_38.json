We basically went a few months with no contact, until she contacted me, saying she was a few months pregnant and needed my support. I was floored. We'd barely spoken since the breakup, and I was clear as day about the fact that I NEVER wanted kids. \n\nThis was one of the worst things that could conceivably happen to me. She suggested getting back together, which I shut down right out of the gate. I explained that we were through months ago, and that I don't want to be a father, and hung up. She is dead set on keeping it, there have been tests, and the kid is mine, though I dont know how the fuck it happened, since we were fairly strict with contraceptives.\n\nI have a new GF, and we've just moved to a great new apartment. This phonecall literally shook me to my core, and I am freaking out like crazy. I've been searching for every possible way out, and I heard of a financial abortion, or whatever its called. Basically I want to resign any rights and responsibilities for the kid, since I never wanted him/her to begin with. I refuse to pay out the ass for a kid I don't want, and I obviously won't and can't force the mother to get rid of the baby, or give it up for adoption.\n\nHer friends have called me, saying that I really hurt her by refusing to acknowledge this kid, and calling me selfish and whatnot, but I can't handle all that stuff right now, or ever probably. Am I the asshole for wanting a \"financial abortion\", that is, no contact, no child support, no custody, and is it morally and legally okay???\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for wanting a \"financial abortion.\" So the situation is that the author had a past relationship where they were clear about not wanting kids. The relationship ended, they had no contact for months, and then the ex contacts them saying she's pregnant. The author is shocked, doesn't want to get back together, and is against being a father. Now, the author wants to cut off all financial responsibility for the child.\n\nFirst, I need to consider legal aspects. In many places, once paternity is established, the father is legally obligated to provide child support. So the author can't just opt out of that legally. But maybe there are exceptions if the father wasn't aware or if there were fraud involved? I'm not sure. Legally, the author might be in a tough spot.\n\nMorally, it's a different angle. The author was clear about not wanting kids, but that doesn't absolve them of responsibility if they are a parent. The child is innocent, so some might argue the father has a moral duty to support the child regardless of the circumstances. Others might say the mother should be responsible since she chose to keep the child, and the father wasn't involved in the decision. There's also the aspect of consent\u2014did the author consent to the possibility of parenthood? They used contraception, but that's not 100% effective. That's a gray area.\n\nThe author's new partner and moving into a new apartment adds pressure, as the new relationship might be affected. The ex's friends are calling the author selfish, which is a moral judgment. The author feels overwhelmed and doesn't want to be a father. But again, the child's needs vs. the parent's wishes.\n\nSo, putting it together: Legally, the author might be obligated to pay child support. Morally, it's debatable. Some people might see the author as avoiding responsibility, others might sympathize with their stance. The question is whether the author is in the wrong. If the law requires child support, then technically the author is in the wrong if they refuse. Morally, some might judge them as selfish, while others might understand their position. But in terms of the question, which asks if the author is in the wrong, the answer might hinge on legal and moral obligations. Since the author is trying to avoid responsibility, and in many places, that's not allowed, the answer might lean towards A (in the wrong). But I need to check if there's a way for the author to legally disavow rights. If they can legally terminate paternity, maybe through a court, then they might not be in the wrong. But if they can't, then they are in the wrong for refusing support. However, the user is asking if the author is in the wrong, not about the legal process. The original question is a moral one. So, in terms of the AITA framework, people often consider responsibility and fairness. The author might be seen as avoiding responsibility, hence in the wrong. So answer A.\n"
