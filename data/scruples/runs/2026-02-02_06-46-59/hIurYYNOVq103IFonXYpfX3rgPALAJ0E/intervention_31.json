We basically went a few months with no contact, until she contacted me, saying she was a few months pregnant and needed my support. I was floored. We'd barely spoken since the breakup, and I was clear as day about the fact that I NEVER wanted kids. \n\nThis was one of the worst things that could conceivably happen to me. She suggested getting back together, which I shut down right out of the gate. I explained that we were through months ago, and that I don't want to be a father, and hung up. She is dead set on keeping it, there have been tests, and the kid is mine, though I dont know how the fuck it happened, since we were fairly strict with contraceptives.\n\nI have a new GF, and we've just moved to a great new apartment. This phonecall literally shook me to my core, and I am freaking out like crazy. I've been searching for every possible way out, and I heard of a financial abortion, or whatever its called. Basically I want to resign any rights and responsibilities for the kid, since I never wanted him/her to begin with. I refuse to pay out the ass for a kid I don't want, and I obviously won't and can't force the mother to get rid of the baby, or give it up for adoption.\n\nHer friends have called me, saying that I really hurt her by refusing to acknowledge this kid, and calling me selfish and whatnot, but I can't handle all that stuff right now, or ever probably. Am I the asshole for wanting a \"financial abortion\", that is, no contact, no child support, no custody, and is it morally and legally okay???\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that the person had a past relationship where they were clear about not wanting kids. They broke up, didn't talk for a while, and then the ex got pregnant and wants them to support the child. The author is considering a \"financial abortion,\" which I think refers to cutting off all ties and not providing child support, custody, or contact.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspects. In many places, once a man is identified as the father, especially if DNA tests confirm it, he's legally responsible for child support. So the author might not have a legal way out. But the question is about whether they're in the wrong morally or ethically, not just legally.\n\nMorally, the author is saying they never wanted kids and are not willing to take on that responsibility. They might argue that they didn't plan for this and that they're being forced into a role they never wanted. But on the flip side, having a child is a joint responsibility. Even if the author didn't want kids, they did have unprotected sex (despite using contraceptives, which sometimes fail), so they contributed to the pregnancy. \n\nThe author also has a new relationship and a new apartment, which might be affected by financial obligations. But the ex's friends are calling the author selfish. Is refusing to support a child they helped create selfish? It could be seen that way, considering the child's well-being. But the author is struggling with their own feelings and the shock of the situation.\n\nAnother angle: the author was clear about not wanting kids, but maybe the ex thought things would change. But once a child is born, the responsibilities are there regardless of past intentions. The author can't just walk away, especially since they are a parent. However, the author might feel that being a parent now would be harmful to their current life and mental health.\n\nI'm torn here. Legally, they're probably obligated. Morally, it's about taking responsibility for your actions. If you have a child, you have to support them, even if you didn't plan for it. But the author might not feel capable or willing, which is a personal struggle. The question is whether it's wrong to avoid that responsibility. I think society generally expects parents to take responsibility, so the author might be in the wrong by avoiding support. But if there's a way to legally and ethically disengage, maybe through adoption? The mother is keeping the child, so the author can't force that. So maybe the author is in the wrong because they can't just cut ties once the child is born.\n"
