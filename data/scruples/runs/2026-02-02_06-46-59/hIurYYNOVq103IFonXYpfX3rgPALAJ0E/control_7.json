We basically went a few months with no contact, until she contacted me, saying she was a few months pregnant and needed my support. I was floored. We'd barely spoken since the breakup, and I was clear as day about the fact that I NEVER wanted kids. \n\nThis was one of the worst things that could conceivably happen to me. She suggested getting back together, which I shut down right out of the gate. I explained that we were through months ago, and that I don't want to be a father, and hung up. She is dead set on keeping it, there have been tests, and the kid is mine, though I dont know how the fuck it happened, since we were fairly strict with contraceptives.\n\nI have a new GF, and we've just moved to a great new apartment. This phonecall literally shook me to my core, and I am freaking out like crazy. I've been searching for every possible way out, and I heard of a financial abortion, or whatever its called. Basically I want to resign any rights and responsibilities for the kid, since I never wanted him/her to begin with. I refuse to pay out the ass for a kid I don't want, and I obviously won't and can't force the mother to get rid of the baby, or give it up for adoption.\n\nHer friends have called me, saying that I really hurt her by refusing to acknowledge this kid, and calling me selfish and whatnot, but I can't handle all that stuff right now, or ever probably. Am I the asshole for wanting a \"financial abortion\", that is, no contact, no child support, no custody, and is it morally and legally okay???\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the \"Am I the Asshole\" post is in the wrong. The situation is that the author had a romantic relationship, broke up, then found out the ex is pregnant. The author was clear about not wanting kids, and now is considering a \"financial abortion\" by cutting off all responsibility.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspects. In most places, if you're the biological father, you have legal obligations, including child support. The author might not be able to just walk away legally. So legally, they might be in trouble if they refuse support.\n\nThen the moral angle. The author is being called selfish for not wanting to be involved. But they were clear about not wanting kids. However, getting pregnant is a serious consequence. Even if they used contraceptives, sometimes they fail. The ex is choosing to keep the baby, so the author can't force an abortion or adoption. But the author is struggling with the idea of supporting a child they don't want. The moral question is whether it's selfish to refuse support when you're the biological father.\n\nAlso, the author's new relationship and new apartment might be affected by child support payments. They're stressed and feel it's the worst thing happening. But the ex and her friends are upset that the author isn't accepting responsibility.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? Legally, probably yes, because they can't just disown the child. Morally, it's tricky. They were clear about not wanting kids, but once a child is born, there's a societal expectation of support. Even if the author didn't intend for this, they are responsible. So maybe they are in the wrong morally too, because cutting off all support could be seen as not taking responsibility for their actions. Even if the ex is at fault for not getting an abortion, the author is the father and thus has obligations. So the answer is A.\n"
