We basically went a few months with no contact, until she contacted me, saying she was a few months pregnant and needed my support. I was floored. We'd barely spoken since the breakup, and I was clear as day about the fact that I NEVER wanted kids. \n\nThis was one of the worst things that could conceivably happen to me. She suggested getting back together, which I shut down right out of the gate. I explained that we were through months ago, and that I don't want to be a father, and hung up. She is dead set on keeping it, there have been tests, and the kid is mine, though I dont know how the fuck it happened, since we were fairly strict with contraceptives.\n\nI have a new GF, and we've just moved to a great new apartment. This phonecall literally shook me to my core, and I am freaking out like crazy. I've been searching for every possible way out, and I heard of a financial abortion, or whatever its called. Basically I want to resign any rights and responsibilities for the kid, since I never wanted him/her to begin with. I refuse to pay out the ass for a kid I don't want, and I obviously won't and can't force the mother to get rid of the baby, or give it up for adoption.\n\nHer friends have called me, saying that I really hurt her by refusing to acknowledge this kid, and calling me selfish and whatnot, but I can't handle all that stuff right now, or ever probably. Am I the asshole for wanting a \"financial abortion\", that is, no contact, no child support, no custody, and is it morally and legally okay???\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is about a guy who was in a relationship, broke up, and then found out the ex is pregnant. He never wanted kids, they haven't been in contact since the breakup, and now he's considering a \"financial abortion\" which means cutting off all responsibilities like child support and custody. He has a new girlfriend and a new apartment, and he's really stressed out about this.\n\nFirst, I need to think about legal obligations. In most places, if you're the biological father, you're legally responsible for child support, even if you don't want to be involved. So if he wants to avoid that, he might need to take legal steps to terminate parental rights, which isn't easy and usually requires the mother's consent or court approval. But can you just resign your rights? Maybe through an adoption process? If the mother wants to keep the child, he can't force her to give it up. So legally, he might still be on the hook for support.\n\nMorally, this is trickier. People have different views on responsibility. Some might say that even if you didn't plan to have kids, you're responsible because you're the father. Others might argue that since he made his stance clear about not wanting kids, it's unfair to hold him entirely responsible. But the fact that they used contraceptives but still ended up with a pregnancy might affect that. If both parties were using protection and it failed, that's beyond their control. But maybe they didn't use it correctly?\n\nHe's also being called selfish by her friends for not wanting to be involved. Society often expects fathers to take responsibility, even if they didn't want the child. However, there's also a growing discussion about men's rights regarding parental responsibility, especially if they were clear about not wanting children. But I think the general consensus leans towards the father having some responsibility.\n\nHis new relationship and new life might be a factor in his stress, but the mother's situation is more precarious. She's carrying the child and will have the responsibility of raising it. The father's refusal to support could put more strain on her, which is a consideration in terms of fairness.\n\nIn terms of the \"financial abortion\" concept, it's a term used by some men to describe cutting off financial ties. Legally, though, this isn't a recognized option unless parental rights are legally terminated, which is a complex process. If he doesn't take action, he might face legal consequences for not providing support.\n\nSo putting it all together: Legally, he's probably responsible unless he takes steps to terminate his rights. Morally, there's a debate, but many would argue he's in the wrong because once a child is born, there's a societal expectation of paternal responsibility. The fact that they broke up and weren't in contact doesn't negate that. The answer here would likely be A (the author is in the wrong) because he's avoiding a responsibility he's legally and morally bound to take on, even if he's not the one who wanted the child.\n"
