We basically went a few months with no contact, until she contacted me, saying she was a few months pregnant and needed my support. I was floored. We'd barely spoken since the breakup, and I was clear as day about the fact that I NEVER wanted kids. \n\nThis was one of the worst things that could conceivably happen to me. She suggested getting back together, which I shut down right out of the gate. I explained that we were through months ago, and that I don't want to be a father, and hung up. She is dead set on keeping it, there have been tests, and the kid is mine, though I dont know how the fuck it happened, since we were fairly strict with contraceptives.\n\nI have a new GF, and we've just moved to a great new apartment. This phonecall literally shook me to my core, and I am freaking out like crazy. I've been searching for every possible way out, and I heard of a financial abortion, or whatever its called. Basically I want to resign any rights and responsibilities for the kid, since I never wanted him/her to begin with. I refuse to pay out the ass for a kid I don't want, and I obviously won't and can't force the mother to get rid of the baby, or give it up for adoption.\n\nHer friends have called me, saying that I really hurt her by refusing to acknowledge this kid, and calling me selfish and whatnot, but I can't handle all that stuff right now, or ever probably. Am I the asshole for wanting a \"financial abortion\", that is, no contact, no child support, no custody, and is it morally and legally okay???\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that the person had a past relationship where they were clear about not wanting kids. They broke up, had no contact for months, and then the ex reaches out saying she's pregnant. The author doesn't want to get back together and is against supporting the child financially. They're considering a \"financial abortion\" to avoid child support and any responsibilities.\n\nFirst, I need to think about the legal aspects. In many places, if you're the biological father, you're legally responsible for child support, even if you don't want to be involved. I remember that in the US, for example, a father can't just opt out of responsibility; he has to go through the legal system to terminate parental rights, which is a big deal and not easy. So legally, the author might not be able to just walk away without facing consequences.\n\nThen there's the moral aspect. The author was in a relationship where they were clear about not wanting kids, but the ex is now pregnant. The key point here is whether the author's actions were responsible. They used contraceptives, but sometimes they fail. However, even with that, the author is now facing the consequences of an unintended pregnancy. The ex wants to keep the baby, and the author is refusing to be involved. From a moral standpoint, some might argue that paternity comes with certain responsibilities, regardless of the circumstances. On the other hand, the author is in a new relationship and is stressed about their current situation. It's understandable they don't want to take on parental responsibilities they never agreed to.\n\nThe ex's friends are calling the author selfish, which adds to the social pressure. But is the author actually in the wrong? Legally, they might be if they don't pay child support. But morally, it's a bit of a gray area. The author was clear about their stance on kids, so the ex might have known. However, once the child is born, the legal obligations are there. The author's refusal to engage could be seen as irresponsible, but they might feel they're being forced into a role they never wanted. \n\nAlso, considering the financial aspects, the author is in a new place and doesn't want to be tied down financially. But again, the law doesn't typically allow for opting out of child support. So while the author's feelings are valid, the legal and moral implications mean they might be in the wrong if they don't fulfill their obligations. The key here is whether the author can legally disengage and the moral stance on parental responsibility.\n"
