We basically went a few months with no contact, until she contacted me, saying she was a few months pregnant and needed my support. I was floored. We'd barely spoken since the breakup, and I was clear as day about the fact that I NEVER wanted kids. \n\nThis was one of the worst things that could conceivably happen to me. She suggested getting back together, which I shut down right out of the gate. I explained that we were through months ago, and that I don't want to be a father, and hung up. She is dead set on keeping it, there have been tests, and the kid is mine, though I dont know how the fuck it happened, since we were fairly strict with contraceptives.\n\nI have a new GF, and we've just moved to a great new apartment. This phonecall literally shook me to my core, and I am freaking out like crazy. I've been searching for every possible way out, and I heard of a financial abortion, or whatever its called. Basically I want to resign any rights and responsibilities for the kid, since I never wanted him/her to begin with. I refuse to pay out the ass for a kid I don't want, and I obviously won't and can't force the mother to get rid of the baby, or give it up for adoption.\n\nHer friends have called me, saying that I really hurt her by refusing to acknowledge this kid, and calling me selfish and whatnot, but I can't handle all that stuff right now, or ever probably. Am I the asshole for wanting a \"financial abortion\", that is, no contact, no child support, no custody, and is it morally and legally okay???\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for wanting a financial abortion, meaning not paying child support, no contact, etc. \n\nFirst, legal perspective. In most places, once a man is determined to be the legal father, he's required to pay child support. So the author can't just walk away legally. He might need to go through a legal process to disestablish paternity, but that's tough if the mother doesn't agree. So legally, he might not have a choice.\n\nMoral angle. This is trickier. The author was clear they didn't want kids, but the pregnancy happened. The mother is keeping the child, and the author is being asked to support it. Some people might say that as a father, even if you didn't want the child, you have a responsibility. Others might argue that the mother also shares responsibility for using contraception. \n\nThe author mentions they had a breakup and no contact for months. The mother contacting him to reconnect and then revealing the pregnancy could complicate things. If the author had continued the relationship, maybe he'd have different expectations, but he shut down the idea of getting back together. So maybe he doesn't feel responsible for the child because he's not part of the parent's life anymore.\n\nHowever, if the child is his, legally and ethically, he might still be expected to support it financially. The mother's friends calling him selfish could be valid if he's refusing to support his child. But if the child isn't his, maybe he should check DNA tests again. But he says tests confirmed paternity.\n\nThe author is stressed because of his new relationship and new apartment. That's understandable, but that doesn't mean he's not responsible. The question is whether refusing support is moral. Some might say yes, others no. Legally, he's probably in the wrong if he refuses to pay. Morally, it's a toss-up. He didn't want the child, but once it's born, he's a father. However, if he can legally disestablish paternity, maybe that's possible, but without the mother's consent, it's hard.\n\nSo, the answer depends on perspective. Legally, he's in the wrong if he doesn't pay. Morally, it's less clear but many would argue he has a responsibility. So, the author is in the wrong because he's avoiding his responsibilities, even if he didn't want the child.\n"
