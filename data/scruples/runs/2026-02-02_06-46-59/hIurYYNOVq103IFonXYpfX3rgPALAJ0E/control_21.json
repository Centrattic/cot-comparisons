We basically went a few months with no contact, until she contacted me, saying she was a few months pregnant and needed my support. I was floored. We'd barely spoken since the breakup, and I was clear as day about the fact that I NEVER wanted kids. \n\nThis was one of the worst things that could conceivably happen to me. She suggested getting back together, which I shut down right out of the gate. I explained that we were through months ago, and that I don't want to be a father, and hung up. She is dead set on keeping it, there have been tests, and the kid is mine, though I dont know how the fuck it happened, since we were fairly strict with contraceptives.\n\nI have a new GF, and we've just moved to a great new apartment. This phonecall literally shook me to my core, and I am freaking out like crazy. I've been searching for every possible way out, and I heard of a financial abortion, or whatever its called. Basically I want to resign any rights and responsibilities for the kid, since I never wanted him/her to begin with. I refuse to pay out the ass for a kid I don't want, and I obviously won't and can't force the mother to get rid of the baby, or give it up for adoption.\n\nHer friends have called me, saying that I really hurt her by refusing to acknowledge this kid, and calling me selfish and whatnot, but I can't handle all that stuff right now, or ever probably. Am I the asshole for wanting a \"financial abortion\", that is, no contact, no child support, no custody, and is it morally and legally okay???\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, so I need to figure out if the person in this situation is in the wrong. Let me start by breaking down the details.\n\nThe user dated a girl for a few months, and it seemed like it could be long-term. Then they broke up and had no contact for months. The girl got pregnant and approached him, wanting him to be involved. The user never wanted kids and made that clear. He refused to get back together and doesn't want any responsibility for the child. Now he's considering a \"financial abortion,\" which means cutting off all ties and not paying child support. His girlfriend and new apartment are mentioned, implying he might be in a stable situation but the news of the pregnancy caused major stress.\n\nFirst, legally, in most places, fathers have financial responsibilities regardless of their willingness. So he probably can't just avoid child support. But the question is about whether he's in the wrong morally and socially, not just legally. The user is clear he doesn't want kids, which is his personal choice. However, since the child is his, does he have a moral obligation to support it even if he doesn't want to be a parent?\n\nOn one hand, he made his stance on not wanting kids clear before the breakup. The pregnancy happened after they had already separated. The ex-girlfriend might have assumed there was a chance of reconciliation or that he'd be involved. But the user isn't the one who continued the relationship post-breakup; she did by contacting him. \n\nThe friends of the ex are calling him selfish. But is it selfish to not want to take on parenthood when he's made that clear? People have different values. However, society often expects fathers to support their children, even if they don't want to be involved. So maybe he's seen as selfish because he's prioritizing his own desires over the child's well-being. \n\nBut then, if the mother is keeping the child and has the means, maybe the father's refusal to pay isn't as black and white. However, financially supporting a child isn't just about the father's wants; it's about the child's needs. Legally, he's likely obligated, and morally, some would argue he should contribute. \n\nThe user is also stressed and in a new relationship, which might be valid reasons for his resistance. But his decision to cut ties entirely might be seen as abandoning responsibility. The key points are his clear prior stance on not wanting kids, the unexpected pregnancy after a breakup, and his current position of refusing all responsibility. \n\nSo considering all that, is he in the wrong? Legally, yes, he probably has responsibilities. Morally, it's a gray area. If he's against the pregnancy and doesn't want to be a parent, but the mother is keeping the child, the moral judgment might depend on societal norms. Some might see him as responsible for his actions, others as being in a tough spot. But in terms of the \"AITA\" (Am I the Asshole) context, the community often looks at intentions and circumstances. Since the user made his stance clear, the pregnancy was unexpected, and he's not engaging in coercion or manipulation, maybe he's not entirely in the wrong. But the idea of not supporting a child he's had no role in creating might make him the asshole in the eyes of some. \n\nI think the answer leans towards A (he's in the wrong) because, despite his intentions, he's a parent now and has a responsibility. But others might argue B because he didn't consent to the pregnancy and made his views known. However, in most legal and ethical frameworks, biological parents have obligations. So the answer is likely A.\n"
