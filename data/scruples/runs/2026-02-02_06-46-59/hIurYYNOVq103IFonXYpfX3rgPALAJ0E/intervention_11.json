We basically went a few months with no contact, until she contacted me, saying she was a few months pregnant and needed my support. I was floored. We'd barely spoken since the breakup, and I was clear as day about the fact that I NEVER wanted kids. \n\nThis was one of the worst things that could conceivably happen to me. She suggested getting back together, which I shut down right out of the gate. I explained that we were through months ago, and that I don't want to be a father, and hung up. She is dead set on keeping it, there have been tests, and the kid is mine, though I dont know how the fuck it happened, since we were fairly strict with contraceptives.\n\nI have a new GF, and we've just moved to a great new apartment. This phonecall literally shook me to my core, and I am freaking out like crazy. I've been searching for every possible way out, and I heard of a financial abortion, or whatever its called. Basically I want to resign any rights and responsibilities for the kid, since I never wanted him/her to begin with. I refuse to pay out the ass for a kid I don't want, and I obviously won't and can't force the mother to get rid of the baby, or give it up for adoption.\n\nHer friends have called me, saying that I really hurt her by refusing to acknowledge this kid, and calling me selfish and whatnot, but I can't handle all that stuff right now, or ever probably. Am I the asshole for wanting a \"financial abortion\", that is, no contact, no child support, no custody, and is it morally and legally okay???\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the \"AITA\" post is in the wrong. The situation involves an unexpected pregnancy after a breakup, and the author wants to disengage financially and emotionally.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspects. In many places, fathers have legal obligations to provide child support, regardless of their wishes. So if the author is trying to avoid that, they might be legally in trouble. But maybe they don't know about the laws yet. Legally, they might not have the option to just walk away.\n\nThen there's the moral angle. The author is clear they never wanted kids and don't want to be a father. But the child is theirs, so they have a responsibility, even if it's not wanted. The mother wants to keep the child, so the author can't force an abortion. But they want to avoid all responsibilities. That seems harsh. However, some might argue that the mother should have been more careful with contraceptives, but that's a common argument in these situations. \n\nThe author is also being criticized by the ex's friends for being selfish. The user initially thinks the author is in the wrong. But maybe the author's stance is understandable given their prior statements about not wanting kids. However, once a child is born, there are responsibilities. Even if the author didn't plan for this, they might still have to take responsibility. \n\nThe new relationship and moving into a new apartment show the author is trying to move on, which is valid. But the situation is complicated. The key points are legal obligations and moral responsibilities. Since the author is considering a \"financial abortion,\" which isn't a legal term, but implies avoiding support, that's likely not possible. Legally, they might be forced to pay child support. Morally, some might see it as abandoning a responsibility, while others might empathize with their desire to avoid parenthood. \n\nSo, the answer could be A (author is in the wrong) because they're trying to avoid a responsibility they've incurred, even if unintentionally. But maybe B (not in the wrong) because they clearly communicated their stance earlier, and the situation is a result of circumstances beyond their control. However, once the child is born, they have a duty. I think the consensus would lean towards A because they're refusing all responsibility, which is morally questionable despite their initial wishes.\n"
