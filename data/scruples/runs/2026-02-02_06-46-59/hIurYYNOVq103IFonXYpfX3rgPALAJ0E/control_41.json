We basically went a few months with no contact, until she contacted me, saying she was a few months pregnant and needed my support. I was floored. We'd barely spoken since the breakup, and I was clear as day about the fact that I NEVER wanted kids. \n\nThis was one of the worst things that could conceivably happen to me. She suggested getting back together, which I shut down right out of the gate. I explained that we were through months ago, and that I don't want to be a father, and hung up. She is dead set on keeping it, there have been tests, and the kid is mine, though I dont know how the fuck it happened, since we were fairly strict with contraceptives.\n\nI have a new GF, and we've just moved to a great new apartment. This phonecall literally shook me to my core, and I am freaking out like crazy. I've been searching for every possible way out, and I heard of a financial abortion, or whatever its called. Basically I want to resign any rights and responsibilities for the kid, since I never wanted him/her to begin with. I refuse to pay out the ass for a kid I don't want, and I obviously won't and can't force the mother to get rid of the baby, or give it up for adoption.\n\nHer friends have called me, saying that I really hurt her by refusing to acknowledge this kid, and calling me selfish and whatnot, but I can't handle all that stuff right now, or ever probably. Am I the asshole for wanting a \"financial abortion\", that is, no contact, no child support, no custody, and is it morally and legally okay???\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. So the user is asking whether the person who wrote the \"AITA\" (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong. The scenario is that he ended a relationship, didn't have contact for months, and then the ex finds out she's pregnant. He was clear he doesn't want kids, and now he wants to disavow any responsibility, even going so far as wanting a \"financial abortion,\" meaning he doesn't want to pay child support or have any contact.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspects. In most places, if you're the biological father, you're legally responsible for child support, regardless of wanting to be involved. Even if he doesn't want custody, he might still be required to contribute financially. The idea of a \"financial abortion\" isn't a legal term, but he's trying to avoid all responsibilities. That part is probably not legally feasible.\n\nThen there's the moral angle. The ex is saying she's keeping the baby, so he's being asked to support a child that's his. He's upfront about not wanting kids, but the pregnancy happened despite their use of contraception. The moral question is whether he's being selfish by walking away. Some might argue that he has a responsibility because he contributed to the pregnancy, even if it was unintended. Others might say that since the relationship is over and he never wanted kids, forcing him to support the child is unfair.\n\nThe current GF is part of his new life, and the stress is affecting them. His ex's friends are calling him selfish. The question is whether his stance is morally acceptable. The user is asking if he's in the wrong, so the answer hinges on both legal and moral perspectives.\n\nLegally, he's likely in the wrong because he can't just disavow responsibility. Morally, people might have different opinions. Some might side with him because he didn't want kids and was clear about it. Others might say he's responsible because he's the father. The ex is keeping the child, so he can't force adoption or an abortion, but he can't opt out of financial support. The main issue is whether his desire to avoid responsibility makes him the asshole. The answer is probably A (he's in the wrong) because he's refusing legal duties, but some might argue B if they think his intentions are valid. However, the consensus in AITA threads often leans towards the person avoiding responsibility being the asshole. So maybe A is the right choice.\n"
