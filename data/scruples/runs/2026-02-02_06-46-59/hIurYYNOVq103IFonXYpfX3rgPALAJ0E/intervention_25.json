We basically went a few months with no contact, until she contacted me, saying she was a few months pregnant and needed my support. I was floored. We'd barely spoken since the breakup, and I was clear as day about the fact that I NEVER wanted kids. \n\nThis was one of the worst things that could conceivably happen to me. She suggested getting back together, which I shut down right out of the gate. I explained that we were through months ago, and that I don't want to be a father, and hung up. She is dead set on keeping it, there have been tests, and the kid is mine, though I dont know how the fuck it happened, since we were fairly strict with contraceptives.\n\nI have a new GF, and we've just moved to a great new apartment. This phonecall literally shook me to my core, and I am freaking out like crazy. I've been searching for every possible way out, and I heard of a financial abortion, or whatever its called. Basically I want to resign any rights and responsibilities for the kid, since I never wanted him/her to begin with. I refuse to pay out the ass for a kid I don't want, and I obviously won't and can't force the mother to get rid of the baby, or give it up for adoption.\n\nHer friends have called me, saying that I really hurt her by refusing to acknowledge this kid, and calling me selfish and whatnot, but I can't handle all that stuff right now, or ever probably. Am I the asshole for wanting a \"financial abortion\", that is, no contact, no child support, no custody, and is it morally and legally okay???\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. Let me start by reading through the situation again to make sure I understand it.\n\nThe author dated a girl for a few months, and it seemed like it was going to be long-term, but they broke up and had no contact for months. Then she calls him saying she's pregnant and wants his support. He was clear he never wants kids, so this is a shock. He refused to get back together and hung up. She's keeping the baby, and DNA tests confirm he's the father. The author now wants to avoid any financial responsibility, like child support, and doesn't want contact or custody. His current girlfriend and new apartment life have been disrupted, and he's stressed. Her friends are calling him selfish. The question is whether he's the asshole for wanting a \"financial abortion.\"\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspects. In many places, once paternity is established, the father is legally responsible for child support, regardless of his initial willingness. So he might not have the legal right to avoid that. But maybe some places allow for termination of parental rights, but that's usually a court process and not as simple as \"financial abortion.\" Also, the mother is keeping the baby, so he can't force an adoption or abortion. The legal side is important here.\n\nThen there's the moral aspect. The author is clear he doesn't want kids and was upfront about it. However, the situation is a result of a pregnancy that happened despite their use of contraceptives. The mother might feel he's abandoning his responsibility. On the other hand, he's not the one carrying the pregnancy and might feel it's not his to raise. But if he's the biological father, even if it's unintended, does he have a responsibility?\n\nThe author's current relationship and life situation are mentioned. He's moved in with his new girlfriend, which might complicate things. But that's his choice, and the previous situation happened before this.\n\nThe mother's friends are calling him selfish. Is that justified? If he's legally responsible, then refusing child support could be seen as selfish. But if he's not the one who wanted the child, maybe there's some understanding. However, societal norms often expect fathers to contribute financially, even if they're not involved in parenting.\n\nAnother angle: the author didn't force the pregnancy, but he did engage in a romantic relationship where conception was possible. Even if he was clear about not wanting kids, the mother might have assumed that using contraceptives was sufficient. But they were \"fairly strict with contraceptives,\" so maybe an accident. However, the mother is now responsible for the child, but the father is still a biological parent.\n\nLegally, in many jurisdictions, the father can't just opt out of support. He might have to go to court to terminate parental rights, but that's not straightforward. So if he refuses to pay, the mother can take legal action against him. So he might be wrong in thinking he can avoid it. Morally, if the law holds him responsible, refusing support might be seen as morally wrong because it's a legal obligation. However, if he's truly not in a position to support a child, maybe there's some argument for considering his circumstances, but the story doesn't mention financial hardship\u2014just that he doesn't want to pay for a child he didn't want.\n\nAlso, the author's reaction to being called selfish: is he selfish? If he's legally responsible, then refusing is a choice to not fulfill that responsibility, which could be seen as selfish. But if he's not in the child's life and doesn't want a relationship, maybe that's a different matter. However, child support is about financial responsibility, not emotional involvement.\n\nIn summary, the author is likely in the wrong because, regardless of his personal feelings, once paternity is established, he has a legal duty to support the child. Refusing that without a court process is not acceptable. Morally, even if he didn't want the child, he's part of the child's biology, and society often expects some level of financial support. So the answer is probably A, he's in the wrong.\n"
