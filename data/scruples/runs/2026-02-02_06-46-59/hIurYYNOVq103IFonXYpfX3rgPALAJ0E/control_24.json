We basically went a few months with no contact, until she contacted me, saying she was a few months pregnant and needed my support. I was floored. We'd barely spoken since the breakup, and I was clear as day about the fact that I NEVER wanted kids. \n\nThis was one of the worst things that could conceivably happen to me. She suggested getting back together, which I shut down right out of the gate. I explained that we were through months ago, and that I don't want to be a father, and hung up. She is dead set on keeping it, there have been tests, and the kid is mine, though I dont know how the fuck it happened, since we were fairly strict with contraceptives.\n\nI have a new GF, and we've just moved to a great new apartment. This phonecall literally shook me to my core, and I am freaking out like crazy. I've been searching for every possible way out, and I heard of a financial abortion, or whatever its called. Basically I want to resign any rights and responsibilities for the kid, since I never wanted him/her to begin with. I refuse to pay out the ass for a kid I don't want, and I obviously won't and can't force the mother to get rid of the baby, or give it up for adoption.\n\nHer friends have called me, saying that I really hurt her by refusing to acknowledge this kid, and calling me selfish and whatnot, but I can't handle all that stuff right now, or ever probably. Am I the asshole for wanting a \"financial abortion\", that is, no contact, no child support, no custody, and is it morally and legally okay???\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that he was in a relationship that ended months ago. They mostly stopped talking, and then the ex contacts him saying she's pregnant. He never wanted kids, so this is a huge shock. He turned down getting back together and now wants to avoid all responsibility, like child support, custody, etc. The question is whether he's the asshole for wanting a \"financial abortion.\"\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspects. In many places, fathers have legal responsibilities for their children, including child support, even if they don't want to be involved. Even if he signs away his rights, there might be legal obligations he can't avoid. So maybe he's not legally in the wrong, but legally he might still have to pay. But he's talking about wanting to resign all rights, which might not be possible. Legally, he might be required to pay child support regardless.\n\nThen there's the moral side. People might argue that he's responsible because he's the father. Even if the pregnancy was unintentional, some might say he's being selfish by not supporting the child. Others might say he was clear about not wanting kids, so the ex should have been responsible. But since they were using contraception, the ex might also share some responsibility in not being 100% sure. \n\nThe fact that they broke up months ago is important. If they weren't in a committed ongoing relationship when the pregnancy happened, maybe the expectations of responsibility are different. But the ex contacting him after months of no contact might complicate things. \n\nHe has a new relationship and a new apartment, so suddenly dealing with child support could be a financial burden. However, financial responsibility is part of being a parent, even if he doesn't want the child. \n\nHis ex's friends calling him selfish might be their opinion, but that doesn't determine if he's in the wrong. The key is whether he's acting within his legal rights and if society deems his actions morally acceptable. \n\nIn some states, fathers can disclaim paternity within a certain timeframe, but once the child is born, it's harder. If he wants to disclaim, he might have to go through legal processes, but there's a chance he's still responsible. If he doesn't legally disclaim, he might still be on the hook financially. \n\nSo, the answer depends on whether he's legally required to pay and if society considers his stance morally acceptable. Legally, he might not be in the wrong if he can disclaim, but if he's still bound by law to pay, then he might be in the wrong. Morally, some people might see him as selfish, while others might think he was clear about his desires and isn't responsible because of that. \n\nThe question is whether the author is the asshole. If the community thinks being a father comes with responsibilities regardless of intentions, then he's in the wrong. If they think he was clear and the ex should have considered that, he's not. The answer could be either based on perspectives, but the question is whether he's in the wrong. \n\nIn many cases, people would say he's in the wrong because he is the father and has responsibilities. Even if he didn't want kids, once a child is born, he might be expected to support it. So maybe the answer is A (he's in the wrong), but I'm not 100% sure. Alternatively, if the law allows him to disclaim, then maybe not. But the question is about being in the wrong in terms of moral and legal aspects. \n\nI think the answer is A because, despite his feelings, he might still be legally and morally responsible. But I'm a bit confused because if he can legally disclaim, then he's not. However, the \"AITA\" usually considers societal views, which might lean towards him being an asshole for not stepping up. So maybe A.\n"
