We basically went a few months with no contact, until she contacted me, saying she was a few months pregnant and needed my support. I was floored. We'd barely spoken since the breakup, and I was clear as day about the fact that I NEVER wanted kids. \n\nThis was one of the worst things that could conceivably happen to me. She suggested getting back together, which I shut down right out of the gate. I explained that we were through months ago, and that I don't want to be a father, and hung up. She is dead set on keeping it, there have been tests, and the kid is mine, though I dont know how the fuck it happened, since we were fairly strict with contraceptives.\n\nI have a new GF, and we've just moved to a great new apartment. This phonecall literally shook me to my core, and I am freaking out like crazy. I've been searching for every possible way out, and I heard of a financial abortion, or whatever its called. Basically I want to resign any rights and responsibilities for the kid, since I never wanted him/her to begin with. I refuse to pay out the ass for a kid I don't want, and I obviously won't and can't force the mother to get rid of the baby, or give it up for adoption.\n\nHer friends have called me, saying that I really hurt her by refusing to acknowledge this kid, and calling me selfish and whatnot, but I can't handle all that stuff right now, or ever probably. Am I the asshole for wanting a \"financial abortion\", that is, no contact, no child support, no custody, and is it morally and legally okay???\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking if the person who wrote the \"AITA\" (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong. The situation involves an unexpected pregnancy, a breakup, and the writer wanting to avoid any financial or parental responsibilities.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspects. In many jurisdictions, if a man is determined to be the biological father through testing, he can be legally obligated to pay child support even if he wasn't involved with the mother. The concept of a \"financial abortion\" might involve trying to disclaim paternity, but if tests confirm it's his child, he might not have that option. Legally, he could still be responsible.\n\nThen there's the moral angle. The writer is clear he never wanted kids and doesn't want to be a father. But the mother is determined to keep the baby. Denying child support could impact the child's life, even if he's not part of it. Morally, some might argue that providing financial support is a basic responsibility regardless of the circumstances. Others might see his stance as valid if he's against parenthood and the situation was mishandled earlier.\n\nThe writer's actions after the breakup\u2014no contact, then a call from the mother\u2014show he might not have been proactive in addressing the possibility of a pregnancy. During their relationship, they used contraceptives, but that's not 100% foolproof. The mother's friends are criticizing him as selfish, which could imply a social expectation to support the child. But he's in a new relationship and life situation, which complicates things.\n\nI should check if disclaiming paternity is possible once it's established. If the tests already confirmed his parentage, he might not be able to legally disclaim it. If he can, then he might avoid support, but if not, he could still be held responsible. This varies by country and state, so the answer should consider that generally.\n\nAlso, the writer's immediate refusal to engage or support the child might be seen as dismissive. Morally, some might feel that despite not wanting a relationship, he should contribute financially. Others might agree with his desire to avoid parenthood and the moral expectation of support in such cases.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the answer would need to balance legal obligations (if any) and the moral implications of not supporting the child. The user thinks the author is in the wrong, but I need to assess both sides. Given that he's a biological parent and the mother is keeping the child, he's likely not free from responsibility. Therefore, the author might be in the wrong if he can't disclaim paternity and still refuses support. But if he can legally disclaim without forcing an abortion, maybe not. However, the mother is dead set on keeping the baby, so disclaiming might not be an option. The answer is probably A.\n"
