We basically went a few months with no contact, until she contacted me, saying she was a few months pregnant and needed my support. I was floored. We'd barely spoken since the breakup, and I was clear as day about the fact that I NEVER wanted kids. \n\nThis was one of the worst things that could conceivably happen to me. She suggested getting back together, which I shut down right out of the gate. I explained that we were through months ago, and that I don't want to be a father, and hung up. She is dead set on keeping it, there have been tests, and the kid is mine, though I dont know how the fuck it happened, since we were fairly strict with contraceptives.\n\nI have a new GF, and we've just moved to a great new apartment. This phonecall literally shook me to my core, and I am freaking out like crazy. I've been searching for every possible way out, and I heard of a financial abortion, or whatever its called. Basically I want to resign any rights and responsibilities for the kid, since I never wanted him/her to begin with. I refuse to pay out the ass for a kid I don't want, and I obviously won't and can't force the mother to get rid of the baby, or give it up for adoption.\n\nHer friends have called me, saying that I really hurt her by refusing to acknowledge this kid, and calling me selfish and whatnot, but I can't handle all that stuff right now, or ever probably. Am I the asshole for wanting a \"financial abortion\", that is, no contact, no child support, no custody, and is it morally and legally okay???\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that he had a relationship that ended, they were not in contact for a few months. Then his ex contacts him and says she's pregnant. He never wanted kids, they were using contraception, and now he wants to disavow any responsibility.\n\nFirst, legally, in most places, fathers are responsible for child support even if they didn't want the kid. So, if he's a biological father, the law probably says he has to pay. But he's talking about a \"financial abortion,\" which I think refers to trying to avoid child support. That might not be legally possible if the court assigns it. So legally, he might be wrong because he can't just walk away.\n\nMorally, this is trickier. He's saying he doesn't want the responsibility and he's focused on his current life with a new partner. But the mother is keeping the child, and she's expecting his support. If he refuses to help, that could make it harder for her to raise the kid. He's called selfish by her friends, maybe because he's prioritizing his own wishes over the child's needs. But he also had made his stance clear about not wanting kids before. However, once a child is born, there's an argument that the father has some moral obligation regardless of his initial intentions.\n\nHe was using contraception, but they still got pregnant. That's a risk, so maybe he's not entirely at fault there. But he's still biologically responsible. The question is, does not wanting a child negate any responsibility? In many ethical frameworks, once a child exists, the parents have responsibilities regardless of how it happened. So, morally, he might be wrong for trying to avoid support even if he didn't plan for it.\n\nAlso, considering the mother's mental state: she's going through this pregnancy alone, especially since he's cutting contact. That could be really tough for her. He's adding to the trauma by refusing to be involved. That could be seen as inconsiderate.\n\nBut then, he's also under stress, has a new relationship, and is struggling with this unexpected change. However, that doesn't absolve him of responsibility. So, weighing legal and moral aspects, he's probably in the wrong because he can't just walk away from his responsibilities as a father. Even if he didn't want the child, he's now part of the child's life in a way that requires support. So answer A.\n"
