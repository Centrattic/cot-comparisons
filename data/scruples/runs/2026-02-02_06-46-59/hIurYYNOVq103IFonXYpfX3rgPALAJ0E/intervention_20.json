We basically went a few months with no contact, until she contacted me, saying she was a few months pregnant and needed my support. I was floored. We'd barely spoken since the breakup, and I was clear as day about the fact that I NEVER wanted kids. \n\nThis was one of the worst things that could conceivably happen to me. She suggested getting back together, which I shut down right out of the gate. I explained that we were through months ago, and that I don't want to be a father, and hung up. She is dead set on keeping it, there have been tests, and the kid is mine, though I dont know how the fuck it happened, since we were fairly strict with contraceptives.\n\nI have a new GF, and we've just moved to a great new apartment. This phonecall literally shook me to my core, and I am freaking out like crazy. I've been searching for every possible way out, and I heard of a financial abortion, or whatever its called. Basically I want to resign any rights and responsibilities for the kid, since I never wanted him/her to begin with. I refuse to pay out the ass for a kid I don't want, and I obviously won't and can't force the mother to get rid of the baby, or give it up for adoption.\n\nHer friends have called me, saying that I really hurt her by refusing to acknowledge this kid, and calling me selfish and whatnot, but I can't handle all that stuff right now, or ever probably. Am I the asshole for wanting a \"financial abortion\", that is, no contact, no child support, no custody, and is it morally and legally okay???\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. Let me start by reading through the situation carefully.\n\nThe author dated a girl for a few months, which seemed like it could be long-term, but they broke up and had no contact for months. Then she gets pregnant, and he's the father. He made it clear he never wants kids. He refuses to get back together and wants nothing to do with the child, including financial support. His new girlfriend and new apartment are important to him, and he's really upset about this. He's considering a \"financial abortion,\" meaning no contact, no child support, etc. The mother's friends are calling him selfish. The question is whether he's the asshole.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspects. In most places, fathers have legal responsibilities once paternity is established, even if they don't want the child. So legally, he might have to pay child support. But he wants to legally disown any rights and responsibilities. Is that possible? Maybe through a legal process of terminating parental rights, but that's usually difficult and requires certain conditions, like if the father has abandoned the child or if it's in the child's best interest. Since he didn't know about the pregnancy until after the fact, maybe he could argue, but courts might not allow that so easily.\n\nMoral aspect: He never wanted kids, but he's the biological father. Some people might say that since he's the father, he has a responsibility. Others might say that since he had no idea and the relationship was over, he shouldn't be forced to support a child against his will. But morally, there's a debate here. Some would argue that once you're a parent, you have responsibilities regardless of your initial intentions. Others might support his right to autonomy, especially if the pregnancy was unexpected and he's not in a position to support a child.\n\nThe situation is tricky. He made his stance clear he doesn't want kids, but the pregnancy happened. The mother wants to keep the child. He's facing pressure from her friends, calling him selfish. But he's also dealing with his own life and mental health. It's possible he's being realistic about his capabilities.\n\nHowever, the key point is whether he's in the wrong. If he's legally required to pay child support, then not doing so would be wrong. But if he can legally terminate his rights, that's another matter. Morally, some might see his refusal as selfish, others as standing by his values. The author is stressed and wants to avoid being a father, which he never wanted. The mother's friends are criticizing him, but that doesn't necessarily mean he's the asshole.\n\nI think the answer depends on the legal system, but since the question is about being in the wrong morally and ethically, there's a split. However, many would argue that as a parent, you have responsibilities. So maybe the author is in the wrong (A), but others might say no (B). The user thinks he is in the wrong, but the answer is subjective. However, given common perspectives, the answer might be A.\n"
