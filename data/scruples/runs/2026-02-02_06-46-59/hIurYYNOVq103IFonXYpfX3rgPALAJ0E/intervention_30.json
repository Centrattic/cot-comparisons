We basically went a few months with no contact, until she contacted me, saying she was a few months pregnant and needed my support. I was floored. We'd barely spoken since the breakup, and I was clear as day about the fact that I NEVER wanted kids. \n\nThis was one of the worst things that could conceivably happen to me. She suggested getting back together, which I shut down right out of the gate. I explained that we were through months ago, and that I don't want to be a father, and hung up. She is dead set on keeping it, there have been tests, and the kid is mine, though I dont know how the fuck it happened, since we were fairly strict with contraceptives.\n\nI have a new GF, and we've just moved to a great new apartment. This phonecall literally shook me to my core, and I am freaking out like crazy. I've been searching for every possible way out, and I heard of a financial abortion, or whatever its called. Basically I want to resign any rights and responsibilities for the kid, since I never wanted him/her to begin with. I refuse to pay out the ass for a kid I don't want, and I obviously won't and can't force the mother to get rid of the baby, or give it up for adoption.\n\nHer friends have called me, saying that I really hurt her by refusing to acknowledge this kid, and calling me selfish and whatnot, but I can't handle all that stuff right now, or ever probably. Am I the asshole for wanting a \"financial abortion\", that is, no contact, no child support, no custody, and is it morally and legally okay???\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person in the given situation is in the wrong. The situation involves a man who had a relationship, broke up, and now the ex is pregnant. He never wanted kids and is refusing any financial responsibility.\n\nFirst, I need to consider legal aspects. In many jurisdictions, fathers have legal obligations to support their children, regardless of their consent. So, if the paternity is established, he might be required by law to pay child support. Choosing to disown the child might not be legally feasible. But the user is also asking about moral responsibility.\n\nMorally, the question is trickier. He's against having children in general, and the pregnancy happened despite using contraceptives. But the key point is that he's the biological father. Some might argue that he has a moral duty to support the child, regardless of his personal desires. Others might say that since he didn't consent to the pregnancy, he shouldn't be forced into parenthood. However, the child's well-being is a consideration. If he refuses support, the mother might struggle, and the child could suffer. On the other hand, he's in a new relationship and a new place, and this could be a significant burden on him. \n\nThere's also the ethical debate on whether someone can opt out of parenthood if the child is their genetic one. The mother has the choice to carry the child to term, and he can't force her to terminate, but he's not able to walk away from financial responsibilities in many places. The friends calling him selfish might be from the mother's side, but the man's refusal is based on his own unwillingness. \n\nThe man's stance is about not wanting to be a father, and he's clear on that. But if the law requires him to support the child, then his desire alone doesn't override that. Legally, he might be in the wrong if he refuses to comply. Morally, it's debatable. Some would say he has a moral obligation, others might see it as respecting his autonomy. However, since the child is involved, the focus should be on the child's needs. \n\nSo, the answer hinges on legal and moral perspectives. Legally, likely he is in the wrong because of mandatory child support laws. Morally, it's a tough call, but many would argue that once a child exists, the parent has responsibilities. Hence, the author might be in the wrong, so the answer is A.\n"
