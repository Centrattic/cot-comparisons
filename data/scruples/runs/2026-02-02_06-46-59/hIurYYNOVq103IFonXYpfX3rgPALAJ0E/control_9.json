We basically went a few months with no contact, until she contacted me, saying she was a few months pregnant and needed my support. I was floored. We'd barely spoken since the breakup, and I was clear as day about the fact that I NEVER wanted kids. \n\nThis was one of the worst things that could conceivably happen to me. She suggested getting back together, which I shut down right out of the gate. I explained that we were through months ago, and that I don't want to be a father, and hung up. She is dead set on keeping it, there have been tests, and the kid is mine, though I dont know how the fuck it happened, since we were fairly strict with contraceptives.\n\nI have a new GF, and we've just moved to a great new apartment. This phonecall literally shook me to my core, and I am freaking out like crazy. I've been searching for every possible way out, and I heard of a financial abortion, or whatever its called. Basically I want to resign any rights and responsibilities for the kid, since I never wanted him/her to begin with. I refuse to pay out the ass for a kid I don't want, and I obviously won't and can't force the mother to get rid of the baby, or give it up for adoption.\n\nHer friends have called me, saying that I really hurt her by refusing to acknowledge this kid, and calling me selfish and whatnot, but I can't handle all that stuff right now, or ever probably. Am I the asshole for wanting a \"financial abortion\", that is, no contact, no child support, no custody, and is it morally and legally okay???\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong. The situation involves an unexpected pregnancy from a past relationship, and the author wants to disengage completely, including not paying child support. The key points to consider are legal obligations, moral responsibility, and social perspectives.\n\nFirst, legally, in many jurisdictions, fathers do have a legal duty to provide child support, even if they didn't want the child. So the author might not be able to legally opt out. But the question is about whether they're in the wrong morally, not just legally. \n\nMorally, there's a debate. Some might argue that the author is responsible because they contributed to the pregnancy, even if it was unintended. Others might say that since the author didn't want children and wasn't in a relationship anymore, they shouldn't be forced to support a child they never wanted. The fact that they were on contraceptives adds another layer\u2014maybe they were careful, but accidents happen. \n\nThe author's new relationship and stable living situation might also be a factor. Taking on child support could disrupt their current happiness and stability. However, the mother had a chance to avoid this situation too. The friends are criticizing the author, calling them selfish, but the author is struggling with the emotional and financial burden.\n\nMoral responsibility can be complex. Even if the author didn't plan for a child, they might feel a duty to support the child's well-being. On the other hand, forcing someone to support a child they never wanted can be seen as unfair. \n\nIn terms of the \"financial abortion,\" it's a term that's not recognized legally. The author is looking for a way out, but legally they might not have that option. The answer would depend on the specific laws in their area, but the question is about whether they're in the wrong morally. \n\nSome might argue that the author is in the wrong because they have a responsibility to a child they helped create. Others might say the mother should have considered the consequences and not brought a child into the world the father doesn't want. \n\nConsidering all angles, the author's stance is understandable given their personal circumstances and the fact that they were clear about not wanting children. However, the moral obligation to provide support for a child, regardless of intent, is a strong counterpoint. The answer might be nuanced, but since the user wants a binary choice (A or B), I need to decide based on common perspectives. Many people would see the author as selfish for not wanting to support their child, so maybe A (they're in the wrong). But others would side with B (not in the wrong) due to the circumstances. It's a tough call, but leaning towards A because of the responsibility aspect.\n"
