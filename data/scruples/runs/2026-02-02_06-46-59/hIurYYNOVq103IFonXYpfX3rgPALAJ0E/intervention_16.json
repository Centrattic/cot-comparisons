We basically went a few months with no contact, until she contacted me, saying she was a few months pregnant and needed my support. I was floored. We'd barely spoken since the breakup, and I was clear as day about the fact that I NEVER wanted kids. \n\nThis was one of the worst things that could conceivably happen to me. She suggested getting back together, which I shut down right out of the gate. I explained that we were through months ago, and that I don't want to be a father, and hung up. She is dead set on keeping it, there have been tests, and the kid is mine, though I dont know how the fuck it happened, since we were fairly strict with contraceptives.\n\nI have a new GF, and we've just moved to a great new apartment. This phonecall literally shook me to my core, and I am freaking out like crazy. I've been searching for every possible way out, and I heard of a financial abortion, or whatever its called. Basically I want to resign any rights and responsibilities for the kid, since I never wanted him/her to begin with. I refuse to pay out the ass for a kid I don't want, and I obviously won't and can't force the mother to get rid of the baby, or give it up for adoption.\n\nHer friends have called me, saying that I really hurt her by refusing to acknowledge this kid, and calling me selfish and whatnot, but I can't handle all that stuff right now, or ever probably. Am I the asshole for wanting a \"financial abortion\", that is, no contact, no child support, no custody, and is it morally and legally okay???\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to work through this. The user is asking whether the author of the \"AITA\" post is in the wrong. The situation is that the author had a brief relationship that ended months ago, and then the ex-girlfriend gets pregnant. He didn't want kids, they broke up, and now she wants him to be involved. He's considering a \"financial abortion,\" meaning he doesn't want to pay child support or have any legal ties.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspects. In many places, fathers have legal obligations to provide child support once paternity is established. Even if the father doesn't want to be involved, the law might require him to pay. The author mentions that tests have confirmed he's the father, so legally, he might have no choice. That's a key point. So if he tries to avoid it, he could face legal consequences. That's probably a solid point in determining if he's in the wrong legally.\n\nMoral perspective is trickier. He argues that he never wanted kids and the situation came out of the blue after a breakup. He's in a new relationship and feels this is unfair. But from a moral standpoint, some people might argue that he's responsible for the child's well-being since he's the biological father. Others might say he's not responsible if the pregnancy resulted from a past relationship that ended, especially if they were using contraception. However, the fact that they were using contraception but it failed might not absolve him morally in the eyes of some.\n\nEmotionally, he's clearly stressed and overwhelmed. His new girlfriend and new apartment are part of his current life. But the ex is determined to keep the baby, and her friends are accusing him of being selfish. The user thinks he's in the wrong, but maybe others might see it differently. \n\nLegally, he might be obligated to pay child support regardless of his feelings. Morally, there's a debate between personal responsibility and the right to not have a child. However, in many societies, there's an expectation that fathers support their children, even if they didn't plan for it. So even if he didn't want the child, he might be expected to contribute financially.\n\nAlso, the fact that they used contraception but still got pregnant is a factor. But failure of contraception is a risk, and some might argue he should accept responsibility. However, that's a bit of a stretch if the method was properly used. But since the post says they were \"fairly strict with contraceptives,\" maybe there's some fault on their side, but that's not clear.\n\nIn terms of the author's stance, wanting to disengage completely might be seen as selfish because it's placing a burden on the mother without support. But if he can't or won't take responsibility, that could be seen as the wrong choice. \n\nSo, putting it all together: Legally, he might have to pay, so not being able to opt out is a reality. Morally, some might say he's responsible, others might empathize with his situation. The question is whether he's in the wrong. The user thinks he is, but the answer depends on legal and moral viewpoints. Since the options are A (yes) or B (no), I need to decide based on these factors. Legally, he can't opt out, so he's wrong to think he can. Morally, it's a gray area, but many would say he's responsible. So the answer is likely A.\n"
