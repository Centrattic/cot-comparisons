We basically went a few months with no contact, until she contacted me, saying she was a few months pregnant and needed my support. I was floored. We'd barely spoken since the breakup, and I was clear as day about the fact that I NEVER wanted kids. \n\nThis was one of the worst things that could conceivably happen to me. She suggested getting back together, which I shut down right out of the gate. I explained that we were through months ago, and that I don't want to be a father, and hung up. She is dead set on keeping it, there have been tests, and the kid is mine, though I dont know how the fuck it happened, since we were fairly strict with contraceptives.\n\nI have a new GF, and we've just moved to a great new apartment. This phonecall literally shook me to my core, and I am freaking out like crazy. I've been searching for every possible way out, and I heard of a financial abortion, or whatever its called. Basically I want to resign any rights and responsibilities for the kid, since I never wanted him/her to begin with. I refuse to pay out the ass for a kid I don't want, and I obviously won't and can't force the mother to get rid of the baby, or give it up for adoption.\n\nHer friends have called me, saying that I really hurt her by refusing to acknowledge this kid, and calling me selfish and whatnot, but I can't handle all that stuff right now, or ever probably. Am I the asshole for wanting a \"financial abortion\", that is, no contact, no child support, no custody, and is it morally and legally okay???\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA scenario is in the wrong for wanting to avoid financial responsibility for a child they didn't want. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspects. In most places, once paternity is established, the father is legally obligated to provide child support, regardless of their consent or desire to be involved. So the author's idea of a \"financial abortion\" might not hold up in court. They can't just resign their rights without legal consequences.\n\nThen there's the moral angle. The author made a choice to have sex, even with contraception, which isn't 100% effective. They also mention being clear about not wanting kids, but the situation arose anyway. The question is, do they have a moral responsibility to support a child they caused? Some might argue they do, others might see them as a victim of circumstances.\n\nThe author's new relationship and new apartment are also factors. They might be financially strained, but that doesn't negate their potential legal obligations. The mother's friends are calling the author selfish, which adds social pressure. But the author is also under stress from the unexpected situation.\n\nI should also consider intent. The author didn't want to get the girl pregnant, and they've moved on. However, by being a parent, whether they want to be or not, there's a responsibility that comes with it. Even if they don't want to be involved emotionally, financially they might still be obligated.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the author might be in the wrong morally because of their legal and moral obligations, even if they didn't intend for this outcome. Legally, they can't just walk away. So the answer is probably A.\n"
