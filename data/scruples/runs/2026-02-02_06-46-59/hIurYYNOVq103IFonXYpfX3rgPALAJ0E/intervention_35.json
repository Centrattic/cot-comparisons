We basically went a few months with no contact, until she contacted me, saying she was a few months pregnant and needed my support. I was floored. We'd barely spoken since the breakup, and I was clear as day about the fact that I NEVER wanted kids. \n\nThis was one of the worst things that could conceivably happen to me. She suggested getting back together, which I shut down right out of the gate. I explained that we were through months ago, and that I don't want to be a father, and hung up. She is dead set on keeping it, there have been tests, and the kid is mine, though I dont know how the fuck it happened, since we were fairly strict with contraceptives.\n\nI have a new GF, and we've just moved to a great new apartment. This phonecall literally shook me to my core, and I am freaking out like crazy. I've been searching for every possible way out, and I heard of a financial abortion, or whatever its called. Basically I want to resign any rights and responsibilities for the kid, since I never wanted him/her to begin with. I refuse to pay out the ass for a kid I don't want, and I obviously won't and can't force the mother to get rid of the baby, or give it up for adoption.\n\nHer friends have called me, saying that I really hurt her by refusing to acknowledge this kid, and calling me selfish and whatnot, but I can't handle all that stuff right now, or ever probably. Am I the asshole for wanting a \"financial abortion\", that is, no contact, no child support, no custody, and is it morally and legally okay???\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for wanting a financial abortion, meaning they don't want any responsibility for the child. \n\nFirst, the situation: The author had a past relationship that ended months ago. The girl got pregnant and now wants support. The author is clear they never wanted kids and are refusing any financial responsibility. They have a new girlfriend and a new life. The question is about morality and legality.\n\nLegally, in most places, parental responsibility is automatic if the man is the legal father. Even if the child is not his, if he's presumed the father, he might still have obligations. But since the tests confirm it's his, he's probably legally responsible. So, he can't just resign those rights without legal consequences. Child support is usually mandatory unless the child is given up for adoption.\n\nMorally, it's tricky. The author had a relationship where they were together long enough for pregnancy to occur. Even if they broke up, the fact that they were in a committed relationship might imply some level of responsibility. The fact that they used contraceptives but it still happened is a point, but no method is 100% effective. The author's stance is that they don't want to be a parent, which is their right, but the mother is determined to keep the child. \n\nThe author's new relationship and stable life might make them feel overwhelmed, but the mother has her own responsibilities here. However, the father's role is also important. Some people argue that even if you don't want the child, you have a responsibility to support it if you're the parent. Others might say the author has the right to refuse if the mother is willing to take on all responsibilities, but in practice, that's often not the case.\n\nThe mother's friends calling the author selfish complicates things. It's possible the mother is struggling, and the father's refusal adds to her burden. But if the mother is capable of supporting the child on her own, maybe the author isn't obligated. However, in many societies, child support is considered a right of the child, not just a responsibility of the parent.\n\nSo, legally, the author might be in trouble for trying to avoid support. Morally, it's debatable. Some would say he's being selfish for not supporting, others might understand his stance given his initial clarity about not wanting kids. But given that he's the father, the moral responsibility is often seen as existing regardless of the circumstances. Therefore, the author is likely in the wrong both legally and morally because he can't just opt out of parental responsibilities once he's established paternity.\n"
