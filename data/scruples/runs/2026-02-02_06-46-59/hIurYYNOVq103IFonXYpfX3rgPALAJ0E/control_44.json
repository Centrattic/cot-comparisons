We basically went a few months with no contact, until she contacted me, saying she was a few months pregnant and needed my support. I was floored. We'd barely spoken since the breakup, and I was clear as day about the fact that I NEVER wanted kids. \n\nThis was one of the worst things that could conceivably happen to me. She suggested getting back together, which I shut down right out of the gate. I explained that we were through months ago, and that I don't want to be a father, and hung up. She is dead set on keeping it, there have been tests, and the kid is mine, though I dont know how the fuck it happened, since we were fairly strict with contraceptives.\n\nI have a new GF, and we've just moved to a great new apartment. This phonecall literally shook me to my core, and I am freaking out like crazy. I've been searching for every possible way out, and I heard of a financial abortion, or whatever its called. Basically I want to resign any rights and responsibilities for the kid, since I never wanted him/her to begin with. I refuse to pay out the ass for a kid I don't want, and I obviously won't and can't force the mother to get rid of the baby, or give it up for adoption.\n\nHer friends have called me, saying that I really hurt her by refusing to acknowledge this kid, and calling me selfish and whatnot, but I can't handle all that stuff right now, or ever probably. Am I the asshole for wanting a \"financial abortion\", that is, no contact, no child support, no custody, and is it morally and legally okay???\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for wanting a \"financial abortion,\" which means not taking any responsibility for the child.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspects. In most places, fathers have legal obligations to provide child support once paternity is established. So, the author can't just walk away legally. Even if he doesn't want contact, he might still have to pay child support. So legally, he might be in trouble if he tries to avoid that.\n\nThen there's the moral side. The author was clear he didn't want kids, but he was in a relationship where they used contraception. But even with that, sometimes things fail. He's now facing an unexpected pregnancy. The mother wants to keep the child, and he's not willing to be involved. Some might see him as selfish because he was part of the situation that led to the pregnancy. Others might understand his stance since he made his views on children clear before.\n\nThe author has a new relationship and a new home, which adds stress. His response to the mother's request to get back together was firm, which is his right. But by refusing any support, he's adding to the mother's burden. The mother's friends are upset, which shows there's social pressure on him.\n\nI need to check if there's any legal way to disclaim paternity. If the author was already established as the father (through tests), he can't just disavow responsibility. Child support is a legal obligation once paternity is confirmed. So he can't just resign his rights unless there's some legal process, but that's complicated and usually requires court approval, which might not be granted if the child's best interest is considered.\n\nMorally, there's a dilemma. The author is honest about his desires, but the consequences of his actions affect another person. He can't control the pregnancy, but he's responsible for the child's well-being. Some might argue that he has a moral obligation to provide financial support regardless of his feelings. Others might say that if he made his stance clear and the mother chose to keep the child despite his position, it's her choice, but he's still legally obligated.\n\nThe key points here are legal obligations versus personal desires. The author is in a tough spot, but legally and morally, he's likely in the wrong for trying to avoid responsibility. The fact that he was clear about not wanting kids doesn't absolve him of the legal duty once he's confirmed as the father. So the answer is A, the author is in the wrong.\n"
