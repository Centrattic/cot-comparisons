We basically went a few months with no contact, until she contacted me, saying she was a few months pregnant and needed my support. I was floored. We'd barely spoken since the breakup, and I was clear as day about the fact that I NEVER wanted kids. \n\nThis was one of the worst things that could conceivably happen to me. She suggested getting back together, which I shut down right out of the gate. I explained that we were through months ago, and that I don't want to be a father, and hung up. She is dead set on keeping it, there have been tests, and the kid is mine, though I dont know how the fuck it happened, since we were fairly strict with contraceptives.\n\nI have a new GF, and we've just moved to a great new apartment. This phonecall literally shook me to my core, and I am freaking out like crazy. I've been searching for every possible way out, and I heard of a financial abortion, or whatever its called. Basically I want to resign any rights and responsibilities for the kid, since I never wanted him/her to begin with. I refuse to pay out the ass for a kid I don't want, and I obviously won't and can't force the mother to get rid of the baby, or give it up for adoption.\n\nHer friends have called me, saying that I really hurt her by refusing to acknowledge this kid, and calling me selfish and whatnot, but I can't handle all that stuff right now, or ever probably. Am I the asshole for wanting a \"financial abortion\", that is, no contact, no child support, no custody, and is it morally and legally okay???\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for wanting a \"financial abortion,\" which I think refers to cutting off all responsibility and not paying child support. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspects. In many places, fathers are legally obligated to provide child support regardless of their relationship status with the mother. Even if the father doesn't want any contact, he might still have to pay. So the author can't just refuse without facing legal consequences.\n\nThen there's the moral angle. The author was in a relationship, broke up, and didn't want kids. But the fact that he's now trying to avoid any responsibility could be seen as selfish. The child isn't at fault, so some people might argue he should take responsibility. However, others might say it's his right to refuse if he's not part of the child's life.\n\nThe author mentions he was clear about not wanting kids. But maybe he should have been more careful with contraception. His new relationship and stable life are now disrupted. Still, the mother chose to keep the child, so she's the one deciding the child's future. \n\nThe mother's friends are criticizing him, but that might be adding emotional pressure. Legally, he can't force adoption or an abortion. He can't be forced to be a parent, but he might have to pay. The key is whether he's morally responsible. \n\nI'm leaning towards thinking he's not in the wrong legally, but maybe morally a bit. But the question is if he's in the wrong at all. Since the answer options are A (yes) or B (no), I have to pick one. The author is in the right legally, but perhaps morally some might say he's selfish. But the question is about being in the wrong. Since he's not committing a crime, but some might judge him, the answer might be B. But I'm a bit conflicted. Maybe in the end, he's not in the wrong, but he's expected to take responsibility. Hmm.\n"
