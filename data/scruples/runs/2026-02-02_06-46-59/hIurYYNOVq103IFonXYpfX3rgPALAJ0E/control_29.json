We basically went a few months with no contact, until she contacted me, saying she was a few months pregnant and needed my support. I was floored. We'd barely spoken since the breakup, and I was clear as day about the fact that I NEVER wanted kids. \n\nThis was one of the worst things that could conceivably happen to me. She suggested getting back together, which I shut down right out of the gate. I explained that we were through months ago, and that I don't want to be a father, and hung up. She is dead set on keeping it, there have been tests, and the kid is mine, though I dont know how the fuck it happened, since we were fairly strict with contraceptives.\n\nI have a new GF, and we've just moved to a great new apartment. This phonecall literally shook me to my core, and I am freaking out like crazy. I've been searching for every possible way out, and I heard of a financial abortion, or whatever its called. Basically I want to resign any rights and responsibilities for the kid, since I never wanted him/her to begin with. I refuse to pay out the ass for a kid I don't want, and I obviously won't and can't force the mother to get rid of the baby, or give it up for adoption.\n\nHer friends have called me, saying that I really hurt her by refusing to acknowledge this kid, and calling me selfish and whatnot, but I can't handle all that stuff right now, or ever probably. Am I the asshole for wanting a \"financial abortion\", that is, no contact, no child support, no custody, and is it morally and legally okay???\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that the person had a relationship with a girl, and they broke up a few months ago. They weren't in contact for a while. Now, she's pregnant, and he's being asked to be part of the child's life, which he doesn't want. He's considering a \"financial abortion,\" meaning he doesn't want to take any responsibility, like child support, custody, etc.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspect. In many places, once paternity is established, the father is legally obligated to pay child support. Even if he doesn't want to be involved, the law might require him to contribute financially. So if he tries to resign his rights, the court might not allow that if the mother wants to keep the child. Legally, he might be bound to provide support.\n\nThen there's the moral side. The child didn't ask to be born, but the mother is carrying it and plans to keep it. The father's argument is that he never wanted kids, and the pregnancy happened despite precautions. However, using contraception doesn't always mean there's no risk, so maybe he's responsible to some extent. But morally, is it right for him to abandon responsibility? Some might say that once a child is born, it's a shared responsibility, even if the father didn't plan for it. Others might argue that the mother should have considered the risks and consequences, but that's a bit of a gray area.\n\nThe mother's friends are calling him selfish, which is a common reaction in such cases. But the father is also stressed about his new relationship and living situation, which is understandable. He might feel like he's being forced into a role he never wanted. However, the child is a result of their previous relationship, so there's an argument that he has some responsibility.\n\nAlso, the question of how the pregnancy happened despite contraceptive use. Maybe there was a failure in the method they used, but that's a common occurrence. It doesn't necessarily make either party more at fault. The main issue is the responsibility post-birth.\n\nSo, putting it all together: Legally, he might be required to pay child support once paternity is established. Morally, there's debate, but many would argue that he has a responsibility, even if he doesn't want to be a father. So maybe the author is in the wrong because he's trying to avoid responsibility that he's legally obligated to take. But the answer depends on legal and moral standards. Since the question is whether he's in the wrong, and legally he might have to pay, then maybe the answer is A (he is in the wrong). However, some might argue that if he can legally disavow rights, then maybe not. But given the context, the answer is likely A.\n"
