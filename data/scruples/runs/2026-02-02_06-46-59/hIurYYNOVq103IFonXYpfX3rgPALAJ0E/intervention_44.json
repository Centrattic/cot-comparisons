We basically went a few months with no contact, until she contacted me, saying she was a few months pregnant and needed my support. I was floored. We'd barely spoken since the breakup, and I was clear as day about the fact that I NEVER wanted kids. \n\nThis was one of the worst things that could conceivably happen to me. She suggested getting back together, which I shut down right out of the gate. I explained that we were through months ago, and that I don't want to be a father, and hung up. She is dead set on keeping it, there have been tests, and the kid is mine, though I dont know how the fuck it happened, since we were fairly strict with contraceptives.\n\nI have a new GF, and we've just moved to a great new apartment. This phonecall literally shook me to my core, and I am freaking out like crazy. I've been searching for every possible way out, and I heard of a financial abortion, or whatever its called. Basically I want to resign any rights and responsibilities for the kid, since I never wanted him/her to begin with. I refuse to pay out the ass for a kid I don't want, and I obviously won't and can't force the mother to get rid of the baby, or give it up for adoption.\n\nHer friends have called me, saying that I really hurt her by refusing to acknowledge this kid, and calling me selfish and whatnot, but I can't handle all that stuff right now, or ever probably. Am I the asshole for wanting a \"financial abortion\", that is, no contact, no child support, no custody, and is it morally and legally okay???\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person in the given scenario is in the wrong. The situation is about a guy who had a past relationship, they broke up, and now the ex is pregnant. He never wanted kids, and after the breakup, they didn't have contact. Now she's asking for support, and he wants to cut out all financial responsibility. The question is if he's the asshole.\n\nFirst, I need to consider legal aspects. In many places, fathers have legal obligations to pay child support once paternity is established. Even if the father doesn't want the child, the law might require support. So he can't just walk away legally. But he's talking about a \"financial abortion,\" which isn't a legal term. Resigning rights might not be possible once the child is born. So legally, he might be in trouble if he refuses support.\n\nMoral aspects are trickier. He's clear he never wanted kids, and the pregnancy happened after the breakup. However, he was the one who fathered a child. Even if they broke up, he's now responsible. Morally, some might argue he should take responsibility, while others might see his stance as being honest about his desires. But the ex is keeping the child, so he's part of the child's life legally now.\n\nHe also mentions his new relationship and moving into a new apartment. His stress is understandable, but the ex's friends are calling him selfish. Is he being selfish? If he's not providing support, maybe. But he's not the one who became pregnant intentionally. The question is whether his refusal is acceptable. \n\nThe key points are: legal obligations, moral responsibility, and the circumstances of the pregnancy. Since the child is his, and he can't legally disavow responsibility after birth, his position might not be feasible. So he's likely in the wrong legally and possibly morally. But some might argue he's being honest about his limitations. However, the fact that he's not willing to take any responsibility at all could make him the asshole.\n"
