We basically went a few months with no contact, until she contacted me, saying she was a few months pregnant and needed my support. I was floored. We'd barely spoken since the breakup, and I was clear as day about the fact that I NEVER wanted kids. \n\nThis was one of the worst things that could conceivably happen to me. She suggested getting back together, which I shut down right out of the gate. I explained that we were through months ago, and that I don't want to be a father, and hung up. She is dead set on keeping it, there have been tests, and the kid is mine, though I dont know how the fuck it happened, since we were fairly strict with contraceptives.\n\nI have a new GF, and we've just moved to a great new apartment. This phonecall literally shook me to my core, and I am freaking out like crazy. I've been searching for every possible way out, and I heard of a financial abortion, or whatever its called. Basically I want to resign any rights and responsibilities for the kid, since I never wanted him/her to begin with. I refuse to pay out the ass for a kid I don't want, and I obviously won't and can't force the mother to get rid of the baby, or give it up for adoption.\n\nHer friends have called me, saying that I really hurt her by refusing to acknowledge this kid, and calling me selfish and whatnot, but I can't handle all that stuff right now, or ever probably. Am I the asshole for wanting a \"financial abortion\", that is, no contact, no child support, no custody, and is it morally and legally okay???\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for wanting to disengage financially and legally from a child they didn't want. The situation is that they dated someone for a few months, broke up, and then after months of no contact, the ex gets pregnant. The author made it clear they never wanted kids, so this is a big shock. They refused to get back together and are now looking to avoid any responsibilities like child support.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspects. In most places, once paternity is established, a man is legally required to pay child support regardless of his desire to be involved. The concept of a \"financial abortion\" isn't a real legal term. Legally, you can't just disown a child; there are no such options. So the author might be under a misconception here. They might not be able to opt out of financial responsibilities once the child is born, even if they don't want custody or contact.\n\nThen there's the moral side. The author is facing a dilemma between their personal desires and the responsibility towards a child. While it's understandable that they didn't want kids, the fact that they contributed to the child's existence might create a moral obligation. However, morality can be subjective. Some people might argue that the author has no control over the pregnancy and isn't responsible for the child's upbringing if the mother is capable. Others might say that once a child is born, the biological father has a duty, even if it wasn't planned.\n\nThe ex's friends are calling the author selfish. That's a judgment based on the idea that supporting the child is necessary. But the author is in a new relationship and personal circumstances have changed. They're not the ones choosing to keep the child, so should they be obligated to support it? It's a tough spot. The author isn't being cruel by forcing an abortion, but they are refusing to pay for something they consider an unexpected burden.\n\nI should check if the author is being reasonable. They did use contraceptives, but maybe there was a failure. The breakup was months ago, so if they're not in a relationship anymore, expecting them to take on responsibilities could be unfair. But legally, they can't escape child support. So in the end, the answer would likely be that the author is in the wrong because they can't legally avoid financial support and morally, some might see it as neglecting a duty. However, the reasoning might vary. The main point is they can't just opt out, which might make them the asshole if they're aware of the legal obligations but still try to deny them.\n"
