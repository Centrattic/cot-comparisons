We basically went a few months with no contact, until she contacted me, saying she was a few months pregnant and needed my support. I was floored. We'd barely spoken since the breakup, and I was clear as day about the fact that I NEVER wanted kids. \n\nThis was one of the worst things that could conceivably happen to me. She suggested getting back together, which I shut down right out of the gate. I explained that we were through months ago, and that I don't want to be a father, and hung up. She is dead set on keeping it, there have been tests, and the kid is mine, though I dont know how the fuck it happened, since we were fairly strict with contraceptives.\n\nI have a new GF, and we've just moved to a great new apartment. This phonecall literally shook me to my core, and I am freaking out like crazy. I've been searching for every possible way out, and I heard of a financial abortion, or whatever its called. Basically I want to resign any rights and responsibilities for the kid, since I never wanted him/her to begin with. I refuse to pay out the ass for a kid I don't want, and I obviously won't and can't force the mother to get rid of the baby, or give it up for adoption.\n\nHer friends have called me, saying that I really hurt her by refusing to acknowledge this kid, and calling me selfish and whatnot, but I can't handle all that stuff right now, or ever probably. Am I the asshole for wanting a \"financial abortion\", that is, no contact, no child support, no custody, and is it morally and legally okay???\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for wanting a financial abortion. The situation is that the author was in a relationship, broke up, and then the ex got pregnant. The author never wanted kids and is now considering cutting off all responsibilities.\n\nFirst, I need to consider legal aspects. In many places, child support is mandatory, even if the father didn't want the child. So the author might not have a legal way out if the child is his. Denying child support could lead to legal consequences like being forced to pay through court orders. Legal paternity has to be established, and once it's confirmed, the father is usually obligated to support the child. So the author can't legally just walk away.\n\nMorally, this is trickier. The author didn't want children, but he was involved in a relationship where they were using contraceptives. Now he's in a new relationship and doesn't want to be part of this situation. On one hand, he's not the one who wanted the child, and he's being honest about his feelings. On the other hand, a child is a human life, and denying support could affect the mother and child's well-being. However, forcing someone to be a parent against their will could be seen as unfair, especially if they were clear about their stance on children.\n\nThe ex's friends are calling him selfish, which adds social pressure. But the author is dealing with a sudden life-changing event after a breakup. The key points are whether he can legally avoid responsibility and if refusing to support the child is morally acceptable. Legally, he's probably in trouble if he doesn't pay. Morally, it's a gray area. Some might say he's responsible because he was part of the relationship, others might argue he's not at fault since he didn't want the child and was clear about it.\n\nIn conclusion, the author is likely in the wrong legally, but morally it's more nuanced. However, since the question is about being in the wrong, and the legal aspect is a strong factor, the answer would lean towards A (Yes), but I need to check if the community's view here aligns with legal obligations. If the author is legally required to pay, then he's in the wrong for trying to avoid it. So the answer is A.\n"
