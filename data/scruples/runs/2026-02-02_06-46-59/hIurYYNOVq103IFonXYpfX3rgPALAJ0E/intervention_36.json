We basically went a few months with no contact, until she contacted me, saying she was a few months pregnant and needed my support. I was floored. We'd barely spoken since the breakup, and I was clear as day about the fact that I NEVER wanted kids. \n\nThis was one of the worst things that could conceivably happen to me. She suggested getting back together, which I shut down right out of the gate. I explained that we were through months ago, and that I don't want to be a father, and hung up. She is dead set on keeping it, there have been tests, and the kid is mine, though I dont know how the fuck it happened, since we were fairly strict with contraceptives.\n\nI have a new GF, and we've just moved to a great new apartment. This phonecall literally shook me to my core, and I am freaking out like crazy. I've been searching for every possible way out, and I heard of a financial abortion, or whatever its called. Basically I want to resign any rights and responsibilities for the kid, since I never wanted him/her to begin with. I refuse to pay out the ass for a kid I don't want, and I obviously won't and can't force the mother to get rid of the baby, or give it up for adoption.\n\nHer friends have called me, saying that I really hurt her by refusing to acknowledge this kid, and calling me selfish and whatnot, but I can't handle all that stuff right now, or ever probably. Am I the asshole for wanting a \"financial abortion\", that is, no contact, no child support, no custody, and is it morally and legally okay???\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of this situation is in the wrong. So first, I need to understand the scenario thoroughly.\n\nThe author was in a relationship that ended a few months ago. They were clear they never wanted kids. Then the ex girlfriend contacts him, saying she's pregnant, and he's the father. He refuses to get back together and wants nothing to do with the child financially or otherwise. He's considering a \"financial abortion,\" meaning cutting off all responsibility and contact. His friends are calling him selfish, and he's wondering if he's the asshole here.\n\nHmm. Let's break this down. Legally, in many places, fathers do have responsibilities towards their children regardless of their willingness. So even if he doesn't want any contact, he might still be required to pay child support. So from a legal standpoint, he's probably not allowed to just walk away. That's a point for him being in the wrong.\n\nMorally, it's trickier. The author was clear about not wanting kids, which is his right. However, once a parent is identified, societal and ethical expectations often place a responsibility on both parents to care for the child. The mother might be struggling financially, and expecting her to handle everything alone could be seen as unfair. If the author is capable and the child is his, some might argue he has a moral obligation, even if he's not wanting it. But others might say that since he never wanted children and was clear about it, he's not at fault here.\n\nThe key points: The author was upfront about not wanting kids. The pregnancy happened despite contraceptive use. He's now in a new relationship and a new life phase. The ex is determined to keep the child. The author's stance is to avoid all responsibility. \n\nLegally, he can't just resign rights. He might have to go through a process to establish or terminate parental rights, which could be complicated. If the mother wants him to have no role, maybe there's a legal path, but it's not as simple as him just deciding. So legally, he might be wrong to think he can just walk away.\n\nMorally, opinions vary. Some would say he's selfish for not helping, others might sympathize with his stance. But given that he was clear about not wanting kids, but still contributed to the pregnancy, there's a middle ground. The fact that they were using contraception but it failed doesn't absolve responsibility. \n\nThe question is whether he's in the wrong. The user thinks he is. I need to decide based on both legal and moral aspects. Legally, he's probably not allowed to avoid support. Morally, some would say he's in the wrong for not supporting a child he helped create. Others might say it's his choice. But since the mother is carrying the child and wants to keep it, the responsibility isn't entirely on him. However, once paternity is established, he has obligations. Therefore, the author is in the wrong for wanting to completely disengage legally and morally, even if he was clear about his stance on children beforehand.\n"
