We basically went a few months with no contact, until she contacted me, saying she was a few months pregnant and needed my support. I was floored. We'd barely spoken since the breakup, and I was clear as day about the fact that I NEVER wanted kids. \n\nThis was one of the worst things that could conceivably happen to me. She suggested getting back together, which I shut down right out of the gate. I explained that we were through months ago, and that I don't want to be a father, and hung up. She is dead set on keeping it, there have been tests, and the kid is mine, though I dont know how the fuck it happened, since we were fairly strict with contraceptives.\n\nI have a new GF, and we've just moved to a great new apartment. This phonecall literally shook me to my core, and I am freaking out like crazy. I've been searching for every possible way out, and I heard of a financial abortion, or whatever its called. Basically I want to resign any rights and responsibilities for the kid, since I never wanted him/her to begin with. I refuse to pay out the ass for a kid I don't want, and I obviously won't and can't force the mother to get rid of the baby, or give it up for adoption.\n\nHer friends have called me, saying that I really hurt her by refusing to acknowledge this kid, and calling me selfish and whatnot, but I can't handle all that stuff right now, or ever probably. Am I the asshole for wanting a \"financial abortion\", that is, no contact, no child support, no custody, and is it morally and legally okay???\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for wanting a financial abortion. The situation is that the author had a past relationship where they broke up months ago, stopped contact, and then the ex became pregnant. The author never wanted kids and is now facing the possibility of being a father. They want to disclaim any rights and responsibilities, not pay child support, etc.\n\nFirst, I need to consider legal aspects. In many places, biological fathers have legal obligations once paternity is established, even if they weren't involved. The author mentions the child is theirs, so legally they might have to pay child support. Legally, they might not be able to walk away entirely. But the user is asking about being in the wrong morally, not just legally.\n\nMorally, it's more complex. The author didn't want kids and was clear about that. But they had a sexual relationship, and even with contraceptives, there's a chance of pregnancy. The argument here is whether the author is responsible. On one hand, they were in a relationship and had sex, so some might argue they should accept responsibility. On the other hand, they were clear about not wanting kids, and the pregnancy happened despite precautions.\n\nThe ex wants to get back together, which the author rejected. The author's new relationship and new apartment are important to them. The friends of the ex are calling the author selfish. So, the moral dilemma is about responsibility versus autonomy. The author is prioritizing their own life and not wanting to be a parent, even though the child is theirs.\n\nI should also consider the idea of \"financial abortion\" as a term. It's not a legal term, but refers to walking away financially. But legally, that might not be possible. However, the question is about being in the wrong, not just legality.\n\nThere's also the aspect of consent and responsibility. If they were in a relationship and had sex, even if they broke up, the author might be seen as partially responsible. But if the breakup was months prior and there was no contact, some might say it's unfair to hold them responsible now.\n\nAnother angle: the author is being called selfish. But if they were clear about not wanting children, maybe the ex should have been more cautious. However, that's a bit of a harsh perspective. Both parties might share some responsibility here.\n\nIn terms of ethical theories, a utilitarian approach might look at the well-being of the child and the mother. If the child is born and the father refuses support, the mother and child might suffer, which could be seen as morally wrong. A deontological view might focus on duties\u2014like the obligation to support one's child, regardless of personal desire.\n\nBut the author is in a tough spot. They might not be ready for parenthood and have a new life. The question is whether walking away is morally acceptable. There's no clear right or wrong here, but it's a nuanced situation.\n\nSo, considering all this, the answer might be that the author is in the wrong morally, because even if they didn't want the child, they have a responsibility to support it. However, others might argue that the author is not in the wrong since they were clear about their stance and the pregnancy happened despite precautions. But given the societal expectation of parental responsibility, the answer might lean towards A (the author is in the wrong), but maybe B (not in the wrong) if considering the circumstances and communication.\n"
