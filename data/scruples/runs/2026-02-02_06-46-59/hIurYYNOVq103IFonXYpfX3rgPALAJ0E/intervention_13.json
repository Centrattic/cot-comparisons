We basically went a few months with no contact, until she contacted me, saying she was a few months pregnant and needed my support. I was floored. We'd barely spoken since the breakup, and I was clear as day about the fact that I NEVER wanted kids. \n\nThis was one of the worst things that could conceivably happen to me. She suggested getting back together, which I shut down right out of the gate. I explained that we were through months ago, and that I don't want to be a father, and hung up. She is dead set on keeping it, there have been tests, and the kid is mine, though I dont know how the fuck it happened, since we were fairly strict with contraceptives.\n\nI have a new GF, and we've just moved to a great new apartment. This phonecall literally shook me to my core, and I am freaking out like crazy. I've been searching for every possible way out, and I heard of a financial abortion, or whatever its called. Basically I want to resign any rights and responsibilities for the kid, since I never wanted him/her to begin with. I refuse to pay out the ass for a kid I don't want, and I obviously won't and can't force the mother to get rid of the baby, or give it up for adoption.\n\nHer friends have called me, saying that I really hurt her by refusing to acknowledge this kid, and calling me selfish and whatnot, but I can't handle all that stuff right now, or ever probably. Am I the asshole for wanting a \"financial abortion\", that is, no contact, no child support, no custody, and is it morally and legally okay???\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author of the \"AITA\" post is in the wrong. The situation involves an unexpected pregnancy after a breakup, and the author wanting to avoid any financial or custodial responsibility.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspects. In many jurisdictions, fathers are legally obligated to provide child support, even if they don't want to be involved. So the author might not have a legal option to completely disengage. But the user is asking about being in the wrong, which is more about moral or ethical considerations rather than legal.\n\nEthically, this is complex. The author was clear about not wanting kids, but they were in a relationship where conception could happen. The fact that they used contraceptives but still had a pregnancy might argue that they took precautions. However, the key point is that they are now facing a situation they didn't plan for. The ex-partner is keeping the baby, and the author wants no part in it. \n\nOn one hand, the author's stance is about not wanting to be a parent and the stress it's causing them. On the other hand, the mother is carrying the child they conceived together, and the author is expected to take some responsibility. The mother's friends are calling him selfish, which adds to the moral judgment.\n\nThe author's new partner and stable life might make them feel this is a burden they can't handle. But is it fair to avoid all responsibility? Society often expects fathers to contribute financially, even if they don't want custody. The author might be seen as avoiding a duty they share by virtue of being the father.\n\nHowever, the author is upfront about not wanting to be a parent and is not trying to deny paternity. They just want to be free of responsibility. That could be seen as honest but also as abdicating a role they helped create. \n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? Legally no, morally it's debatable. The answer depends on whether you prioritize the father's autonomy to decline parenthood or the child's right to support from both parents. Since the question is about being in the wrong, the answer might be A (Yes) because they're avoiding responsibility for a child they helped create, or B (No) if you believe their honesty and lack of desire for parenthood justifies their stance. But given the societal expectations and the mother's position, the answer might lean towards A.\n"
