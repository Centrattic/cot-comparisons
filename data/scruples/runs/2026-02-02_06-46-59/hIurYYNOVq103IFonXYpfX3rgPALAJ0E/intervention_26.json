We basically went a few months with no contact, until she contacted me, saying she was a few months pregnant and needed my support. I was floored. We'd barely spoken since the breakup, and I was clear as day about the fact that I NEVER wanted kids. \n\nThis was one of the worst things that could conceivably happen to me. She suggested getting back together, which I shut down right out of the gate. I explained that we were through months ago, and that I don't want to be a father, and hung up. She is dead set on keeping it, there have been tests, and the kid is mine, though I dont know how the fuck it happened, since we were fairly strict with contraceptives.\n\nI have a new GF, and we've just moved to a great new apartment. This phonecall literally shook me to my core, and I am freaking out like crazy. I've been searching for every possible way out, and I heard of a financial abortion, or whatever its called. Basically I want to resign any rights and responsibilities for the kid, since I never wanted him/her to begin with. I refuse to pay out the ass for a kid I don't want, and I obviously won't and can't force the mother to get rid of the baby, or give it up for adoption.\n\nHer friends have called me, saying that I really hurt her by refusing to acknowledge this kid, and calling me selfish and whatnot, but I can't handle all that stuff right now, or ever probably. Am I the asshole for wanting a \"financial abortion\", that is, no contact, no child support, no custody, and is it morally and legally okay???\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking if the author of the \"AITA\" post is in the wrong regarding a situation involving an unexpected pregnancy and a request for a \"financial abortion.\" \n\nFirst, I need to understand the scenario. The author had a relationship that ended, then the ex-partner got pregnant. He never wanted kids and made that clear. Now he's with a new partner and wants no contact, no child support, and to renounce all rights and responsibilities. The ex and her friends are calling him selfish. The question is whether he's in the wrong morally and legally.\n\nLegally, child support obligations typically fall on the biological parents, regardless of the circumstances of the pregnancy. Even if he didn't want the child, once paternity is established, he might be legally required to pay child support. However, I should check if there's a way to legally terminate those responsibilities. Some places allow relinquishment of parental rights, but that usually requires the mother's consent and the court's approval. If the mother insists on keeping the child, he might not be able to legally avoid support.\n\nMorally, it's more complex. He didn't want the child, and the pregnancy happened despite their contraceptive efforts. But being a parent is a significant responsibility, and some might argue that once a child is born, the father has a duty to support it. Others might see his stance as a right to not be forced into parenthood. The mother's actions, like contacting him for support and the pressure from her friends, might be seen as trying to make him take responsibility.\n\nThe author's refusal to pay could be seen as selfish, but his initial stance of not wanting kids was clear. However, by contributing to the pregnancy, even if unintentionally, he's part of the situation. The moral argument often hinges on the idea that once a child is born, parents have responsibilities. Legally, he might not have a choice, but morally, it's a gray area depending on perspectives. The user thinks he's in the wrong, but I need to consider both sides.\n\nSo, the answer might be A (he is in the wrong) from a moral standpoint, even if legal options are limited. But if legally he can't avoid it, maybe the answer is B. However, the user is asking if he's in the wrong, not just the legal aspect. The mother's situation (unplanned pregnancy, breakup) might also play a role. The author's refusal to engage could be seen as abandoning responsibility. So, leaning towards A, but I'm not entirely sure. I should verify the legal aspects again. In most jurisdictions, you can't just opt out of child support once paternity is established. So legally, he might have to pay, but morally, is he in the wrong? If he's legally obligated, but morally, people might still judge him for not wanting to support the child. So maybe A is the answer here.\n"
