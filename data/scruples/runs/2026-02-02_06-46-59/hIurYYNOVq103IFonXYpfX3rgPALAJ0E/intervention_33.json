We basically went a few months with no contact, until she contacted me, saying she was a few months pregnant and needed my support. I was floored. We'd barely spoken since the breakup, and I was clear as day about the fact that I NEVER wanted kids. \n\nThis was one of the worst things that could conceivably happen to me. She suggested getting back together, which I shut down right out of the gate. I explained that we were through months ago, and that I don't want to be a father, and hung up. She is dead set on keeping it, there have been tests, and the kid is mine, though I dont know how the fuck it happened, since we were fairly strict with contraceptives.\n\nI have a new GF, and we've just moved to a great new apartment. This phonecall literally shook me to my core, and I am freaking out like crazy. I've been searching for every possible way out, and I heard of a financial abortion, or whatever its called. Basically I want to resign any rights and responsibilities for the kid, since I never wanted him/her to begin with. I refuse to pay out the ass for a kid I don't want, and I obviously won't and can't force the mother to get rid of the baby, or give it up for adoption.\n\nHer friends have called me, saying that I really hurt her by refusing to acknowledge this kid, and calling me selfish and whatnot, but I can't handle all that stuff right now, or ever probably. Am I the asshole for wanting a \"financial abortion\", that is, no contact, no child support, no custody, and is it morally and legally okay???\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of this \"Am I the asshole?\" post is in the wrong. The situation is about a guy who had a relationship that ended, they were using contraceptives but she got pregnant. Now he wants to completely cut ties, no contact, no child support, no custody. He's been called selfish by her friends, and he's wondering if he's wrong.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspects. In many places, once paternity is established, the father is legally obligated to provide child support, even if he doesn't want custody or contact. The term \"financial abortion\" might refer to voluntarily giving up parental rights, which is possible, but there are legal procedures involved. He can't just refuse; he might need to go to court. But if he does that properly, maybe he's not in the wrong legally. However, the mother might still pursue child support unless he successfully terminates his rights.\n\nThen, the moral side. The guy claims he never wanted kids and was clear about it. But if they were in a relationship, he might be seen as responsible. The fact that they were using contraceptives but it failed could be a factor. But if he was clear about not wanting kids, maybe that's a valid reason. However, walking away entirely from a child he helped create might be viewed as selfish. He's not taking responsibility, which some people might see as morally wrong, even if it's legal.\n\nHe has a new relationship and a new apartment. The new GF might not be aware of this situation, which could cause future problems. Also, the mother is determined to keep the child, so he can't just avoid all responsibility. If he wants to terminate parental rights, he needs to take active steps, not just refuse. But if he does that, he might be absolving himself legally. Still, the moral judgment could vary. Some might say it's right if he's being honest about his inability to be a parent, others might see it as abandoning a child.\n\nThere's also the question of how he was clear about not wanting kids. If he communicated that effectively before the pregnancy, it might support his stance. But if the pregnancy was a surprise, maybe the mother thought he could be persuaded to change his mind. His reaction of being \"floored\" and cutting contact immediately might seem harsh if the mother is now expecting him to be involved.\n\nIn summary, legally, he might not be in the wrong if he properly terminates his parental rights. Morally, it's more ambiguous. He's prioritizing his own desires and current life, but the child's well-being is a factor. The fact that he's not trying to force an abortion or adoption might be a point in his favor. However, the abruptness and refusal to engage could be seen as selfish. The answer probably depends on cultural and personal values.\n"
