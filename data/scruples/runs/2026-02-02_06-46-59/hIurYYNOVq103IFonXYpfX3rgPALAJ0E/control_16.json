We basically went a few months with no contact, until she contacted me, saying she was a few months pregnant and needed my support. I was floored. We'd barely spoken since the breakup, and I was clear as day about the fact that I NEVER wanted kids. \n\nThis was one of the worst things that could conceivably happen to me. She suggested getting back together, which I shut down right out of the gate. I explained that we were through months ago, and that I don't want to be a father, and hung up. She is dead set on keeping it, there have been tests, and the kid is mine, though I dont know how the fuck it happened, since we were fairly strict with contraceptives.\n\nI have a new GF, and we've just moved to a great new apartment. This phonecall literally shook me to my core, and I am freaking out like crazy. I've been searching for every possible way out, and I heard of a financial abortion, or whatever its called. Basically I want to resign any rights and responsibilities for the kid, since I never wanted him/her to begin with. I refuse to pay out the ass for a kid I don't want, and I obviously won't and can't force the mother to get rid of the baby, or give it up for adoption.\n\nHer friends have called me, saying that I really hurt her by refusing to acknowledge this kid, and calling me selfish and whatnot, but I can't handle all that stuff right now, or ever probably. Am I the asshole for wanting a \"financial abortion\", that is, no contact, no child support, no custody, and is it morally and legally okay???\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking whether the author of the given scenario is in the wrong. Let me start by understanding the situation.\n\nThe author was in a relationship that ended a few months before the pregnancy was discovered. They were clear about not wanting kids, and after a breakup with no contact, the ex reaches out saying she's pregnant. The author is against getting back together, wants nothing to do with the child, and refuses financial responsibility. He's considering a \"financial abortion,\" which I think refers to not providing child support or any parental involvement. His current partner and new apartment are mentioned as part of his stress.\n\nFirst, I need to assess the legal aspects. In many places, once paternity is established, the father is legally obligated to provide financial support for the child, regardless of wanting to be involved. So, the author's desire to disclaim all responsibilities might not be legally feasible. That's a key point. \n\nThen there's the moral angle. The author is not taking responsibility for a child they didn't plan for, especially since the ex is keeping the baby. Some might argue that as a parent, even if not wanting the child, you have a duty to support it financially. Others might see the author's stance as realistic given their initial stance on not wanting kids. However, the act of creating life and then refusing responsibility could be seen as selfish. \n\nThe ex's friends are calling him selfish, which adds social pressure. But the author is also dealing with personal stress from the situation. The fact that they were using contraceptives is mentioned, but accidents happen. The author's main issue is not wanting to be a father and the financial burden, which is a personal choice, but legally, they can't opt out.\n\nI should also consider if there's any fault on the author's side. If they were clear about not wanting kids during the relationship, but the ex might have not taken that into account. However, the author's response after the fact is the focus here. \n\nSo, putting it all together: Legally, they might be bound to pay child support once paternity is confirmed. Morally, it's debatable. Some might see it as irresponsible, others as realistic. The author is in a tough spot but the decision to disclaim all responsibility could be seen as in the wrong, especially if they contributed to the pregnancy even with contraception. The answer might lean towards A (they're in the wrong) because of the legal obligations and moral responsibility, but there's nuance. However, the initial clarity about not wanting kids might mitigate some blame. But the refusal to take any responsibility post-pregnancy could be seen as selfish. Hmm. I think the answer is A, but I need to be careful. Let me check legal aspects again. In many places, you can't disclaim paternity once it's established. So the author can't legally opt out. So wanting to do a financial abortion is not possible, hence the author is in the wrong for thinking they can avoid responsibility. So the answer is A.\n"
