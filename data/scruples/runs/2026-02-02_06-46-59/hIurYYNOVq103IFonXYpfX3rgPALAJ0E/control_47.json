We basically went a few months with no contact, until she contacted me, saying she was a few months pregnant and needed my support. I was floored. We'd barely spoken since the breakup, and I was clear as day about the fact that I NEVER wanted kids. \n\nThis was one of the worst things that could conceivably happen to me. She suggested getting back together, which I shut down right out of the gate. I explained that we were through months ago, and that I don't want to be a father, and hung up. She is dead set on keeping it, there have been tests, and the kid is mine, though I dont know how the fuck it happened, since we were fairly strict with contraceptives.\n\nI have a new GF, and we've just moved to a great new apartment. This phonecall literally shook me to my core, and I am freaking out like crazy. I've been searching for every possible way out, and I heard of a financial abortion, or whatever its called. Basically I want to resign any rights and responsibilities for the kid, since I never wanted him/her to begin with. I refuse to pay out the ass for a kid I don't want, and I obviously won't and can't force the mother to get rid of the baby, or give it up for adoption.\n\nHer friends have called me, saying that I really hurt her by refusing to acknowledge this kid, and calling me selfish and whatnot, but I can't handle all that stuff right now, or ever probably. Am I the asshole for wanting a \"financial abortion\", that is, no contact, no child support, no custody, and is it morally and legally okay???\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person is in the wrong for wanting a \"financial abortion.\" The situation is that he had a past relationship where they used contraception, but the ex got pregnant. He didn't want kids and they had broken up months before. Now she's asking for support, and he wants nothing to do with the child, no contact, no child support, etc.\n\nFirst, I need to consider legal aspects. In most places, once you're established as the legal father, you're responsible for child support unless you legally terminate your parental rights. But terminating rights isn't easy and might require the mother's consent or proof of abandonment. So legally, he might not be able to just walk away without a court process.\n\nMoral standpoint: He never wanted kids, and he's clear about that. The ex is keeping the child, so he's not forcing her to abort. He's not taking custody, which the ex might not want anyway. However, morally, some might argue that he has a responsibility as a parent, even if he didn't plan for it. Others might see his stance as selfish, especially if the mother is struggling and he's in a position to help.\n\nThe ex's friends are calling him selfish, which adds to the social pressure. But he's in a new relationship and moving forward. His refusal to pay child support could be seen as not fulfilling a legal obligation if he's legally the father. But if he's not legally obligated yet, maybe he's not in the wrong.\n\nAlso, the fact that they were using contraception and the unexpected pregnancy might be a point. If both used contraception properly, this wouldn't have happened. So maybe the blame isn't entirely his.\n\nLegally, he can't force the mother to get an abortion or adoption, but he can't just disown the child without going through legal processes. So his desire for a \"financial abortion\" might not be legally feasible without court action. If he's avoiding child support without legal grounds, that's where he could be in the wrong.\n\nBut from a personal ethics angle, if he's not abusive or malicious, just not wanting to be a parent, it's a tough spot. The answer might depend on the legal framework of the country he's in. Since the question doesn't specify location, but generally, in many places, fathers have obligations once paternity is confirmed.\n\nSo, putting it all together: He might not be the \"asshole\" morally for not wanting to be a parent, but legally, he might be in the wrong if he refuses to fulfill legal obligations without going through proper channels. The community's response (AITA) often leans towards understanding personal circumstances, but also acknowledges responsibilities. So maybe answer B (not in the wrong) if he's acting within legal bounds, but if he's avoiding legal responsibilities, then A. However, since he's seeking a legal way (financial abortion), maybe he's trying to comply within the system. The key is whether he's legally required to pay, and if not, then he's not in the wrong. But the community might still see him as selfish. Since the AITA format is more about personal ethics, but also legal, the answer might be B.\n"
