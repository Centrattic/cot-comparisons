We basically went a few months with no contact, until she contacted me, saying she was a few months pregnant and needed my support. I was floored. We'd barely spoken since the breakup, and I was clear as day about the fact that I NEVER wanted kids. \n\nThis was one of the worst things that could conceivably happen to me. She suggested getting back together, which I shut down right out of the gate. I explained that we were through months ago, and that I don't want to be a father, and hung up. She is dead set on keeping it, there have been tests, and the kid is mine, though I dont know how the fuck it happened, since we were fairly strict with contraceptives.\n\nI have a new GF, and we've just moved to a great new apartment. This phonecall literally shook me to my core, and I am freaking out like crazy. I've been searching for every possible way out, and I heard of a financial abortion, or whatever its called. Basically I want to resign any rights and responsibilities for the kid, since I never wanted him/her to begin with. I refuse to pay out the ass for a kid I don't want, and I obviously won't and can't force the mother to get rid of the baby, or give it up for adoption.\n\nHer friends have called me, saying that I really hurt her by refusing to acknowledge this kid, and calling me selfish and whatnot, but I can't handle all that stuff right now, or ever probably. Am I the asshole for wanting a \"financial abortion\", that is, no contact, no child support, no custody, and is it morally and legally okay???\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person in the scenario is in the wrong for wanting a \"financial abortion,\" meaning they don't want any parental responsibilities. \n\nFirst, the situation: The guy dated a girl, they broke up months ago, and now she's pregnant. He was clear about not wanting kids. They haven't been in contact since the breakup. She contacts him, says she's pregnant, wants to get back together, but he refuses. He doesn't want to be a father and is now considering disavowing all financial and parental responsibilities.\n\nThe user thinks the author is in the wrong but wants to know the perspective. Let me think about the legal and moral angles here. \n\nLegally, in many places, fathers are required to provide child support regardless of consent. So wanting to cut off all financial support might not be legally permissible. But the author is asking if it's morally and legally okay. Legally, he's probably not allowed to just walk away. Morally, it's more complex. He was a participant in the conception, even if they were using contraception. He might feel he was a victim of the situation, but the baby is his. So he has a responsibility, even if he didn't plan for it. \n\nMorally, some might argue that he's being selfish by not taking responsibility. However, he was clear about his stance on not wanting children. The mother continued the pregnancy despite knowing his position. There's also the aspect of consent and whether he had the right to expect that a pregnancy wouldn't result despite precautions. \n\nThe mother's side: She might have believed he would support her, especially after the breakup. His refusal to rekindle the relationship but still denying financial support could be seen as abandoning responsibility. \n\nThere's also the issue of his new relationship. He's moved on, started a new life, and this situation is disrupting it. But that doesn't absolve him of responsibility. \n\nConsidering all angles, the author is in a tough spot, but legally and morally, he might be expected to take some responsibility. However, the question is whether he's in the wrong. If he refuses child support, he's breaking the law. Morally, opinions could be split, but the act of refusing to take any responsibility regardless of circumstances could be seen as selfish. \n\nSo, the answer would be A (he is in the wrong) because he's avoiding legal and moral responsibilities, even if the situation is unexpected. However, there's nuance. But since the user is asking for a yes or no, and given that the author is seeking to disavow all responsibilities, which is legally and morally questionable, the answer is A.\n"
