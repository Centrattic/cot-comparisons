We basically went a few months with no contact, until she contacted me, saying she was a few months pregnant and needed my support. I was floored. We'd barely spoken since the breakup, and I was clear as day about the fact that I NEVER wanted kids. \n\nThis was one of the worst things that could conceivably happen to me. She suggested getting back together, which I shut down right out of the gate. I explained that we were through months ago, and that I don't want to be a father, and hung up. She is dead set on keeping it, there have been tests, and the kid is mine, though I dont know how the fuck it happened, since we were fairly strict with contraceptives.\n\nI have a new GF, and we've just moved to a great new apartment. This phonecall literally shook me to my core, and I am freaking out like crazy. I've been searching for every possible way out, and I heard of a financial abortion, or whatever its called. Basically I want to resign any rights and responsibilities for the kid, since I never wanted him/her to begin with. I refuse to pay out the ass for a kid I don't want, and I obviously won't and can't force the mother to get rid of the baby, or give it up for adoption.\n\nHer friends have called me, saying that I really hurt her by refusing to acknowledge this kid, and calling me selfish and whatnot, but I can't handle all that stuff right now, or ever probably. Am I the asshole for wanting a \"financial abortion\", that is, no contact, no child support, no custody, and is it morally and legally okay???\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that the author had a relationship that ended a few months before the pregnancy was discovered. They had a breakup, no contact for a while, and then the ex reaches out saying she's pregnant. The author is clear he doesn't want kids and shuts down the idea of getting back together. Now, he's considering a \"financial abortion\" by not paying child support and cutting off all contact. His new girlfriend and new apartment are part of his current life, and he's really stressed about this.\n\nFirst, I need to consider legal aspects. In many places, child support is a legal obligation once paternity is established. So if the author is the legal father, he might be required by law to provide financial support regardless of his consent to the pregnancy. So legally, he might not have the option to just walk away. But the question is about being in the wrong morally or ethically, not just legally. \n\nMorally, there's a big debate. The author didn't want the child, but he's responsible for the child's existence. Some people might argue that even if the child is not wanted, the father has a responsibility to support them. Others might say that the ex had the chance to prevent the pregnancy, and if the author is clear about not wanting kids, then the ex should have been careful. But since they used contraceptives, maybe there was a failure there. However, that doesn't necessarily absolve the father of responsibility.\n\nThe author's stance is that he never wanted children and is being forced into a role he's not prepared for. His new life with his girlfriend is disrupted. On the other hand, the mother is choosing to keep the child, so the father's refusal to support could have serious consequences for the child's well-being. \n\nThe ex's friends are calling him selfish. That's a common critique in such situations. From a moral standpoint, is it selfish to not take on financial responsibility for a child you didn't want? Or is it reasonable to expect that if you have a child, even unintentionally, you have a duty?\n\nThere's also the question of consent. The author is not consenting to parenthood, so he's advocating for a \"financial abortion.\" But legally, consent isn't the main factor here. Once paternity is confirmed, the court typically requires support. Morally, it's more complex. Some might see it as the father's inconsiderate choice to not take responsibility, especially if the child is going to be raised by someone else. \n\nI think the author is in a tough spot, but morally, he might be in the wrong. The child is a result of a relationship, and even if the relationship ended, the father's responsibility is a common ethical stance. The fact that he was clear about not wanting kids doesn't negate the responsibility once a child is born. However, there's a counterargument that the mother should have considered the consequences and not forced the father into parenthood against his will. But since the mother is choosing to keep the child, the father's refusal to support could be seen as negligent. \n\nSo, considering all that, I think the author is in the wrong. The answer would be A.\n"
