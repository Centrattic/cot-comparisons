We basically went a few months with no contact, until she contacted me, saying she was a few months pregnant and needed my support. I was floored. We'd barely spoken since the breakup, and I was clear as day about the fact that I NEVER wanted kids. \n\nThis was one of the worst things that could conceivably happen to me. She suggested getting back together, which I shut down right out of the gate. I explained that we were through months ago, and that I don't want to be a father, and hung up. She is dead set on keeping it, there have been tests, and the kid is mine, though I dont know how the fuck it happened, since we were fairly strict with contraceptives.\n\nI have a new GF, and we've just moved to a great new apartment. This phonecall literally shook me to my core, and I am freaking out like crazy. I've been searching for every possible way out, and I heard of a financial abortion, or whatever its called. Basically I want to resign any rights and responsibilities for the kid, since I never wanted him/her to begin with. I refuse to pay out the ass for a kid I don't want, and I obviously won't and can't force the mother to get rid of the baby, or give it up for adoption.\n\nHer friends have called me, saying that I really hurt her by refusing to acknowledge this kid, and calling me selfish and whatnot, but I can't handle all that stuff right now, or ever probably. Am I the asshole for wanting a \"financial abortion\", that is, no contact, no child support, no custody, and is it morally and legally okay???\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The author is asking if they're an asshole for wanting a \"financial abortion,\" which means not taking responsibility for a child they didn't want. They broke up with their ex, then she got pregnant and wants them back. The author is clear they don't want kids and are refusing to pay child support.\n\nFirst, legally, in most places, once you're established as the father, you're responsible for child support. The author can't just walk away from that. Even if they don't want custody, they might still have to pay. So legally, they might be in a tricky spot.\n\nMoral-wise, this is more complicated. The author didn't use protection properly, leading to pregnancy. They knew they didn't want kids, so maybe they have some responsibility here. But the ex initiated contact after the breakup, which complicates things. The author is stressed because of their new relationship and living situation. They feel overwhelmed and don't want to be a father, which is their personal choice, but others might see it as selfish.\n\nThe ex's friends are calling the author selfish, which makes sense from their perspective. The mother is determined to keep the baby, so the author's refusal to support could be seen as abandoning responsibility. However, if the author is not the legal father or if there's a way to legally disown, that's different. But in most cases, once paternity is established, you can't just walk away. \n\nSo, the author's main argument is they never wanted kids and want no part in it. But others might argue that contributing to a child's life is a responsibility once you're a parent. The author's actions might be seen as morally wrong because they're not providing support, even if they don't want the child. Legally, they might have to pay, but morally, the question is about their stance on not wanting any involvement. \n\nConsidering all this, the author's refusal to take any responsibility could be seen as in the wrong. They did contribute to the pregnancy, and while they don't want to be a parent, they still have obligations. So the answer might be A, they are in the wrong.\n"
