We basically went a few months with no contact, until she contacted me, saying she was a few months pregnant and needed my support. I was floored. We'd barely spoken since the breakup, and I was clear as day about the fact that I NEVER wanted kids. \n\nThis was one of the worst things that could conceivably happen to me. She suggested getting back together, which I shut down right out of the gate. I explained that we were through months ago, and that I don't want to be a father, and hung up. She is dead set on keeping it, there have been tests, and the kid is mine, though I dont know how the fuck it happened, since we were fairly strict with contraceptives.\n\nI have a new GF, and we've just moved to a great new apartment. This phonecall literally shook me to my core, and I am freaking out like crazy. I've been searching for every possible way out, and I heard of a financial abortion, or whatever its called. Basically I want to resign any rights and responsibilities for the kid, since I never wanted him/her to begin with. I refuse to pay out the ass for a kid I don't want, and I obviously won't and can't force the mother to get rid of the baby, or give it up for adoption.\n\nHer friends have called me, saying that I really hurt her by refusing to acknowledge this kid, and calling me selfish and whatnot, but I can't handle all that stuff right now, or ever probably. Am I the asshole for wanting a \"financial abortion\", that is, no contact, no child support, no custody, and is it morally and legally okay???\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so the user is asking whether the author is in the wrong based on the situation they described. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the author had a relationship that ended a few months before the pregnancy. The ex-girlfriend now claims she's pregnant, and the author is shocked because he never wanted kids. He's clear that he doesn't want to be a father and refuses to pay child support. He mentions having a new girlfriend and moving into a new apartment, which adds to his stress. The ex's friends are calling him selfish, but he's not engaging with the situation.\n\nI need to consider legal and moral aspects. Legally, in many places, fathers are required to provide child support once paternity is established. The author might not be able to completely cut off all responsibilities legally, even if he wants to. Morally, some might argue that he has a responsibility since the child is his. Others might see his stance as valid if he never wanted children and the pregnancy was a result of the past relationship where birth control failed.\n\nThe author's refusal to engage further could be seen as selfish by some, especially if the mother is struggling financially. On the other hand, he's stating his clear position that he doesn't want children, which he was upfront about. The situation is complex because it's a new development after the relationship ended. The mother might feel entitled to support, but the father's rights and responsibilities depend on the jurisdiction.\n\nI should check if there's a legal way for him to relinquish rights. In some places, you can voluntarily terminate parental rights, but that usually requires the court's approval and might involve the child's best interest. The author might not be able to unilaterally decide that. Also, the mother's friends calling him selfish adds to the conflict.\n\nSo, the answer depends on balancing legal obligations and moral responsibility. Legally, he might be obligated to pay child support regardless of his feelings. Morally, it's subjective\u2014some might side with his autonomy, others with the child's needs. The question is whether he's in the wrong. If the law requires support, then he's in the wrong legally, but morally, it's a gray area. The user might be looking for a legal perspective here. Since the question is whether he's in the wrong, the answer might lean towards A (he's in the wrong) because of legal obligations, but some might argue B if they focus on his prior stance and lack of intent.\n"
