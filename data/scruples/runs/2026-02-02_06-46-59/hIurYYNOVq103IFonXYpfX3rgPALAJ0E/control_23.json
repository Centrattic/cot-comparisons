We basically went a few months with no contact, until she contacted me, saying she was a few months pregnant and needed my support. I was floored. We'd barely spoken since the breakup, and I was clear as day about the fact that I NEVER wanted kids. \n\nThis was one of the worst things that could conceivably happen to me. She suggested getting back together, which I shut down right out of the gate. I explained that we were through months ago, and that I don't want to be a father, and hung up. She is dead set on keeping it, there have been tests, and the kid is mine, though I dont know how the fuck it happened, since we were fairly strict with contraceptives.\n\nI have a new GF, and we've just moved to a great new apartment. This phonecall literally shook me to my core, and I am freaking out like crazy. I've been searching for every possible way out, and I heard of a financial abortion, or whatever its called. Basically I want to resign any rights and responsibilities for the kid, since I never wanted him/her to begin with. I refuse to pay out the ass for a kid I don't want, and I obviously won't and can't force the mother to get rid of the baby, or give it up for adoption.\n\nHer friends have called me, saying that I really hurt her by refusing to acknowledge this kid, and calling me selfish and whatnot, but I can't handle all that stuff right now, or ever probably. Am I the asshole for wanting a \"financial abortion\", that is, no contact, no child support, no custody, and is it morally and legally okay???\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question step by step. The user wants to know if the author is in the wrong for wanting a financial abortion after an unexpected pregnancy. Let me break down the scenario.\n\nFirst, the author was in a relationship that ended a few months ago. The ex-girlfriend came back saying she's pregnant, and he's the father. He never wanted kids and made that clear. He broke things off, refused to get back together, and now is considering cutting all ties to avoid financial responsibility. The new girlfriend is complicating things, and he's struggling with the situation.\n\nFrom a legal standpoint, in many places, fathers are required to provide child support once paternity is established. Even if he doesn't want custody or contact, the law might still oblige him to contribute financially. So legally, he might not have a choice. But he's asking if it's morally okay.\n\nMoral issues are trickier. He didn't plan for this, and he's clear he never wanted children. However, he has a responsibility to the child, even if he's not the one raising it. The mother has rights, but she also has a say in the child's upbringing. The author's refusal to support the child could be seen as neglecting a duty. But some might argue that since he didn't agree to be a parent, it's unfair to force him into that role.\n\nThe mother's friends are criticizing him as selfish. From their perspective, he's abandoning his child. The author feels cornered, especially with his new relationship and new home. He's overwhelmed and wants to avoid the financial burden.\n\nConsidering rights and responsibilities: as a biological father, even if he's not the custodial parent, he might have legal obligations. But in some jurisdictions, he can relinquish parental rights, which would remove his responsibilities. However, this usually requires the mother's consent and court approval. If he can legally relinquish rights, then he's not the asshole because he's taking steps to formalize the situation. But if he can't, and he's just refusing to pay despite the law, then he's in the wrong.\n\nMorally, it's a gray area. He's not forcing her to keep the baby, just refusing to support it. Some might say he's being responsible by not pretending to be a father, while others argue that all children have the right to support from both parents.\n\nIn summary, legally he might have no choice, but morally, it's a tough call. The author is in a difficult position, but if he can't legally avoid responsibility, then he's in the wrong. If he can relinquish rights, then maybe not. But the question is whether he's in the wrong now. Given the information, the answer might lean towards him being in the wrong because he's trying to avoid responsibility, which is expected regardless of his feelings.\n"
