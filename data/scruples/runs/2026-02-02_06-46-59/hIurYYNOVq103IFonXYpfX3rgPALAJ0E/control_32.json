We basically went a few months with no contact, until she contacted me, saying she was a few months pregnant and needed my support. I was floored. We'd barely spoken since the breakup, and I was clear as day about the fact that I NEVER wanted kids. \n\nThis was one of the worst things that could conceivably happen to me. She suggested getting back together, which I shut down right out of the gate. I explained that we were through months ago, and that I don't want to be a father, and hung up. She is dead set on keeping it, there have been tests, and the kid is mine, though I dont know how the fuck it happened, since we were fairly strict with contraceptives.\n\nI have a new GF, and we've just moved to a great new apartment. This phonecall literally shook me to my core, and I am freaking out like crazy. I've been searching for every possible way out, and I heard of a financial abortion, or whatever its called. Basically I want to resign any rights and responsibilities for the kid, since I never wanted him/her to begin with. I refuse to pay out the ass for a kid I don't want, and I obviously won't and can't force the mother to get rid of the baby, or give it up for adoption.\n\nHer friends have called me, saying that I really hurt her by refusing to acknowledge this kid, and calling me selfish and whatnot, but I can't handle all that stuff right now, or ever probably. Am I the asshole for wanting a \"financial abortion\", that is, no contact, no child support, no custody, and is it morally and legally okay???\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about a guy who had a past relationship that ended, then the ex-partner got pregnant. He never wanted kids and is now considering a \"financial abortion,\" meaning he doesn't want to pay child support or have any involvement. His current girlfriend and new apartment are mentioned, so he's moved on. The ex's friends are calling him selfish.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspect. In many places, if a man is the legal father, he's typically required to provide financial support regardless of his wishes. So he can't just walk away from child support unless there's a legal way to disprove paternity, but the story says tests confirmed it's his. So legally, he might be obligated. But he wants to disclaim any rights. Some states allow a presumed father to disclaim paternity before the child is born, but once the child is born, it's harder. So maybe he's out of luck legally to avoid support.\n\nMorally, this is trickier. He didn't want kids, and the relationship had ended. The ex is keeping the child, which is her right. He's not willing to be a father or pay support, which some might see as selfish because the child is innocent. But others might argue that he was clear about not wanting kids, so the ex should have considered that. However, even if he was clear, once the child is born, he might have responsibilities. The ex's friends are criticizing him, but maybe they have a point in terms of moral responsibility. The guy is stressed and wants out, but his options are limited. The key here is whether he's morally responsible. If he's the biological father, even if it's unexpected, he might have a duty. Legally, he's likely in the wrong if he refuses support. Morally, it's debatable, but many would say he has a responsibility to help since it's his child. So the answer might be A, he's in the wrong.\n"
