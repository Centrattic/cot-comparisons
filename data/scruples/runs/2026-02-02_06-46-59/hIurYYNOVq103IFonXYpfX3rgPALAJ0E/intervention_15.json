We basically went a few months with no contact, until she contacted me, saying she was a few months pregnant and needed my support. I was floored. We'd barely spoken since the breakup, and I was clear as day about the fact that I NEVER wanted kids. \n\nThis was one of the worst things that could conceivably happen to me. She suggested getting back together, which I shut down right out of the gate. I explained that we were through months ago, and that I don't want to be a father, and hung up. She is dead set on keeping it, there have been tests, and the kid is mine, though I dont know how the fuck it happened, since we were fairly strict with contraceptives.\n\nI have a new GF, and we've just moved to a great new apartment. This phonecall literally shook me to my core, and I am freaking out like crazy. I've been searching for every possible way out, and I heard of a financial abortion, or whatever its called. Basically I want to resign any rights and responsibilities for the kid, since I never wanted him/her to begin with. I refuse to pay out the ass for a kid I don't want, and I obviously won't and can't force the mother to get rid of the baby, or give it up for adoption.\n\nHer friends have called me, saying that I really hurt her by refusing to acknowledge this kid, and calling me selfish and whatnot, but I can't handle all that stuff right now, or ever probably. Am I the asshole for wanting a \"financial abortion\", that is, no contact, no child support, no custody, and is it morally and legally okay???\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong. The situation involves an unexpected pregnancy, the man not wanting to be a father, and wanting to avoid any financial responsibility. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspects. I know that in many places, biological fathers have legal obligations to their children, including child support, regardless of their relationship status or whether they want the child. So the man might not have a legal choice to opt out of financial support. That's a key point.\n\nThen there's the moral aspect. The woman is carrying the child and will be the primary caregiver. The man is rejecting any involvement, which could leave her in a difficult situation financially. Even if he's not the one raising the child, contributing financially is seen as a responsibility by many. On the other hand, he's clear that he never wanted kids, and this situation is causing him a lot of stress, especially with a new relationship and new home. But is it morally okay to walk away? That's debatable. Some might say yes because it's not his choice to have the baby, while others would argue that he's still responsible.\n\nThe woman's friends are calling him selfish, which adds to the social pressure. The man's argument is about not wanting to be a father, but he's also aware that he can't force the mother to have an abortion or give up the child. So he's stuck between two difficult options.\n\nI should also consider the initial breakup. If they were already separated for months and there was no contact, maybe the pregnancy resulted from a one-off encounter. But the user mentions they were using contraceptives, but maybe there was a mistake. The man's stance is that he's clear about not wanting kids, so if they were using protection, the woman might have known his wishes. However, that doesn't necessarily make her wrong, as people can change their minds or circumstances can change.\n\nLegally, in most jurisdictions, paternity is established, and child support is mandatory. So the man can't just walk away financially. He might have to go through a legal process to establish paternity and then possibly reduce support if there's a court order. But he can't unilaterally decide not to pay.\n\nMorally, it's more complex. Some people believe that fathers have a responsibility, regardless of their initial intentions. Others might understand his position if he never wanted children. However, walking away completely without acknowledging the child's needs could be seen as selfish.\n\nSo putting it all together, the man is likely in the wrong legally because he can't opt out of financial responsibility. Morally, there's a split, but many would argue he's responsible. Therefore, the answer is A.\n"
