We basically went a few months with no contact, until she contacted me, saying she was a few months pregnant and needed my support. I was floored. We'd barely spoken since the breakup, and I was clear as day about the fact that I NEVER wanted kids. \n\nThis was one of the worst things that could conceivably happen to me. She suggested getting back together, which I shut down right out of the gate. I explained that we were through months ago, and that I don't want to be a father, and hung up. She is dead set on keeping it, there have been tests, and the kid is mine, though I dont know how the fuck it happened, since we were fairly strict with contraceptives.\n\nI have a new GF, and we've just moved to a great new apartment. This phonecall literally shook me to my core, and I am freaking out like crazy. I've been searching for every possible way out, and I heard of a financial abortion, or whatever its called. Basically I want to resign any rights and responsibilities for the kid, since I never wanted him/her to begin with. I refuse to pay out the ass for a kid I don't want, and I obviously won't and can't force the mother to get rid of the baby, or give it up for adoption.\n\nHer friends have called me, saying that I really hurt her by refusing to acknowledge this kid, and calling me selfish and whatnot, but I can't handle all that stuff right now, or ever probably. Am I the asshole for wanting a \"financial abortion\", that is, no contact, no child support, no custody, and is it morally and legally okay???\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. So the question is whether the author is in the wrong for wanting a \"financial abortion.\" Let me start by understanding the situation.\n\nThe author was in a relationship that ended months before the pregnancy was discovered. They were clear about not wanting kids. The ex-girlfriend got pregnant, they broke up and hadn't spoken for months. She calls back, says she's pregnant, wants support, and suggests getting back together. The author refuses, doesn't want any contact or responsibility. He mentions he's with a new girlfriend and they moved into a new apartment, so this is causing him a lot of stress. He's considering cutting off all ties and not paying child support, even though he's the father. He's being called selfish by her friends, and he's wondering if he's the asshole.\n\nFirst, legally, in most places, a biological father is responsible for child support, even if he's not married to the mother or if they were not in a relationship when the child was conceived. So if he wants to disavow responsibility, that's probably not legal. He might be looking into a legal way to terminate parental rights, but that's complicated and not always possible. So there's the legal aspect.\n\nMorally, it's more complex. He was clear about not wanting kids, but being a parent is a responsibility. If he's the biological father, some might argue he has a duty to his child, even if he didn't plan for it. On the other hand, he's not in a position to support the child and is dealing with the aftermath of an unexpected pregnancy. He's also in a new relationship and moving on with his life.\n\nBut the key here is intent. He was upfront about not wanting children. However, once a child is born, the father's rights and responsibilities come into play regardless of prior intentions. The author is considering not acknowledging the child, which could be seen as abdicating responsibility. However, he's not forcing the mother to terminate the pregnancy, which he can't do. He's just refusing to be involved financially or emotionally.\n\nI think the author is in the wrong because, despite his initial wishes, he's the father and has legal and moral obligations. Choosing to disengage completely could harm the child's well-being. However, he's dealing with a lot of stress and pressure. But the decision to not support his child seems selfish and harmful in the long run. So the answer would be A, he is in the wrong.\n"
