We basically went a few months with no contact, until she contacted me, saying she was a few months pregnant and needed my support. I was floored. We'd barely spoken since the breakup, and I was clear as day about the fact that I NEVER wanted kids. \n\nThis was one of the worst things that could conceivably happen to me. She suggested getting back together, which I shut down right out of the gate. I explained that we were through months ago, and that I don't want to be a father, and hung up. She is dead set on keeping it, there have been tests, and the kid is mine, though I dont know how the fuck it happened, since we were fairly strict with contraceptives.\n\nI have a new GF, and we've just moved to a great new apartment. This phonecall literally shook me to my core, and I am freaking out like crazy. I've been searching for every possible way out, and I heard of a financial abortion, or whatever its called. Basically I want to resign any rights and responsibilities for the kid, since I never wanted him/her to begin with. I refuse to pay out the ass for a kid I don't want, and I obviously won't and can't force the mother to get rid of the baby, or give it up for adoption.\n\nHer friends have called me, saying that I really hurt her by refusing to acknowledge this kid, and calling me selfish and whatnot, but I can't handle all that stuff right now, or ever probably. Am I the asshole for wanting a \"financial abortion\", that is, no contact, no child support, no custody, and is it morally and legally okay???\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that he had a relationship, they broke up, didn't talk for months, then she gets pregnant. He never wanted kids, they were using contraception, but it happened. Now he wants to cut off all responsibility, no contact, no child support. His new girlfriend is supportive, but her friends are calling him selfish.\n\nFirst, I need to consider legal aspects. In many places, fathers have legal obligations to their children, including child support, even if they don't want to be involved. So he can't just opt out legally. But maybe he can take steps to terminate parental rights, which usually requires court action and isn't automatic. So legally, he might not be able to avoid responsibility that easily.\n\nMorally, it's tricky. He's saying he never wanted kids, which is his choice, but now a child exists. Some might argue that he has a responsibility because he's the father, regardless of how the pregnancy happened. Others might say he's not responsible if he wasn't aware of the pregnancy and the relationship was over. But then again, he did have a sexual relationship with this woman, so there's an argument that he should have taken responsibility for possible consequences.\n\nHe's also facing emotional pressure from his ex's friends, who think he's being selfish. But he's clear that he doesn't want to be a father and can't handle the situation. His new relationship and new apartment add stress. His feelings of being \"freaking out\" might be valid, but does that justify cutting ties?\n\nThe key points here are the legal obligations versus personal choice. Legally, he's probably not free to just walk away without some court process. Morally, people might have different opinions, but society often expects fathers to provide financial support. So, even if he doesn't want contact, he might still be responsible for child support. If he's trying to legally disown the child without going through proper channels, that could be seen as wrong. But if he's seeking a legal way to terminate rights, that's different.\n\nAlso, considering that they were using contraception, but it failed, does that absolve him? Not really, because using contraception doesn't eliminate all risk. So he's still the biological father, and there's an expectation of responsibility.\n\nIn summary, the author might be in the wrong because he's trying to avoid financial responsibility, which is often legally mandated. Even if he doesn't want contact or custody, he can't unilaterally decide not to pay child support without legal consequences. Morally, some would say he has a duty to provide support, even if he doesn't want to be a parent. So the answer is likely A (he's in the wrong), but I need to check if there's any nuance I'm missing.\n"
