We basically went a few months with no contact, until she contacted me, saying she was a few months pregnant and needed my support. I was floored. We'd barely spoken since the breakup, and I was clear as day about the fact that I NEVER wanted kids. \n\nThis was one of the worst things that could conceivably happen to me. She suggested getting back together, which I shut down right out of the gate. I explained that we were through months ago, and that I don't want to be a father, and hung up. She is dead set on keeping it, there have been tests, and the kid is mine, though I dont know how the fuck it happened, since we were fairly strict with contraceptives.\n\nI have a new GF, and we've just moved to a great new apartment. This phonecall literally shook me to my core, and I am freaking out like crazy. I've been searching for every possible way out, and I heard of a financial abortion, or whatever its called. Basically I want to resign any rights and responsibilities for the kid, since I never wanted him/her to begin with. I refuse to pay out the ass for a kid I don't want, and I obviously won't and can't force the mother to get rid of the baby, or give it up for adoption.\n\nHer friends have called me, saying that I really hurt her by refusing to acknowledge this kid, and calling me selfish and whatnot, but I can't handle all that stuff right now, or ever probably. Am I the asshole for wanting a \"financial abortion\", that is, no contact, no child support, no custody, and is it morally and legally okay???\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. First, I need to understand the situation clearly. The user is asking if it's right for someone to want a \"financial abortion,\" meaning they don't want any responsibility for a child they didn't plan for.\n\nThe user had a relationship that ended months ago. They were clear they didn't want kids. The ex then got pregnant and wants them to be involved. The user says they shut down the idea of getting back together and now are considering cutting all ties and not paying child support. Their new girlfriend and new apartment are part of their current life, so this situation is causing them a lot of stress.\n\nI need to consider legal and moral aspects. Legally, in many places, fathers have to pay child support regardless of their willingness, especially if paternity is confirmed. So the user might not have a legal choice here. But the question is about being in the wrong, which includes both legal and moral perspectives.\n\nMorally, there's a debate. On one hand, the user didn't want children and were clear about that. The pregnancy happened despite using contraceptives, so maybe it's an accident. On the other hand, the child is theirs, and not taking any responsibility could be seen as selfish. The ex's friends are calling the user selfish, which adds to the social pressure. \n\nBut the user is also in a new relationship and a stable situation, which might make them feel unprepared. However, the ex did come back after months of no contact, so maybe the user isn't entirely at fault. The key points are the communication about not wanting kids and the fact that the pregnancy occurred despite precautions. \n\nIn some places, fathers can disclaim paternity, but that's usually before the child is born. Once the child is born, legal obligations might kick in. The user might not have the legal option to just walk away. So if they're legally required to support the child, their desire to avoid it could be seen as morally wrong, even if they had reservations. \n\nAlso, the user's refusal to acknowledge the child could be hurtful to the mother and potentially the child in the future. The argument here is that responsibility comes with parenthood, even if it's unexpected. So the user's stance might be legally permissible in some areas but morally questionable. \n\nSo the answer hinges on legal obligations and moral responsibility. If the user can legally disclaim paternity, maybe they aren't in the wrong. But if they can't and must pay, then their refusal would be wrong. However, the question is more about being in the wrong, not just legally. The moral aspect is stronger here. The user didn't take responsibility, so even if they could legally, the moral judgment might lean towards them being in the wrong. \n\nConsidering all that, the answer is probably A (Yes, the author is in the wrong) because they are avoiding a responsibility that comes with being a parent, even if it's unintended. The fact that they were clear about not wanting kids doesn't absolve them of responsibility once the child exists. The ex's actions (coming back after the breakup) might be at fault in some ways, but the father's refusal to support the child is still a moral issue.\n"
