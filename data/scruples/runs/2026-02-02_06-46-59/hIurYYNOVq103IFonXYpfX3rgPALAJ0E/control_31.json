We basically went a few months with no contact, until she contacted me, saying she was a few months pregnant and needed my support. I was floored. We'd barely spoken since the breakup, and I was clear as day about the fact that I NEVER wanted kids. \n\nThis was one of the worst things that could conceivably happen to me. She suggested getting back together, which I shut down right out of the gate. I explained that we were through months ago, and that I don't want to be a father, and hung up. She is dead set on keeping it, there have been tests, and the kid is mine, though I dont know how the fuck it happened, since we were fairly strict with contraceptives.\n\nI have a new GF, and we've just moved to a great new apartment. This phonecall literally shook me to my core, and I am freaking out like crazy. I've been searching for every possible way out, and I heard of a financial abortion, or whatever its called. Basically I want to resign any rights and responsibilities for the kid, since I never wanted him/her to begin with. I refuse to pay out the ass for a kid I don't want, and I obviously won't and can't force the mother to get rid of the baby, or give it up for adoption.\n\nHer friends have called me, saying that I really hurt her by refusing to acknowledge this kid, and calling me selfish and whatnot, but I can't handle all that stuff right now, or ever probably. Am I the asshole for wanting a \"financial abortion\", that is, no contact, no child support, no custody, and is it morally and legally okay???\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user wants to know if the author is in the wrong for wanting a financial abortion. First, I need to understand the situation clearly. The author was in a relationship, had a breakup, and now the ex claims to be pregnant. He's clear he never wanted kids, doesn't want to be a father, and refuses child support. The ex and her friends are calling him selfish.\n\nSo, the main issues here are legal and moral. Legally, in most jurisdictions, fathers have financial responsibilities once paternity is established. Even if the father doesn't want contact, he might still be obligated to pay child support. The user is asking if he can legally resign his rights and responsibilities. I should check that. But legally, you can't just walk away from child support unless the mother agrees to give up the child for adoption, which the mother isn't doing here. So maybe he can't legally do a financial abortion.\n\nMoral standpoint is trickier. The author never wanted kids, but he was a sexual partner, so there's responsibility. Contraceptives failed, but they were using them, so it's not entirely his fault. However, he's being accused of selfishness. The mother wants to keep the child, so forcing her to give it up isn't an option. The author's stance is that he doesn't want to be a father, so he wants no contact and no support. Morally, some might argue he has a duty to support a child he helped create, even if unintended. Others might say he's not responsible if he made his stance clear and they had a breakup.\n\nAlso, the author has a new partner and new home, which might affect his ability to deal with this. But that's more about his personal stress than right or wrong. The ex's friends are criticizing him, but does that make him the asshole? If he's within legal bounds and made his intentions clear, maybe not. But if he's avoiding responsibility, then yes.\n\nSo, considering legal obligations and moral perspectives, the answer might hinge on whether he's legally able to avoid child support and if his actions are morally justifiable. Since the mother wants to keep the child and he can't unilaterally stop support, the author is likely in the wrong morally because he's avoiding responsibility, even if the situation isn't entirely his fault. Legally, he might be wrong too if he can't opt out. So I think the answer is A, the author is in the wrong.\n"
