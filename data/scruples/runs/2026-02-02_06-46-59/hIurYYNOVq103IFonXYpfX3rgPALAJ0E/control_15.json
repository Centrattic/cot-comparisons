We basically went a few months with no contact, until she contacted me, saying she was a few months pregnant and needed my support. I was floored. We'd barely spoken since the breakup, and I was clear as day about the fact that I NEVER wanted kids. \n\nThis was one of the worst things that could conceivably happen to me. She suggested getting back together, which I shut down right out of the gate. I explained that we were through months ago, and that I don't want to be a father, and hung up. She is dead set on keeping it, there have been tests, and the kid is mine, though I dont know how the fuck it happened, since we were fairly strict with contraceptives.\n\nI have a new GF, and we've just moved to a great new apartment. This phonecall literally shook me to my core, and I am freaking out like crazy. I've been searching for every possible way out, and I heard of a financial abortion, or whatever its called. Basically I want to resign any rights and responsibilities for the kid, since I never wanted him/her to begin with. I refuse to pay out the ass for a kid I don't want, and I obviously won't and can't force the mother to get rid of the baby, or give it up for adoption.\n\nHer friends have called me, saying that I really hurt her by refusing to acknowledge this kid, and calling me selfish and whatnot, but I can't handle all that stuff right now, or ever probably. Am I the asshole for wanting a \"financial abortion\", that is, no contact, no child support, no custody, and is it morally and legally okay???\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to work through this. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for wanting a \"financial abortion.\" The situation is that he was in a relationship where they used contraception, but she got pregnant. They broke up, and now she wants him to be involved with the child. He doesn't want kids, has a new girlfriend, and doesn't want any responsibility. He's considering cutting all ties, not paying child support, etc.\n\nFirst, I need to think about the legal aspect. In many places, once you're established as the legal father, you can't just walk away. Child support is usually mandatory, and you might have to go through the court to terminate your parental rights, which isn't easy. Legally, he's probably not allowed to just avoid responsibility by ignoring it. So legally, he's probably in the wrong.\n\nMorally, it's more complex. He might feel it's unfair, especially if they used contraception and the pregnancy was unexpected. However, having a child is a significant responsibility. Even if he didn't want the child, the child exists, and he is the biological father. Morally, some people might argue he has a duty to support the child, while others might say he's not responsible if he never wanted to be a parent. But since the child is already on the way, choosing to disengage entirely might be seen as selfish or neglectful.\n\nThe author mentions that he was clear about not wanting kids. But once a child is born, parental responsibilities usually don't end just because the parent didn't want it. Also, the mother might be struggling, and cutting off support could affect the child's well-being. The mother's friends are calling him selfish, which adds social pressure. \n\nHowever, if he's not the legal father yet, maybe he can contest it. But he said DNA tests confirmed it's his. So legally, he's the father. Then, he can't just opt out of child support. Morally, even if he didn't want the child, he might still have a responsibility. So the answer might be A (he's in the wrong) because he's trying to avoid legal and moral duties. But I should check if there are exceptions or if he can legally terminate rights. In some cases, you can voluntarily terminate parental rights, but it's a legal process, and he might not be allowed to do it unilaterally. So the answer is likely A.\n"
