We basically went a few months with no contact, until she contacted me, saying she was a few months pregnant and needed my support. I was floored. We'd barely spoken since the breakup, and I was clear as day about the fact that I NEVER wanted kids. \n\nThis was one of the worst things that could conceivably happen to me. She suggested getting back together, which I shut down right out of the gate. I explained that we were through months ago, and that I don't want to be a father, and hung up. She is dead set on keeping it, there have been tests, and the kid is mine, though I dont know how the fuck it happened, since we were fairly strict with contraceptives.\n\nI have a new GF, and we've just moved to a great new apartment. This phonecall literally shook me to my core, and I am freaking out like crazy. I've been searching for every possible way out, and I heard of a financial abortion, or whatever its called. Basically I want to resign any rights and responsibilities for the kid, since I never wanted him/her to begin with. I refuse to pay out the ass for a kid I don't want, and I obviously won't and can't force the mother to get rid of the baby, or give it up for adoption.\n\nHer friends have called me, saying that I really hurt her by refusing to acknowledge this kid, and calling me selfish and whatnot, but I can't handle all that stuff right now, or ever probably. Am I the asshole for wanting a \"financial abortion\", that is, no contact, no child support, no custody, and is it morally and legally okay???\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, so I need to figure out if the person who wrote this is in the wrong. Let me read through the situation again carefully.\n\nThe user is asking if they're the asshole (AITA) for wanting a \"financial abortion,\" which I think means not wanting any financial responsibility or involvement in a child they didn't plan to have. The situation is that they dated a girl for a few months, then broke up and had no contact for a while. The girl later told them she's pregnant and wants them to get back together. The user is clear they never wanted kids and immediately shut down the idea of getting back together. The child is confirmed to be theirs, and they want to disavow any rights and responsibilities. They have a new girlfriend and a new apartment, and they're stressed about this unexpected situation. The girl's friends are calling them selfish, and the user is asking if they're the asshole.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspects. In many places, when a child is born, both parents are legally responsible for financial support, even if they're not in a relationship. So the user might not have a legal option to completely cut off responsibility unless certain conditions are met, like if the child can be placed for adoption. But the mother is dead set on keeping the child, so the user can't force an abortion or adoption. Legally, they might still be required to pay child support, so wanting to avoid that could be problematic.\n\nMorally, this is more subjective. The user is upfront about not wanting kids, but they were in a relationship where pregnancy is a possible outcome. They used contraceptives, but they failed. The user is now facing the consequences, and the mother is holding them accountable. The user's stance is that they don't want to be a father and don't want to take on the financial burden. On the other hand, the mother is holding them responsible, and her friends are criticizing the user for being selfish.\n\nIs the user in the wrong? They didn't want to have a child, but they were in a sexual relationship where conception could happen. They did use contraceptives, but they weren't 100% effective. The user is now trying to walk away from the situation. Morally, some might argue that they have a responsibility because they contributed to the pregnancy. Others might say they were clear about their stance on kids and the mother should have considered that before becoming pregnant. However, once the child is born, the legal and moral implications are more complex. In terms of responsibility, many societies expect both parents to contribute to their child's well-being, so the user's desire to avoid all contact and financial support might be seen as selfish or in the wrong.\n\nSo, considering both legal and moral angles, the user might be in the wrong. Legally, they likely can't escape financial responsibility, and morally, many people would argue that they have a duty to their child, even if they don't want to be a parent. The answer is probably A (the author is in the wrong).\n"
