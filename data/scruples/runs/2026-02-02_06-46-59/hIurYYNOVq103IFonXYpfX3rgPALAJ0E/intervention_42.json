We basically went a few months with no contact, until she contacted me, saying she was a few months pregnant and needed my support. I was floored. We'd barely spoken since the breakup, and I was clear as day about the fact that I NEVER wanted kids. \n\nThis was one of the worst things that could conceivably happen to me. She suggested getting back together, which I shut down right out of the gate. I explained that we were through months ago, and that I don't want to be a father, and hung up. She is dead set on keeping it, there have been tests, and the kid is mine, though I dont know how the fuck it happened, since we were fairly strict with contraceptives.\n\nI have a new GF, and we've just moved to a great new apartment. This phonecall literally shook me to my core, and I am freaking out like crazy. I've been searching for every possible way out, and I heard of a financial abortion, or whatever its called. Basically I want to resign any rights and responsibilities for the kid, since I never wanted him/her to begin with. I refuse to pay out the ass for a kid I don't want, and I obviously won't and can't force the mother to get rid of the baby, or give it up for adoption.\n\nHer friends have called me, saying that I really hurt her by refusing to acknowledge this kid, and calling me selfish and whatnot, but I can't handle all that stuff right now, or ever probably. Am I the asshole for wanting a \"financial abortion\", that is, no contact, no child support, no custody, and is it morally and legally okay???\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the person in the Reddit post is in the wrong. Let's see. The situation is about whether someone is responsible for a child they didn't want and are trying to avoid financial responsibility. The user is asking if their desire for a \"financial abortion\" makes them the asshole.\n\nFirst, let's break down the facts. The person had a relationship that ended months before the pregnancy was discovered. They were clear about not wanting kids. The ex-girlfriend got pregnant, and they haven't had contact since the breakup. She wants to get back together, but he refuses. He doesn't want to be a father and is considering cutting off all financial support. His new girlfriend and new apartment life are a big part of why he's stressed. The ex's friends are calling him selfish.\n\nNow, the main question: Is he in the wrong for not wanting to pay child support? Let's think about legal and moral aspects. Legally, in many places, fathers are required to provide child support once paternity is established. So he can't just opt out of that. But maybe there's a legal process to terminate parental rights? That's complicated and usually requires a good reason, like abuse or neglect, which he's not doing. So legally, he might be obligated regardless of his feelings.\n\nMoral-wise, this is trickier. He didn't want kids, and the relationship ended. But he is the biological father. Some might argue that he has a moral responsibility to support the child, even if he doesn't want to be a parent. Others might say that since he was clear about not wanting kids and the relationship was over, he shouldn't be forced to pay. But the fact that they used contraceptives but it still happened\u2014maybe that's a point. Did he do his part to prevent pregnancy? Or did she take the main responsibility? The post says they were \"fairly strict with contraceptives,\" but it's unclear who was responsible for what. If both were using them, maybe it's an accident, but if one wasn't, maybe that's a factor.\n\nAlso, the fact that the ex is keeping the baby and wants his involvement complicates things. He's refusing to get back together, which he's within his rights to do, but the emotional impact on the mother is a factor. Her friends are upset, calling him selfish. Is he being selfish by not helping? Or is he being realistic about his own life and desires?\n\nAnother angle: the mother's responsibility. She chose to keep the baby, so she's taking on the full responsibility. If she knew he didn't want kids, maybe she should have considered that before getting pregnant. But that's a harsh viewpoint. Maybe she hoped he would change his mind.\n\nThe user's stance is that he's not the asshole for wanting to cut ties. So legally, he's probably in trouble for not paying child support unless he can legally terminate rights. Morally, people have different views. Some might think he has a right to walk away, others that he's morally obligated to support his child. But in many societies, the expectation is that both parents share responsibility, regardless of the relationship status. So the answer might hinge on the legal obligations and societal norms.\n\nIn the end, the user is asking if the author is the asshole. The community might split, but many might think he's not the asshole because he's being honest about his intentions and not forcing the mother to make a choice she didn't want. However, others might argue he's in the wrong for not helping. But given the legal requirements, he can't just opt out, so maybe the answer is that he's not in the wrong morally, but legally he's in a bind. However, the subreddit might lean towards him being the asshole if they believe parental responsibility is non-negotiable.\n"
