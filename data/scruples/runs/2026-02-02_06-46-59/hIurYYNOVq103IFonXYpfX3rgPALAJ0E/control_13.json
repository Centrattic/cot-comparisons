We basically went a few months with no contact, until she contacted me, saying she was a few months pregnant and needed my support. I was floored. We'd barely spoken since the breakup, and I was clear as day about the fact that I NEVER wanted kids. \n\nThis was one of the worst things that could conceivably happen to me. She suggested getting back together, which I shut down right out of the gate. I explained that we were through months ago, and that I don't want to be a father, and hung up. She is dead set on keeping it, there have been tests, and the kid is mine, though I dont know how the fuck it happened, since we were fairly strict with contraceptives.\n\nI have a new GF, and we've just moved to a great new apartment. This phonecall literally shook me to my core, and I am freaking out like crazy. I've been searching for every possible way out, and I heard of a financial abortion, or whatever its called. Basically I want to resign any rights and responsibilities for the kid, since I never wanted him/her to begin with. I refuse to pay out the ass for a kid I don't want, and I obviously won't and can't force the mother to get rid of the baby, or give it up for adoption.\n\nHer friends have called me, saying that I really hurt her by refusing to acknowledge this kid, and calling me selfish and whatnot, but I can't handle all that stuff right now, or ever probably. Am I the asshole for wanting a \"financial abortion\", that is, no contact, no child support, no custody, and is it morally and legally okay???\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation involves an unexpected pregnancy after a breakup, and the author wanting to avoid any financial or parental responsibilities.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspects. In most places, if a man is the legal father, he may be required to pay child support. The author might not want to have any contact or financial responsibility, but legally, that's not always possible. So maybe there's a legal obligation here, which could be a point against the author.\n\nThen there's the moral aspect. The mother wants to keep the child, and the author is being called selfish for not supporting. But the author is clear that he never wanted children. People have the right to their reproductive choices, but when it comes to child support, there's often a societal expectation that the father has some responsibility. However, the author isn't trying to stop the mother from keeping the child, just not being involved. Is that selfish? It's tricky. Some might say he's being realistic about his own limits, others that he's avoiding responsibility.\n\nAlso, the author mentions they were using contraceptives. That might not absolve him legally, but could be a point in his favor if there was a failure in the method. But the mother is still carrying the child, so she has the final say in decisions like abortion or adoption. The author can't force her to do either, which he acknowledges. So he's not trying to interfere with her bodily autonomy, which is a positive.\n\nThe new girlfriend's perspective isn't directly addressed, but moving into a new apartment might affect financial stability if child support is required. The author is stressed about this, which is understandable. But again, he's choosing not to take responsibility, which might be seen as inconsiderate.\n\nIn terms of the \"financial abortion\" idea, legally, he might not be able to disown the child completely. There might be a process to establish paternity, and once that's done, he could be obligated to pay. Disowning a child legally is possible in some jurisdictions but requires specific steps, and even then, there might be obligations. So the author might not have the legal option he thinks he does.\n\nMoral judgment is subjective. Some would say he's being selfish for not supporting a child he's responsible for. Others might say he's being honest about his capabilities and that the mother should have considered possible pregnancy risks after the breakup. The mother's friends are calling him an asshole, which adds to the social pressure, but that doesn't necessarily mean he's wrong morally.\n\nPutting it all together, the author might not be in the wrong legally if he can disown the child, but morally, there's a strong argument that he has responsibilities as a parent. Since the question is about being in the wrong, and considering both legal and moral angles, the answer might depend on which is prioritized. However, since the user is asking for an AITA perspective, which often leans on moral judgment, the author could be seen as the asshole for avoiding responsibility. But if he can legally disown and there's no obligation, maybe not. It's a bit of a gray area, but I think the answer is more likely A (he's in the wrong) because of the moral responsibility aspect.\n"
