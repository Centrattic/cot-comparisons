We basically went a few months with no contact, until she contacted me, saying she was a few months pregnant and needed my support. I was floored. We'd barely spoken since the breakup, and I was clear as day about the fact that I NEVER wanted kids. \n\nThis was one of the worst things that could conceivably happen to me. She suggested getting back together, which I shut down right out of the gate. I explained that we were through months ago, and that I don't want to be a father, and hung up. She is dead set on keeping it, there have been tests, and the kid is mine, though I dont know how the fuck it happened, since we were fairly strict with contraceptives.\n\nI have a new GF, and we've just moved to a great new apartment. This phonecall literally shook me to my core, and I am freaking out like crazy. I've been searching for every possible way out, and I heard of a financial abortion, or whatever its called. Basically I want to resign any rights and responsibilities for the kid, since I never wanted him/her to begin with. I refuse to pay out the ass for a kid I don't want, and I obviously won't and can't force the mother to get rid of the baby, or give it up for adoption.\n\nHer friends have called me, saying that I really hurt her by refusing to acknowledge this kid, and calling me selfish and whatnot, but I can't handle all that stuff right now, or ever probably. Am I the asshole for wanting a \"financial abortion\", that is, no contact, no child support, no custody, and is it morally and legally okay???\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong. The situation involves a man who had a past relationship, a breakup, and now a pregnancy. He doesn't want kids, didn't want to get back together, and is considering not paying child support. The main question is whether he's in the wrong by wanting to avoid financial responsibility.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspects. In many places, fathers are legally required to provide child support, regardless of their consent to the pregnancy. Even if the child isn't his, the tests confirmed paternity. So legally, he might be obligated to pay. But the user is asking about moral and legal wrongness. If it's legal to disown, then maybe not. But generally, child support laws exist to ensure children are provided for, so he might not have a legal option to opt out.\n\nMoral considerations are trickier. He never wanted kids, which is his personal choice. However, once a child is born, there's an argument about responsibility. Even if he didn't plan on being a parent, some people might say he has a duty. Others might say he was wronged because he used contraception. But the fact that it happened despite precautions complicates things. The ex's friends are calling him selfish, but he's also in a new relationship and his life was disrupted.\n\nThe user's stance is that he doesn't want contact, support, or custody. Legally, he can't just disown the child. Courts usually require some level of support. Morally, it's a split. Some might say he's being responsible by not engaging in a relationship where he's not wanted, while others might say he's abandoning a child he's responsible for. The key points are the legal obligation and the ethical duty. Since the question is about being in the wrong, the answer depends on whether his refusal to support is justified. If the law requires support, then he's in the wrong legally. Morally, there's a debate, but the question might lean on the legal side. The answer might be A (in the wrong) because he's legally obligated, so not paying would be wrong. But I need to check if \"financial abortion\" is legally possible. If not, then he's in the wrong. If there's a legal way to disown, maybe not. But generally, no, so answer A.\n"
