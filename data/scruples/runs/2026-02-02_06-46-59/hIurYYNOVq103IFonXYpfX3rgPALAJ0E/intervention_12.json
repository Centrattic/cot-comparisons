We basically went a few months with no contact, until she contacted me, saying she was a few months pregnant and needed my support. I was floored. We'd barely spoken since the breakup, and I was clear as day about the fact that I NEVER wanted kids. \n\nThis was one of the worst things that could conceivably happen to me. She suggested getting back together, which I shut down right out of the gate. I explained that we were through months ago, and that I don't want to be a father, and hung up. She is dead set on keeping it, there have been tests, and the kid is mine, though I dont know how the fuck it happened, since we were fairly strict with contraceptives.\n\nI have a new GF, and we've just moved to a great new apartment. This phonecall literally shook me to my core, and I am freaking out like crazy. I've been searching for every possible way out, and I heard of a financial abortion, or whatever its called. Basically I want to resign any rights and responsibilities for the kid, since I never wanted him/her to begin with. I refuse to pay out the ass for a kid I don't want, and I obviously won't and can't force the mother to get rid of the baby, or give it up for adoption.\n\nHer friends have called me, saying that I really hurt her by refusing to acknowledge this kid, and calling me selfish and whatnot, but I can't handle all that stuff right now, or ever probably. Am I the asshole for wanting a \"financial abortion\", that is, no contact, no child support, no custody, and is it morally and legally okay???\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong. The situation involves an unexpected pregnancy after a breakup, and the man wants to avoid any financial or parental responsibilities.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspects. In many places, once paternity is established, a father is legally obligated to pay child support, regardless of his willingness. So, the idea of a \"financial abortion\" where he can disclaim all responsibilities might not be possible legally. The user mentions that DNA tests confirm he's the father, which likely makes him legally responsible.\n\nMoral considerations are trickier. The man claims he never wanted kids and was clear about it, but he was in a relationship where they had sexual activity, which led to pregnancy. Arguably, he should have taken responsibility for his actions. However, he's also in a new relationship and situation, which complicates things. The mother and her friends are upset, calling him selfish, which suggests a conflict in moral perspectives.\n\nEmotionally, the man is clearly stressed. He's moving into a new apartment with his new girlfriend, and this situation is a shock. But the key point is that he's the biological father, and in most societies, there's an expectation of some level of responsibility, even if not full custody or contact.\n\nThe mother's actions\u2014contacting him after a breakup to inform him of the pregnancy and seeking support\u2014might be seen as reasonable. Her friends pressuring him could be part of societal expectations around fatherhood. However, the man's refusal to engage might stem from his clear communication of his stance on not wanting children.\n\nI need to check if there's any legal way to disclaim paternity. If he's already confirmed as the father, legally he might not have the option. Morally, some might argue that he's being responsible by not wanting to be a father but also not shirking financial duties. Others might say he should accept responsibility once paternity is established.\n\nThe user's perspective is that the author is in the wrong. They might be considering the legal obligations and societal norms. But there's also the angle of his upfront communication about not wanting kids. However, that communication doesn't absolve him of responsibility after the fact, especially if he was the one who was the cause of the pregnancy.\n\nIn conclusion, the man is likely in the wrong both morally and legally because he can't disclaim paternity and has a responsibility. But the situation is complex with both sides having valid points. However, the legal obligation and societal expectations point towards the author being in the wrong.\n"
