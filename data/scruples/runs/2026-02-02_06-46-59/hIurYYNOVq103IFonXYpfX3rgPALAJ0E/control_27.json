We basically went a few months with no contact, until she contacted me, saying she was a few months pregnant and needed my support. I was floored. We'd barely spoken since the breakup, and I was clear as day about the fact that I NEVER wanted kids. \n\nThis was one of the worst things that could conceivably happen to me. She suggested getting back together, which I shut down right out of the gate. I explained that we were through months ago, and that I don't want to be a father, and hung up. She is dead set on keeping it, there have been tests, and the kid is mine, though I dont know how the fuck it happened, since we were fairly strict with contraceptives.\n\nI have a new GF, and we've just moved to a great new apartment. This phonecall literally shook me to my core, and I am freaking out like crazy. I've been searching for every possible way out, and I heard of a financial abortion, or whatever its called. Basically I want to resign any rights and responsibilities for the kid, since I never wanted him/her to begin with. I refuse to pay out the ass for a kid I don't want, and I obviously won't and can't force the mother to get rid of the baby, or give it up for adoption.\n\nHer friends have called me, saying that I really hurt her by refusing to acknowledge this kid, and calling me selfish and whatnot, but I can't handle all that stuff right now, or ever probably. Am I the asshole for wanting a \"financial abortion\", that is, no contact, no child support, no custody, and is it morally and legally okay???\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the \"AITA\" (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong for wanting to disengage financially and emotionally from a child they didn't want, especially after a breakup and a change in their life circumstances.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspects. In most jurisdictions, fathers do have legal responsibilities towards their children, even if they weren't involved during the pregnancy or immediately after. Once paternity is established, the court typically requires child support. So if the person is trying to avoid those legal obligations, they might not be able to do that without going through a formal process. Legal disconnection from a child is complicated and usually requires proof of unfitness or other factors, which might not be straightforward here.\n\nThen, the moral side. The father never wanted kids, and the breakup had already occurred. However, the child is a result of their relationship. Morally, opinions vary. Some might argue that a person has a responsibility to support their child, regardless of their initial desire. Others might see the father's stance as justified if he's made his position clear and the mother is unwilling to consider adoption. But the mother's perspective is also important\u2014she's carrying the child and will be the primary caregiver. The father's refusal to be involved could add to her burden, which could be seen as selfish from some viewpoints.\n\nThe situation is further complicated by the fact that they used contraceptives, but they failed. That might lead to questions about responsibility, but it's not a legal defense. The new relationship and moving into a new apartment could be seen as the father's current life taking priority, but it's also a personal choice.\n\nThe mother's friends are criticizing him, labeling him as selfish. That's a common reaction, but does that mean he's in the wrong? The father is not denying the child's existence, just not wanting to be involved. There's no coercion or harm in this case, but the emotional impact on the mother is significant. If the mother is determined to raise the child without him, the father's non-involvement might be feasible, but the child support issue remains a legal hurdle unless he can have his rights terminated.\n\nSo, considering both legal and moral angles, the father's desire to avoid child support might be legally challenging, and morally, some might argue he's neglecting his responsibility. However, others might empathize with his stance if he's adamant about not wanting children. The key is whether he's legally able to disengage and the ethical implications of his choice. Since the question is whether he's in the wrong, it's a balance between personal choice and societal expectations. The legal obligation is a strong point against his position, but the moral argument is more nuanced. The answer likely leans towards A (in the wrong) due to the legal responsibilities and the mother's potential need for support, even if the father doesn't want to be involved.\n"
