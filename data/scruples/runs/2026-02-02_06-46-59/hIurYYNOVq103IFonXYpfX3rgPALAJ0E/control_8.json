We basically went a few months with no contact, until she contacted me, saying she was a few months pregnant and needed my support. I was floored. We'd barely spoken since the breakup, and I was clear as day about the fact that I NEVER wanted kids. \n\nThis was one of the worst things that could conceivably happen to me. She suggested getting back together, which I shut down right out of the gate. I explained that we were through months ago, and that I don't want to be a father, and hung up. She is dead set on keeping it, there have been tests, and the kid is mine, though I dont know how the fuck it happened, since we were fairly strict with contraceptives.\n\nI have a new GF, and we've just moved to a great new apartment. This phonecall literally shook me to my core, and I am freaking out like crazy. I've been searching for every possible way out, and I heard of a financial abortion, or whatever its called. Basically I want to resign any rights and responsibilities for the kid, since I never wanted him/her to begin with. I refuse to pay out the ass for a kid I don't want, and I obviously won't and can't force the mother to get rid of the baby, or give it up for adoption.\n\nHer friends have called me, saying that I really hurt her by refusing to acknowledge this kid, and calling me selfish and whatnot, but I can't handle all that stuff right now, or ever probably. Am I the asshole for wanting a \"financial abortion\", that is, no contact, no child support, no custody, and is it morally and legally okay???\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. The situation is pretty intense. So, the user is asking if they're the asshole (AITA) for wanting a \"financial abortion.\" From the context, they had a past relationship where they were clear they didn't want kids. They broke up, had no contact for months, then the ex contacts them saying she's pregnant and wants them to get back together. The author refuses and wants nothing to do with the child, hence wanting to cut all ties, including child support.\n\nFirst, let's consider the legal aspect. In many places, once a man is legally recognized as the father, he's obligated to provide child support, regardless of his consent to the pregnancy. Even if he didn't want the child, paternity can be established through DNA testing, and he might be required by law to pay. So the author can't just walk away legally. That's a key point. If he doesn't pay, he could face legal consequences like wage garnishment, fines, or even jail time in extreme cases. So legally, he might not have a choice.\n\nMorally, it's more complex. The author was clear about not wanting kids, but the ex still chose to carry the pregnancy. The author might feel it's unfair to be forced into parenthood when it wasn't part of their plans. But the other side is that the mother chose to keep the child, which brings up questions about responsibility. If the author was a parent without consent, does he still have obligations? On the flip side, the mother might argue she's doing what's best for the child, even if the father doesn't want to be involved.\n\nAlso, the author mentions they were using contraception, but it failed. That's a common issue, but using contraception doesn't eliminate the risk entirely. The author might feel it's not their fault, but in terms of responsibility, once a child is created, there's a societal expectation for both parents to contribute. The author's refusal to take any responsibility could be seen as selfish, especially considering the child's needs.\n\nAnother angle is the new relationship. The author's new GF and their new apartment might be factors. If they're financially stable, maybe they can contribute. But if they're not in a position to support the child, they might be overburdened. However, financial capability isn't the main issue here; legal and moral obligations are.\n\nThe ex's friends are calling the author selfish. That's a judgment on their part, but does that mean the author is in the wrong? It's possible that, from a societal standpoint, parents are expected to support their children regardless of the circumstances. Even if the author didn't want the child, once paternity is established, they have legal and moral duties.\n\nSo, considering all this, legally the author is probably in the wrong because they can't avoid child support once paternity is confirmed. Morally, it's debatable. Some might think the author is being irresponsible, while others might empathize with their situation. However, since the question is whether the author is in the wrong, and given that they can't legally avoid their responsibilities, the answer might lean towards A (they are in the wrong). But I need to be careful here. If the author is seeking to avoid legal obligations, they are indeed wrong. But if they're just asking if they're morally in the wrong, it's a different question. The original question is about whether they're the asshole, so AITA typically considers both legal and moral aspects. Given that, the author can't legally walk away, so they might be in the wrong for wanting to avoid responsibility. However, there's nuance in the circumstances. The author didn't want kids and was clear about it, but the ex still chose to keep the child. So maybe the author isn't entirely to blame, but legally, they have obligations. The answer would depend on the jurisdiction, but generally, the author can't avoid their responsibilities once paternity is established. Therefore, they might be considered wrong in the eyes of the law and societal norms, hence AITA. So the answer would be A, they are in the wrong.\n"
