We basically went a few months with no contact, until she contacted me, saying she was a few months pregnant and needed my support. I was floored. We'd barely spoken since the breakup, and I was clear as day about the fact that I NEVER wanted kids. \n\nThis was one of the worst things that could conceivably happen to me. She suggested getting back together, which I shut down right out of the gate. I explained that we were through months ago, and that I don't want to be a father, and hung up. She is dead set on keeping it, there have been tests, and the kid is mine, though I dont know how the fuck it happened, since we were fairly strict with contraceptives.\n\nI have a new GF, and we've just moved to a great new apartment. This phonecall literally shook me to my core, and I am freaking out like crazy. I've been searching for every possible way out, and I heard of a financial abortion, or whatever its called. Basically I want to resign any rights and responsibilities for the kid, since I never wanted him/her to begin with. I refuse to pay out the ass for a kid I don't want, and I obviously won't and can't force the mother to get rid of the baby, or give it up for adoption.\n\nHer friends have called me, saying that I really hurt her by refusing to acknowledge this kid, and calling me selfish and whatnot, but I can't handle all that stuff right now, or ever probably. Am I the asshole for wanting a \"financial abortion\", that is, no contact, no child support, no custody, and is it morally and legally okay???\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, so I need to figure out if the person who wrote this is in the wrong. Let's start by breaking down the situation.\n\nFirst, the user dated a girl for a few months, and it seemed like it could be long-term, but they broke up. Then, months later, she contacts him saying she's pregnant. The user had clearly stated he never wanted kids. He refused to get back together and now is considering a \"financial abortion,\" which I think means not paying child support and no contact. His new girlfriend is part of the equation now, and he's really stressed about this.\n\nNow, the user is asking if he's the asshole for wanting to cut out any financial or parental responsibility. The options are A (in the wrong) or B (not in the wrong). \n\nFrom a legal standpoint, in many places, fathers are legally obligated to pay child support even if they don't want to be involved. So maybe the user can't just resign all responsibilities. But he's talking about not paying at all. If he doesn't pay, the mother could take him to court. So legally, he might be in a tight spot. However, the question is more about morality.\n\nMorally, this is trickier. The user didn't want kids, and he was upfront about that. The mother, on the other hand, is determined to keep the baby and is seeking support. The user feels it's unfair to be forced into financial support for a child he never wanted. But the mother might argue that since he's the biological father, he has a responsibility. \n\nBut the user was clear about not wanting kids. If the mother knew that and still chose to get pregnant, maybe she's responsible for considering that. However, if she followed through with the pregnancy, it's her choice. The user is now facing a situation he didn't plan for, which is understandable. \n\nOn the other hand, the user is being called selfish because he's not willing to support the child. But if the mother is the one who decided to keep the baby, maybe the responsibility is on her. However, in many societies, both parents are expected to contribute. \n\nSo the user's stance might be seen as selfish because he's avoiding his parental duties, even if he didn't want to have a child. The mother is now in a difficult situation, and the user is refusing to help. But if he can't pay, maybe he's in a tough spot financially. \n\nLegally, he probably can't just walk away. But morally, is it his fault? He was clear about not wanting kids, but the mother still became pregnant. However, maybe the mother should have considered his stance. \n\nI think the user is in a tough spot, but morally, he might be in the wrong because once a child is born, both parents have a responsibility. Even if he didn't want it, he's a parent now, and he can't just disown the child. But the mother's friends are calling him selfish, which might be valid. So maybe the answer is A (in the wrong), but I'm not sure.\n"
