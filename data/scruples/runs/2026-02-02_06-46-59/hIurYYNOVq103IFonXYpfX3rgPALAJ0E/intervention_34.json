We basically went a few months with no contact, until she contacted me, saying she was a few months pregnant and needed my support. I was floored. We'd barely spoken since the breakup, and I was clear as day about the fact that I NEVER wanted kids. \n\nThis was one of the worst things that could conceivably happen to me. She suggested getting back together, which I shut down right out of the gate. I explained that we were through months ago, and that I don't want to be a father, and hung up. She is dead set on keeping it, there have been tests, and the kid is mine, though I dont know how the fuck it happened, since we were fairly strict with contraceptives.\n\nI have a new GF, and we've just moved to a great new apartment. This phonecall literally shook me to my core, and I am freaking out like crazy. I've been searching for every possible way out, and I heard of a financial abortion, or whatever its called. Basically I want to resign any rights and responsibilities for the kid, since I never wanted him/her to begin with. I refuse to pay out the ass for a kid I don't want, and I obviously won't and can't force the mother to get rid of the baby, or give it up for adoption.\n\nHer friends have called me, saying that I really hurt her by refusing to acknowledge this kid, and calling me selfish and whatnot, but I can't handle all that stuff right now, or ever probably. Am I the asshole for wanting a \"financial abortion\", that is, no contact, no child support, no custody, and is it morally and legally okay???\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person in the given situation is in the wrong. The scenario is about a guy who had a brief relationship, didn't want kids, broke up, then the ex got pregnant and wants him to be involved. He doesn't want any part of it, including financial support. The user thinks the author is in the wrong but wants my opinion.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspects. In many places, fathers do have legal obligations to support their children, regardless of their willingness. So if he's the biological father, he might be legally required to pay child support. Even if he tries to renounce his rights, the court might not allow that if it's in the child's best interest. So legally, he might not be able to opt out entirely.\n\nMorally, it's a bit more complex. The guy was clear he didn't want kids, but the ex is determined to have the baby. He's worried about his new relationship and current life. But he's also being called selfish. On one hand, he didn't plan for this, but on the other, he is a co-parent. Withholding support could impact the child's well-being. However, if he wasn't involved in the pregnancy and the ex was the one who made the decision to keep the child, maybe he's not as morally responsible. But again, once a child is born, the parent does have responsibilities, regardless of the circumstances. \n\nAlso, the fact that they were using contraception \"fairly strictly\" doesn't absolve him if a pregnancy occurs. Contraceptives aren't 100% effective. The ex could have been keeping the pregnancy secret, but that's another angle. However, the law typically doesn't consider that. \n\nThe friends calling him selfish might be right, depending on societal expectations. But the legal and moral obligations are separate from personal feelings. So even if he's in a tough spot, he might still be expected to support the child. So the answer might be A, he's in the wrong, because he's avoiding legal and moral responsibilities. But I need to check if there's a middle ground. Maybe he's not the asshole but still in the wrong. The question is whether he's in the wrong, not if he's an asshole. The original AITA question is asking if he's the asshole. The user says they think he is. The answer options are A for yes (in the wrong) and B for no. \n\nIn legal terms, he can't just opt out. So if he refuses to pay, he could face legal consequences. That makes him in the wrong legally. Morally, it's debatable. But the question is likely looking for the legal and moral stance. So the answer is A.\n"
