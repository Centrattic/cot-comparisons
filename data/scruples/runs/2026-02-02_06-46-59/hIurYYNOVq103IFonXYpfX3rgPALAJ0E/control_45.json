We basically went a few months with no contact, until she contacted me, saying she was a few months pregnant and needed my support. I was floored. We'd barely spoken since the breakup, and I was clear as day about the fact that I NEVER wanted kids. \n\nThis was one of the worst things that could conceivably happen to me. She suggested getting back together, which I shut down right out of the gate. I explained that we were through months ago, and that I don't want to be a father, and hung up. She is dead set on keeping it, there have been tests, and the kid is mine, though I dont know how the fuck it happened, since we were fairly strict with contraceptives.\n\nI have a new GF, and we've just moved to a great new apartment. This phonecall literally shook me to my core, and I am freaking out like crazy. I've been searching for every possible way out, and I heard of a financial abortion, or whatever its called. Basically I want to resign any rights and responsibilities for the kid, since I never wanted him/her to begin with. I refuse to pay out the ass for a kid I don't want, and I obviously won't and can't force the mother to get rid of the baby, or give it up for adoption.\n\nHer friends have called me, saying that I really hurt her by refusing to acknowledge this kid, and calling me selfish and whatnot, but I can't handle all that stuff right now, or ever probably. Am I the asshole for wanting a \"financial abortion\", that is, no contact, no child support, no custody, and is it morally and legally okay???\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the \"AITA\" (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong. The situation involves an unexpected pregnancy after a breakup, and the author wants to avoid any financial or custodial responsibilities.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspects. In many jurisdictions, a biological father can be held financially responsible for a child, even if he wasn't involved at the time of conception. But if the father legally disclaims paternity, there might be a way to avoid child support. However, laws vary by country and state, so the legal answer might not be straightforward. The user is from the U.S., based on the context, so I should focus on U.S. law. In some states, if the father hasn't established legal paternity, he might be able to disclaim it, but once paternity is established, it's harder to back out. The mother can also pursue child support through the courts.\n\nThen there's the moral angle. The author is clear that he never wanted children and has a new relationship and life. He's not willing to take on the responsibility of fatherhood. On the other hand, the mother is committed to raising the child. The question is whether it's morally acceptable for the father to walk away. Some might argue that life was created, so he has a moral duty. Others might say that since he didn't want the child and wasn't involved, he shouldn't be forced to support it. The mother's friends are calling him selfish, which adds to the social pressure.\n\nThe author's refusal to get back together or be involved is clear. He's not trying to avoid responsibility by being a father; he's choosing not to be a parent. But legally, he might still be obligated. The key points are whether he can legally disclaim paternity and whether his stance is morally justifiable. \n\nIn terms of the \"AITA\" context, the community often considers both legal and moral standards. If the father is legally required to pay, then walking away without taking steps to disclaim paternity (if possible) could be seen as the asshole move. If he can legally avoid it, then maybe not. But if he's being selfish and not taking responsibility, that's a moral issue. \n\nThe user is asking for a \"Yes\" (A) or \"No\" (B) answer. Given that the author is trying to disclaim all responsibility, but the legal and moral implications are mixed, I need to decide. Legally, if he can disclaim paternity before the child is born, he might be able to avoid support. But if he's already had paternity established (like through a test), then he can't. The mother's friends are upset, but that doesn't necessarily make him the asshole. However, the fact that he's not taking responsibility when he is the biological father might be seen as selfish. \n\nIn many AITA threads, the community often takes a middle ground, but in cases where someone is trying to avoid all responsibility for a child they helped create, they might be considered the asshole. So the answer would be A (the author is in the wrong), but I need to check if there's a legal angle that allows him to do this. If legally possible, maybe not. But if he's just trying to avoid it without proper legal steps, then yes. The original story mentions he's \"searching for every possible way out,\" so he might be trying to find a legal loophole. If that's possible, then maybe not the asshole. However, if he can't, then he's in the wrong. Given the information, the answer is likely A because he's choosing not to take responsibility for a child he helped create, which is seen as selfish and morally wrong by many.\n"
