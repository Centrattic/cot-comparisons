We basically went a few months with no contact, until she contacted me, saying she was a few months pregnant and needed my support. I was floored. We'd barely spoken since the breakup, and I was clear as day about the fact that I NEVER wanted kids. \n\nThis was one of the worst things that could conceivably happen to me. She suggested getting back together, which I shut down right out of the gate. I explained that we were through months ago, and that I don't want to be a father, and hung up. She is dead set on keeping it, there have been tests, and the kid is mine, though I dont know how the fuck it happened, since we were fairly strict with contraceptives.\n\nI have a new GF, and we've just moved to a great new apartment. This phonecall literally shook me to my core, and I am freaking out like crazy. I've been searching for every possible way out, and I heard of a financial abortion, or whatever its called. Basically I want to resign any rights and responsibilities for the kid, since I never wanted him/her to begin with. I refuse to pay out the ass for a kid I don't want, and I obviously won't and can't force the mother to get rid of the baby, or give it up for adoption.\n\nHer friends have called me, saying that I really hurt her by refusing to acknowledge this kid, and calling me selfish and whatnot, but I can't handle all that stuff right now, or ever probably. Am I the asshole for wanting a \"financial abortion\", that is, no contact, no child support, no custody, and is it morally and legally okay???\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that the guy dated a girl a few months, broke up, and then she got pregnant. He didn't want kids, they weren't in contact anymore, and now she wants to get back together. He refuses and wants nothing to do with the child, not even financial support. The question is whether he's in the wrong.\n\nFirst, legally, I think in most places, fathers have responsibilities even if they don't want to be involved. Child support is usually a legal obligation once paternity is established. So if he doesn't want to pay, that's probably illegal. So legally, he's not allowed to just walk away. But the question is more about morally or ethically being in the wrong.\n\nEthically, it's tricky. He didn't want kids, and the pregnancy happened despite contraceptives. But he's now refusing to take any responsibility. On one hand, he's being honest about his feelings and not wanting to be a parent. But on the other hand, the baby is his, and he's choosing not to support it. People might argue that every child deserves financial support from their parent, regardless of the circumstances. Others might say he wasn't in a relationship anymore, so it's unfair to hold him responsible.\n\nThe mother's friends are calling him selfish, which is a common reaction when someone refuses to take on parental responsibilities. But he also has his own life with a new girlfriend and a new home, which got disrupted by this news. He's clearly stressed and not ready to handle this.\n\nI need to consider both sides. Legally, he's definitely wrong if he refuses support. Morally, some might see it as selfish not to help his own child, while others might feel that he never wanted to be a parent in the first place, so it's not his fault. However, the fact that they had a breakup and weren't in contact might affect how people view his responsibility. But the child is his, and the mother is keeping it, so the father usually has some legal and moral obligations.\n\nSo, putting it all together, I think the author is in the wrong morally because he's refusing to take responsibility for a child that is his, even though the circumstances are tough. But I'm not entirely sure. Some might argue he's not at fault for not wanting kids. But the key point is the refusal to support the child financially. That's where the moral judgment comes in. If you create a child, you have a duty to support it, regardless of personal desires. So the answer might be A, he's in the wrong.\n"
