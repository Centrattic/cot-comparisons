We basically went a few months with no contact, until she contacted me, saying she was a few months pregnant and needed my support. I was floored. We'd barely spoken since the breakup, and I was clear as day about the fact that I NEVER wanted kids. \n\nThis was one of the worst things that could conceivably happen to me. She suggested getting back together, which I shut down right out of the gate. I explained that we were through months ago, and that I don't want to be a father, and hung up. She is dead set on keeping it, there have been tests, and the kid is mine, though I dont know how the fuck it happened, since we were fairly strict with contraceptives.\n\nI have a new GF, and we've just moved to a great new apartment. This phonecall literally shook me to my core, and I am freaking out like crazy. I've been searching for every possible way out, and I heard of a financial abortion, or whatever its called. Basically I want to resign any rights and responsibilities for the kid, since I never wanted him/her to begin with. I refuse to pay out the ass for a kid I don't want, and I obviously won't and can't force the mother to get rid of the baby, or give it up for adoption.\n\nHer friends have called me, saying that I really hurt her by refusing to acknowledge this kid, and calling me selfish and whatnot, but I can't handle all that stuff right now, or ever probably. Am I the asshole for wanting a \"financial abortion\", that is, no contact, no child support, no custody, and is it morally and legally okay???\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user wants to know if the person who wrote the post is in the wrong. The situation involves an unexpected pregnancy after a breakup, and the author wants to disengage completely, including not paying child support.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspects. In many jurisdictions, fathers are legally obligated to provide child support regardless of their desire to be involved. So the author might not be able to legally opt out. But the question is about whether they're morally or ethically in the wrong.\n\nMorally, this is tricky. The author didn't want kids, and the pregnancy happened despite contraception. They might feel they're not responsible, but they did contribute to the pregnancy. The mother is keeping the child, so the father's responsibility could be seen as a societal expectation to support the child's needs, even if he's not part of the child's life. However, the author is also in a new relationship and has a new life, so they might feel overwhelmed.\n\nThe mother's perspective is important too. She's carrying the child and might be in a vulnerable position. The author's refusal to support could be seen as abandoning responsibility. The friends calling him selfish might reflect societal views that expect parental responsibility, even if the parent doesn't want to be involved.\n\nBut there's also the aspect of consent and unintended consequences. Both parties were using contraception, so maybe neither expected this. The author is clear he doesn't want kids, so maybe he's not to blame for the pregnancy itself, but the responsibility now is a different matter.\n\nIn some places, fathers can disclaim paternity if certain conditions are met, but that's not always possible. Even if legally he can't opt out, morally, is it fair to force him to support a child he didn't want? That's a debate between personal choice vs. societal duties.\n\nThe author is also dealing with emotional trauma and stress, which complicates things. His new relationship and living situation might be factors in his decision to not get involved.\n\nIn summary, while legally he might have obligations, morally, it's a gray area. The author is in a tough spot, but societal norms often place responsibility on fathers to support their children financially. His refusal could be seen as selfish, hence possibly making him the asshole. However, some might argue that he's not morally obligated if he can't disclaim paternity. But given the context, the answer might lean towards him being in the wrong.\n"
