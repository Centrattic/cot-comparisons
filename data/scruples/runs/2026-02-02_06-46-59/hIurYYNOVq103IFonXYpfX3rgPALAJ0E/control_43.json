We basically went a few months with no contact, until she contacted me, saying she was a few months pregnant and needed my support. I was floored. We'd barely spoken since the breakup, and I was clear as day about the fact that I NEVER wanted kids. \n\nThis was one of the worst things that could conceivably happen to me. She suggested getting back together, which I shut down right out of the gate. I explained that we were through months ago, and that I don't want to be a father, and hung up. She is dead set on keeping it, there have been tests, and the kid is mine, though I dont know how the fuck it happened, since we were fairly strict with contraceptives.\n\nI have a new GF, and we've just moved to a great new apartment. This phonecall literally shook me to my core, and I am freaking out like crazy. I've been searching for every possible way out, and I heard of a financial abortion, or whatever its called. Basically I want to resign any rights and responsibilities for the kid, since I never wanted him/her to begin with. I refuse to pay out the ass for a kid I don't want, and I obviously won't and can't force the mother to get rid of the baby, or give it up for adoption.\n\nHer friends have called me, saying that I really hurt her by refusing to acknowledge this kid, and calling me selfish and whatnot, but I can't handle all that stuff right now, or ever probably. Am I the asshole for wanting a \"financial abortion\", that is, no contact, no child support, no custody, and is it morally and legally okay???\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong in this situation. The scenario involves a man who had a past relationship, they broke up, and then the ex got pregnant. He's clear he doesn't want kids, so when she contacts him, he refuses to get back together and wants nothing to do with the child. The question is whether he's in the wrong.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspects. In most places, fathers have legal responsibilities once paternity is established. Even if he doesn't want to be involved, he might still be required to pay child support. So if he wants to \"opt out\" completely, legally that's probably not possible. He can't just resign his rights without the court's approval, which usually requires showing neglect or harm to the child, which he hasn't done here.\n\nMorally, this is trickier. People have different views. Some might say that once a child is born, the father has a responsibility regardless of the circumstances. Others might argue that if the pregnancy was unintended and the father wasn't involved, he shouldn't be forced to support a child he never wanted. However, most societies value children's rights to have both parents, if possible, and the father's responsibility. But the father's autonomy is also a consideration.\n\nThe author's new relationship and new life might make him feel overwhelmed, but that's his personal situation. The mother's friends calling him selfish could be a point\u2014maybe he's being selfish by not taking responsibility. But he's also not the one who chose to carry the pregnancy, so it's a complex balance.\n\nLegally, he can't just walk away. Morally, some might see him as avoiding responsibility, which could make him the asshole. But others might sympathize with his stance, especially if the pregnancy was a surprise and he's clear about not wanting children. However, the mother's decision to keep the child and the child's rights are important factors here.\n\nSo, considering both legal and moral angles, the answer is likely A (the author is in the wrong) because legally he can't disown the child, and morally, many would argue he has a responsibility. The \"financial abortion\" he's seeking isn't a legal option, so he's in the wrong for thinking he can avoid it. Also, the mother's friends calling him selfish might indicate societal judgment against his stance. Therefore, the answer is A.\n"
