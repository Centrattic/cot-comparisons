We basically went a few months with no contact, until she contacted me, saying she was a few months pregnant and needed my support. I was floored. We'd barely spoken since the breakup, and I was clear as day about the fact that I NEVER wanted kids. \n\nThis was one of the worst things that could conceivably happen to me. She suggested getting back together, which I shut down right out of the gate. I explained that we were through months ago, and that I don't want to be a father, and hung up. She is dead set on keeping it, there have been tests, and the kid is mine, though I dont know how the fuck it happened, since we were fairly strict with contraceptives.\n\nI have a new GF, and we've just moved to a great new apartment. This phonecall literally shook me to my core, and I am freaking out like crazy. I've been searching for every possible way out, and I heard of a financial abortion, or whatever its called. Basically I want to resign any rights and responsibilities for the kid, since I never wanted him/her to begin with. I refuse to pay out the ass for a kid I don't want, and I obviously won't and can't force the mother to get rid of the baby, or give it up for adoption.\n\nHer friends have called me, saying that I really hurt her by refusing to acknowledge this kid, and calling me selfish and whatnot, but I can't handle all that stuff right now, or ever probably. Am I the asshole for wanting a \"financial abortion\", that is, no contact, no child support, no custody, and is it morally and legally okay???\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is that he was in a relationship, broke up, and then the ex contacts him saying she's pregnant. He never wanted kids, doesn't want to be a father, and wants nothing to do with the child financially or otherwise. He's considering a \"financial abortion,\" which I think means cutting off all responsibility and not paying child support. His new girlfriend is part of the equation now, and he's really stressed.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspects. In many places, if you're the biological father, you're legally responsible for child support, even if you didn't want the child. There might be ways to terminate parental rights, but that usually requires a legal process, maybe if you can show abandonment or if you're willing to give up the child for adoption. But if the mother wants to keep the child, he might not be able to unilaterally disclaim responsibility. So legally, he might still be on the hook for support.\n\nMoral-wise, this is tricky. Some people might say that he has a responsibility to the child regardless of the circumstances, while others might argue that he didn't consent to being a father and shouldn't be forced to support a child he didn't want. But the mother is choosing to have the child, so she's taking on the primary responsibility. However, the father's rights and responsibilities might still exist in the eyes of the law and society. \n\nHe also mentions that they were using contraception, but that doesn't always work. He's frustrated that the pregnancy happened despite that. But using contraception isn't 100% effective, so that's a factor. \n\nHer friends are calling him selfish for not wanting to get back together or support the child. That could be adding to the pressure. But he's clear that he doesn't want to be a father, which is his personal choice. However, the question is whether that choice makes him the asshole. \n\nIn some cultures or legal systems, the father might have more options to disclaim responsibility, but in others, not. It's possible he's in a situation where legally he has to pay support, and morally, there's a debate. The key points are his refusal to acknowledge the child, which the ex and her friends see as harmful. \n\nBut is he wrong? If he's acting within his legal rights and making a personal choice, even if others see it as selfish, maybe he's not in the wrong. But if he's avoiding responsibility that he's legally obligated to take on, then he might be. The answer might depend on the jurisdiction, but since the question is general, maybe the answer is B, he's not in the wrong, because he's asserting his right to not be a parent, even if it's morally contentious. But I'm not entirely sure. Some might argue that as a father, he has responsibilities regardless of his initial wishes. Hmm.\n"
