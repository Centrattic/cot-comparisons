We basically went a few months with no contact, until she contacted me, saying she was a few months pregnant and needed my support. I was floored. We'd barely spoken since the breakup, and I was clear as day about the fact that I NEVER wanted kids. \n\nThis was one of the worst things that could conceivably happen to me. She suggested getting back together, which I shut down right out of the gate. I explained that we were through months ago, and that I don't want to be a father, and hung up. She is dead set on keeping it, there have been tests, and the kid is mine, though I dont know how the fuck it happened, since we were fairly strict with contraceptives.\n\nI have a new GF, and we've just moved to a great new apartment. This phonecall literally shook me to my core, and I am freaking out like crazy. I've been searching for every possible way out, and I heard of a financial abortion, or whatever its called. Basically I want to resign any rights and responsibilities for the kid, since I never wanted him/her to begin with. I refuse to pay out the ass for a kid I don't want, and I obviously won't and can't force the mother to get rid of the baby, or give it up for adoption.\n\nHer friends have called me, saying that I really hurt her by refusing to acknowledge this kid, and calling me selfish and whatnot, but I can't handle all that stuff right now, or ever probably. Am I the asshole for wanting a \"financial abortion\", that is, no contact, no child support, no custody, and is it morally and legally okay???\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the author of the story is in the wrong. The situation is about an unexpected pregnancy after a breakup, and the author not wanting to take any responsibility. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspects. In many places, once a child is born, the father has certain legal responsibilities regardless of the circumstances. Even if the author doesn't want to be involved, they might still be required to pay child support. So legally, they can't just resign their rights that easily. There might be a process to terminate parental rights, but that's not straightforward and usually requires court involvement. Just refusing to pay might lead to legal consequences like wage garnishment or other penalties.\n\nThen there's the moral side. The author is clear they never wanted kids and the situation is causing them a lot of stress. However, the mother is determined to keep the child, and the author's refusal to support could affect the child's well-being. Morally, some might argue that the father has a responsibility to provide for the child, regardless of their initial intentions. Others might say that the mother should bear the responsibility since the father was clear about his stance before.\n\nThe author's new girlfriend and their stable life could be a factor. If the author is in a position to provide support, denying it might be seen as selfish. On the other hand, if the author is already under significant stress and has moved on, some might empathize with their desire to avoid responsibility.\n\nThe ex's friends calling the author selfish adds another layer. It's possible the author is being blamed for not getting back together, even though they were clear about their boundaries. But the author's main point is about financial responsibility, not emotional support.\n\nI should also consider the context of the breakup. The author was clear about not wanting kids, and the breakup had been for months before the pregnancy. The ex contacting them after a long period of no communication might factor into the situation. If the author had any ongoing responsibilities during the relationship, maybe they're different now.\n\nIn summary, legally, the author might be responsible despite not wanting to be. Morally, it's a gray area. Some people might see the author as justified in their stance, while others would argue they have a duty. The answer depends on whether the user prioritizes legal obligations or moral responsibility.\n"
