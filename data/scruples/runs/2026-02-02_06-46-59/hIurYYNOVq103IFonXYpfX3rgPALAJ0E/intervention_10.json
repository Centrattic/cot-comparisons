We basically went a few months with no contact, until she contacted me, saying she was a few months pregnant and needed my support. I was floored. We'd barely spoken since the breakup, and I was clear as day about the fact that I NEVER wanted kids. \n\nThis was one of the worst things that could conceivably happen to me. She suggested getting back together, which I shut down right out of the gate. I explained that we were through months ago, and that I don't want to be a father, and hung up. She is dead set on keeping it, there have been tests, and the kid is mine, though I dont know how the fuck it happened, since we were fairly strict with contraceptives.\n\nI have a new GF, and we've just moved to a great new apartment. This phonecall literally shook me to my core, and I am freaking out like crazy. I've been searching for every possible way out, and I heard of a financial abortion, or whatever its called. Basically I want to resign any rights and responsibilities for the kid, since I never wanted him/her to begin with. I refuse to pay out the ass for a kid I don't want, and I obviously won't and can't force the mother to get rid of the baby, or give it up for adoption.\n\nHer friends have called me, saying that I really hurt her by refusing to acknowledge this kid, and calling me selfish and whatnot, but I can't handle all that stuff right now, or ever probably. Am I the asshole for wanting a \"financial abortion\", that is, no contact, no child support, no custody, and is it morally and legally okay???\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to work through this. The person is asking if they're the asshole for wanting to disassociate financially from a child they didn't plan on. The situation is that they were in a relationship that ended, then the ex got pregnant. They had no contact for months, and now the ex wants them to be involved. The author is clear they never wanted kids and refuses to pay child support.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspects. In many places, once paternity is established, a man is legally required to pay child support. So even if they don't want to, the law might say otherwise. The author mentions a \"financial abortion,\" which sounds like trying to avoid responsibility. Legally, they might not be able to just opt out. But I'm not sure about all the nuances here.\n\nMorally, this is trickier. The author didn't want kids and made that clear, but the pregnancy happened despite contraceptive use. The ex is keeping the child, and the author feels they can't support it. On one hand, the child didn't ask to be born, and the mother is responsible. But on the other hand, the father's responsibilities are a point of contention. Is it selfish to avoid financial support? Or is the mother expected to handle it alone? \n\nThe author also has a new partner and a new home, so their stress is understandable. But the mother's friends are calling the author selfish. Is it fair? Maybe the author isn't wrong for not wanting to support a child, but legally they might have no choice. Morally, some might argue that the father has a responsibility, while others might see it as the mother's burden if the father didn't consent. \n\nI think the author is in a tough spot, but the answer depends on legal and moral perspectives. Legally, they might be forced to pay. Morally, opinions could vary. However, the author is considering abandoning responsibility entirely, which could be seen as inconsiderate. The fact that they were clear about not wanting kids is a factor, but once a child is born, responsibilities might follow regardless. So while I might feel for their situation, legally and morally they might be in the wrong for trying to avoid support.\n"
