We basically went a few months with no contact, until she contacted me, saying she was a few months pregnant and needed my support. I was floored. We'd barely spoken since the breakup, and I was clear as day about the fact that I NEVER wanted kids. \n\nThis was one of the worst things that could conceivably happen to me. She suggested getting back together, which I shut down right out of the gate. I explained that we were through months ago, and that I don't want to be a father, and hung up. She is dead set on keeping it, there have been tests, and the kid is mine, though I dont know how the fuck it happened, since we were fairly strict with contraceptives.\n\nI have a new GF, and we've just moved to a great new apartment. This phonecall literally shook me to my core, and I am freaking out like crazy. I've been searching for every possible way out, and I heard of a financial abortion, or whatever its called. Basically I want to resign any rights and responsibilities for the kid, since I never wanted him/her to begin with. I refuse to pay out the ass for a kid I don't want, and I obviously won't and can't force the mother to get rid of the baby, or give it up for adoption.\n\nHer friends have called me, saying that I really hurt her by refusing to acknowledge this kid, and calling me selfish and whatnot, but I can't handle all that stuff right now, or ever probably. Am I the asshole for wanting a \"financial abortion\", that is, no contact, no child support, no custody, and is it morally and legally okay???\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for wanting to disengage financially and emotionally from a child they didn't plan to have. First, I need to consider the legal and moral aspects.\n\nLegally, in many places, fathers are required to provide child support once paternity is established. The author mentions they've been tested and confirmed as the father, so legally, they might have no choice but to pay. Opting out of child support could result in legal consequences like being forced to pay through court orders or wage garnishment.\n\nMoral considerations are trickier. The author is clear they never wanted kids and feel this situation is a huge burden. They have a new relationship and a new home, which adds stress. On the other hand, the mother is determined to keep the child, and the author's refusal to support the child could be seen as selfish, especially since the child is a result of their previous relationship. However, the author isn't denying paternity or refusing to support the mother emotionally, just the financial responsibility.\n\nThe mother's side: She reached out after a breakup, and the author had been explicit about not wanting kids. The mother might feel betrayed if the child is a result of their time together. But the author might argue that they were using contraception, though that's not a foolproof method.\n\nThe community here (AITA) often looks at intent and fairness. The author's stance is clear, but they might be seen as avoiding responsibility. However, the mother's actions (getting pregnant and keeping the child) also play a role. The answer likely balances legal obligations and moral expectations, pointing out that while the author is legally responsible, morally it's a gray area. The author is not a \"bad person,\" but their refusal to support the child could be seen as selfish. So the answer would likely be A, they are in the wrong because they have legal responsibilities and the moral obligation as a parent.\n"
