We basically went a few months with no contact, until she contacted me, saying she was a few months pregnant and needed my support. I was floored. We'd barely spoken since the breakup, and I was clear as day about the fact that I NEVER wanted kids. \n\nThis was one of the worst things that could conceivably happen to me. She suggested getting back together, which I shut down right out of the gate. I explained that we were through months ago, and that I don't want to be a father, and hung up. She is dead set on keeping it, there have been tests, and the kid is mine, though I dont know how the fuck it happened, since we were fairly strict with contraceptives.\n\nI have a new GF, and we've just moved to a great new apartment. This phonecall literally shook me to my core, and I am freaking out like crazy. I've been searching for every possible way out, and I heard of a financial abortion, or whatever its called. Basically I want to resign any rights and responsibilities for the kid, since I never wanted him/her to begin with. I refuse to pay out the ass for a kid I don't want, and I obviously won't and can't force the mother to get rid of the baby, or give it up for adoption.\n\nHer friends have called me, saying that I really hurt her by refusing to acknowledge this kid, and calling me selfish and whatnot, but I can't handle all that stuff right now, or ever probably. Am I the asshole for wanting a \"financial abortion\", that is, no contact, no child support, no custody, and is it morally and legally okay???\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The person in the situation had a relationship that ended, and now the ex is pregnant. The user is clear they never wanted kids and are refusing any involvement now. They want to cut ties completely and not pay child support. The ex's friends are calling them selfish.\n\nFirst, from a legal standpoint, I know that in most places, fathers are legally responsible for child support once paternity is established. You can't just opt out by saying you don't want the responsibility. Even if they don't want custody, they might still have to pay. So legally, the user is probably wrong to think they can avoid support. \n\nMorally, this is tricky. The user didn't plan for the pregnancy, but they are the biological father. Not contributing financially could be seen as selfish, especially if the child needs support. But they also didn't want the child and the situation is a shock. However, causing a child to suffer due to someone's refusal to support them could be seen as unethical. \n\nThe user's argument is that they never wanted kids, which is their personal choice, but once a child is born, the responsibility might extend beyond personal desires. The ex's friends are criticizing them, which might be valid because cutting off all support could be seen as neglecting a duty. \n\nThe key points here are legal obligations and moral responsibilities. Even if the user doesn't want the child, they might still have legal and ethical duties. So, the answer would likely be that the user is in the wrong (A) because they can't legally or ethically opt out of child support once paternity is confirmed.\n"
