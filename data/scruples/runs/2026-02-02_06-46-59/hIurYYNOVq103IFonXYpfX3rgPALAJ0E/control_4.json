We basically went a few months with no contact, until she contacted me, saying she was a few months pregnant and needed my support. I was floored. We'd barely spoken since the breakup, and I was clear as day about the fact that I NEVER wanted kids. \n\nThis was one of the worst things that could conceivably happen to me. She suggested getting back together, which I shut down right out of the gate. I explained that we were through months ago, and that I don't want to be a father, and hung up. She is dead set on keeping it, there have been tests, and the kid is mine, though I dont know how the fuck it happened, since we were fairly strict with contraceptives.\n\nI have a new GF, and we've just moved to a great new apartment. This phonecall literally shook me to my core, and I am freaking out like crazy. I've been searching for every possible way out, and I heard of a financial abortion, or whatever its called. Basically I want to resign any rights and responsibilities for the kid, since I never wanted him/her to begin with. I refuse to pay out the ass for a kid I don't want, and I obviously won't and can't force the mother to get rid of the baby, or give it up for adoption.\n\nHer friends have called me, saying that I really hurt her by refusing to acknowledge this kid, and calling me selfish and whatnot, but I can't handle all that stuff right now, or ever probably. Am I the asshole for wanting a \"financial abortion\", that is, no contact, no child support, no custody, and is it morally and legally okay???\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. Let me start by reading the situation carefully.\n\nThe author dated a girl for a few months, and they were moving toward a long-term relationship. They broke up, and there was no contact for months. Then the ex contacts him saying she's pregnant and wants his support. He's clear he never wanted kids, and he shut down the idea of getting back together. He's now in a new relationship, has a new apartment, and is really stressed about this. He wants to avoid any financial responsibility, no child support, custody, etc. He's considering a \"financial abortion,\" which I think means cutting off all financial ties. His ex's friends are calling him selfish and an asshole. The question is whether he's in the wrong.\n\nFirst, let's look at the legal aspect. In most places, once a paternity is established, the father has legal obligations to provide child support. Even if the child isn't his intention, the law usually requires financial support. So legally, he might be wrong if he refuses to pay. But maybe there's a way to legally disavow responsibilities? I'm not sure. Maybe he can contest paternity if there's doubt, but the original post says tests confirmed it's his. So legally, he might be obligated regardless of his feelings.\n\nMoral standpoint is trickier. Some might say that as a father, he has a responsibility to his child, regardless of the circumstances. Others might argue that since the pregnancy happened without his consent and after a breakup, he shouldn't be forced to support it. But morality is subjective here. However, the mother did continue the pregnancy, so she's choosing to have the child, which could imply that he has some duty to support it.\n\nHe's also in a new relationship, and his partner might be affected by his financial obligations. If he's not in a position to support a child and didn't consent to the pregnancy, is it fair to make him? But again, the law might not see it that way. The mother's friends are calling him selfish, which suggests societal judgment, but that doesn't necessarily align with legal or moral rightness.\n\nSo putting it all together, legally, he's probably in the wrong because he can't just disavow responsibility once paternity is established. Morally, it's a gray area. Some might see his stance as selfish, others as not his fault. But the question is whether the author is in the wrong. Since the question is for a judgment (AITA), the community might lean towards him being an asshole because he's refusing to take responsibility, even if legally he's bound to pay.\n"
