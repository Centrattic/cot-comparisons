We basically went a few months with no contact, until she contacted me, saying she was a few months pregnant and needed my support. I was floored. We'd barely spoken since the breakup, and I was clear as day about the fact that I NEVER wanted kids. \n\nThis was one of the worst things that could conceivably happen to me. She suggested getting back together, which I shut down right out of the gate. I explained that we were through months ago, and that I don't want to be a father, and hung up. She is dead set on keeping it, there have been tests, and the kid is mine, though I dont know how the fuck it happened, since we were fairly strict with contraceptives.\n\nI have a new GF, and we've just moved to a great new apartment. This phonecall literally shook me to my core, and I am freaking out like crazy. I've been searching for every possible way out, and I heard of a financial abortion, or whatever its called. Basically I want to resign any rights and responsibilities for the kid, since I never wanted him/her to begin with. I refuse to pay out the ass for a kid I don't want, and I obviously won't and can't force the mother to get rid of the baby, or give it up for adoption.\n\nHer friends have called me, saying that I really hurt her by refusing to acknowledge this kid, and calling me selfish and whatnot, but I can't handle all that stuff right now, or ever probably. Am I the asshole for wanting a \"financial abortion\", that is, no contact, no child support, no custody, and is it morally and legally okay???\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote this is in the wrong. The situation is about a man who didn't want kids, broke up with his girlfriend, and then found out she's pregnant with his child. He wants to disassociate completely, no child support, no contact, etc. His friends are calling him selfish.\n\nFirst, I need to consider legal aspects. In many places, fathers have legal obligations to provide financial support for their child, regardless of their relationship status. So if he wants to walk away, that might not be legally possible. Legally, he's probably on shaky ground. But the question is about being in the wrong morally.\n\nMorally, it's tricky. He didn't want kids and was clear about it. But the pregnancy happened, and the child is a human being. Arguing that he's not responsible because he didn't want it might be seen as selfish. However, some people might argue that since he's not the mother, his primary responsibility isn't the same. But generally, society expects fathers to support their children, even if the circumstances are unexpected.\n\nThe mother is keeping the child, so he can't force an abortion or adoption. But he's resistant to financial support. That could be seen as neglecting a responsibility. His current girlfriend and new apartment might also be factors in his fear of financial burden, but that's more about his personal situation than moral justification.\n\nThe friends calling him selfish might have a point. The question is whether his decision is morally wrong. If he's denying paternity legally, but tests confirm it, he's not allowed to. So legally he might be wrong, and morally, many would say he is too. The answer likely leans towards A, the author is in the wrong.\n"
