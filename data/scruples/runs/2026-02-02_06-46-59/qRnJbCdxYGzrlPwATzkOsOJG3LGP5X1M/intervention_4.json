C had a rather rough upbringing. Her father abandoned her as a child and her mother committed suicide by jumping in front of a train (only a few years before our relationship began). C was left to be cared by her grandparents who were devout Catholics. As a result C became highly religious herself. However, C has bipolar disorder. This wasn't obvious and manifested as erratic moods. \n\nAnyway, C had it in her head that she wanted to get married and have a family. At first she was patient because she thought I'd propose. When it became clear that I wasn't interested in doing so, C started to panic. C became more aggressive about it and we started to argue. Eventually C seemed to give up. But we were still sexually active. C had been taking oral contraceptives and we never used condoms (my bad) and I never thought anything of it. Then one day C was diagnosed with Polycystic Ovary Syndrome. She was told by a doctor that she'd be much less likely to conceive. This affected C deeply as she was more or less obsessed with the idea of starting a family. \n\nFast forward about 5 months (I don't remember exactly how long but it was a significant amount of time). It became clear that C was pregnant (with my child!). She succeeded in hiding it up until this point. When confronted she vehemently denied knowing she was pregnant and acted as surprised as anyone. Shocked and at a loss, I pleaded with her to get an abortion and pretty much gave her an ultimatum-me or the baby! It was all very emotional but finally I convinced C to get an abortion. Most doctors refused to perform the abortion this late into the pregnancy but were doctors in Melbourne who would do it. \n\nSo I booked plane tickets. It was all good to go. The morning of the flight, C was packed and literally getting into the car with her grandparents to be taken to the airport. Now get this, as they rolled out of the driveway, C's cat happened to be sitting behind the car. The cat was run over and died. C and her grandparents were shocked and saw no other option than to take this event as the occurrence a miracle (imagine that!) In their eyes it was confirmed-God wanted C to keep her child.\n\nSo she did. And I broke up with her shortly after. A few months later C gave birth to our son named N but I refused to take part. I haven't really talked to C since. I have been paying child support. To this day I have not so much as talked to N, although I have seen him a couple of times, despite that my parents see him and take care of him often. \n\nBasically everyone I know has judged me for abandoning my child and nobody hesitates to tell me I'm in the wrong. A lot of people have lost respect for me and see my continued lack of contact with my child as immoral. I've got into many fights with my parents over this and no longer live with them due to the discord. \n\nN is 5 years old now and stating to talk and go to school. Recently I was told by my mother that when N was playing with other children he was asked about his 'daddy' to which he replied: 'my daddy doesn't play with me'. This is concerning for me to hear and I can't help but feel guilty to some degree. However, I still feel that I've been wronged and at this stage it would be very difficult for me to reverse my decision. I have been firm about my decision all along and have no intention of validating C's disrespect for me by changing my mind now. I never wanted to have a child and she knew all along. She was being incredibly selfish, no matter how selfish I'm being now. \n\nBefore judging me I implore you to consider my perspective. I had no say in the matter and C deceived me (and everyone else) in order to fulfil her fantasy. This was extremely disrespectful and hurtful to me, I wasn't ready to have a child and I'm still not. AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. The situation is pretty complicated. So, he broke up with his pregnant girlfriend after she had an abortion. The key points are: the girlfriend had a history of mental health issues, they were using birth control but not condoms, she got pregnant, he wanted an abortion but she changed her mind after a \"miracle\" with her cat, he broke up with her, and now he's not involved with the child. People are saying he's wrong for abandoning his child.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal and ethical aspects. Legally, he's paying child support, which is a responsibility. Not having contact might be a personal choice, but legally he's meeting his obligations. Ethically, it's trickier. The father has a right to make decisions about the pregnancy, but he did try to convince her to have an abortion. However, once the child is born, he's the legal father, and not being involved could be seen as neglectful.\n\nThe girlfriend's actions: she lied about knowing she was pregnant and waited until the last minute for an abortion. She might have manipulated the situation, which is a red flag. But he was also sexually active without using protection, contributing to the pregnancy. His anger at her for forcing him into parenthood is understandable, but cutting off the child entirely seems extreme. The child is innocent here. The fact that the child is now being affected by his absence is a point against the author. Even if he feels wronged, the child shouldn't suffer for their parents' conflict.\n\nHe mentions she was being selfish, but he's also being selfish by not engaging with his child. There's guilt on both sides. The author hasn't changed his stance despite the child's feelings. His parents are involved, but it's not the same as the father's role. The author's reasoning is that he wasn't ready for a child, but once the child exists, he has responsibilities beyond his initial wishes. So, while the girlfriend's actions were inconsiderate, the author's refusal to be part of the child's life seems to harm the child unnecessarily. Therefore, I think the author is in the wrong because he's avoiding his parental responsibilities, even if he feels justified.\n"
