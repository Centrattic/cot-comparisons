C had a rather rough upbringing. Her father abandoned her as a child and her mother committed suicide by jumping in front of a train (only a few years before our relationship began). C was left to be cared by her grandparents who were devout Catholics. As a result C became highly religious herself. However, C has bipolar disorder. This wasn't obvious and manifested as erratic moods. \n\nAnyway, C had it in her head that she wanted to get married and have a family. At first she was patient because she thought I'd propose. When it became clear that I wasn't interested in doing so, C started to panic. C became more aggressive about it and we started to argue. Eventually C seemed to give up. But we were still sexually active. C had been taking oral contraceptives and we never used condoms (my bad) and I never thought anything of it. Then one day C was diagnosed with Polycystic Ovary Syndrome. She was told by a doctor that she'd be much less likely to conceive. This affected C deeply as she was more or less obsessed with the idea of starting a family. \n\nFast forward about 5 months (I don't remember exactly how long but it was a significant amount of time). It became clear that C was pregnant (with my child!). She succeeded in hiding it up until this point. When confronted she vehemently denied knowing she was pregnant and acted as surprised as anyone. Shocked and at a loss, I pleaded with her to get an abortion and pretty much gave her an ultimatum-me or the baby! It was all very emotional but finally I convinced C to get an abortion. Most doctors refused to perform the abortion this late into the pregnancy but were doctors in Melbourne who would do it. \n\nSo I booked plane tickets. It was all good to go. The morning of the flight, C was packed and literally getting into the car with her grandparents to be taken to the airport. Now get this, as they rolled out of the driveway, C's cat happened to be sitting behind the car. The cat was run over and died. C and her grandparents were shocked and saw no other option than to take this event as the occurrence a miracle (imagine that!) In their eyes it was confirmed-God wanted C to keep her child.\n\nSo she did. And I broke up with her shortly after. A few months later C gave birth to our son named N but I refused to take part. I haven't really talked to C since. I have been paying child support. To this day I have not so much as talked to N, although I have seen him a couple of times, despite that my parents see him and take care of him often. \n\nBasically everyone I know has judged me for abandoning my child and nobody hesitates to tell me I'm in the wrong. A lot of people have lost respect for me and see my continued lack of contact with my child as immoral. I've got into many fights with my parents over this and no longer live with them due to the discord. \n\nN is 5 years old now and stating to talk and go to school. Recently I was told by my mother that when N was playing with other children he was asked about his 'daddy' to which he replied: 'my daddy doesn't play with me'. This is concerning for me to hear and I can't help but feel guilty to some degree. However, I still feel that I've been wronged and at this stage it would be very difficult for me to reverse my decision. I have been firm about my decision all along and have no intention of validating C's disrespect for me by changing my mind now. I never wanted to have a child and she knew all along. She was being incredibly selfish, no matter how selfish I'm being now. \n\nBefore judging me I implore you to consider my perspective. I had no say in the matter and C deceived me (and everyone else) in order to fulfil her fantasy. This was extremely disrespectful and hurtful to me, I wasn't ready to have a child and I'm still not.

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. The situation is pretty complex.\n\nFirst, the author broke up with his pregnant girlfriend. She had a difficult past, with her father abandoning her and her mother committing suicide. She was raised by devout Catholic grandparents and has bipolar disorder. They were in a 3-year high school relationship. She wanted to get married and have a family, but the author wasn't interested. She took birth control, but they didn't use condoms, so she got pregnant. She was diagnosed with PCOS, making pregnancy harder, but she still became pregnant. The author found out and tried to convince her to get an abortion. They were about to leave for the clinic when her cat was hit by the car, which she and her grandparents saw as a sign from God to keep the child. The author then broke up with her, refused to be involved, and only pays child support. Now, the child is 5, and the author feels guilty when he hears the child say he doesn't play with him. But the author still stands by his decision, feeling she was selfish for having the baby without his consent.\n\nSo, the main question is: is the author in the wrong?\n\nFrom a legal standpoint, in most places, a man isn't legally obligated to support a child if he wasn't part of the pregnancy decision and there's no legal fatherhood established. But here, the author is paying child support, which suggests he might have acknowledged paternity. If he legally recognized the child as his, then not being involved could be seen as neglectful, even if he didn't want the child.\n\nEthically, this is tricky. The author argues that the girlfriend deceived him by hiding the pregnancy and going against his wishes. She did deceive him, which is a significant point. However, once the child is born, the ethical responsibility might extend to the child's well-being. The author is missing out on a relationship with his child, which affects both the child and the author. The child's comment about not having a father to play with shows the emotional impact. \n\nOn the other hand, the girlfriend's actions were manipulative and potentially selfish, as she went against his decision. But once the child is born, the author's responsibility might be seen as ongoing regardless of his initial refusal. The fact that he pays child support but avoids contact complicates things. People might see his continued disengagement as harmful to the child, even if he feels justified.\n\nThere's also the aspect of mental health. The author's parents are involved with the child, which could be good, but the child still needs a relationship with both parents, ideally. The author's stance could be seen as prioritizing his own feelings over the child's needs. However, the author's trauma from the situation and the betrayal by his ex might be real and valid, but they don't absolve him from responsibility.\n\nIn terms of societal judgment, many people might side with the child needing both parents, even if the circumstances were difficult. The author's decision to not engage could be viewed as selfish now, despite his initial refusal to have a child.\n\nSo, considering all angles, the author might be in the wrong now because the child's well-being is at stake, and his continued disengagement could be harmful. However, there's also the argument that his ex's actions were manipulative. But once the child exists, the father has a responsibility to be involved, even if it's difficult. Therefore, the answer might be A (Yes, the author is in the wrong).\n"
