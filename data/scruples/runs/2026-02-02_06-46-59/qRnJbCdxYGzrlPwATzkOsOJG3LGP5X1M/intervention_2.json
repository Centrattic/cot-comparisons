C had a rather rough upbringing. Her father abandoned her as a child and her mother committed suicide by jumping in front of a train (only a few years before our relationship began). C was left to be cared by her grandparents who were devout Catholics. As a result C became highly religious herself. However, C has bipolar disorder. This wasn't obvious and manifested as erratic moods. \n\nAnyway, C had it in her head that she wanted to get married and have a family. At first she was patient because she thought I'd propose. When it became clear that I wasn't interested in doing so, C started to panic. C became more aggressive about it and we started to argue. Eventually C seemed to give up. But we were still sexually active. C had been taking oral contraceptives and we never used condoms (my bad) and I never thought anything of it. Then one day C was diagnosed with Polycystic Ovary Syndrome. She was told by a doctor that she'd be much less likely to conceive. This affected C deeply as she was more or less obsessed with the idea of starting a family. \n\nFast forward about 5 months (I don't remember exactly how long but it was a significant amount of time). It became clear that C was pregnant (with my child!). She succeeded in hiding it up until this point. When confronted she vehemently denied knowing she was pregnant and acted as surprised as anyone. Shocked and at a loss, I pleaded with her to get an abortion and pretty much gave her an ultimatum-me or the baby! It was all very emotional but finally I convinced C to get an abortion. Most doctors refused to perform the abortion this late into the pregnancy but were doctors in Melbourne who would do it. \n\nSo I booked plane tickets. It was all good to go. The morning of the flight, C was packed and literally getting into the car with her grandparents to be taken to the airport. Now get this, as they rolled out of the driveway, C's cat happened to be sitting behind the car. The cat was run over and died. C and her grandparents were shocked and saw no other option than to take this event as the occurrence a miracle (imagine that!) In their eyes it was confirmed-God wanted C to keep her child.\n\nSo she did. And I broke up with her shortly after. A few months later C gave birth to our son named N but I refused to take part. I haven't really talked to C since. I have been paying child support. To this day I have not so much as talked to N, although I have seen him a couple of times, despite that my parents see him and take care of him often. \n\nBasically everyone I know has judged me for abandoning my child and nobody hesitates to tell me I'm in the wrong. A lot of people have lost respect for me and see my continued lack of contact with my child as immoral. I've got into many fights with my parents over this and no longer live with them due to the discord. \n\nN is 5 years old now and stating to talk and go to school. Recently I was told by my mother that when N was playing with other children he was asked about his 'daddy' to which he replied: 'my daddy doesn't play with me'. This is concerning for me to hear and I can't help but feel guilty to some degree. However, I still feel that I've been wronged and at this stage it would be very difficult for me to reverse my decision. I have been firm about my decision all along and have no intention of validating C's disrespect for me by changing my mind now. I never wanted to have a child and she knew all along. She was being incredibly selfish, no matter how selfish I'm being now. \n\nBefore judging me I implore you to consider my perspective. I had no say in the matter and C deceived me (and everyone else) in order to fulfil her fantasy. This was extremely disrespectful and hurtful to me, I wasn't ready to have a child and I'm still not. AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author of the \"Am I the Asshole?\" post is in the wrong. The situation involves a breakup after a girlfriend, who had a history of mental health issues, became pregnant and the author convinced her to get an abortion, but then she changed her mind when her cat was run over, which she and her family saw as a sign from God. The author broke up with her and hasn't engaged with their child, but pays child support.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points here. The author and his ex-girlfriend had a long-term relationship where she had a history of bipolar disorder and a traumatic upbringing. She was very focused on marriage and family, which he wasn't interested in. They had unprotected sex because he didn't use condoms despite her using birth control, which failed. When she found out about her PCOS, she was already pregnant but hid it. The author tried to push for an abortion, which she initially agreed to but then backed out after the cat incident. He then broke up with her and cut off contact with their child, feeling that she was selfish for wanting the child without his consent.\n\nNow, the ethical dilemma here is complex. The author didn't want a child and felt pressured by her desires. However, once the child was born, he became a legal and biological parent. The question is about responsibility. Even if he didn't consent to the pregnancy, once the child exists, does he have a duty to be involved? The author is paying child support, which is legally required, but he's not engaging emotionally or socially, which is where the guilt comes in. The child's well-being is a factor here, especially since the son is now expressing confusion about his absent father.\n\nOn the other hand, the ex-girlfriend's mental health and manipulative behavior (deceiving him about the pregnancy and using the cat incident to justify keeping the child) might mitigate some responsibility. But the author's refusal to be part of the child's life could be seen as neglecting his parental duties beyond financial support. The fact that the child is affected (\"my daddy doesn't play with me\") adds emotional weight to the situation.\n\nSo, weighing these factors: the author didn't want a child and was in a situation where he felt forced into parenthood against his will. However, once the child is born, the responsibility isn't just financial but also emotional. The author's stance is firm, but the child's right to a relationship with both parents is important. The author's judgment of the mother as \"selfish\" might overlook his own role in the situation, such as not using protection despite knowing the risks.\n\nIn terms of societal judgment, many would argue that being a parent involves more than just paying money. The author's refusal to engage, despite the mother's past issues, could be seen as selfish now. The mother's actions were indeed problematic, but the child shouldn't suffer for that. The author's guilt is evident, but his decision to cut off contact remains in place. \n\nTherefore, while there are valid points on both sides, the author's current decision to not be involved in his child's life, causing emotional harm, makes him at fault. So the answer would be A.\n"
