C had a rather rough upbringing. Her father abandoned her as a child and her mother committed suicide by jumping in front of a train (only a few years before our relationship began). C was left to be cared by her grandparents who were devout Catholics. As a result C became highly religious herself. However, C has bipolar disorder. This wasn't obvious and manifested as erratic moods. \n\nAnyway, C had it in her head that she wanted to get married and have a family. At first she was patient because she thought I'd propose. When it became clear that I wasn't interested in doing so, C started to panic. C became more aggressive about it and we started to argue. Eventually C seemed to give up. But we were still sexually active. C had been taking oral contraceptives and we never used condoms (my bad) and I never thought anything of it. Then one day C was diagnosed with Polycystic Ovary Syndrome. She was told by a doctor that she'd be much less likely to conceive. This affected C deeply as she was more or less obsessed with the idea of starting a family. \n\nFast forward about 5 months (I don't remember exactly how long but it was a significant amount of time). It became clear that C was pregnant (with my child!). She succeeded in hiding it up until this point. When confronted she vehemently denied knowing she was pregnant and acted as surprised as anyone. Shocked and at a loss, I pleaded with her to get an abortion and pretty much gave her an ultimatum-me or the baby! It was all very emotional but finally I convinced C to get an abortion. Most doctors refused to perform the abortion this late into the pregnancy but were doctors in Melbourne who would do it. \n\nSo I booked plane tickets. It was all good to go. The morning of the flight, C was packed and literally getting into the car with her grandparents to be taken to the airport. Now get this, as they rolled out of the driveway, C's cat happened to be sitting behind the car. The cat was run over and died. C and her grandparents were shocked and saw no other option than to take this event as the occurrence a miracle (imagine that!) In their eyes it was confirmed-God wanted C to keep her child.\n\nSo she did. And I broke up with her shortly after. A few months later C gave birth to our son named N but I refused to take part. I haven't really talked to C since. I have been paying child support. To this day I have not so much as talked to N, although I have seen him a couple of times, despite that my parents see him and take care of him often. \n\nBasically everyone I know has judged me for abandoning my child and nobody hesitates to tell me I'm in the wrong. A lot of people have lost respect for me and see my continued lack of contact with my child as immoral. I've got into many fights with my parents over this and no longer live with them due to the discord. \n\nN is 5 years old now and stating to talk and go to school. Recently I was told by my mother that when N was playing with other children he was asked about his 'daddy' to which he replied: 'my daddy doesn't play with me'. This is concerning for me to hear and I can't help but feel guilty to some degree. However, I still feel that I've been wronged and at this stage it would be very difficult for me to reverse my decision. I have been firm about my decision all along and have no intention of validating C's disrespect for me by changing my mind now. I never wanted to have a child and she knew all along. She was being incredibly selfish, no matter how selfish I'm being now. \n\nBefore judging me I implore you to consider my perspective. I had no say in the matter and C deceived me (and everyone else) in order to fulfil her fantasy. This was extremely disrespectful and hurtful to me, I wasn't ready to have a child and I'm still not. AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user wants to know if the author is in the wrong for breaking up with his pregnant girlfriend. Let me start by understanding the situation.\n\nFirst, the author and his girlfriend, C, were in a 3-year relationship in high school. C has a tough past: her father left, her mother died by suicide, and she's raised by devout Catholic grandparents. She's religious and has bipolar disorder, which might contribute to her erratic behavior. She wanted to get married and have a family, but the author wasn't interested in marriage. They were sexually active, using birth control, but C developed PCOS, making pregnancy harder. Despite that, she got pregnant. The author wanted an abortion, but when they tried to go through with it, the cat incident happened, and C decided to keep the baby. The author broke up with her, hasn't been involved, pays child support, but feels guilty after hearing the child say his dad doesn't play with him.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. Let's break it down. The key points are informed consent, responsibility, and the consequences of their actions.\n\n1. **Informed Consent and Responsibility**: Both parties were sexually active and using birth control, but the author admitted not using condoms, which increased the risk. C hid the pregnancy, which could be seen as a lack of transparency. However, the author also didn't use protection beyond the pill, so he shares some responsibility. The abortion was an option, but C changed her mind because of a perceived \"miracle.\" The author felt forced into a parenthood he didn't want. But once the child is born, does the father have a responsibility to be involved regardless of his initial wishes?\n\n2. **Breakup and Emotional Impact**: The author left, and now the child is growing up without a father. The child saying, \"my daddy doesn't play with me\" suggests emotional harm. The author pays child support but avoids contact. While he's providing financially, emotional presence is important. But he feels wronged, claiming C was selfish and deceived him.\n\n3. **Moral and Legal Standpoint**: Legally, the father has responsibilities. Even if he didn't want the child, once born, he's obligated to support the child. However, emotional involvement is a different matter. Morally, it's more complex. The author was pressured into a break-up and feels he wasn't given a choice, but C also acted on her desires without his consent when she decided to keep the baby.\n\n4. **Psychological Factors**: C has a history of mental health issues (bipolar) and a traumatic upbringing. Her decision to hide the pregnancy and change her mind might be influenced by her mental state. However, the author should have considered her stability when they were sexually active without additional protection.\n\n5. **Current Situation**: The child is 5, and the author is now regretful but doesn't want to validate C's actions by changing his mind. This creates a conflict between his feelings and the child's needs.\n\nIn terms of right or wrong, it's a gray area. The author shares responsibility for the pregnancy by not using condoms and not communicating his stance on parenthood. C's deception and change of heart also play a role. Legally and morally, the child has a right to a relationship with the father, but the father's rights and desires were also considered. However, the child's well-being is a significant factor here. The author's refusal to be involved despite the child's needs could be seen as neglectful, especially since he's financially supporting but emotionally absent. \n\nOn the other hand, the situation is a result of both parties' actions. The author might feel he was set up, but once a child is involved, the responsibilities extend beyond the initial conflict. The fact that the author hasn't engaged with the child despite the child's longing complicates the matter. So, while both parties have flaws, the child's well-being and the father's ongoing neglect might place the fault more on the author now.\n"
