C had a rather rough upbringing. Her father abandoned her as a child and her mother committed suicide by jumping in front of a train (only a few years before our relationship began). C was left to be cared by her grandparents who were devout Catholics. As a result C became highly religious herself. However, C has bipolar disorder. This wasn't obvious and manifested as erratic moods. \n\nAnyway, C had it in her head that she wanted to get married and have a family. At first she was patient because she thought I'd propose. When it became clear that I wasn't interested in doing so, C started to panic. C became more aggressive about it and we started to argue. Eventually C seemed to give up. But we were still sexually active. C had been taking oral contraceptives and we never used condoms (my bad) and I never thought anything of it. Then one day C was diagnosed with Polycystic Ovary Syndrome. She was told by a doctor that she'd be much less likely to conceive. This affected C deeply as she was more or less obsessed with the idea of starting a family. \n\nFast forward about 5 months (I don't remember exactly how long but it was a significant amount of time). It became clear that C was pregnant (with my child!). She succeeded in hiding it up until this point. When confronted she vehemently denied knowing she was pregnant and acted as surprised as anyone. Shocked and at a loss, I pleaded with her to get an abortion and pretty much gave her an ultimatum-me or the baby! It was all very emotional but finally I convinced C to get an abortion. Most doctors refused to perform the abortion this late into the pregnancy but were doctors in Melbourne who would do it. \n\nSo I booked plane tickets. It was all good to go. The morning of the flight, C was packed and literally getting into the car with her grandparents to be taken to the airport. Now get this, as they rolled out of the driveway, C's cat happened to be sitting behind the car. The cat was run over and died. C and her grandparents were shocked and saw no other option than to take this event as the occurrence a miracle (imagine that!) In their eyes it was confirmed-God wanted C to keep her child.\n\nSo she did. And I broke up with her shortly after. A few months later C gave birth to our son named N but I refused to take part. I haven't really talked to C since. I have been paying child support. To this day I have not so much as talked to N, although I have seen him a couple of times, despite that my parents see him and take care of him often. \n\nBasically everyone I know has judged me for abandoning my child and nobody hesitates to tell me I'm in the wrong. A lot of people have lost respect for me and see my continued lack of contact with my child as immoral. I've got into many fights with my parents over this and no longer live with them due to the discord. \n\nN is 5 years old now and stating to talk and go to school. Recently I was told by my mother that when N was playing with other children he was asked about his 'daddy' to which he replied: 'my daddy doesn't play with me'. This is concerning for me to hear and I can't help but feel guilty to some degree. However, I still feel that I've been wronged and at this stage it would be very difficult for me to reverse my decision. I have been firm about my decision all along and have no intention of validating C's disrespect for me by changing my mind now. I never wanted to have a child and she knew all along. She was being incredibly selfish, no matter how selfish I'm being now. \n\nBefore judging me I implore you to consider my perspective. I had no say in the matter and C deceived me (and everyone else) in order to fulfil her fantasy. This was extremely disrespectful and hurtful to me, I wasn't ready to have a child and I'm still not. AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is that he broke up with his pregnant girlfriend, C, who ends up having his child. There's a lot of backstory here. C had a tough upbringing, which led her to be very religious and have bipolar disorder. She wanted to get married and have a family, but he wasn't interested in marriage. They were using birth control, but she got pregnant anyway. When she was diagnosed with PCOS, which made conception harder, she was really upset. Then she got pregnant but tried to hide it, leading to a very emotional ultimatum from him about abortion or him. She agreed to the abortion but then changed her mind when her cat was run over, which they saw as a miracle. He broke up with her, refuses to be involved with the child, pays child support but no contact. Now the kid is 5 and says he doesn't play with his dad.\n\nSo, the user is asking if the author is in the wrong. I need to weigh both sides.\n\nOn one hand, C did deceive him. She hid the pregnancy and then changed her mind about the abortion after the cat incident. That seems manipulative and possibly selfish. He wasn't ready for a child, and she knew that. His argument is that she forced the situation on him, and he's standing by his decision because he wasn't ready.\n\nOn the other hand, he's the biological father of a child. Even if the circumstances were messy, he has responsibilities. He pays child support but refuses contact, which could be harmful to the child. The child saying \"my daddy doesn't play with me\" suggests that the lack of a father figure is affecting him. Legally, he might be the father, and in many places, he can't just cut off contact completely. There's a responsibility to be part of the child's life, even if the relationship with the mother is broken.\n\nHe also mentions that she disrespected him by getting pregnant against his wishes. But he did not use protection either. The fact that they were having sex without condoms and he was not on birth control means that he also shares some responsibility. Maybe he should have been more proactive in using protection or discussing their future plans.\n\nThe key points here are consent, responsibility, and the child's well-being. While C's actions were manipulative, the author also didn't take necessary precautions. Now that the child exists, cutting off completely might not be in the child's best interest. Even if the author feels wronged, as a parent, he has duties beyond just financial support. Emotional and social support are crucial for a child's development.\n\nThe author's parents are involved with the child, which is good, but the father's absence could lead to long-term emotional issues. The author's stance seems rigid, not considering the impact on the child. Even if he wasn't ready for a child, being a father is a lifelong responsibility, and he needs to adjust his stance for the child's sake.\n\nIn many societies, biological fathers have legal obligations to support their children, but emotional and social involvement is also expected. The author's refusal to engage might be seen as neglecting part of that responsibility. So, while C's actions were wrong, the author's refusal to play any role in the child's life could also be considered neglectful. Therefore, he might be in the wrong for not being involved, even if he feels he wasn't ready.\n"
