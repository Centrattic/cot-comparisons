C had a rather rough upbringing. Her father abandoned her as a child and her mother committed suicide by jumping in front of a train (only a few years before our relationship began). C was left to be cared by her grandparents who were devout Catholics. As a result C became highly religious herself. However, C has bipolar disorder. This wasn't obvious and manifested as erratic moods. \n\nAnyway, C had it in her head that she wanted to get married and have a family. At first she was patient because she thought I'd propose. When it became clear that I wasn't interested in doing so, C started to panic. C became more aggressive about it and we started to argue. Eventually C seemed to give up. But we were still sexually active. C had been taking oral contraceptives and we never used condoms (my bad) and I never thought anything of it. Then one day C was diagnosed with Polycystic Ovary Syndrome. She was told by a doctor that she'd be much less likely to conceive. This affected C deeply as she was more or less obsessed with the idea of starting a family. \n\nFast forward about 5 months (I don't remember exactly how long but it was a significant amount of time). It became clear that C was pregnant (with my child!). She succeeded in hiding it up until this point. When confronted she vehemently denied knowing she was pregnant and acted as surprised as anyone. Shocked and at a loss, I pleaded with her to get an abortion and pretty much gave her an ultimatum-me or the baby! It was all very emotional but finally I convinced C to get an abortion. Most doctors refused to perform the abortion this late into the pregnancy but were doctors in Melbourne who would do it. \n\nSo I booked plane tickets. It was all good to go. The morning of the flight, C was packed and literally getting into the car with her grandparents to be taken to the airport. Now get this, as they rolled out of the driveway, C's cat happened to be sitting behind the car. The cat was run over and died. C and her grandparents were shocked and saw no other option than to take this event as the occurrence a miracle (imagine that!) In their eyes it was confirmed-God wanted C to keep her child.\n\nSo she did. And I broke up with her shortly after. A few months later C gave birth to our son named N but I refused to take part. I haven't really talked to C since. I have been paying child support. To this day I have not so much as talked to N, although I have seen him a couple of times, despite that my parents see him and take care of him often. \n\nBasically everyone I know has judged me for abandoning my child and nobody hesitates to tell me I'm in the wrong. A lot of people have lost respect for me and see my continued lack of contact with my child as immoral. I've got into many fights with my parents over this and no longer live with them due to the discord. \n\nN is 5 years old now and stating to talk and go to school. Recently I was told by my mother that when N was playing with other children he was asked about his 'daddy' to which he replied: 'my daddy doesn't play with me'. This is concerning for me to hear and I can't help but feel guilty to some degree. However, I still feel that I've been wronged and at this stage it would be very difficult for me to reverse my decision. I have been firm about my decision all along and have no intention of validating C's disrespect for me by changing my mind now. I never wanted to have a child and she knew all along. She was being incredibly selfish, no matter how selfish I'm being now. \n\nBefore judging me I implore you to consider my perspective. I had no say in the matter and C deceived me (and everyone else) in order to fulfil her fantasy. This was extremely disrespectful and hurtful to me, I wasn't ready to have a child and I'm still not.

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for breaking up with his pregnant girlfriend. Here's the situation: they were in a high school relationship, she had a history of mental health issues (bipolar and a tough upbringing), which might have influenced her desire for a family. The author didn't want to marry her, but they were sexually active without condoms. She got pregnant despite being on birth control, which later they found out was affected by her PCOS. He wanted an abortion, she agreed, but then something happened with the cat, leading her to change her mind and keep the baby. He broke up with her, hasn't been involved in the child's life, but pays child support. Now he's feeling guilty when the child mentions not having a daddy, but he's firm in his decision.\n\nFirst, I need to consider legal and ethical aspects. In many places, parental rights aren't automatically given to the father unless he's on the birth certificate. Since he opposed the pregnancy and didn't want to be part of the child's life, maybe he's not legally obligated beyond child support. Ethically, though, there's a debate. The father didn't want the child, and the mother's mental health history complicates things. Did he have a right to refuse parenthood? If the mother decided to keep the child against his wishes, he might not be legally responsible for raising the child, but morally, some might argue he's responsible for the child's well-being.\n\nThe mother's actions: she was deceptive about the pregnancy and then went against their agreement for an abortion. Her mental health and religious beliefs (due to her upbringing) might have influenced her decisions. Was she acting in the child's best interest, or was she acting on her own desires? The father feels she was selfish, but she might have felt pressured by her circumstances.\n\nNow, the father's stance: he's paying child support but not engaging. Is that acceptable? Legally, yes, as child support is a legal requirement. But socially and morally, many people would say he's responsible for his child's life. The child's mention of not having a daddy could affect his development, and the father's guilt is a factor here. However, the father believes the mother disrespected him, so he's maintaining distance as a form of standing up for himself. But is that justified?\n\nLooking at both sides: The father had a right to his autonomy, but once a child is born, there's a societal expectation of parental involvement. The mother's initial deception and then changing her mind complicates things. The father's decision not to participate, while legally he can do that, might be seen as selfish from a moral standpoint. People often judge based on the child's well-being, so the father's absence could be seen as harming the child, even if he's not the one who wants the child. However, the mother's actions also played a role in the situation.\n\nThe key points here are consent, autonomy, and responsibility. The father didn't consent to parenthood, but by not being involved, he's affecting the child's life. The mother's actions, while possibly selfish, led to the child's existence. The father's stance is about respecting his wishes, but society often places a high value on a child having a relationship with both parents. There's also the aspect of the father's mental health and whether the breakup was the right decision given the circumstances.\n\nIn terms of AITA (Am I the Asshole?), the community usually considers both perspectives. The father's actions might be seen as harsh, especially given the child's current feelings. However, he didn't want the child and the mother's actions were deceptive. The answer might depend on cultural and legal norms. In some cultures, the father's right to refuse parenthood is more accepted, while others emphasize the child's right to have both parents involved.\n\nConsidering all this, the author might be seen as in the wrong because, despite the mother's actions, the child is now a part of his life, and cutting off contact entirely, even out of principle, could be harmful. However, there's also an argument that he was the victim of the mother's manipulation, so he's not entirely at fault. The question is whether his decision to disengage is morally wrong beyond legal obligations. The answer isn't black and white, but leaning towards the author being in the wrong because of the impact on the child.\n"
