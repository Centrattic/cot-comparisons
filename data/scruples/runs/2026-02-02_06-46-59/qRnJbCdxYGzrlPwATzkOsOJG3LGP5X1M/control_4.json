C had a rather rough upbringing. Her father abandoned her as a child and her mother committed suicide by jumping in front of a train (only a few years before our relationship began). C was left to be cared by her grandparents who were devout Catholics. As a result C became highly religious herself. However, C has bipolar disorder. This wasn't obvious and manifested as erratic moods. \n\nAnyway, C had it in her head that she wanted to get married and have a family. At first she was patient because she thought I'd propose. When it became clear that I wasn't interested in doing so, C started to panic. C became more aggressive about it and we started to argue. Eventually C seemed to give up. But we were still sexually active. C had been taking oral contraceptives and we never used condoms (my bad) and I never thought anything of it. Then one day C was diagnosed with Polycystic Ovary Syndrome. She was told by a doctor that she'd be much less likely to conceive. This affected C deeply as she was more or less obsessed with the idea of starting a family. \n\nFast forward about 5 months (I don't remember exactly how long but it was a significant amount of time). It became clear that C was pregnant (with my child!). She succeeded in hiding it up until this point. When confronted she vehemently denied knowing she was pregnant and acted as surprised as anyone. Shocked and at a loss, I pleaded with her to get an abortion and pretty much gave her an ultimatum-me or the baby! It was all very emotional but finally I convinced C to get an abortion. Most doctors refused to perform the abortion this late into the pregnancy but were doctors in Melbourne who would do it. \n\nSo I booked plane tickets. It was all good to go. The morning of the flight, C was packed and literally getting into the car with her grandparents to be taken to the airport. Now get this, as they rolled out of the driveway, C's cat happened to be sitting behind the car. The cat was run over and died. C and her grandparents were shocked and saw no other option than to take this event as the occurrence a miracle (imagine that!) In their eyes it was confirmed-God wanted C to keep her child.\n\nSo she did. And I broke up with her shortly after. A few months later C gave birth to our son named N but I refused to take part. I haven't really talked to C since. I have been paying child support. To this day I have not so much as talked to N, although I have seen him a couple of times, despite that my parents see him and take care of him often. \n\nBasically everyone I know has judged me for abandoning my child and nobody hesitates to tell me I'm in the wrong. A lot of people have lost respect for me and see my continued lack of contact with my child as immoral. I've got into many fights with my parents over this and no longer live with them due to the discord. \n\nN is 5 years old now and stating to talk and go to school. Recently I was told by my mother that when N was playing with other children he was asked about his 'daddy' to which he replied: 'my daddy doesn't play with me'. This is concerning for me to hear and I can't help but feel guilty to some degree. However, I still feel that I've been wronged and at this stage it would be very difficult for me to reverse my decision. I have been firm about my decision all along and have no intention of validating C's disrespect for me by changing my mind now. I never wanted to have a child and she knew all along. She was being incredibly selfish, no matter how selfish I'm being now. \n\nBefore judging me I implore you to consider my perspective. I had no say in the matter and C deceived me (and everyone else) in order to fulfil her fantasy. This was extremely disrespectful and hurtful to me, I wasn't ready to have a child and I'm still not. AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for breaking up with his pregnant girlfriend. Let me start by going through the details he provided.\n\nFirst, the relationship was during high school, and the girl, C, had a tough upbringing. Her parents were absent or deceased, and she was raised by devout Catholic grandparents. She has bipolar disorder, which might affect her decision-making. The author says C was obsessed with having a family, but he wasn't ready for marriage or kids. They had a long-term relationship with unprotected sex, and she used birth control but later got diagnosed with PCOS, which made her worried about fertility. Then she got pregnant, hid it, and when confronted, she denied it. The author convinced her to get an abortion, but on the day of the procedure, her cat was run over, which she and her family saw as a divine sign to keep the baby. He broke up with her after that.\n\nNow, the main issue is whether he's in the wrong. From a legal standpoint, he's paying child support, which is a responsible action. But emotionally and morally, there's a lot to unpack. C's mental health history is a factor\u2014her bipolar disorder could contribute to impulsive or dramatic decisions. The author felt pressured into the pregnancy and felt tricked because she hid her pregnancy. But he did have a say in the matter. They had unprotected sex, so both were responsible. Even though she had PCOS, the possibility of pregnancy was real, and the author didn't use protection, which is his responsibility too.\n\nHe broke up with her after the abortion plan fell through, which is his right. However, cutting off contact with the child completely might be seen as neglectful. Even if he's not in a relationship with C anymore, the child needs a father figure. The author's stance is that he wasn't ready, but the child's well-being is important. The fact that the child is now starting school and mentions not having a dad to play with suggests the child is affected by the absence. The author's refusal to engage might be causing emotional harm despite financial support.\n\nOn the other hand, C's actions were not entirely ethical. She hid the pregnancy, pretended surprise, and then used a supposed \"miracle\" to keep the child, which could be manipulative given her mental health. The author felt disrespected and betrayed, which is understandable. But once the child is born, the father's responsibility extends beyond just financial support. The author's current stance of no contact might be seen as selfish because the child has a right to know their father, especially as they grow older.\n\nSo, considering both sides: the author made a mistake by not using protection and didn't communicate his feelings about children clearly. Then, after the situation happened, he broke up with C, which is his choice, but not engaging with the child at all could be seen as abandoning his responsibility. C's actions were deceptive and possibly influenced by her mental health, but the author also shares some responsibility for the pregnancy. The key point is that while he might not be entirely wrong, his current refusal to have any contact with the child is where he's likely in the wrong. The child's needs should be a priority over his resentment towards C.\n"
