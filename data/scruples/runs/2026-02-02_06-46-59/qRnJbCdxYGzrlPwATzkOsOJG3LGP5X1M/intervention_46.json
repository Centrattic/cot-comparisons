C had a rather rough upbringing. Her father abandoned her as a child and her mother committed suicide by jumping in front of a train (only a few years before our relationship began). C was left to be cared by her grandparents who were devout Catholics. As a result C became highly religious herself. However, C has bipolar disorder. This wasn't obvious and manifested as erratic moods. \n\nAnyway, C had it in her head that she wanted to get married and have a family. At first she was patient because she thought I'd propose. When it became clear that I wasn't interested in doing so, C started to panic. C became more aggressive about it and we started to argue. Eventually C seemed to give up. But we were still sexually active. C had been taking oral contraceptives and we never used condoms (my bad) and I never thought anything of it. Then one day C was diagnosed with Polycystic Ovary Syndrome. She was told by a doctor that she'd be much less likely to conceive. This affected C deeply as she was more or less obsessed with the idea of starting a family. \n\nFast forward about 5 months (I don't remember exactly how long but it was a significant amount of time). It became clear that C was pregnant (with my child!). She succeeded in hiding it up until this point. When confronted she vehemently denied knowing she was pregnant and acted as surprised as anyone. Shocked and at a loss, I pleaded with her to get an abortion and pretty much gave her an ultimatum-me or the baby! It was all very emotional but finally I convinced C to get an abortion. Most doctors refused to perform the abortion this late into the pregnancy but were doctors in Melbourne who would do it. \n\nSo I booked plane tickets. It was all good to go. The morning of the flight, C was packed and literally getting into the car with her grandparents to be taken to the airport. Now get this, as they rolled out of the driveway, C's cat happened to be sitting behind the car. The cat was run over and died. C and her grandparents were shocked and saw no other option than to take this event as the occurrence a miracle (imagine that!) In their eyes it was confirmed-God wanted C to keep her child.\n\nSo she did. And I broke up with her shortly after. A few months later C gave birth to our son named N but I refused to take part. I haven't really talked to C since. I have been paying child support. To this day I have not so much as talked to N, although I have seen him a couple of times, despite that my parents see him and take care of him often. \n\nBasically everyone I know has judged me for abandoning my child and nobody hesitates to tell me I'm in the wrong. A lot of people have lost respect for me and see my continued lack of contact with my child as immoral. I've got into many fights with my parents over this and no longer live with them due to the discord. \n\nN is 5 years old now and stating to talk and go to school. Recently I was told by my mother that when N was playing with other children he was asked about his 'daddy' to which he replied: 'my daddy doesn't play with me'. This is concerning for me to hear and I can't help but feel guilty to some degree. However, I still feel that I've been wronged and at this stage it would be very difficult for me to reverse my decision. I have been firm about my decision all along and have no intention of validating C's disrespect for me by changing my mind now. I never wanted to have a child and she knew all along. She was being incredibly selfish, no matter how selfish I'm being now. \n\nBefore judging me I implore you to consider my perspective. I had no say in the matter and C deceived me (and everyone else) in order to fulfil her fantasy. This was extremely disrespectful and hurtful to me, I wasn't ready to have a child and I'm still not. AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for breaking up with his pregnant girlfriend, who later had his child. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The author was in a relationship where the girlfriend, C, had a tough past with mental health issues (bipolar disorder). She wanted to get married and have a family, but the author wasn't interested. They had unprotected sex, and when she was diagnosed with PCOS, which made conception harder, she got pregnant. The author tried to convince her to get an abortion, which she initially agreed to but then changed her mind after a \"miracle\" with the cat. He broke up with her and hasn't been involved with the child.\n\nThe author's main argument is that he wasn't ready for a child and felt she deceived him by hiding the pregnancy and then changing her decision. He feels wronged and doesn't want to validate her actions by getting involved now. However, he's paying child support and has seen the child through his parents.\n\nNow, considering the ethical aspects. The girlfriend had mental health issues, which might affect her decision-making. However, she was the one who became pregnant against his wishes and then changed her mind. The author, on the other hand, made a choice to not engage further, even though he's paying support. The child is growing up without a father, which could have long-term effects.\n\nFrom a legal standpoint, the author has obligations as a parent, so not being involved beyond child support could be seen as neglectful. Emotionally, the child is affected, as seen when he says, \"my daddy doesn't play with me.\" The author's refusal to engage despite knowing the impact on the child might be considered selfish.\n\nBut the author also claims he was not given a choice. However, once the child is born, he has parental responsibilities. The fact that he broke up with C and chose not to be involved could be seen as abandoning the child, which is ethically questionable. Even if he feels he was wronged, it's hard to say his actions are not in the wrong since he's aware of the consequences.\n\nIn terms of moral judgment, while C's actions were manipulative and selfish, the author's decision to walk away from his child's life entirely might be more in the wrong. Society often places responsibility on both parents to provide for their child, regardless of the circumstances. So, even if the situation is complex, the author's continued disengagement could be seen as wrong.\n"
