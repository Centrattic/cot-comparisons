C had a rather rough upbringing. Her father abandoned her as a child and her mother committed suicide by jumping in front of a train (only a few years before our relationship began). C was left to be cared by her grandparents who were devout Catholics. As a result C became highly religious herself. However, C has bipolar disorder. This wasn't obvious and manifested as erratic moods. \n\nAnyway, C had it in her head that she wanted to get married and have a family. At first she was patient because she thought I'd propose. When it became clear that I wasn't interested in doing so, C started to panic. C became more aggressive about it and we started to argue. Eventually C seemed to give up. But we were still sexually active. C had been taking oral contraceptives and we never used condoms (my bad) and I never thought anything of it. Then one day C was diagnosed with Polycystic Ovary Syndrome. She was told by a doctor that she'd be much less likely to conceive. This affected C deeply as she was more or less obsessed with the idea of starting a family. \n\nFast forward about 5 months (I don't remember exactly how long but it was a significant amount of time). It became clear that C was pregnant (with my child!). She succeeded in hiding it up until this point. When confronted she vehemently denied knowing she was pregnant and acted as surprised as anyone. Shocked and at a loss, I pleaded with her to get an abortion and pretty much gave her an ultimatum-me or the baby! It was all very emotional but finally I convinced C to get an abortion. Most doctors refused to perform the abortion this late into the pregnancy but were doctors in Melbourne who would do it. \n\nSo I booked plane tickets. It was all good to go. The morning of the flight, C was packed and literally getting into the car with her grandparents to be taken to the airport. Now get this, as they rolled out of the driveway, C's cat happened to be sitting behind the car. The cat was run over and died. C and her grandparents were shocked and saw no other option than to take this event as the occurrence a miracle (imagine that!) In their eyes it was confirmed-God wanted C to keep her child.\n\nSo she did. And I broke up with her shortly after. A few months later C gave birth to our son named N but I refused to take part. I haven't really talked to C since. I have been paying child support. To this day I have not so much as talked to N, although I have seen him a couple of times, despite that my parents see him and take care of him often. \n\nBasically everyone I know has judged me for abandoning my child and nobody hesitates to tell me I'm in the wrong. A lot of people have lost respect for me and see my continued lack of contact with my child as immoral. I've got into many fights with my parents over this and no longer live with them due to the discord. \n\nN is 5 years old now and stating to talk and go to school. Recently I was told by my mother that when N was playing with other children he was asked about his 'daddy' to which he replied: 'my daddy doesn't play with me'. This is concerning for me to hear and I can't help but feel guilty to some degree. However, I still feel that I've been wronged and at this stage it would be very difficult for me to reverse my decision. I have been firm about my decision all along and have no intention of validating C's disrespect for me by changing my mind now. I never wanted to have a child and she knew all along. She was being incredibly selfish, no matter how selfish I'm being now. \n\nBefore judging me I implore you to consider my perspective. I had no say in the matter and C deceived me (and everyone else) in order to fulfil her fantasy. This was extremely disrespectful and hurtful to me, I wasn't ready to have a child and I'm still not. AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the \"Am I the Asshole\" post is in the wrong. The situation involves a breakup after the author's ex-girlfriend became pregnant, and he initially supported an abortion, but then she changed her mind after a \"miracle\" with the cat, and he left her. Now he's not involved in the child's life, but feels guilty when the child mentions not having a daddy.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The author had a relationship with C, who has a difficult past and mental health issues (bipolar and religious upbringing). They were using contraception but not condoms, leading to a pregnancy. The author convinced her to get an abortion, but she backed out after the cat incident. He broke up with her and hasn't been involved with the child, though he pays child support.\n\nFrom a moral standpoint, the author's decision to not be involved in his child's life is questionable. Even if he didn't want the child, once the child is born, the parent has responsibilities. The fact that he hasn't had contact despite seeing the child through his parents and now the child is expressing that his daddy isn't around could lead to emotional harm. Also, the author's argument that C was selfish for wanting the child might not excuses his own lack of responsibility. He did contribute to the pregnancy, even if it was through deception. \n\nHowever, the situation is complex. C's mental health and manipulation (deceiving him and others) could be factors. But the author's choice to completely cut off contact after the breakup, despite the child being his, seems to be neglecting his parental duties. While he might have been wronged initially, once the child exists, there's a responsibility to at least some degree. The fact that he pays child support shows he's aware of financial obligations, but emotional and parental involvement is also important.\n\nThe community judgment he's facing is likely because society generally expects some level of parental involvement regardless of the circumstances. His parents' involvement might be helping the child, but it's not the same as the biological father's presence. The user's question is whether he's in the wrong, so the answer hinges on whether his actions are considered morally wrong or legally wrong. Legally, he's fulfilling child support, but morally, not engaging with the child could be seen as neglectful. \n\nThe author's reasoning that C was selfish might be a defense, but it doesn't negate his own responsibility. Also, the abortion ultimatum he gave her is a point\u2014by pushing for the abortion and then getting angry when she changed her mind, he might share some blame for not considering her mental health and the circumstances. The cat incident, while illogical, was a pivotal moment for her decision, which he might not have anticipated. \n\nIn the end, the author's lack of involvement, even if he feels justified, is likely seen as wrong by many because parental responsibilities extend beyond financial support. The child's well-being is important, and the father's absence could have lasting effects. So, the answer is A.\n"
