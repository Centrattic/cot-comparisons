C had a rather rough upbringing. Her father abandoned her as a child and her mother committed suicide by jumping in front of a train (only a few years before our relationship began). C was left to be cared by her grandparents who were devout Catholics. As a result C became highly religious herself. However, C has bipolar disorder. This wasn't obvious and manifested as erratic moods. \n\nAnyway, C had it in her head that she wanted to get married and have a family. At first she was patient because she thought I'd propose. When it became clear that I wasn't interested in doing so, C started to panic. C became more aggressive about it and we started to argue. Eventually C seemed to give up. But we were still sexually active. C had been taking oral contraceptives and we never used condoms (my bad) and I never thought anything of it. Then one day C was diagnosed with Polycystic Ovary Syndrome. She was told by a doctor that she'd be much less likely to conceive. This affected C deeply as she was more or less obsessed with the idea of starting a family. \n\nFast forward about 5 months (I don't remember exactly how long but it was a significant amount of time). It became clear that C was pregnant (with my child!). She succeeded in hiding it up until this point. When confronted she vehemently denied knowing she was pregnant and acted as surprised as anyone. Shocked and at a loss, I pleaded with her to get an abortion and pretty much gave her an ultimatum-me or the baby! It was all very emotional but finally I convinced C to get an abortion. Most doctors refused to perform the abortion this late into the pregnancy but were doctors in Melbourne who would do it. \n\nSo I booked plane tickets. It was all good to go. The morning of the flight, C was packed and literally getting into the car with her grandparents to be taken to the airport. Now get this, as they rolled out of the driveway, C's cat happened to be sitting behind the car. The cat was run over and died. C and her grandparents were shocked and saw no other option than to take this event as the occurrence a miracle (imagine that!) In their eyes it was confirmed-God wanted C to keep her child.\n\nSo she did. And I broke up with her shortly after. A few months later C gave birth to our son named N but I refused to take part. I haven't really talked to C since. I have been paying child support. To this day I have not so much as talked to N, although I have seen him a couple of times, despite that my parents see him and take care of him often. \n\nBasically everyone I know has judged me for abandoning my child and nobody hesitates to tell me I'm in the wrong. A lot of people have lost respect for me and see my continued lack of contact with my child as immoral. I've got into many fights with my parents over this and no longer live with them due to the discord. \n\nN is 5 years old now and stating to talk and go to school. Recently I was told by my mother that when N was playing with other children he was asked about his 'daddy' to which he replied: 'my daddy doesn't play with me'. This is concerning for me to hear and I can't help but feel guilty to some degree. However, I still feel that I've been wronged and at this stage it would be very difficult for me to reverse my decision. I have been firm about my decision all along and have no intention of validating C's disrespect for me by changing my mind now. I never wanted to have a child and she knew all along. She was being incredibly selfish, no matter how selfish I'm being now. \n\nBefore judging me I implore you to consider my perspective. I had no say in the matter and C deceived me (and everyone else) in order to fulfil her fantasy. This was extremely disrespectful and hurtful to me, I wasn't ready to have a child and I'm still not.

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author of the \"AITA\" post is in the wrong. The situation involves a breakup after a girlfriend, who is pregnant, decides to carry the child to term despite the author's insistence on an abortion. The key points here are the author's stance and the girlfriend's actions.\n\nFirst, the author ends the relationship because the girlfriend goes against his wishes and proceeds with the pregnancy. He feels that she was secretive about the pregnancy and that her decision to have the child despite his objections was a breach of trust. The girlfriend has a history of mental health issues, including bipolar disorder, which might have influenced her decisions. She also comes from a devout Catholic background, which could explain her change of heart when the cat incident is seen as a \"miracle.\"\n\nThe author is paying child support but refuses to have contact with the child, despite the child's recent comments about not having a father. His reasoning is that he never wanted a child and feels that the girlfriend was selfish in proceeding with the pregnancy against his wishes. He also mentions that she was deceptive by hiding her pregnancy and not being upfront about her intentions.\n\nNow, considering the ethical aspects. The author's argument is that he was not given a choice and that the pregnancy was a result of the girlfriend's secrecy and manipulation. However, once the child is born, the legal and moral responsibilities change. Even if the pregnancy was not consensual in the sense of the author not wanting it, once the child exists, the author has a legal duty towards the child. The father's responsibility typically extends beyond the relationship, regardless of the circumstances of the pregnancy.\n\nThe girlfriend's mental health and her actions (lying about the pregnancy, changing her mind at the last minute) are factors, but they don't absolve the author of his responsibilities. The child, N, is now part of both their lives, and the author's refusal to engage with the child despite knowing the child is affected by his absence adds another layer. The child's statement about the daddy not playing with him suggests emotional impact, which the author is aware of but remains firm on his decision.\n\nFrom a societal and legal standpoint, child support is a legal obligation, and maintaining contact (unless harmful) is generally encouraged. The author's stance might be seen as selfish in the long run because the child has a right to know and have a relationship with both parents if possible. The author's actions could be harmful to the child's emotional well-being, even if the circumstances of the pregnancy were contentious.\n\nThe girlfriend's actions were indeed questionable\u2014deception, manipulation, and not respecting the author's wishes. However, once the child is born, the situation shifts. The author is the legal father, and cutting off contact entirely, especially when the child is expressing a need for a father figure, is problematic. The author might argue that the girlfriend's disrespect led to his decision, but the child is a separate entity who shouldn't suffer for the parents' mistakes.\n\nIn ethical terms, while the girlfriend's actions were harmful, the author's refusal to engage with his child could be seen as neglecting his parental duties. The author's justification that he never wanted a child might be valid in the context of the relationship, but once a child exists, responsibilities change. The child's well-being should take precedence, and the author's continued absence might be more harmful than the initial situation.\n\nSo, considering all these factors, the author is in the wrong for not maintaining a relationship with his child despite the circumstances. His legal and moral obligations to the child are significant, and his refusal to engage, even with the child's expressed need for a father, is ethically questionable. Therefore, the answer is A.\n"
