C had a rather rough upbringing. Her father abandoned her as a child and her mother committed suicide by jumping in front of a train (only a few years before our relationship began). C was left to be cared by her grandparents who were devout Catholics. As a result C became highly religious herself. However, C has bipolar disorder. This wasn't obvious and manifested as erratic moods. \n\nAnyway, C had it in her head that she wanted to get married and have a family. At first she was patient because she thought I'd propose. When it became clear that I wasn't interested in doing so, C started to panic. C became more aggressive about it and we started to argue. Eventually C seemed to give up. But we were still sexually active. C had been taking oral contraceptives and we never used condoms (my bad) and I never thought anything of it. Then one day C was diagnosed with Polycystic Ovary Syndrome. She was told by a doctor that she'd be much less likely to conceive. This affected C deeply as she was more or less obsessed with the idea of starting a family. \n\nFast forward about 5 months (I don't remember exactly how long but it was a significant amount of time). It became clear that C was pregnant (with my child!). She succeeded in hiding it up until this point. When confronted she vehemently denied knowing she was pregnant and acted as surprised as anyone. Shocked and at a loss, I pleaded with her to get an abortion and pretty much gave her an ultimatum-me or the baby! It was all very emotional but finally I convinced C to get an abortion. Most doctors refused to perform the abortion this late into the pregnancy but were doctors in Melbourne who would do it. \n\nSo I booked plane tickets. It was all good to go. The morning of the flight, C was packed and literally getting into the car with her grandparents to be taken to the airport. Now get this, as they rolled out of the driveway, C's cat happened to be sitting behind the car. The cat was run over and died. C and her grandparents were shocked and saw no other option than to take this event as the occurrence a miracle (imagine that!) In their eyes it was confirmed-God wanted C to keep her child.\n\nSo she did. And I broke up with her shortly after. A few months later C gave birth to our son named N but I refused to take part. I haven't really talked to C since. I have been paying child support. To this day I have not so much as talked to N, although I have seen him a couple of times, despite that my parents see him and take care of him often. \n\nBasically everyone I know has judged me for abandoning my child and nobody hesitates to tell me I'm in the wrong. A lot of people have lost respect for me and see my continued lack of contact with my child as immoral. I've got into many fights with my parents over this and no longer live with them due to the discord. \n\nN is 5 years old now and stating to talk and go to school. Recently I was told by my mother that when N was playing with other children he was asked about his 'daddy' to which he replied: 'my daddy doesn't play with me'. This is concerning for me to hear and I can't help but feel guilty to some degree. However, I still feel that I've been wronged and at this stage it would be very difficult for me to reverse my decision. I have been firm about my decision all along and have no intention of validating C's disrespect for me by changing my mind now. I never wanted to have a child and she knew all along. She was being incredibly selfish, no matter how selfish I'm being now. \n\nBefore judging me I implore you to consider my perspective. I had no say in the matter and C deceived me (and everyone else) in order to fulfil her fantasy. This was extremely disrespectful and hurtful to me, I wasn't ready to have a child and I'm still not. AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for breaking up with his pregnant girlfriend. The situation is pretty complex.\n\nFirst, the author ends a relationship with C after she becomes pregnant. He initially convinced her to get an abortion, but then she backs out when her cat dies, seeing it as a miracle. The author then breaks up with her and refuses to be involved in the child's life. Now the kid is 5 and mentions his dad doesn't play with him, causing guilt but the author still stands by his decision.\n\nSo, the key points here: The author didn't want children and made that clear. C, with mental health issues and a traumatic background, wanted to have a family and manipulated the situation by hiding her pregnancy. The author tried to get an abortion but she changed her mind at the last minute. After breaking up, he hasn't been involved, though he's paying child support.\n\nLegally, in many places, you have a right to not be a parent if you weren't part of the decision to have the child, but once the child is born, legal obligations exist. Ethically, it's more complicated. The author feels wronged, but the child is affected by his absence. Even if he wasn't ready, the child has a right to a relationship with both parents, assuming both are healthy.\n\nC's actions were deceptive, but that doesn't absolve the author from responsibility toward the child. His decision to cut off contact might be seen as selfish now, especially since the child is old enough to feel the absence. While he was wronged in the circumstances leading up to the pregnancy, the ongoing non-involvement could be considered neglectful. The moral responsibility as a parent isn't just about wanting a child but also about ensuring their well-being once they're born. So, even if the author feels wronged, not being part of the child's life could be seen as wrong.\n"
