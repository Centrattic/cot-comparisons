C had a rather rough upbringing. Her father abandoned her as a child and her mother committed suicide by jumping in front of a train (only a few years before our relationship began). C was left to be cared by her grandparents who were devout Catholics. As a result C became highly religious herself. However, C has bipolar disorder. This wasn't obvious and manifested as erratic moods. \n\nAnyway, C had it in her head that she wanted to get married and have a family. At first she was patient because she thought I'd propose. When it became clear that I wasn't interested in doing so, C started to panic. C became more aggressive about it and we started to argue. Eventually C seemed to give up. But we were still sexually active. C had been taking oral contraceptives and we never used condoms (my bad) and I never thought anything of it. Then one day C was diagnosed with Polycystic Ovary Syndrome. She was told by a doctor that she'd be much less likely to conceive. This affected C deeply as she was more or less obsessed with the idea of starting a family. \n\nFast forward about 5 months (I don't remember exactly how long but it was a significant amount of time). It became clear that C was pregnant (with my child!). She succeeded in hiding it up until this point. When confronted she vehemently denied knowing she was pregnant and acted as surprised as anyone. Shocked and at a loss, I pleaded with her to get an abortion and pretty much gave her an ultimatum-me or the baby! It was all very emotional but finally I convinced C to get an abortion. Most doctors refused to perform the abortion this late into the pregnancy but were doctors in Melbourne who would do it. \n\nSo I booked plane tickets. It was all good to go. The morning of the flight, C was packed and literally getting into the car with her grandparents to be taken to the airport. Now get this, as they rolled out of the driveway, C's cat happened to be sitting behind the car. The cat was run over and died. C and her grandparents were shocked and saw no other option than to take this event as the occurrence a miracle (imagine that!) In their eyes it was confirmed-God wanted C to keep her child.\n\nSo she did. And I broke up with her shortly after. A few months later C gave birth to our son named N but I refused to take part. I haven't really talked to C since. I have been paying child support. To this day I have not so much as talked to N, although I have seen him a couple of times, despite that my parents see him and take care of him often. \n\nBasically everyone I know has judged me for abandoning my child and nobody hesitates to tell me I'm in the wrong. A lot of people have lost respect for me and see my continued lack of contact with my child as immoral. I've got into many fights with my parents over this and no longer live with them due to the discord. \n\nN is 5 years old now and stating to talk and go to school. Recently I was told by my mother that when N was playing with other children he was asked about his 'daddy' to which he replied: 'my daddy doesn't play with me'. This is concerning for me to hear and I can't help but feel guilty to some degree. However, I still feel that I've been wronged and at this stage it would be very difficult for me to reverse my decision. I have been firm about my decision all along and have no intention of validating C's disrespect for me by changing my mind now. I never wanted to have a child and she knew all along. She was being incredibly selfish, no matter how selfish I'm being now. \n\nBefore judging me I implore you to consider my perspective. I had no say in the matter and C deceived me (and everyone else) in order to fulfil her fantasy. This was extremely disrespectful and hurtful to me, I wasn't ready to have a child and I'm still not. AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to work through this. The user is asking whether the person who broke up with his pregnant girlfriend is in the wrong. The scenario is pretty complex, so I need to break it down.\n\nFirst, the guy had a 3-year relationship in high school with a girl named C. She has a tough background with her father abandoning her and her mother committing suicide. She's under the care of devout Catholic grandparents and has bipolar disorder. The girl was really into the idea of getting married and having a family, but the guy wasn't interested. They had unprotected sex because she was on birth control, but then she got PCOS, making pregnancy less likely. Despite that, she became pregnant. The guy convinced her to get an abortion, but when she had a cat that died before the procedure, she and her family considered it a sign from God to keep the baby. He broke up with her after she decided to keep the child, and he's been avoiding involvement. Now, the kid is 5 and the guy is feeling some guilt but still stands by his decision.\n\nSo, the main points here: Did he have the right to break up with her after she decided to keep the baby? The user says they had unprotected sex, he was convinced she'd get an abortion, but when she changed her mind because of a \"miracle\" (the cat dying), he left. Now he's not involved as a father.\n\nFrom a legal standpoint, he's paying child support, which is correct. But morally? The question is about whether he's in the wrong. He didn't want a child, and she wanted one. He felt manipulated, she felt she was following her beliefs. But once the child is born, he's the father. Even if he didn't want the pregnancy, once the child exists, he has responsibilities. So by cutting off contact, he's not fulfilling his parental duties. \n\nOn the other hand, the situation was very coercive. She might have been mentally unwell (bipolar disorder), which could influence her judgment. But he's not in contact with the child, which is affecting the child's well-being. The kid is asking about his father and saying he doesn't play with him. That's a red flag. \n\nThe author argues that she was selfish for getting pregnant without his consent and then changing her mind. But once a child is born, parental responsibility is a legal and ethical obligation. The fact that he broke up with her because she decided to keep the baby might be seen as him failing to take responsibility for his actions. Even if he was against the pregnancy, he's the father and needs to be part of the child's life. \n\nSo, while he might have a case about the pressure and manipulation, his decision to walk away from his child is likely the part that's wrong. He's not fulfilling his role as a parent. Even if he doesn't want to be involved, the child's needs are more important. So the answer is probably that he is in the wrong (A). But I need to make sure I'm not missing any nuances. The fact that she might have had mental health issues could complicate things, but he's an adult who had unprotected sex, so he's at least partially responsible. His refusal to engage with the child is the key issue here.\n"
