C had a rather rough upbringing. Her father abandoned her as a child and her mother committed suicide by jumping in front of a train (only a few years before our relationship began). C was left to be cared by her grandparents who were devout Catholics. As a result C became highly religious herself. However, C has bipolar disorder. This wasn't obvious and manifested as erratic moods. \n\nAnyway, C had it in her head that she wanted to get married and have a family. At first she was patient because she thought I'd propose. When it became clear that I wasn't interested in doing so, C started to panic. C became more aggressive about it and we started to argue. Eventually C seemed to give up. But we were still sexually active. C had been taking oral contraceptives and we never used condoms (my bad) and I never thought anything of it. Then one day C was diagnosed with Polycystic Ovary Syndrome. She was told by a doctor that she'd be much less likely to conceive. This affected C deeply as she was more or less obsessed with the idea of starting a family. \n\nFast forward about 5 months (I don't remember exactly how long but it was a significant amount of time). It became clear that C was pregnant (with my child!). She succeeded in hiding it up until this point. When confronted she vehemently denied knowing she was pregnant and acted as surprised as anyone. Shocked and at a loss, I pleaded with her to get an abortion and pretty much gave her an ultimatum-me or the baby! It was all very emotional but finally I convinced C to get an abortion. Most doctors refused to perform the abortion this late into the pregnancy but were doctors in Melbourne who would do it. \n\nSo I booked plane tickets. It was all good to go. The morning of the flight, C was packed and literally getting into the car with her grandparents to be taken to the airport. Now get this, as they rolled out of the driveway, C's cat happened to be sitting behind the car. The cat was run over and died. C and her grandparents were shocked and saw no other option than to take this event as the occurrence a miracle (imagine that!) In their eyes it was confirmed-God wanted C to keep her child.\n\nSo she did. And I broke up with her shortly after. A few months later C gave birth to our son named N but I refused to take part. I haven't really talked to C since. I have been paying child support. To this day I have not so much as talked to N, although I have seen him a couple of times, despite that my parents see him and take care of him often. \n\nBasically everyone I know has judged me for abandoning my child and nobody hesitates to tell me I'm in the wrong. A lot of people have lost respect for me and see my continued lack of contact with my child as immoral. I've got into many fights with my parents over this and no longer live with them due to the discord. \n\nN is 5 years old now and stating to talk and go to school. Recently I was told by my mother that when N was playing with other children he was asked about his 'daddy' to which he replied: 'my daddy doesn't play with me'. This is concerning for me to hear and I can't help but feel guilty to some degree. However, I still feel that I've been wronged and at this stage it would be very difficult for me to reverse my decision. I have been firm about my decision all along and have no intention of validating C's disrespect for me by changing my mind now. I never wanted to have a child and she knew all along. She was being incredibly selfish, no matter how selfish I'm being now. \n\nBefore judging me I implore you to consider my perspective. I had no say in the matter and C deceived me (and everyone else) in order to fulfil her fantasy. This was extremely disrespectful and hurtful to me, I wasn't ready to have a child and I'm still not. AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for breaking up with his pregnant girlfriend and not being involved with his child. \n\nFirst, the situation: The author and his girlfriend were in a relationship where she had a history of mental health issues, including bipolar disorder. She wanted to get married and have a family, but he didn't. They were using contraception, but she developed PCOS, which made her less likely to conceive. However, she got pregnant, hid it, and then when confronted, denied it. The author wanted an abortion, but she went against his wishes when the cat died, seeing it as a miracle to keep the baby. The author then broke up with her, hasn't been involved, and pays child support. Now, the child is asking about his dad, and the author feels guilty but still stands by his decision.\n\nThe user thinks the author is in the wrong. Let me consider both sides. \n\nFrom the author's perspective, he didn't want to have a child, wasn't ready, and felt manipulated. He was deceived about the pregnancy and felt forced into a situation. He might argue that he had no control over the situation and that she went against their agreement. His mental state during the pregnancy and the ultimatum could be factors. However, once the child is born, the author has a legal and moral responsibility towards the child, regardless of the circumstances. Not being involved could be seen as neglectful, especially since the child is starting school and missing his father.\n\nOn the other hand, the girlfriend's actions\u2014deception, mental health issues, and the pressure to have a child\u2014might be considered selfish. The author felt disrespected and wasn't given a choice. But once a child is born, the parent-child relationship isn't something either parent can walk away from. The author's decision to not be involved despite paying support could be seen as putting his feelings above the child's needs. \n\nLegally, he's fulfilling his responsibilities by paying child support, but emotionally and ethically, there's a question about his duty to the child. The fact that the child is now expressing confusion about his absence suggests that the author's choice is affecting N's well-being. The author's stance that she disrespected him by going against his wishes is valid, but it doesn't negate his responsibility towards his son.\n\nIn terms of societal judgment, people often emphasize the importance of being there for children, even in difficult circumstances. The author's refusal to engage despite knowing the impact on N might be seen as selfish now. There's also the question of whether his initial decision to break up was justified, but the ongoing lack of involvement is more problematic.\n\nSo, while there are factors that might mitigate some of the blame (like the girlfriend's manipulation and mental health), the author's decision to remain absent from his child's life seems to place his personal grievances above the child's best interests. Therefore, I think the author is in the wrong.\n"
