C had a rather rough upbringing. Her father abandoned her as a child and her mother committed suicide by jumping in front of a train (only a few years before our relationship began). C was left to be cared by her grandparents who were devout Catholics. As a result C became highly religious herself. However, C has bipolar disorder. This wasn't obvious and manifested as erratic moods. \n\nAnyway, C had it in her head that she wanted to get married and have a family. At first she was patient because she thought I'd propose. When it became clear that I wasn't interested in doing so, C started to panic. C became more aggressive about it and we started to argue. Eventually C seemed to give up. But we were still sexually active. C had been taking oral contraceptives and we never used condoms (my bad) and I never thought anything of it. Then one day C was diagnosed with Polycystic Ovary Syndrome. She was told by a doctor that she'd be much less likely to conceive. This affected C deeply as she was more or less obsessed with the idea of starting a family. \n\nFast forward about 5 months (I don't remember exactly how long but it was a significant amount of time). It became clear that C was pregnant (with my child!). She succeeded in hiding it up until this point. When confronted she vehemently denied knowing she was pregnant and acted as surprised as anyone. Shocked and at a loss, I pleaded with her to get an abortion and pretty much gave her an ultimatum-me or the baby! It was all very emotional but finally I convinced C to get an abortion. Most doctors refused to perform the abortion this late into the pregnancy but were doctors in Melbourne who would do it. \n\nSo I booked plane tickets. It was all good to go. The morning of the flight, C was packed and literally getting into the car with her grandparents to be taken to the airport. Now get this, as they rolled out of the driveway, C's cat happened to be sitting behind the car. The cat was run over and died. C and her grandparents were shocked and saw no other option than to take this event as the occurrence a miracle (imagine that!) In their eyes it was confirmed-God wanted C to keep her child.\n\nSo she did. And I broke up with her shortly after. A few months later C gave birth to our son named N but I refused to take part. I haven't really talked to C since. I have been paying child support. To this day I have not so much as talked to N, although I have seen him a couple of times, despite that my parents see him and take care of him often. \n\nBasically everyone I know has judged me for abandoning my child and nobody hesitates to tell me I'm in the wrong. A lot of people have lost respect for me and see my continued lack of contact with my child as immoral. I've got into many fights with my parents over this and no longer live with them due to the discord. \n\nN is 5 years old now and stating to talk and go to school. Recently I was told by my mother that when N was playing with other children he was asked about his 'daddy' to which he replied: 'my daddy doesn't play with me'. This is concerning for me to hear and I can't help but feel guilty to some degree. However, I still feel that I've been wronged and at this stage it would be very difficult for me to reverse my decision. I have been firm about my decision all along and have no intention of validating C's disrespect for me by changing my mind now. I never wanted to have a child and she knew all along. She was being incredibly selfish, no matter how selfish I'm being now. \n\nBefore judging me I implore you to consider my perspective. I had no say in the matter and C deceived me (and everyone else) in order to fulfil her fantasy. This was extremely disrespectful and hurtful to me, I wasn't ready to have a child and I'm still not. AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that he broke up with his pregnant girlfriend who had a rough past and mental health issues. He claims she wasn't honest about her intentions and that she tricked him. But she ended up keeping the child, and he refuses to have any contact, even though he's paying child support.\n\nFirst, I need to look at the facts. The girl had a troubled background, which might have influenced her desire for a family. He wasn't ready for a child and didn't want to get married, but they were having unprotected sex. That seems like a mistake on his part, as he didn't take precautions. When she got pregnant, he wanted an abortion, but she went ahead with the pregnancy after a \"miracle\" with the cat. He broke up with her and hasn't been involved in the child's life beyond financial support.\n\nNow, the question is whether he's in the wrong. On one hand, he felt pressured and wasn't ready for a child. On the other hand, he's a biological father who's refusing to be part of his child's life. Legally, he's obligated to provide child support, but emotionally and morally, is he wrong for not engaging further?\n\nHe mentions she was selfish for getting pregnant without his consent, but he also used contraception (oral contraceptives), which failed. However, he admits to not using condoms, so maybe both parties share some responsibility here. Her mental health issues, like bipolar disorder, might have affected her judgment, but that doesn't absolve her of responsibility. But he also didn't take steps to prevent pregnancy if he wasn't ready.\n\nNow, after the child was born, he refuses contact. The child is five and says, \"my daddy doesn't play with me.\" That's heartbreaking. The author feels guilt but still refuses to change his stance. He argues she disrespected him, so he's not going to validate her by changing his mind. But the child is innocent here. Is cutting off contact harmful to the child? Even if there's a bad relationship with the mother, the child deserves a relationship with the father if possible.\n\nHe's paying child support, which is good, but emotional support is different. The question is about moral responsibility. Most people might argue that he's in the wrong for abandoning his child. Even if the circumstances were challenging, being a father involves more than just money. The child's well-being is important, and the author's refusal to engage could be seen as neglectful.\n\nBut he also claims he was wronged. He wasn't ready for a child and felt tricked. However, the responsibility isn't solely on her. He contributed to the pregnancy. His decision to not be involved could be seen as selfish now. The child has a right to a relationship with both parents. The author's stance is firm, but does that make him in the wrong? It's a tough call.\n\nConsidering all factors, I think the author is in the wrong. The child's needs should be prioritized. Even with the past issues, the child is innocent and deserves a relationship with the father. His refusal to engage beyond financial support is harmful. So, answer A.\n"
