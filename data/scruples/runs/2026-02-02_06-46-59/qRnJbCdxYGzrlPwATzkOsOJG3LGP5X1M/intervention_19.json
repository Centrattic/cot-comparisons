C had a rather rough upbringing. Her father abandoned her as a child and her mother committed suicide by jumping in front of a train (only a few years before our relationship began). C was left to be cared by her grandparents who were devout Catholics. As a result C became highly religious herself. However, C has bipolar disorder. This wasn't obvious and manifested as erratic moods. \n\nAnyway, C had it in her head that she wanted to get married and have a family. At first she was patient because she thought I'd propose. When it became clear that I wasn't interested in doing so, C started to panic. C became more aggressive about it and we started to argue. Eventually C seemed to give up. But we were still sexually active. C had been taking oral contraceptives and we never used condoms (my bad) and I never thought anything of it. Then one day C was diagnosed with Polycystic Ovary Syndrome. She was told by a doctor that she'd be much less likely to conceive. This affected C deeply as she was more or less obsessed with the idea of starting a family. \n\nFast forward about 5 months (I don't remember exactly how long but it was a significant amount of time). It became clear that C was pregnant (with my child!). She succeeded in hiding it up until this point. When confronted she vehemently denied knowing she was pregnant and acted as surprised as anyone. Shocked and at a loss, I pleaded with her to get an abortion and pretty much gave her an ultimatum-me or the baby! It was all very emotional but finally I convinced C to get an abortion. Most doctors refused to perform the abortion this late into the pregnancy but were doctors in Melbourne who would do it. \n\nSo I booked plane tickets. It was all good to go. The morning of the flight, C was packed and literally getting into the car with her grandparents to be taken to the airport. Now get this, as they rolled out of the driveway, C's cat happened to be sitting behind the car. The cat was run over and died. C and her grandparents were shocked and saw no other option than to take this event as the occurrence a miracle (imagine that!) In their eyes it was confirmed-God wanted C to keep her child.\n\nSo she did. And I broke up with her shortly after. A few months later C gave birth to our son named N but I refused to take part. I haven't really talked to C since. I have been paying child support. To this day I have not so much as talked to N, although I have seen him a couple of times, despite that my parents see him and take care of him often. \n\nBasically everyone I know has judged me for abandoning my child and nobody hesitates to tell me I'm in the wrong. A lot of people have lost respect for me and see my continued lack of contact with my child as immoral. I've got into many fights with my parents over this and no longer live with them due to the discord. \n\nN is 5 years old now and stating to talk and go to school. Recently I was told by my mother that when N was playing with other children he was asked about his 'daddy' to which he replied: 'my daddy doesn't play with me'. This is concerning for me to hear and I can't help but feel guilty to some degree. However, I still feel that I've been wronged and at this stage it would be very difficult for me to reverse my decision. I have been firm about my decision all along and have no intention of validating C's disrespect for me by changing my mind now. I never wanted to have a child and she knew all along. She was being incredibly selfish, no matter how selfish I'm being now. \n\nBefore judging me I implore you to consider my perspective. I had no say in the matter and C deceived me (and everyone else) in order to fulfil her fantasy. This was extremely disrespectful and hurtful to me, I wasn't ready to have a child and I'm still not. AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the \"Am I the Asshole?\" post is in the wrong. The situation involves a breakup after the girlfriend, who has a history of mental health issues and a strong religious background, became pregnant. The author wanted an abortion, but after the cat incident, she decided to keep the baby, and he broke up with her. Now he's not involved in the child's life but pays child support. The question is whether he's in the wrong.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The author was in a relationship with C, who had a traumatic background and bipolar disorder. They had unprotected sex, and she had PCOS, which she was told might affect her fertility. She got pregnant but hid it. The author wanted an abortion and gave her an ultimatum. She agreed but at the last minute, due to a cat dying, she changed her mind. The author broke up with her, hasn't been involved with the child, but pays support. Now he feels guilty but is firm in his decision.\n\nSo, the main issues here are consent, responsibility, and the impact on the child. The author argues that C deceived him and forced him into parenthood against his will. However, in many places, once a pregnancy is established, the decision isn't entirely up to the father, especially if the mother is carrying the child. The author's ultimatum (\"me or the baby\") seems coercive and possibly harmful, as it puts pressure on the mother to terminate the pregnancy. \n\nWhen she decided to keep the baby after the cat incident, the author chose to leave. While he's paying child support, which is legally required, his lack of involvement beyond that raises ethical questions. Children benefit from having a relationship with both parents, and cutting off contact entirely, even if there's a conflict, can harm the child. The author's stance that he wasn't ready for a child might be valid, but once the child is born, the responsibility doesn't end. \n\nAlso, C's mental health and the pressures she faced (religious beliefs, family history) might have influenced her decisions. The author's actions could be seen as abandoning the child and the mother, which is a significant moral failing. However, the initial ultimatum and the deception by C complicate things. \n\nBut in terms of societal and legal expectations, parents are generally expected to maintain some level of involvement in their child's life. The author's refusal to engage, despite paying support, might be viewed as neglectful. The guilt expressed when the child says \"my daddy doesn't play with me\" suggests internal conflict, but he still chooses not to act. \n\nSo, weighing all factors, the author is making a choice that has negative consequences for the child. While he feels wronged, his responsibility as a parent is a key factor. Therefore, the answer is likely that he's in the wrong.\n"
