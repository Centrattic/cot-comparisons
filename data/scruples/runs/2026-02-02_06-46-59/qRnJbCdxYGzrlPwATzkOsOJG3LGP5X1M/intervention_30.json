C had a rather rough upbringing. Her father abandoned her as a child and her mother committed suicide by jumping in front of a train (only a few years before our relationship began). C was left to be cared by her grandparents who were devout Catholics. As a result C became highly religious herself. However, C has bipolar disorder. This wasn't obvious and manifested as erratic moods. \n\nAnyway, C had it in her head that she wanted to get married and have a family. At first she was patient because she thought I'd propose. When it became clear that I wasn't interested in doing so, C started to panic. C became more aggressive about it and we started to argue. Eventually C seemed to give up. But we were still sexually active. C had been taking oral contraceptives and we never used condoms (my bad) and I never thought anything of it. Then one day C was diagnosed with Polycystic Ovary Syndrome. She was told by a doctor that she'd be much less likely to conceive. This affected C deeply as she was more or less obsessed with the idea of starting a family. \n\nFast forward about 5 months (I don't remember exactly how long but it was a significant amount of time). It became clear that C was pregnant (with my child!). She succeeded in hiding it up until this point. When confronted she vehemently denied knowing she was pregnant and acted as surprised as anyone. Shocked and at a loss, I pleaded with her to get an abortion and pretty much gave her an ultimatum-me or the baby! It was all very emotional but finally I convinced C to get an abortion. Most doctors refused to perform the abortion this late into the pregnancy but were doctors in Melbourne who would do it. \n\nSo I booked plane tickets. It was all good to go. The morning of the flight, C was packed and literally getting into the car with her grandparents to be taken to the airport. Now get this, as they rolled out of the driveway, C's cat happened to be sitting behind the car. The cat was run over and died. C and her grandparents were shocked and saw no other option than to take this event as the occurrence a miracle (imagine that!) In their eyes it was confirmed-God wanted C to keep her child.\n\nSo she did. And I broke up with her shortly after. A few months later C gave birth to our son named N but I refused to take part. I haven't really talked to C since. I have been paying child support. To this day I have not so much as talked to N, although I have seen him a couple of times, despite that my parents see him and take care of him often. \n\nBasically everyone I know has judged me for abandoning my child and nobody hesitates to tell me I'm in the wrong. A lot of people have lost respect for me and see my continued lack of contact with my child as immoral. I've got into many fights with my parents over this and no longer live with them due to the discord. \n\nN is 5 years old now and stating to talk and go to school. Recently I was told by my mother that when N was playing with other children he was asked about his 'daddy' to which he replied: 'my daddy doesn't play with me'. This is concerning for me to hear and I can't help but feel guilty to some degree. However, I still feel that I've been wronged and at this stage it would be very difficult for me to reverse my decision. I have been firm about my decision all along and have no intention of validating C's disrespect for me by changing my mind now. I never wanted to have a child and she knew all along. She was being incredibly selfish, no matter how selfish I'm being now. \n\nBefore judging me I implore you to consider my perspective. I had no say in the matter and C deceived me (and everyone else) in order to fulfil her fantasy. This was extremely disrespectful and hurtful to me, I wasn't ready to have a child and I'm still not. AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out whether the author is in the wrong. The situation is pretty complex. So, the author broke up with his pregnant girlfriend, and there's a lot of back and forth here. Let me break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, the girlfriend, C, had a tough upbringing with her parents being absent or deceased. She became religious and had bipolar disorder. She wanted to get married and have a family. The author wasn't interested in marriage. They had a relationship where they used contraception, but she developed PCOS, which made pregnancy harder, leading her to stop the pill or maybe it failed. Then she got pregnant, hid it, and when the author found out, he wanted an abortion but she went through with the pregnancy after a \"miracle\" with the cat. The author then broke up with her and has been distant, paying child support but not engaging with the child. Now he's conflicted because the child says he doesn't play with him, but he's firm on not changing his decision.\n\nSo, the key points here are consent to parenthood, responsibility, and the impact on the child. The author argues he wasn't ready, and C was selfish for getting pregnant. He felt deceived. But was it truly deception? They were having unprotected sex, so even with the pill, there's a small risk. She might have stopped taking the pill if PCOS affected her, but he admits he didn't use condoms. So maybe he's partially responsible for the pregnancy. Also, when she got pregnant, he wanted an abortion, and she was initially going through with it until the cat incident. That's a critical point. She changed her mind based on a religious interpretation of an accident. Then the author broke up, possibly because he didn't want to be a parent. \n\nBut now the child is growing up without a father. The author is paying child support but not participating in the child's life. Is that neglect? He says he's not ready, but the child is already 5. The child's well-being is a factor here. The author is being criticized for not engaging, but he's sticking to his decision because he feels wronged. The question is whether he's in the wrong for abandoning the child despite being the biological father.\n\nLegally, he's paying child support, which is his obligation. But morally, is it right to cut off a child? The mother (C) might have a role in not encouraging contact, but the author is choosing not to engage. Even if he was wronged initially, the child is innocent. The author's stance might be seen as selfish now. However, he might believe he's protecting himself from being forced into parenthood. But the child's needs are separate from the parents' issues.\n\nIn terms of responsibility, when someone becomes a parent, they have a duty to the child regardless of the circumstances. The author's refusal to be involved beyond financial support could be seen as neglecting the child's emotional needs. He's avoiding responsibility, which is a problem. On the other hand, he wasn't ready for parenthood, and the mother's actions were manipulative (if she hid the pregnancy). However, she was carrying the child, so maybe she had the final say in continuing the pregnancy. The author can't control that once the child is born. \n\nSo, the author is in a tough spot. He might feel justified in his decision, but the child's right to a relationship with both parents is important. The author's choice to not participate could be seen as morally wrong, even if he feels wronged. Therefore, he's likely in the wrong because he's not fulfilling his role as a father, regardless of past circumstances.\n"
