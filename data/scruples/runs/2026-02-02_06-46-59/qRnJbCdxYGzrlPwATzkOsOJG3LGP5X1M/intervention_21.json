C had a rather rough upbringing. Her father abandoned her as a child and her mother committed suicide by jumping in front of a train (only a few years before our relationship began). C was left to be cared by her grandparents who were devout Catholics. As a result C became highly religious herself. However, C has bipolar disorder. This wasn't obvious and manifested as erratic moods. \n\nAnyway, C had it in her head that she wanted to get married and have a family. At first she was patient because she thought I'd propose. When it became clear that I wasn't interested in doing so, C started to panic. C became more aggressive about it and we started to argue. Eventually C seemed to give up. But we were still sexually active. C had been taking oral contraceptives and we never used condoms (my bad) and I never thought anything of it. Then one day C was diagnosed with Polycystic Ovary Syndrome. She was told by a doctor that she'd be much less likely to conceive. This affected C deeply as she was more or less obsessed with the idea of starting a family. \n\nFast forward about 5 months (I don't remember exactly how long but it was a significant amount of time). It became clear that C was pregnant (with my child!). She succeeded in hiding it up until this point. When confronted she vehemently denied knowing she was pregnant and acted as surprised as anyone. Shocked and at a loss, I pleaded with her to get an abortion and pretty much gave her an ultimatum-me or the baby! It was all very emotional but finally I convinced C to get an abortion. Most doctors refused to perform the abortion this late into the pregnancy but were doctors in Melbourne who would do it. \n\nSo I booked plane tickets. It was all good to go. The morning of the flight, C was packed and literally getting into the car with her grandparents to be taken to the airport. Now get this, as they rolled out of the driveway, C's cat happened to be sitting behind the car. The cat was run over and died. C and her grandparents were shocked and saw no other option than to take this event as the occurrence a miracle (imagine that!) In their eyes it was confirmed-God wanted C to keep her child.\n\nSo she did. And I broke up with her shortly after. A few months later C gave birth to our son named N but I refused to take part. I haven't really talked to C since. I have been paying child support. To this day I have not so much as talked to N, although I have seen him a couple of times, despite that my parents see him and take care of him often. \n\nBasically everyone I know has judged me for abandoning my child and nobody hesitates to tell me I'm in the wrong. A lot of people have lost respect for me and see my continued lack of contact with my child as immoral. I've got into many fights with my parents over this and no longer live with them due to the discord. \n\nN is 5 years old now and stating to talk and go to school. Recently I was told by my mother that when N was playing with other children he was asked about his 'daddy' to which he replied: 'my daddy doesn't play with me'. This is concerning for me to hear and I can't help but feel guilty to some degree. However, I still feel that I've been wronged and at this stage it would be very difficult for me to reverse my decision. I have been firm about my decision all along and have no intention of validating C's disrespect for me by changing my mind now. I never wanted to have a child and she knew all along. She was being incredibly selfish, no matter how selfish I'm being now. \n\nBefore judging me I implore you to consider my perspective. I had no say in the matter and C deceived me (and everyone else) in order to fulfil her fantasy. This was extremely disrespectful and hurtful to me, I wasn't ready to have a child and I'm still not. AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to work through this. The user is asking whether the author of the \"AITA\" post is in the wrong. The situation involves a breakup after the girlfriend, who had a history of mental health issues and religious upbringing, became pregnant. The author wanted an abortion, but after the planned procedure was prevented by a cat dying, the girlfriend decided to keep the child, and the author broke up with her. Now he's not involved in the child's life and feels guilty but still believes he's right.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The author didn't want children and thought he made the right decision by breaking up. The girlfriend's actions\u2014deceiving him about the pregnancy, holding onto the child after a near-abortion\u2014might be seen as manipulative. However, the author is not involved in the child's life, which is a big ethical issue. \n\nOn one hand, the author had no intention of becoming a parent and was blindsided by the pregnancy. His decision to end the relationship was based on his beliefs and the circumstances. He's paying child support, which shows some responsibility. On the other hand, by not being part of the child's life, he's denying the child a relationship with a parent. The child's comment about the dad not playing with him adds emotional weight. \n\nThe author's parents are involved, which is good, but the author's stance is that he won't change his decision because he feels wronged. The girlfriend's mental health and upbringing might have influenced her actions, but that doesn't excuse her behavior either. \n\nLegally, he's fulfilling his duty with child support, but ethically, the lack of involvement is questionable. People might argue that having a child is a shared responsibility, and even if the pregnancy was unplanned, he's still a parent. The author's guilt suggests conflict, but his actions show he's stuck in his decision. \n\nSo, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. The answer isn't black and white. He's not wrong for not wanting a child, but by not being involved, he's neglecting his parental responsibilities. The girlfriend's actions were wrong, but that doesn't absolve the author from his role as a father. The child's well-being is the main concern here. The author's guilt indicates he knows something's wrong, but he's unwilling to take action. \n\nConsidering all this, the author is in the wrong because he's not engaging with his child despite being a legal and biological parent. The initial breakup was due to conflicting desires, but the ongoing disengagement harms the child. So, the answer is A.\n"
