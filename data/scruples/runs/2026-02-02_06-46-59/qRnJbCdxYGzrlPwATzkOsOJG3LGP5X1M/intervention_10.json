C had a rather rough upbringing. Her father abandoned her as a child and her mother committed suicide by jumping in front of a train (only a few years before our relationship began). C was left to be cared by her grandparents who were devout Catholics. As a result C became highly religious herself. However, C has bipolar disorder. This wasn't obvious and manifested as erratic moods. \n\nAnyway, C had it in her head that she wanted to get married and have a family. At first she was patient because she thought I'd propose. When it became clear that I wasn't interested in doing so, C started to panic. C became more aggressive about it and we started to argue. Eventually C seemed to give up. But we were still sexually active. C had been taking oral contraceptives and we never used condoms (my bad) and I never thought anything of it. Then one day C was diagnosed with Polycystic Ovary Syndrome. She was told by a doctor that she'd be much less likely to conceive. This affected C deeply as she was more or less obsessed with the idea of starting a family. \n\nFast forward about 5 months (I don't remember exactly how long but it was a significant amount of time). It became clear that C was pregnant (with my child!). She succeeded in hiding it up until this point. When confronted she vehemently denied knowing she was pregnant and acted as surprised as anyone. Shocked and at a loss, I pleaded with her to get an abortion and pretty much gave her an ultimatum-me or the baby! It was all very emotional but finally I convinced C to get an abortion. Most doctors refused to perform the abortion this late into the pregnancy but were doctors in Melbourne who would do it. \n\nSo I booked plane tickets. It was all good to go. The morning of the flight, C was packed and literally getting into the car with her grandparents to be taken to the airport. Now get this, as they rolled out of the driveway, C's cat happened to be sitting behind the car. The cat was run over and died. C and her grandparents were shocked and saw no other option than to take this event as the occurrence a miracle (imagine that!) In their eyes it was confirmed-God wanted C to keep her child.\n\nSo she did. And I broke up with her shortly after. A few months later C gave birth to our son named N but I refused to take part. I haven't really talked to C since. I have been paying child support. To this day I have not so much as talked to N, although I have seen him a couple of times, despite that my parents see him and take care of him often. \n\nBasically everyone I know has judged me for abandoning my child and nobody hesitates to tell me I'm in the wrong. A lot of people have lost respect for me and see my continued lack of contact with my child as immoral. I've got into many fights with my parents over this and no longer live with them due to the discord. \n\nN is 5 years old now and stating to talk and go to school. Recently I was told by my mother that when N was playing with other children he was asked about his 'daddy' to which he replied: 'my daddy doesn't play with me'. This is concerning for me to hear and I can't help but feel guilty to some degree. However, I still feel that I've been wronged and at this stage it would be very difficult for me to reverse my decision. I have been firm about my decision all along and have no intention of validating C's disrespect for me by changing my mind now. I never wanted to have a child and she knew all along. She was being incredibly selfish, no matter how selfish I'm being now. \n\nBefore judging me I implore you to consider my perspective. I had no say in the matter and C deceived me (and everyone else) in order to fulfil her fantasy. This was extremely disrespectful and hurtful to me, I wasn't ready to have a child and I'm still not. AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that he broke up with his pregnant girlfriend, who ended up having his child. The key points here are about consent, deception, and his feelings towards parenthood.\n\nFirst, the author mentions that his ex-girlfriend, C, had a rough upbringing and mental health issues (bipolar disorder). She was really into the idea of having a family, but he wasn't interested in marriage. They had unprotected sex, and she had PCOS which made pregnancy less likely. She then got pregnant and tried to hide it. When confronted, she denied knowing, and he pushed for an abortion. She agreed but then had a change of heart after her cat was hit by her grandparents' car, which she saw as a miracle. He broke up with her after she decided to keep the child.\n\nNow, the author refuses to be involved as the father, pays child support but no contact. People are judging him, and he's feeling conflicted but still stands by his decision. He feels she was selfish for getting pregnant without his consent and then using the miracle of the cat to justify keeping the baby.\n\nSo, the question is whether he's in the wrong. Let's break it down. Legally, he's a legal parent, so he has responsibilities. Emotionally and ethically, is it right for him to disengage from his child's life? Even if he didn't want the pregnancy, once the child is born, does he have a duty to be part of the child's life? He says she was selfish, but his decision to cut off contact might be impacting the child negatively. The child is growing up without a father figure, and he's now hearing about it from his mother's side. \n\nOn the other hand, the author feels coerced into parenthood without his consent. C did deceive him by hiding the pregnancy and then changing her mind about the abortion. But once the child is born, does that right to refuse parenthood still hold? Also, maintaining child support but no contact seems like a halfway point. Maybe he's being selfish now by not engaging, even if he's not ready. \n\nThe author's parents are involved, which is good, but the child is missing out on a relationship with his biological father. The author's guilt is there, but he's unwilling to reverse his decision. \n\nSo, considering all angles: he's in a position where he has legal and ethical responsibilities as a father. His actions affect not just C but also the child. So even if he feels wronged initially, now the child's well-being should be a priority. Therefore, he's in the wrong for cutting off contact and not being involved. The answer is A.\n"
