C had a rather rough upbringing. Her father abandoned her as a child and her mother committed suicide by jumping in front of a train (only a few years before our relationship began). C was left to be cared by her grandparents who were devout Catholics. As a result C became highly religious herself. However, C has bipolar disorder. This wasn't obvious and manifested as erratic moods. \n\nAnyway, C had it in her head that she wanted to get married and have a family. At first she was patient because she thought I'd propose. When it became clear that I wasn't interested in doing so, C started to panic. C became more aggressive about it and we started to argue. Eventually C seemed to give up. But we were still sexually active. C had been taking oral contraceptives and we never used condoms (my bad) and I never thought anything of it. Then one day C was diagnosed with Polycystic Ovary Syndrome. She was told by a doctor that she'd be much less likely to conceive. This affected C deeply as she was more or less obsessed with the idea of starting a family. \n\nFast forward about 5 months (I don't remember exactly how long but it was a significant amount of time). It became clear that C was pregnant (with my child!). She succeeded in hiding it up until this point. When confronted she vehemently denied knowing she was pregnant and acted as surprised as anyone. Shocked and at a loss, I pleaded with her to get an abortion and pretty much gave her an ultimatum-me or the baby! It was all very emotional but finally I convinced C to get an abortion. Most doctors refused to perform the abortion this late into the pregnancy but were doctors in Melbourne who would do it. \n\nSo I booked plane tickets. It was all good to go. The morning of the flight, C was packed and literally getting into the car with her grandparents to be taken to the airport. Now get this, as they rolled out of the driveway, C's cat happened to be sitting behind the car. The cat was run over and died. C and her grandparents were shocked and saw no other option than to take this event as the occurrence a miracle (imagine that!) In their eyes it was confirmed-God wanted C to keep her child.\n\nSo she did. And I broke up with her shortly after. A few months later C gave birth to our son named N but I refused to take part. I haven't really talked to C since. I have been paying child support. To this day I have not so much as talked to N, although I have seen him a couple of times, despite that my parents see him and take care of him often. \n\nBasically everyone I know has judged me for abandoning my child and nobody hesitates to tell me I'm in the wrong. A lot of people have lost respect for me and see my continued lack of contact with my child as immoral. I've got into many fights with my parents over this and no longer live with them due to the discord. \n\nN is 5 years old now and stating to talk and go to school. Recently I was told by my mother that when N was playing with other children he was asked about his 'daddy' to which he replied: 'my daddy doesn't play with me'. This is concerning for me to hear and I can't help but feel guilty to some degree. However, I still feel that I've been wronged and at this stage it would be very difficult for me to reverse my decision. I have been firm about my decision all along and have no intention of validating C's disrespect for me by changing my mind now. I never wanted to have a child and she knew all along. She was being incredibly selfish, no matter how selfish I'm being now. \n\nBefore judging me I implore you to consider my perspective. I had no say in the matter and C deceived me (and everyone else) in order to fulfil her fantasy. This was extremely disrespectful and hurtful to me, I wasn't ready to have a child and I'm still not. AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to work through this. The user wants to know if the author is in the wrong for breaking up with his pregnant girlfriend. \n\nFirst, I need to look at the facts presented. The author was in a long-term high school relationship with C. C had a tough past with her parents, leading to her being raised by devout grandparents. She's religious and has bipolar disorder. The author wasn't interested in marriage or having kids, but they were in a relationship where they had sex without condoms. C had PCOS, which made pregnancy harder, but she still got pregnant. The author wanted an abortion, convinced her, but then the cat incident happened, making her change her mind. The author then broke up with her and hasn't been involved with the child, despite paying child support.\n\nNow, the key points here are consent and responsibility. The author argues that C deceived him by hiding the pregnancy and using the religious event to keep the baby. But wait, they were in a sexual relationship, so both were aware of the possibility of pregnancy. The author also admits to not using condoms and not taking birth control seriously. So maybe part of the responsibility is on him too.\n\nC's mental health is a factor. She has bipolar disorder, which could affect her decision-making. But she was the one pushing for the pregnancy, and the author felt pressured. However, once pregnant, the decision isn't solely hers. Both parties are responsible for the child. The author's ultimatum of \"me or the baby\" seems harsh, but he did try to get her to abort, which she refused after the cat incident. \n\nBreaking up after that is one thing, but cutting off the child completely raises ethical issues. The author is paying child support but not engaging with the child. The child's well-being is now affected, as seen when the child mentions not having a daddy. The author feels wronged but is causing long-term harm to the child.\n\nLegally, he might be fulfilling obligations with child support, but emotionally and morally, he's neglecting the child. Abandonment can have serious consequences. Even if he wasn't ready for a child, the child is a person with rights. The author's stance that C was selfish but he's justified in his decision is conflicting. Both parties made choices that led to the pregnancy. \n\nThe author's refusal to change his mind despite the child's needs might make him the one at fault. He's choosing to remain detached, which affects the child's life. So while C's actions might have contributed, the author's decision to cut off completely and not engage as a father is problematic. Therefore, he might be in the wrong.\n"
