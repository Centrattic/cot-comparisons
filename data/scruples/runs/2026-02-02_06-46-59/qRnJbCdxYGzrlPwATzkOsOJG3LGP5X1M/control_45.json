C had a rather rough upbringing. Her father abandoned her as a child and her mother committed suicide by jumping in front of a train (only a few years before our relationship began). C was left to be cared by her grandparents who were devout Catholics. As a result C became highly religious herself. However, C has bipolar disorder. This wasn't obvious and manifested as erratic moods. \n\nAnyway, C had it in her head that she wanted to get married and have a family. At first she was patient because she thought I'd propose. When it became clear that I wasn't interested in doing so, C started to panic. C became more aggressive about it and we started to argue. Eventually C seemed to give up. But we were still sexually active. C had been taking oral contraceptives and we never used condoms (my bad) and I never thought anything of it. Then one day C was diagnosed with Polycystic Ovary Syndrome. She was told by a doctor that she'd be much less likely to conceive. This affected C deeply as she was more or less obsessed with the idea of starting a family. \n\nFast forward about 5 months (I don't remember exactly how long but it was a significant amount of time). It became clear that C was pregnant (with my child!). She succeeded in hiding it up until this point. When confronted she vehemently denied knowing she was pregnant and acted as surprised as anyone. Shocked and at a loss, I pleaded with her to get an abortion and pretty much gave her an ultimatum-me or the baby! It was all very emotional but finally I convinced C to get an abortion. Most doctors refused to perform the abortion this late into the pregnancy but were doctors in Melbourne who would do it. \n\nSo I booked plane tickets. It was all good to go. The morning of the flight, C was packed and literally getting into the car with her grandparents to be taken to the airport. Now get this, as they rolled out of the driveway, C's cat happened to be sitting behind the car. The cat was run over and died. C and her grandparents were shocked and saw no other option than to take this event as the occurrence a miracle (imagine that!) In their eyes it was confirmed-God wanted C to keep her child.\n\nSo she did. And I broke up with her shortly after. A few months later C gave birth to our son named N but I refused to take part. I haven't really talked to C since. I have been paying child support. To this day I have not so much as talked to N, although I have seen him a couple of times, despite that my parents see him and take care of him often. \n\nBasically everyone I know has judged me for abandoning my child and nobody hesitates to tell me I'm in the wrong. A lot of people have lost respect for me and see my continued lack of contact with my child as immoral. I've got into many fights with my parents over this and no longer live with them due to the discord. \n\nN is 5 years old now and stating to talk and go to school. Recently I was told by my mother that when N was playing with other children he was asked about his 'daddy' to which he replied: 'my daddy doesn't play with me'. This is concerning for me to hear and I can't help but feel guilty to some degree. However, I still feel that I've been wronged and at this stage it would be very difficult for me to reverse my decision. I have been firm about my decision all along and have no intention of validating C's disrespect for me by changing my mind now. I never wanted to have a child and she knew all along. She was being incredibly selfish, no matter how selfish I'm being now. \n\nBefore judging me I implore you to consider my perspective. I had no say in the matter and C deceived me (and everyone else) in order to fulfil her fantasy. This was extremely disrespectful and hurtful to me, I wasn't ready to have a child and I'm still not. AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong. The situation is pretty complex. So, the man is in high school, in a 3-year relationship with a girl who has a tough past\u2014abandoned father, mother's suicide, raised by devout Catholic grandparents. She has bipolar disorder, which might have affected her mood swings. He wasn't interested in marriage, but she wanted a family. They were sexually active without condoms, she was on birth control. Then she got diagnosed with PCOS, which made her worried about her fertility. Later, she got pregnant but hid it until it became obvious. He wanted an abortion, and she agreed to go to Melbourne for it. But when she was about to leave, her cat died, and she and her family saw it as a divine sign to keep the child. He broke up with her, refuses to have a relationship with the child, pays child support but no contact. Now the child is 5 and is saying \"my daddy doesn't play with me.\" The author feels guilty but stands by his decision because he wasn't ready and she was selfish.\n\nFirst, let's look at the key points. The author had a relationship where they were intimate without protection. He wasn't using condoms, which contributed to the pregnancy. She had mental health issues, which might affect her decision-making. She was hiding the pregnancy, which could be seen as deceitful. He felt pressured into an abortion and then she changed her mind because of a perceived divine sign. He broke up and refuses to be part of the child's life. Society often judges people for not being involved with their child, but there's also the aspect of consent and coercion.\n\nThe author's perspective is that he was wronged because she tricked him into having a child. But in reality, both parties contributed to the situation. The fact that she had mental health issues complicates things. Was she in a stable state of mind when she decided to keep the child? Also, the author didn't take responsibility for his role in the pregnancy by not using protection. Breaking up after the child is born and not being involved is a major issue. The child's well-being is also a factor here; being denied a father figure can have long-term effects.\n\nHowever, the author's reasoning is that he wasn't ready and that she was selfish. But the mother's decision to keep the child after agreeing to an abortion might be seen as manipulative. The author is now facing consequences he didn't want, but he also has responsibilities towards the child. Legally, he has to pay child support, but emotionally and ethically, is it right to cut contact? The child's statement about not playing with him shows the impact of this decision. Even if the author feels wronged, the child's needs might outweigh his personal feelings.\n\nThere's a balance between an individual's autonomy and parental responsibility. The author might feel the relationship was unfair, but once a child is involved, the responsibilities extend beyond the couple. His parents are involved in the child's life, which adds another layer. The author's guilt is evident, but he's sticking to his decision. From a societal standpoint, not being involved with one's child is often seen as wrong, regardless of the circumstances. But legally, without custody, maybe he's not obligated. Still, morally, there's a duty to be part of the child's life.\n\nIn summary, while the author has valid grievances about being pressured and deceived, his refusal to engage with the child despite the child's needs and societal expectations makes him at fault. The mother's actions were manipulative, but the author's decision to disengage has lasting negative impacts. Therefore, he's in the wrong for not taking responsibility for the child.\n"
