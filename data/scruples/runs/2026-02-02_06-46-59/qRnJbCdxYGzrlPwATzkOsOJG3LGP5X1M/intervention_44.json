C had a rather rough upbringing. Her father abandoned her as a child and her mother committed suicide by jumping in front of a train (only a few years before our relationship began). C was left to be cared by her grandparents who were devout Catholics. As a result C became highly religious herself. However, C has bipolar disorder. This wasn't obvious and manifested as erratic moods. \n\nAnyway, C had it in her head that she wanted to get married and have a family. At first she was patient because she thought I'd propose. When it became clear that I wasn't interested in doing so, C started to panic. C became more aggressive about it and we started to argue. Eventually C seemed to give up. But we were still sexually active. C had been taking oral contraceptives and we never used condoms (my bad) and I never thought anything of it. Then one day C was diagnosed with Polycystic Ovary Syndrome. She was told by a doctor that she'd be much less likely to conceive. This affected C deeply as she was more or less obsessed with the idea of starting a family. \n\nFast forward about 5 months (I don't remember exactly how long but it was a significant amount of time). It became clear that C was pregnant (with my child!). She succeeded in hiding it up until this point. When confronted she vehemently denied knowing she was pregnant and acted as surprised as anyone. Shocked and at a loss, I pleaded with her to get an abortion and pretty much gave her an ultimatum-me or the baby! It was all very emotional but finally I convinced C to get an abortion. Most doctors refused to perform the abortion this late into the pregnancy but were doctors in Melbourne who would do it. \n\nSo I booked plane tickets. It was all good to go. The morning of the flight, C was packed and literally getting into the car with her grandparents to be taken to the airport. Now get this, as they rolled out of the driveway, C's cat happened to be sitting behind the car. The cat was run over and died. C and her grandparents were shocked and saw no other option than to take this event as the occurrence a miracle (imagine that!) In their eyes it was confirmed-God wanted C to keep her child.\n\nSo she did. And I broke up with her shortly after. A few months later C gave birth to our son named N but I refused to take part. I haven't really talked to C since. I have been paying child support. To this day I have not so much as talked to N, although I have seen him a couple of times, despite that my parents see him and take care of him often. \n\nBasically everyone I know has judged me for abandoning my child and nobody hesitates to tell me I'm in the wrong. A lot of people have lost respect for me and see my continued lack of contact with my child as immoral. I've got into many fights with my parents over this and no longer live with them due to the discord. \n\nN is 5 years old now and stating to talk and go to school. Recently I was told by my mother that when N was playing with other children he was asked about his 'daddy' to which he replied: 'my daddy doesn't play with me'. This is concerning for me to hear and I can't help but feel guilty to some degree. However, I still feel that I've been wronged and at this stage it would be very difficult for me to reverse my decision. I have been firm about my decision all along and have no intention of validating C's disrespect for me by changing my mind now. I never wanted to have a child and she knew all along. She was being incredibly selfish, no matter how selfish I'm being now. \n\nBefore judging me I implore you to consider my perspective. I had no say in the matter and C deceived me (and everyone else) in order to fulfil her fantasy. This was extremely disrespectful and hurtful to me, I wasn't ready to have a child and I'm still not. AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. Let's start by breaking down the situation. The author had a girlfriend named C who had a tough upbringing and became religious. She wanted to get married and have kids, but the author wasn't interested in marriage. They were having sex without condoms, and she was on birth control. Then she got diagnosed with PCOS, which made her worried about her ability to conceive. She ended up getting pregnant, but hid it. The author found out and tried to convince her to get an abortion. They were on their way to the airport to get it done when her cat got hit by the car, which she and her grandparents saw as a sign from God to keep the baby. The author then broke up with her, didn't take part in the child's life, and now he's being judged for it. Now the kid is 5 and he mentions not having a dad. The author feels guilty but still stands by his decision.\n\nFirst, let's look at the author's actions. He was in a relationship where his partner wanted to have a family, but he wasn't interested in marriage. They were having unprotected sex, which the author acknowledges was his mistake. The fact that she hid the pregnancy is a point here. The author tried to convince her to have an abortion, but when she changed her mind at the last minute, he broke up with her and hasn't been involved. Now the child is growing up without a father, and the author is paying child support but not engaging in the child's life.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? Let's consider both sides. On one hand, the author didn't want to have a child and felt pressured. He did try to prevent the pregnancy by urging an abortion, but when she changed her mind, he cut off all contact. On the other hand, he's the biological father, and the child is his. The mother might have made a significant decision (keeping the child) without considering his wishes, but once the child is born, does the father have a responsibility to be involved? The author is paying child support, which is a legal obligation, but emotional and parental involvement is another matter. The child is growing up without a father figure, which is a loss for the child.\n\nThe author argues that he was wronged because he wasn't ready and felt deceived. However, he was aware of the risks of unprotected sex and the possibility of pregnancy. His partner's mental health (bipolar disorder) and her upbringing might have influenced her decisions, but that doesn't absolve him from responsibility once the child exists. Even if he didn't want the child, the child's well-being is a factor. The author's decision to cut off completely, despite the child's need for a father, could be seen as selfish or neglectful.\n\nBut then, the mother's actions in hiding the pregnancy and using the cat incident as a sign might have been manipulative. However, the author could have chosen to be part of the child's life even if he didn't want to be the parent. The key issue is whether he has a moral responsibility now that the child exists. Legally, he's contributing support, but morally, some might argue he should be more involved. Others might say he has the right to refuse if he wasn't part of the decision to keep the child.\n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong. The mother's actions were questionable, but the father's refusal to engage with the child could be seen as neglect. The child's best interest is a primary concern here. If the author is the legal father and the mother isn't allowing him to be involved, that's different, but in this case, he's choosing not to be involved despite the opportunity. His guilt over the child's comment suggests some conflict, but he's still not changing his stance.\n\nIn conclusion, while the mother made decisions without his consent, the author has a responsibility towards his child. Choosing to remain absent could be seen as wrong, especially considering the child's well-being. Therefore, the answer is A.\n"
