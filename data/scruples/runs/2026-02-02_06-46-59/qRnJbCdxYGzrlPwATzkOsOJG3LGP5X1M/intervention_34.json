C had a rather rough upbringing. Her father abandoned her as a child and her mother committed suicide by jumping in front of a train (only a few years before our relationship began). C was left to be cared by her grandparents who were devout Catholics. As a result C became highly religious herself. However, C has bipolar disorder. This wasn't obvious and manifested as erratic moods. \n\nAnyway, C had it in her head that she wanted to get married and have a family. At first she was patient because she thought I'd propose. When it became clear that I wasn't interested in doing so, C started to panic. C became more aggressive about it and we started to argue. Eventually C seemed to give up. But we were still sexually active. C had been taking oral contraceptives and we never used condoms (my bad) and I never thought anything of it. Then one day C was diagnosed with Polycystic Ovary Syndrome. She was told by a doctor that she'd be much less likely to conceive. This affected C deeply as she was more or less obsessed with the idea of starting a family. \n\nFast forward about 5 months (I don't remember exactly how long but it was a significant amount of time). It became clear that C was pregnant (with my child!). She succeeded in hiding it up until this point. When confronted she vehemently denied knowing she was pregnant and acted as surprised as anyone. Shocked and at a loss, I pleaded with her to get an abortion and pretty much gave her an ultimatum-me or the baby! It was all very emotional but finally I convinced C to get an abortion. Most doctors refused to perform the abortion this late into the pregnancy but were doctors in Melbourne who would do it. \n\nSo I booked plane tickets. It was all good to go. The morning of the flight, C was packed and literally getting into the car with her grandparents to be taken to the airport. Now get this, as they rolled out of the driveway, C's cat happened to be sitting behind the car. The cat was run over and died. C and her grandparents were shocked and saw no other option than to take this event as the occurrence a miracle (imagine that!) In their eyes it was confirmed-God wanted C to keep her child.\n\nSo she did. And I broke up with her shortly after. A few months later C gave birth to our son named N but I refused to take part. I haven't really talked to C since. I have been paying child support. To this day I have not so much as talked to N, although I have seen him a couple of times, despite that my parents see him and take care of him often. \n\nBasically everyone I know has judged me for abandoning my child and nobody hesitates to tell me I'm in the wrong. A lot of people have lost respect for me and see my continued lack of contact with my child as immoral. I've got into many fights with my parents over this and no longer live with them due to the discord. \n\nN is 5 years old now and stating to talk and go to school. Recently I was told by my mother that when N was playing with other children he was asked about his 'daddy' to which he replied: 'my daddy doesn't play with me'. This is concerning for me to hear and I can't help but feel guilty to some degree. However, I still feel that I've been wronged and at this stage it would be very difficult for me to reverse my decision. I have been firm about my decision all along and have no intention of validating C's disrespect for me by changing my mind now. I never wanted to have a child and she knew all along. She was being incredibly selfish, no matter how selfish I'm being now. \n\nBefore judging me I implore you to consider my perspective. I had no say in the matter and C deceived me (and everyone else) in order to fulfil her fantasy. This was extremely disrespectful and hurtful to me, I wasn't ready to have a child and I'm still not. AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's dive into this. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for breaking up with his pregnant girlfriend, C. The situation is pretty complex with a lot of factors.\n\nFirst, the author was in a 3-year relationship with C, who has a tough background and bipolar disorder. C wanted to get married and have kids, but the author wasn't interested. They were sexually active with no condoms, and C was on birth control. Then she got diagnosed with PCOS, which made her worried about fertility. Despite this, she got pregnant and tried to hide it. The author found out and pushed for an abortion, even going as far as booking a flight to Melbourne for the procedure. But on the day they were about to leave, the cat was hit by the car, which C and her family saw as a miracle from God, so she decided to keep the baby. The author then broke up with her and hasn't been involved in the child's life, though he pays child support. Now, the child is 5 and mentions his dad doesn't play with him, which is making the author feel guilty but he's still firm in his decision.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? Let's break it down. The key points are: C's mental health, the deception about the pregnancy, the pressure to have a child, the author's refusal to accept the pregnancy, and the aftermath of not being involved in the child's life.\n\nFirst, the author's responsibility. Once a child is born, the legal and moral responsibilities don't just disappear. Even if the author was coerced or didn't want the child, he is the biological father. Withholding involvement could harm the child's emotional well-being. The child's comment about not playing with his dad suggests the author's absence is affecting N. The author pays child support, which covers financial aspects, but emotional and parental bonds are separate.\n\nC's actions: She did deceive by hiding the pregnancy. The author might feel wronged by her manipulation. However, her mental health (bipolar and religious trauma) might have influenced her actions. But that doesn't excuse her not being honest. However, the author was also on board with the relationship without using protection, contributing to the pregnancy.\n\nThe abortion ultimatum: The author gave her an ultimatum, which is a heavy decision. But once she decided to keep the baby, he walked away. It's his child, so choosing to not be involved at all seems extreme. Even if he's not ready, being a present parent is important for the child's life.\n\nThe cat incident: C and her family saw it as a sign. The author might see it as a convenient excuse, but the author's reaction was to end the relationship. Maybe he felt betrayed, but cutting off contact entirely without trying to establish some form of relationship with the child is questionable.\n\nThe author argues that C disrespected him by deceiving him. But as a parent, he has a duty beyond the relationship. The child's needs come into play regardless of the parents' past issues. The author's stance of not validating C's actions by changing his mind might be his way of standing his ground, but the child is innocent here.\n\nIn terms of legal and moral standards, most societies expect a father to at least have some involvement with his child, even if the parents are not together. The author's complete disengagement (no contact, no play) is where the issue lies. Guilt is starting to set in, which is normal, but his actions have real consequences on the child.\n\nSo, while the author's situation is complicated and C's actions were wrong in hiding the pregnancy and possibly manipulating the situation, the author's choice to completely disconnect from his child seems to be the greater wrong. The answer would be A (the author is in the wrong) because once the child is born, the parent's responsibilities extend beyond the relationship. The author's decision to not be part of the child's life, despite the circumstances, is where the fault lies.\n"
