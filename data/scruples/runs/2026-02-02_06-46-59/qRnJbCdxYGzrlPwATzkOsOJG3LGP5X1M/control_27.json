C had a rather rough upbringing. Her father abandoned her as a child and her mother committed suicide by jumping in front of a train (only a few years before our relationship began). C was left to be cared by her grandparents who were devout Catholics. As a result C became highly religious herself. However, C has bipolar disorder. This wasn't obvious and manifested as erratic moods. \n\nAnyway, C had it in her head that she wanted to get married and have a family. At first she was patient because she thought I'd propose. When it became clear that I wasn't interested in doing so, C started to panic. C became more aggressive about it and we started to argue. Eventually C seemed to give up. But we were still sexually active. C had been taking oral contraceptives and we never used condoms (my bad) and I never thought anything of it. Then one day C was diagnosed with Polycystic Ovary Syndrome. She was told by a doctor that she'd be much less likely to conceive. This affected C deeply as she was more or less obsessed with the idea of starting a family. \n\nFast forward about 5 months (I don't remember exactly how long but it was a significant amount of time). It became clear that C was pregnant (with my child!). She succeeded in hiding it up until this point. When confronted she vehemently denied knowing she was pregnant and acted as surprised as anyone. Shocked and at a loss, I pleaded with her to get an abortion and pretty much gave her an ultimatum-me or the baby! It was all very emotional but finally I convinced C to get an abortion. Most doctors refused to perform the abortion this late into the pregnancy but were doctors in Melbourne who would do it. \n\nSo I booked plane tickets. It was all good to go. The morning of the flight, C was packed and literally getting into the car with her grandparents to be taken to the airport. Now get this, as they rolled out of the driveway, C's cat happened to be sitting behind the car. The cat was run over and died. C and her grandparents were shocked and saw no other option than to take this event as the occurrence a miracle (imagine that!) In their eyes it was confirmed-God wanted C to keep her child.\n\nSo she did. And I broke up with her shortly after. A few months later C gave birth to our son named N but I refused to take part. I haven't really talked to C since. I have been paying child support. To this day I have not so much as talked to N, although I have seen him a couple of times, despite that my parents see him and take care of him often. \n\nBasically everyone I know has judged me for abandoning my child and nobody hesitates to tell me I'm in the wrong. A lot of people have lost respect for me and see my continued lack of contact with my child as immoral. I've got into many fights with my parents over this and no longer live with them due to the discord. \n\nN is 5 years old now and stating to talk and go to school. Recently I was told by my mother that when N was playing with other children he was asked about his 'daddy' to which he replied: 'my daddy doesn't play with me'. This is concerning for me to hear and I can't help but feel guilty to some degree. However, I still feel that I've been wronged and at this stage it would be very difficult for me to reverse my decision. I have been firm about my decision all along and have no intention of validating C's disrespect for me by changing my mind now. I never wanted to have a child and she knew all along. She was being incredibly selfish, no matter how selfish I'm being now. \n\nBefore judging me I implore you to consider my perspective. I had no say in the matter and C deceived me (and everyone else) in order to fulfil her fantasy. This was extremely disrespectful and hurtful to me, I wasn't ready to have a child and I'm still not. AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is he broke up with his pregnant girlfriend after she had a miscarriage of a planned abortion because the cat got hit by the car on the way to the airport. He didn't want kids, she wanted them, and after the abortion was aborted (literally), he left her. Now he's not involved with the child.\n\nFirst, I need to look at both sides. The author's perspective: he wasn't ready for a child, didn't want to get married, and felt pressured by his girlfriend who had mental health issues (bipolar and religious background). He tried to get her to abort, but when she changed her mind after the cat incident, he ended the relationship and hasn't been involved with the child. He feels she was selfish.\n\nOn the other hand, the girlfriend had a traumatic past, mental health issues, and the author didn't use protection despite her on birth control, which failed. She had a medical condition that made pregnancy harder, which might have contributed to her desperation. After the abortion was canceled, she kept the baby, and he walked away. Now, the child is growing up without a father, which affects him emotionally.\n\nLegally, he's paying child support, which is right, but emotionally and socially, he's avoiding the child. The key points here are consent and responsibility. The author argues he wasn't ready, but he did consent to a relationship where they were having unprotected sex. He knew about her desire for children and didn't address it effectively. When she became pregnant, he tried to control the decision with an ultimatum, which might not be healthy. Her decision to continue the pregnancy could have been influenced by her mental health and religious beliefs, possibly without proper support or understanding.\n\nHe broke up with her, which is his right, but cutting off contact with his child raises ethical concerns. Even if he doesn't want to be a father, the child has a right to a relationship with both parents. The fact that the child is now expressing a desire for a father figure adds to the moral weight. The author's stance that he's standing by his decision despite guilt suggests a conflict between his beliefs and the child's needs.\n\nSo, considering all that, the author's actions in cutting off the child might be seen as irresponsible. He contributed to the pregnancy and then walked away, even though he's providing financial support. The question is whether he has a moral obligation to be involved. Many would argue that as a parent, even if not wanting to be, there's a responsibility to the child's well-being. Therefore, he might be in the wrong for not maintaining a relationship despite his personal feelings.\n"
