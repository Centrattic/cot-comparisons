C had a rather rough upbringing. Her father abandoned her as a child and her mother committed suicide by jumping in front of a train (only a few years before our relationship began). C was left to be cared by her grandparents who were devout Catholics. As a result C became highly religious herself. However, C has bipolar disorder. This wasn't obvious and manifested as erratic moods. \n\nAnyway, C had it in her head that she wanted to get married and have a family. At first she was patient because she thought I'd propose. When it became clear that I wasn't interested in doing so, C started to panic. C became more aggressive about it and we started to argue. Eventually C seemed to give up. But we were still sexually active. C had been taking oral contraceptives and we never used condoms (my bad) and I never thought anything of it. Then one day C was diagnosed with Polycystic Ovary Syndrome. She was told by a doctor that she'd be much less likely to conceive. This affected C deeply as she was more or less obsessed with the idea of starting a family. \n\nFast forward about 5 months (I don't remember exactly how long but it was a significant amount of time). It became clear that C was pregnant (with my child!). She succeeded in hiding it up until this point. When confronted she vehemently denied knowing she was pregnant and acted as surprised as anyone. Shocked and at a loss, I pleaded with her to get an abortion and pretty much gave her an ultimatum-me or the baby! It was all very emotional but finally I convinced C to get an abortion. Most doctors refused to perform the abortion this late into the pregnancy but were doctors in Melbourne who would do it. \n\nSo I booked plane tickets. It was all good to go. The morning of the flight, C was packed and literally getting into the car with her grandparents to be taken to the airport. Now get this, as they rolled out of the driveway, C's cat happened to be sitting behind the car. The cat was run over and died. C and her grandparents were shocked and saw no other option than to take this event as the occurrence a miracle (imagine that!) In their eyes it was confirmed-God wanted C to keep her child.\n\nSo she did. And I broke up with her shortly after. A few months later C gave birth to our son named N but I refused to take part. I haven't really talked to C since. I have been paying child support. To this day I have not so much as talked to N, although I have seen him a couple of times, despite that my parents see him and take care of him often. \n\nBasically everyone I know has judged me for abandoning my child and nobody hesitates to tell me I'm in the wrong. A lot of people have lost respect for me and see my continued lack of contact with my child as immoral. I've got into many fights with my parents over this and no longer live with them due to the discord. \n\nN is 5 years old now and stating to talk and go to school. Recently I was told by my mother that when N was playing with other children he was asked about his 'daddy' to which he replied: 'my daddy doesn't play with me'. This is concerning for me to hear and I can't help but feel guilty to some degree. However, I still feel that I've been wronged and at this stage it would be very difficult for me to reverse my decision. I have been firm about my decision all along and have no intention of validating C's disrespect for me by changing my mind now. I never wanted to have a child and she knew all along. She was being incredibly selfish, no matter how selfish I'm being now. \n\nBefore judging me I implore you to consider my perspective. I had no say in the matter and C deceived me (and everyone else) in order to fulfil her fantasy. This was extremely disrespectful and hurtful to me, I wasn't ready to have a child and I'm still not. AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for breaking up with his pregnant girlfriend. Let me go through the details step by step.\n\nFirst, the situation: The author was in a 3-year relationship in high school with a girl, C, who has a difficult past, including her parents abandoning her and her being under the care of grandparents who are devout Catholics. C has bipolar disorder, which caused erratic moods. She wanted to get married and have a family, but the author wasn't interested in proposing. They had a sexual relationship without using condoms despite her taking birth control. She later got diagnosed with PCOS, making pregnancy less likely, but she still got pregnant. The author found out after she hid it, convinced her to get an abortion, but when the cat died on the way to the clinic, she changed her mind, leading the author to break up with her. Now, the child is 5, and the author hasn't been involved, causing guilt and conflict with family.\n\nSo, the main points are: Did he have a right to break up? Was he wrong for not being involved in the child's life? The key factors here are consent and deception. C hid the pregnancy, and the author wanted an abortion, which she didn't go through with. He felt forced into a parent role. But he's also not involved in the child's life, which others see as wrong.\n\nFrom a legal standpoint, he's paying child support, which is his responsibility. But emotionally and ethically, it's complex. C manipulated the situation by keeping the pregnancy a secret, leading him to believe an abortion would happen. When she changed her mind, he felt betrayed. However, once the child was born, he has a responsibility towards the child, regardless of his feelings towards C.\n\nThe author's argument is that C was selfish in deceiving him, and he's being selfish by not engaging with the child. But children have needs beyond financial support; they need emotional presence. His refusal to participate could be hurting the child, especially as the child is now expressing that his \"daddy doesn't play with me.\" The author's guilt is mentioned, but he's stuck in his decision.\n\nLegally, he might not be at fault for breaking up, but morally, neglecting the child's emotional needs might make him at fault. However, the initial breakup was because of C's actions, which were deceptive. The question is whether his response is justified. Some might argue that regardless of C's actions, he's responsible for his child. Others might say he was coerced into a parent role against his will.\n\nSo, the answer hinges on whether the author's current stance (no contact beyond support) is morally wrong. Given that the child is affected, the author's inaction could be seen as the wrong. Therefore, answer A: he is in the wrong.\n"
