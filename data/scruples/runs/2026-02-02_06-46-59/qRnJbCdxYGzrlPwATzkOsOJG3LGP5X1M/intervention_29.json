C had a rather rough upbringing. Her father abandoned her as a child and her mother committed suicide by jumping in front of a train (only a few years before our relationship began). C was left to be cared by her grandparents who were devout Catholics. As a result C became highly religious herself. However, C has bipolar disorder. This wasn't obvious and manifested as erratic moods. \n\nAnyway, C had it in her head that she wanted to get married and have a family. At first she was patient because she thought I'd propose. When it became clear that I wasn't interested in doing so, C started to panic. C became more aggressive about it and we started to argue. Eventually C seemed to give up. But we were still sexually active. C had been taking oral contraceptives and we never used condoms (my bad) and I never thought anything of it. Then one day C was diagnosed with Polycystic Ovary Syndrome. She was told by a doctor that she'd be much less likely to conceive. This affected C deeply as she was more or less obsessed with the idea of starting a family. \n\nFast forward about 5 months (I don't remember exactly how long but it was a significant amount of time). It became clear that C was pregnant (with my child!). She succeeded in hiding it up until this point. When confronted she vehemently denied knowing she was pregnant and acted as surprised as anyone. Shocked and at a loss, I pleaded with her to get an abortion and pretty much gave her an ultimatum-me or the baby! It was all very emotional but finally I convinced C to get an abortion. Most doctors refused to perform the abortion this late into the pregnancy but were doctors in Melbourne who would do it. \n\nSo I booked plane tickets. It was all good to go. The morning of the flight, C was packed and literally getting into the car with her grandparents to be taken to the airport. Now get this, as they rolled out of the driveway, C's cat happened to be sitting behind the car. The cat was run over and died. C and her grandparents were shocked and saw no other option than to take this event as the occurrence a miracle (imagine that!) In their eyes it was confirmed-God wanted C to keep her child.\n\nSo she did. And I broke up with her shortly after. A few months later C gave birth to our son named N but I refused to take part. I haven't really talked to C since. I have been paying child support. To this day I have not so much as talked to N, although I have seen him a couple of times, despite that my parents see him and take care of him often. \n\nBasically everyone I know has judged me for abandoning my child and nobody hesitates to tell me I'm in the wrong. A lot of people have lost respect for me and see my continued lack of contact with my child as immoral. I've got into many fights with my parents over this and no longer live with them due to the discord. \n\nN is 5 years old now and stating to talk and go to school. Recently I was told by my mother that when N was playing with other children he was asked about his 'daddy' to which he replied: 'my daddy doesn't play with me'. This is concerning for me to hear and I can't help but feel guilty to some degree. However, I still feel that I've been wronged and at this stage it would be very difficult for me to reverse my decision. I have been firm about my decision all along and have no intention of validating C's disrespect for me by changing my mind now. I never wanted to have a child and she knew all along. She was being incredibly selfish, no matter how selfish I'm being now. \n\nBefore judging me I implore you to consider my perspective. I had no say in the matter and C deceived me (and everyone else) in order to fulfil her fantasy. This was extremely disrespectful and hurtful to me, I wasn't ready to have a child and I'm still not. AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author of the Reddit-style \"AITA\" post is in the wrong. The situation involves a breakup after a girlfriend, who has a history of mental health issues and a strong religious background, had a child with him. The key points are about consent, deception, and the aftermath of the child's birth.\n\nFirst, the author and his ex-girlfriend (C) were in a relationship where he wasn't interested in marriage or having kids. She had a history of mental health struggles, including bipolar disorder, and was under the care of devout Catholic grandparents. She stopped taking birth control, got pregnant, and then tried to get an abortion. But when the cat died before the procedure, she changed her mind, leading to the author breaking up with her. Now, the child is five, and the author is paying child support but not involved in the child's life. He feels guilty but also believes she was selfish in deceiving him.\n\nThe user thinks the author is in the wrong, but I need to analyze both sides. Legally, the author is required to pay child support, which he's doing. However, emotionally and ethically, it's complex. The author claims he wasn't ready for a child and that she deceived him. But C had her own struggles with mental health and a traumatic upbringing, which might have influenced her decisions. The author's ultimatum and subsequent lack of involvement could be seen as neglectful, but he argues that he was respecting her actions that he felt were disrespectful to him.\n\nThe author's perspective is that he was coerced into a situation he didn't consent to, which is a valid point. However, the child is a human being with rights and needs. The author's refusal to engage, despite the emotional impact on the child, might be seen as neglecting his responsibilities. The fact that C's mental health and religious beliefs played a role complicates things further. She might have felt pressured by her family's expectations, but that doesn't excuse her deception.\n\nOn the other hand, the author's decision to break up and not participate in the child's life could be viewed as selfish. The child has the right to know and have a relationship with both parents. The author's guilt is mentioned, but he remains firm in his stance. There's a conflict between his autonomy and the child's well-being.\n\nConsidering all this, while the author's situation is understandable, especially given the lack of consent and deception, the responsibility towards the child is significant. The author is in a position where he's causing ongoing harm by not being involved, which might make him partially at fault. However, the initial circumstances where the child was conceived through deception could also be a mitigating factor. It's a tough call, but generally, parental involvement is considered important for a child's development. So, leaning towards the author being in the wrong (A), but with understanding of his perspective.\n"
