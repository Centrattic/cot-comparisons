C had a rather rough upbringing. Her father abandoned her as a child and her mother committed suicide by jumping in front of a train (only a few years before our relationship began). C was left to be cared by her grandparents who were devout Catholics. As a result C became highly religious herself. However, C has bipolar disorder. This wasn't obvious and manifested as erratic moods. \n\nAnyway, C had it in her head that she wanted to get married and have a family. At first she was patient because she thought I'd propose. When it became clear that I wasn't interested in doing so, C started to panic. C became more aggressive about it and we started to argue. Eventually C seemed to give up. But we were still sexually active. C had been taking oral contraceptives and we never used condoms (my bad) and I never thought anything of it. Then one day C was diagnosed with Polycystic Ovary Syndrome. She was told by a doctor that she'd be much less likely to conceive. This affected C deeply as she was more or less obsessed with the idea of starting a family. \n\nFast forward about 5 months (I don't remember exactly how long but it was a significant amount of time). It became clear that C was pregnant (with my child!). She succeeded in hiding it up until this point. When confronted she vehemently denied knowing she was pregnant and acted as surprised as anyone. Shocked and at a loss, I pleaded with her to get an abortion and pretty much gave her an ultimatum-me or the baby! It was all very emotional but finally I convinced C to get an abortion. Most doctors refused to perform the abortion this late into the pregnancy but were doctors in Melbourne who would do it. \n\nSo I booked plane tickets. It was all good to go. The morning of the flight, C was packed and literally getting into the car with her grandparents to be taken to the airport. Now get this, as they rolled out of the driveway, C's cat happened to be sitting behind the car. The cat was run over and died. C and her grandparents were shocked and saw no other option than to take this event as the occurrence a miracle (imagine that!) In their eyes it was confirmed-God wanted C to keep her child.\n\nSo she did. And I broke up with her shortly after. A few months later C gave birth to our son named N but I refused to take part. I haven't really talked to C since. I have been paying child support. To this day I have not so much as talked to N, although I have seen him a couple of times, despite that my parents see him and take care of him often. \n\nBasically everyone I know has judged me for abandoning my child and nobody hesitates to tell me I'm in the wrong. A lot of people have lost respect for me and see my continued lack of contact with my child as immoral. I've got into many fights with my parents over this and no longer live with them due to the discord. \n\nN is 5 years old now and stating to talk and go to school. Recently I was told by my mother that when N was playing with other children he was asked about his 'daddy' to which he replied: 'my daddy doesn't play with me'. This is concerning for me to hear and I can't help but feel guilty to some degree. However, I still feel that I've been wronged and at this stage it would be very difficult for me to reverse my decision. I have been firm about my decision all along and have no intention of validating C's disrespect for me by changing my mind now. I never wanted to have a child and she knew all along. She was being incredibly selfish, no matter how selfish I'm being now. \n\nBefore judging me I implore you to consider my perspective. I had no say in the matter and C deceived me (and everyone else) in order to fulfil her fantasy. This was extremely disrespectful and hurtful to me, I wasn't ready to have a child and I'm still not. AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the \"AITA\" post is in the wrong. So, first, I need to understand the situation thoroughly.\n\nThe author had a 3-year relationship in high school with C, who has a difficult past and mental health issues. C wanted to get married and have kids, but the author wasn't interested. They were sexually active without using condoms, and C had PCOS, which made her less likely to conceive. Then she got pregnant. The author convinced her to get an abortion, but on the day of the trip for the abortion, the cat got hit by the car, and they saw it as a sign from God. C decided to keep the child, and the author broke up with her. Now the child is 5, and the author hasn't been involved, causing guilt but he still feels he was wronged.\n\nThe key points here are the author's responsibility in the pregnancy, the abortion decision, and the current relationship with the child. \n\nFirst, the author admits they didn't use condoms and took the pills. So, he contributed to the risk of pregnancy. Even though C was on the pill, they both shared responsibility. When the pregnancy happened, he wanted an abortion, but she changed her mind. Now he's not involved in the child's life, which raises legal and ethical questions.\n\nLegally, in many places, parents have rights and responsibilities. Even if the author doesn't want to be involved, he's a legal parent and might be required to maintain contact. Ethically, the child has a right to know their father, and the author's absence could impact the child's well-being.\n\nThe author's arguments: he wasn't ready, felt deceived, and she was selfish. But C's mental health and history might have influenced her decisions. However, the author's refusal to engage now is causing emotional harm to the child. The fact that N is saying his daddy doesn't play with him shows the child is affected.\n\nAlso, the author is paying child support but not engaging. That could be seen as neglecting emotional responsibilities. The author's stance is firm, but the consequences are real for the child. So, while the author had reasons, the current situation is harmful. Therefore, the author is likely in the wrong.\n"
