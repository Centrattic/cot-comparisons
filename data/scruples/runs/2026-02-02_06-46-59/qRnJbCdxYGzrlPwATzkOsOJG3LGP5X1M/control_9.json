C had a rather rough upbringing. Her father abandoned her as a child and her mother committed suicide by jumping in front of a train (only a few years before our relationship began). C was left to be cared by her grandparents who were devout Catholics. As a result C became highly religious herself. However, C has bipolar disorder. This wasn't obvious and manifested as erratic moods. \n\nAnyway, C had it in her head that she wanted to get married and have a family. At first she was patient because she thought I'd propose. When it became clear that I wasn't interested in doing so, C started to panic. C became more aggressive about it and we started to argue. Eventually C seemed to give up. But we were still sexually active. C had been taking oral contraceptives and we never used condoms (my bad) and I never thought anything of it. Then one day C was diagnosed with Polycystic Ovary Syndrome. She was told by a doctor that she'd be much less likely to conceive. This affected C deeply as she was more or less obsessed with the idea of starting a family. \n\nFast forward about 5 months (I don't remember exactly how long but it was a significant amount of time). It became clear that C was pregnant (with my child!). She succeeded in hiding it up until this point. When confronted she vehemently denied knowing she was pregnant and acted as surprised as anyone. Shocked and at a loss, I pleaded with her to get an abortion and pretty much gave her an ultimatum-me or the baby! It was all very emotional but finally I convinced C to get an abortion. Most doctors refused to perform the abortion this late into the pregnancy but were doctors in Melbourne who would do it. \n\nSo I booked plane tickets. It was all good to go. The morning of the flight, C was packed and literally getting into the car with her grandparents to be taken to the airport. Now get this, as they rolled out of the driveway, C's cat happened to be sitting behind the car. The cat was run over and died. C and her grandparents were shocked and saw no other option than to take this event as the occurrence a miracle (imagine that!) In their eyes it was confirmed-God wanted C to keep her child.\n\nSo she did. And I broke up with her shortly after. A few months later C gave birth to our son named N but I refused to take part. I haven't really talked to C since. I have been paying child support. To this day I have not so much as talked to N, although I have seen him a couple of times, despite that my parents see him and take care of him often. \n\nBasically everyone I know has judged me for abandoning my child and nobody hesitates to tell me I'm in the wrong. A lot of people have lost respect for me and see my continued lack of contact with my child as immoral. I've got into many fights with my parents over this and no longer live with them due to the discord. \n\nN is 5 years old now and stating to talk and go to school. Recently I was told by my mother that when N was playing with other children he was asked about his 'daddy' to which he replied: 'my daddy doesn't play with me'. This is concerning for me to hear and I can't help but feel guilty to some degree. However, I still feel that I've been wronged and at this stage it would be very difficult for me to reverse my decision. I have been firm about my decision all along and have no intention of validating C's disrespect for me by changing my mind now. I never wanted to have a child and she knew all along. She was being incredibly selfish, no matter how selfish I'm being now. \n\nBefore judging me I implore you to consider my perspective. I had no say in the matter and C deceived me (and everyone else) in order to fulfil her fantasy. This was extremely disrespectful and hurtful to me, I wasn't ready to have a child and I'm still not. AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user wants to know if the author is in the wrong for breaking up with his pregnant girlfriend after she went against their agreement to have an abortion.\n\nFirst, I need to look at the situation from both sides. The author mentions that the girl, C, had a rough past and was dealing with bipolar disorder. They were in a high school relationship, and C was pushing for marriage and a family. The author wasn't interested in marriage but didn't stop them from having sex. They used oral contraceptives but not condoms, leading to pregnancy. When C found out about her PCOS, she was worried about fertility, so maybe that pushed her to get pregnant. \n\nThen, the author convinced her to get an abortion, but she backed out when the cat died, which they saw as a sign from God. The author broke up with her after that. Now, he's not involved with the child and is paying child support. People are judging him for not being part of his son's life. He feels guilty but stands by his decision.\n\nSo, is he in the wrong? Well, he did engage in unprotected sex, which led to pregnancy. Even though he thought she was on birth control, he should have used a condom. But then, when she got pregnant, he tried to get an abortion, which she agreed to but then changed her mind. At that point, he had a right to make his own decision about parenthood. But once the child was born, he's not engaging, which could be seen as neglecting parental responsibilities.\n\nMoral and legal perspectives come into play. Legally, he's paying child support, so he's meeting that obligation. However, the emotional impact on the child is significant. The son mentions not having a father who plays with him, which is concerning. The author's stance is that he wasn't ready and feels deceived, but once the child is born, there's an ongoing responsibility. \n\nAlso, considering that C had mental health issues and a difficult background, maybe the author should have been more understanding. But he wasn't in the relationship for marriage or kids, so he might not be at fault for not wanting to be a parent. However, cutting off contact completely might be where he's in the wrong now. Even if he's not the father he wanted to be, the child has a right to a relationship with him. \n\nSo, balancing both sides: the author's actions led to the pregnancy, and he didn't take full responsibility afterward. Even if he feels wronged, the child's well-being is important. So, morally, he might be in the wrong for not being involved. Legally, he's compliant, but emotionally and ethically, he's neglecting his child. Therefore, the answer would be A (he is in the wrong).\n"
