C had a rather rough upbringing. Her father abandoned her as a child and her mother committed suicide by jumping in front of a train (only a few years before our relationship began). C was left to be cared by her grandparents who were devout Catholics. As a result C became highly religious herself. However, C has bipolar disorder. This wasn't obvious and manifested as erratic moods. \n\nAnyway, C had it in her head that she wanted to get married and have a family. At first she was patient because she thought I'd propose. When it became clear that I wasn't interested in doing so, C started to panic. C became more aggressive about it and we started to argue. Eventually C seemed to give up. But we were still sexually active. C had been taking oral contraceptives and we never used condoms (my bad) and I never thought anything of it. Then one day C was diagnosed with Polycystic Ovary Syndrome. She was told by a doctor that she'd be much less likely to conceive. This affected C deeply as she was more or less obsessed with the idea of starting a family. \n\nFast forward about 5 months (I don't remember exactly how long but it was a significant amount of time). It became clear that C was pregnant (with my child!). She succeeded in hiding it up until this point. When confronted she vehemently denied knowing she was pregnant and acted as surprised as anyone. Shocked and at a loss, I pleaded with her to get an abortion and pretty much gave her an ultimatum-me or the baby! It was all very emotional but finally I convinced C to get an abortion. Most doctors refused to perform the abortion this late into the pregnancy but were doctors in Melbourne who would do it. \n\nSo I booked plane tickets. It was all good to go. The morning of the flight, C was packed and literally getting into the car with her grandparents to be taken to the airport. Now get this, as they rolled out of the driveway, C's cat happened to be sitting behind the car. The cat was run over and died. C and her grandparents were shocked and saw no other option than to take this event as the occurrence a miracle (imagine that!) In their eyes it was confirmed-God wanted C to keep her child.\n\nSo she did. And I broke up with her shortly after. A few months later C gave birth to our son named N but I refused to take part. I haven't really talked to C since. I have been paying child support. To this day I have not so much as talked to N, although I have seen him a couple of times, despite that my parents see him and take care of him often. \n\nBasically everyone I know has judged me for abandoning my child and nobody hesitates to tell me I'm in the wrong. A lot of people have lost respect for me and see my continued lack of contact with my child as immoral. I've got into many fights with my parents over this and no longer live with them due to the discord. \n\nN is 5 years old now and stating to talk and go to school. Recently I was told by my mother that when N was playing with other children he was asked about his 'daddy' to which he replied: 'my daddy doesn't play with me'. This is concerning for me to hear and I can't help but feel guilty to some degree. However, I still feel that I've been wronged and at this stage it would be very difficult for me to reverse my decision. I have been firm about my decision all along and have no intention of validating C's disrespect for me by changing my mind now. I never wanted to have a child and she knew all along. She was being incredibly selfish, no matter how selfish I'm being now. \n\nBefore judging me I implore you to consider my perspective. I had no say in the matter and C deceived me (and everyone else) in order to fulfil her fantasy. This was extremely disrespectful and hurtful to me, I wasn't ready to have a child and I'm still not. AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is that the author broke up with his pregnant girlfriend, who later had their child, and he refuses to be involved. The main points are: they were in a high school relationship, she had a rough past, was religious, and had bipolar disorder. They didn't use condoms, she got pregnant, but he wanted an abortion and she went through with it until the cat incident made her change her mind. Now the child is 5, and the author isn't involved but pays child support. People are judging him, but he feels wronged because she tricked him into having a child.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal and ethical aspects. Legally, he's paying child support, which is required, so that's a given. But ethically, is it wrong to not be involved in the child's life? The child is his, so there's a biological connection. Even if he didn't want the child, once the child is born, does he have a responsibility beyond financial support?\n\nThe author argues that she was selfish for deceiving him into having the child. However, she might have felt that he was the father and had a right to know. The deception part is a bit tricky. If she hid the pregnancy and then went against his wishes by keeping the child, that could be seen as manipulative. But on the other hand, he was the one who didn't want the child and pressured her for an abortion. So, when she changed her mind, he broke up with her.\n\nNow, the child is growing up without a father figure. The fact that the child says \"my daddy doesn't play with me\" is a significant emotional impact. The author might feel he's not ready, but the child's well-being is a factor here. Even if he's not emotionally ready, does he have a responsibility to at least be part of the child's life now that the child is old enough to understand?\n\nThe author's perspective is that she disrespected him by not getting the abortion, but he's now not engaging with the child. Both sides have elements of self-centeredness. He didn't use protection, which led to the pregnancy, and she made a decision against his wishes. However, once the child is born, the ethical responsibility shifts. The child's needs come into play. So while the author's initial reaction might be understandable, the long-term neglect of the child's emotional needs could make him ethically wrong.\n\nAlso, considering the mental health aspects: the girlfriend had bipolar disorder and a traumatic background, which might have influenced her decisions. But the author also has his own stance and is now causing harm to the child by not being involved. It's a complex situation with both parties having some responsibility, but the child's welfare is paramount. The author's current stance of not engaging, despite the child's age and need for a father, likely makes him in the wrong.\n"
