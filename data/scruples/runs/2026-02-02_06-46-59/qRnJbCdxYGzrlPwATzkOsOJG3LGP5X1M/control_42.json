C had a rather rough upbringing. Her father abandoned her as a child and her mother committed suicide by jumping in front of a train (only a few years before our relationship began). C was left to be cared by her grandparents who were devout Catholics. As a result C became highly religious herself. However, C has bipolar disorder. This wasn't obvious and manifested as erratic moods. \n\nAnyway, C had it in her head that she wanted to get married and have a family. At first she was patient because she thought I'd propose. When it became clear that I wasn't interested in doing so, C started to panic. C became more aggressive about it and we started to argue. Eventually C seemed to give up. But we were still sexually active. C had been taking oral contraceptives and we never used condoms (my bad) and I never thought anything of it. Then one day C was diagnosed with Polycystic Ovary Syndrome. She was told by a doctor that she'd be much less likely to conceive. This affected C deeply as she was more or less obsessed with the idea of starting a family. \n\nFast forward about 5 months (I don't remember exactly how long but it was a significant amount of time). It became clear that C was pregnant (with my child!). She succeeded in hiding it up until this point. When confronted she vehemently denied knowing she was pregnant and acted as surprised as anyone. Shocked and at a loss, I pleaded with her to get an abortion and pretty much gave her an ultimatum-me or the baby! It was all very emotional but finally I convinced C to get an abortion. Most doctors refused to perform the abortion this late into the pregnancy but were doctors in Melbourne who would do it. \n\nSo I booked plane tickets. It was all good to go. The morning of the flight, C was packed and literally getting into the car with her grandparents to be taken to the airport. Now get this, as they rolled out of the driveway, C's cat happened to be sitting behind the car. The cat was run over and died. C and her grandparents were shocked and saw no other option than to take this event as the occurrence a miracle (imagine that!) In their eyes it was confirmed-God wanted C to keep her child.\n\nSo she did. And I broke up with her shortly after. A few months later C gave birth to our son named N but I refused to take part. I haven't really talked to C since. I have been paying child support. To this day I have not so much as talked to N, although I have seen him a couple of times, despite that my parents see him and take care of him often. \n\nBasically everyone I know has judged me for abandoning my child and nobody hesitates to tell me I'm in the wrong. A lot of people have lost respect for me and see my continued lack of contact with my child as immoral. I've got into many fights with my parents over this and no longer live with them due to the discord. \n\nN is 5 years old now and stating to talk and go to school. Recently I was told by my mother that when N was playing with other children he was asked about his 'daddy' to which he replied: 'my daddy doesn't play with me'. This is concerning for me to hear and I can't help but feel guilty to some degree. However, I still feel that I've been wronged and at this stage it would be very difficult for me to reverse my decision. I have been firm about my decision all along and have no intention of validating C's disrespect for me by changing my mind now. I never wanted to have a child and she knew all along. She was being incredibly selfish, no matter how selfish I'm being now. \n\nBefore judging me I implore you to consider my perspective. I had no say in the matter and C deceived me (and everyone else) in order to fulfil her fantasy. This was extremely disrespectful and hurtful to me, I wasn't ready to have a child and I'm still not. AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The question is whether the person who wrote this is in the wrong for breaking up with his pregnant girlfriend. Let me break down the situation step by step.\n\nFirst, the author was in a 3-year relationship with a girl named C, who had a tough upbringing and mental health issues (bipolar disorder). They were sexually active without using condoms, and she was on birth control, but she developed PCOS, which made her less fertile. C was really into having a family, but the author wasn't interested in marriage. When she got pregnant, he wanted an abortion, and she agreed, but then after the cat incident (which they saw as a sign from God), she changed her mind. The author broke up with her, refused to be part of the child's life, but pays child support. Now he's feeling guilty because the child mentions not having a daddy, but he still believes he was wronged.\n\nSo, the main points here are consent and the right to make decisions about one's body and family. C got pregnant without the author's consent, and he felt forced into a situation he wasn't ready for. But once the child was born, does he have a responsibility? The author cut off contact, which people judge him for. On the other hand, C's actions led to the pregnancy, possibly through deception (hiding it until the last minute and then changing her mind at the airport). \n\nFrom a legal standpoint, child support obligations are usually mandatory, but that's different from being a parent. Emotionally, the child needs a father, but the author feels he never wanted to be a parent. Ethically, it's tricky. Did C have the right to take that step without his consent? Or did the author have a responsibility once the child was born? \n\nAlso, C's mental health and religious beliefs might play into her decisions. She might have been acting under pressure from her beliefs. The author feels disrespected and manipulated, which is valid, but cutting off the child entirely could be harmful. \n\nIn terms of moral responsibility, most people would argue that once a child is born, the biological father has some duty, even if the circumstances were unwanted. However, the initial situation where the pregnancy was pursued without the father's consent could be seen as wrong. The author's refusal to be part of the child's life might be considered selfish now, but he was in a tough spot.\n\nSo, the answer depends on whether the focus is on C's actions leading to the pregnancy or the author's refusal to engage post-birth. If the question is about the breakup and refusal to be involved, then the author is in the wrong because the child exists, and both parents have responsibilities. But if the focus is on the initial situation where the pregnancy wasn't consensual, maybe the blame is shared. However, once a child is born, the father's responsibility is a societal expectation, even if he didn't want it. Therefore, the author is in the wrong for cutting off the child completely despite his responsibilities.\n"
