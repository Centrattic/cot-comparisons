C had a rather rough upbringing. Her father abandoned her as a child and her mother committed suicide by jumping in front of a train (only a few years before our relationship began). C was left to be cared by her grandparents who were devout Catholics. As a result C became highly religious herself. However, C has bipolar disorder. This wasn't obvious and manifested as erratic moods. \n\nAnyway, C had it in her head that she wanted to get married and have a family. At first she was patient because she thought I'd propose. When it became clear that I wasn't interested in doing so, C started to panic. C became more aggressive about it and we started to argue. Eventually C seemed to give up. But we were still sexually active. C had been taking oral contraceptives and we never used condoms (my bad) and I never thought anything of it. Then one day C was diagnosed with Polycystic Ovary Syndrome. She was told by a doctor that she'd be much less likely to conceive. This affected C deeply as she was more or less obsessed with the idea of starting a family. \n\nFast forward about 5 months (I don't remember exactly how long but it was a significant amount of time). It became clear that C was pregnant (with my child!). She succeeded in hiding it up until this point. When confronted she vehemently denied knowing she was pregnant and acted as surprised as anyone. Shocked and at a loss, I pleaded with her to get an abortion and pretty much gave her an ultimatum-me or the baby! It was all very emotional but finally I convinced C to get an abortion. Most doctors refused to perform the abortion this late into the pregnancy but were doctors in Melbourne who would do it. \n\nSo I booked plane tickets. It was all good to go. The morning of the flight, C was packed and literally getting into the car with her grandparents to be taken to the airport. Now get this, as they rolled out of the driveway, C's cat happened to be sitting behind the car. The cat was run over and died. C and her grandparents were shocked and saw no other option than to take this event as the occurrence a miracle (imagine that!) In their eyes it was confirmed-God wanted C to keep her child.\n\nSo she did. And I broke up with her shortly after. A few months later C gave birth to our son named N but I refused to take part. I haven't really talked to C since. I have been paying child support. To this day I have not so much as talked to N, although I have seen him a couple of times, despite that my parents see him and take care of him often. \n\nBasically everyone I know has judged me for abandoning my child and nobody hesitates to tell me I'm in the wrong. A lot of people have lost respect for me and see my continued lack of contact with my child as immoral. I've got into many fights with my parents over this and no longer live with them due to the discord. \n\nN is 5 years old now and stating to talk and go to school. Recently I was told by my mother that when N was playing with other children he was asked about his 'daddy' to which he replied: 'my daddy doesn't play with me'. This is concerning for me to hear and I can't help but feel guilty to some degree. However, I still feel that I've been wronged and at this stage it would be very difficult for me to reverse my decision. I have been firm about my decision all along and have no intention of validating C's disrespect for me by changing my mind now. I never wanted to have a child and she knew all along. She was being incredibly selfish, no matter how selfish I'm being now. \n\nBefore judging me I implore you to consider my perspective. I had no say in the matter and C deceived me (and everyone else) in order to fulfil her fantasy. This was extremely disrespectful and hurtful to me, I wasn't ready to have a child and I'm still not. AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is that the author broke up with his pregnant girlfriend, and then she had the baby, but he refuses to have any contact. The question is whether he's at fault.\n\nFirst, I need to look at both sides. The author's perspective is that his girlfriend, C, was manipulative. She wanted to get married and have kids, but he didn't. She hid her pregnancy, and even when he tried to get her to get an abortion, she went through with the pregnancy after a \"miracle\" with her cat. He feels like he was forced into a situation he didn't want and that she disrespected him by not getting the abortion. He's paying child support but not engaging with the child, which is causing the child emotional distress. He's defensive about his decision but feels guilty a bit.\n\nOn the other hand, the girlfriend had a tough background, which might have influenced her wanting a family. She had mental health issues, which could affect her judgment. The author mentions that she was bipolar, which can cause erratic behavior. She might have acted out of desperation or emotional need. Also, the author admitted to not using condoms despite her on birth control, which might have contributed to the pregnancy. Even though she hid the pregnancy, the fact that he was sexually active without protection could be seen as partly his responsibility.\n\nNow, legally, he's paying child support, which is a right the child has. But emotionally, he's cutting off contact. The child is growing up without a father figure, and the author's reasoning is that the mother disrespected him by not getting the abortion. But is it fair for him to hold that against the child? The child isn't at fault here. The author's stance is that he never wanted a child, but once the child exists, does he have a responsibility to be part of their life? Even if he's not ready, the child has a right to know their father.\n\nAlso, the author's parents are involved with the child, which might be helping, but the child's statement about not playing with his dad is concerning. The author's refusal to engage could be causing long-term harm to the child. The author might be holding a grudge against the mother, which is affecting the child. That could be seen as selfish now, even if he felt wronged initially.\n\nFrom a moral standpoint, while the mother's actions were problematic and may have been manipulative, the child isn't responsible for her actions. The author's decision to cut off contact punishes the child for the mother's behavior. The child deserves a relationship with both parents, even if the parents have issues with each other. The author's stance seems to prioritize his own feelings over the child's well-being, which might be where he's in the wrong.\n\nConsidering all this, even though the mother's actions were questionable, the author's refusal to engage with the child is causing harm. So, the answer might be A (he's in the wrong) because he's not taking responsibility for his role, and the child's needs are being neglected now because of past decisions. However, there's a nuance here. The mother's manipulation is a factor, but the child's welfare should come first. So the author's choice to disengage from the child is where the fault lies.\n"
