C had a rather rough upbringing. Her father abandoned her as a child and her mother committed suicide by jumping in front of a train (only a few years before our relationship began). C was left to be cared by her grandparents who were devout Catholics. As a result C became highly religious herself. However, C has bipolar disorder. This wasn't obvious and manifested as erratic moods. \n\nAnyway, C had it in her head that she wanted to get married and have a family. At first she was patient because she thought I'd propose. When it became clear that I wasn't interested in doing so, C started to panic. C became more aggressive about it and we started to argue. Eventually C seemed to give up. But we were still sexually active. C had been taking oral contraceptives and we never used condoms (my bad) and I never thought anything of it. Then one day C was diagnosed with Polycystic Ovary Syndrome. She was told by a doctor that she'd be much less likely to conceive. This affected C deeply as she was more or less obsessed with the idea of starting a family. \n\nFast forward about 5 months (I don't remember exactly how long but it was a significant amount of time). It became clear that C was pregnant (with my child!). She succeeded in hiding it up until this point. When confronted she vehemently denied knowing she was pregnant and acted as surprised as anyone. Shocked and at a loss, I pleaded with her to get an abortion and pretty much gave her an ultimatum-me or the baby! It was all very emotional but finally I convinced C to get an abortion. Most doctors refused to perform the abortion this late into the pregnancy but were doctors in Melbourne who would do it. \n\nSo I booked plane tickets. It was all good to go. The morning of the flight, C was packed and literally getting into the car with her grandparents to be taken to the airport. Now get this, as they rolled out of the driveway, C's cat happened to be sitting behind the car. The cat was run over and died. C and her grandparents were shocked and saw no other option than to take this event as the occurrence a miracle (imagine that!) In their eyes it was confirmed-God wanted C to keep her child.\n\nSo she did. And I broke up with her shortly after. A few months later C gave birth to our son named N but I refused to take part. I haven't really talked to C since. I have been paying child support. To this day I have not so much as talked to N, although I have seen him a couple of times, despite that my parents see him and take care of him often. \n\nBasically everyone I know has judged me for abandoning my child and nobody hesitates to tell me I'm in the wrong. A lot of people have lost respect for me and see my continued lack of contact with my child as immoral. I've got into many fights with my parents over this and no longer live with them due to the discord. \n\nN is 5 years old now and stating to talk and go to school. Recently I was told by my mother that when N was playing with other children he was asked about his 'daddy' to which he replied: 'my daddy doesn't play with me'. This is concerning for me to hear and I can't help but feel guilty to some degree. However, I still feel that I've been wronged and at this stage it would be very difficult for me to reverse my decision. I have been firm about my decision all along and have no intention of validating C's disrespect for me by changing my mind now. I never wanted to have a child and she knew all along. She was being incredibly selfish, no matter how selfish I'm being now. \n\nBefore judging me I implore you to consider my perspective. I had no say in the matter and C deceived me (and everyone else) in order to fulfil her fantasy. This was extremely disrespectful and hurtful to me, I wasn't ready to have a child and I'm still not. AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for breaking up with his pregnant girlfriend. The situation is pretty complex, so I need to consider multiple angles.\n\nFirst, the author and his girlfriend, C, were in a high school relationship. C had a tough childhood, mental health issues (bipolar disorder), and a strong Catholic background. She wanted to get married and have a family, but the author wasn't interested in marriage. They were sexually active without using condoms, and C was on birth control. Then she got diagnosed with PCOS, which made her fear infertility, so she got pregnant despite the author's wishes. The author wanted an abortion, but she went through with the pregnancy after a \"miracle\" with her cat. The author broke up with her, refuses to have contact with the child, pays child support, but feels judged for it.\n\nNow, considering the ethical aspects. The key points here are consent, mental health, deception, and responsibility. The author didn't want children and didn't agree to the pregnancy. However, C deceived him by hiding the pregnancy. But once pregnant, does the father have any responsibility? Legally, he's paying child support, which is required, but emotionally and ethically, it's a different matter.\n\nThe author's stance is that C was selfish for getting pregnant without considering his wishes. But he also didn't use protection, so maybe he's partially responsible. C's mental health issues might have influenced her decisions. She had a history of erratic behavior due to bipolar disorder, which could affect her judgment. However, she's also an adult who made choices, even if her mental health was a factor.\n\nThe author's refusal to engage with the child is a big issue. While he didn't want a child, once a child exists, the father's responsibility is a societal expectation. The child's well-being is a factor here. The child is now 5 and is expressing feelings about his father not playing with him, which is hurting the child. The author's guilt is there, but he's stuck on his decision not to validate what he sees as C's disrespect.\n\nOn the other hand, the author was pressured into an ultimatum by C, leading to the abortion that almost happened but was prevented by the cat incident. The author felt forced into a situation where he had to choose between the child or the relationship. Now, he's maintaining his decision but is causing emotional harm to the child.\n\nLegally, he's fulfilling his financial obligations, but ethically, he's avoiding emotional and parental duties. The question is whether he's in the wrong. While C's actions were manipulative, the father's refusal to be part of his child's life could be seen as neglectful. Even if he didn't want the child, once the child exists, there's an argument that he has a responsibility to be present. However, the initial deception by C complicates things.\n\nIn many cultures, the expectation is that a father, even if not the mother, should be involved. The author's stance is causing harm to the child, which is a strong point against him. The guilt he feels suggests he knows this, but he's prioritizing his past grievances over the child's needs now. \n\nSo, considering all this, the author's actions are ethically questionable. He's not in the wrong in terms of not wanting a child initially, but after the child's birth, his refusal to engage is harmful. Therefore, the answer would be A (the author is in the wrong).\n"
