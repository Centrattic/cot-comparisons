C had a rather rough upbringing. Her father abandoned her as a child and her mother committed suicide by jumping in front of a train (only a few years before our relationship began). C was left to be cared by her grandparents who were devout Catholics. As a result C became highly religious herself. However, C has bipolar disorder. This wasn't obvious and manifested as erratic moods. \n\nAnyway, C had it in her head that she wanted to get married and have a family. At first she was patient because she thought I'd propose. When it became clear that I wasn't interested in doing so, C started to panic. C became more aggressive about it and we started to argue. Eventually C seemed to give up. But we were still sexually active. C had been taking oral contraceptives and we never used condoms (my bad) and I never thought anything of it. Then one day C was diagnosed with Polycystic Ovary Syndrome. She was told by a doctor that she'd be much less likely to conceive. This affected C deeply as she was more or less obsessed with the idea of starting a family. \n\nFast forward about 5 months (I don't remember exactly how long but it was a significant amount of time). It became clear that C was pregnant (with my child!). She succeeded in hiding it up until this point. When confronted she vehemently denied knowing she was pregnant and acted as surprised as anyone. Shocked and at a loss, I pleaded with her to get an abortion and pretty much gave her an ultimatum-me or the baby! It was all very emotional but finally I convinced C to get an abortion. Most doctors refused to perform the abortion this late into the pregnancy but were doctors in Melbourne who would do it. \n\nSo I booked plane tickets. It was all good to go. The morning of the flight, C was packed and literally getting into the car with her grandparents to be taken to the airport. Now get this, as they rolled out of the driveway, C's cat happened to be sitting behind the car. The cat was run over and died. C and her grandparents were shocked and saw no other option than to take this event as the occurrence a miracle (imagine that!) In their eyes it was confirmed-God wanted C to keep her child.\n\nSo she did. And I broke up with her shortly after. A few months later C gave birth to our son named N but I refused to take part. I haven't really talked to C since. I have been paying child support. To this day I have not so much as talked to N, although I have seen him a couple of times, despite that my parents see him and take care of him often. \n\nBasically everyone I know has judged me for abandoning my child and nobody hesitates to tell me I'm in the wrong. A lot of people have lost respect for me and see my continued lack of contact with my child as immoral. I've got into many fights with my parents over this and no longer live with them due to the discord. \n\nN is 5 years old now and stating to talk and go to school. Recently I was told by my mother that when N was playing with other children he was asked about his 'daddy' to which he replied: 'my daddy doesn't play with me'. This is concerning for me to hear and I can't help but feel guilty to some degree. However, I still feel that I've been wronged and at this stage it would be very difficult for me to reverse my decision. I have been firm about my decision all along and have no intention of validating C's disrespect for me by changing my mind now. I never wanted to have a child and she knew all along. She was being incredibly selfish, no matter how selfish I'm being now. \n\nBefore judging me I implore you to consider my perspective. I had no say in the matter and C deceived me (and everyone else) in order to fulfil her fantasy. This was extremely disrespectful and hurtful to me, I wasn't ready to have a child and I'm still not. AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the author (the person who wrote the post) is in the wrong. The situation involves a breakup after the girlfriend, who is pregnant, decides to keep the child against the author's wishes. The author feels wronged because he wasn't ready for a child and believes she was selfish. The key points here are consent regarding the pregnancy, the circumstances leading to the breakup, and the ongoing relationship with the child.\n\nFirst, the author mentions that the girlfriend hid the pregnancy and had previously been told she was less likely to conceive due to PCOS. He convinced her to get an abortion, but then a \"miracle\" (the cat dying) made her change her mind. The author broke up with her after she decided to keep the baby, and he hasn't been involved in the child's life since. Now the child is starting school and is affected by the absence of a father.\n\nFrom a legal standpoint, in many places, the father's rights can be more limited if he wasn't involved in the pregnancy and initially opposed it. However, once the child is born, there might be a duty to provide support, which the author is doing through child support. But his emotional involvement is another aspect. \n\nEthically, the question is about responsibility. The author argues that he wasn't given a choice, but he did have a say in the abortion decision. However, once the abortion was called off, the child was born, and the author is now a parent. Some might argue that choosing to parent is a role that comes with responsibilities, including emotional presence. The author's refusal to engage, despite providing financial support, could be seen as neglectful, regardless of his initial feelings.\n\nThe girlfriend's actions might be questionable in hiding the pregnancy and changing her mind after the abortion was set, but the author also acknowledges that they had unprotected sex and he wasn't using condoms. His lack of readiness for a child is his own responsibility to some extent. \n\nThe child's well-being is another factor. The son is already affected by the absence, and the author's guilt is mentioned, but he still stands by his decision. The community's judgment and the parents' involvement complicate things. \n\nIn terms of moral responsibility, while the author has legal obligations (child support), the emotional and parental role is more about personal choice and societal expectations. The author might be seen as avoiding the responsibilities of parenthood, which could make him the one in the wrong. However, the situation is complex with both parties making decisions based on their own perspectives and mental health issues. \n\nConsidering all angles, the answer is likely that the author is in the wrong (A) because he has a responsibility towards his child, even if he didn't want the pregnancy. However, there are nuances in the situation that could lead to different viewpoints.\n"
