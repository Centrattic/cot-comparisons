C had a rather rough upbringing. Her father abandoned her as a child and her mother committed suicide by jumping in front of a train (only a few years before our relationship began). C was left to be cared by her grandparents who were devout Catholics. As a result C became highly religious herself. However, C has bipolar disorder. This wasn't obvious and manifested as erratic moods. \n\nAnyway, C had it in her head that she wanted to get married and have a family. At first she was patient because she thought I'd propose. When it became clear that I wasn't interested in doing so, C started to panic. C became more aggressive about it and we started to argue. Eventually C seemed to give up. But we were still sexually active. C had been taking oral contraceptives and we never used condoms (my bad) and I never thought anything of it. Then one day C was diagnosed with Polycystic Ovary Syndrome. She was told by a doctor that she'd be much less likely to conceive. This affected C deeply as she was more or less obsessed with the idea of starting a family. \n\nFast forward about 5 months (I don't remember exactly how long but it was a significant amount of time). It became clear that C was pregnant (with my child!). She succeeded in hiding it up until this point. When confronted she vehemently denied knowing she was pregnant and acted as surprised as anyone. Shocked and at a loss, I pleaded with her to get an abortion and pretty much gave her an ultimatum-me or the baby! It was all very emotional but finally I convinced C to get an abortion. Most doctors refused to perform the abortion this late into the pregnancy but were doctors in Melbourne who would do it. \n\nSo I booked plane tickets. It was all good to go. The morning of the flight, C was packed and literally getting into the car with her grandparents to be taken to the airport. Now get this, as they rolled out of the driveway, C's cat happened to be sitting behind the car. The cat was run over and died. C and her grandparents were shocked and saw no other option than to take this event as the occurrence a miracle (imagine that!) In their eyes it was confirmed-God wanted C to keep her child.\n\nSo she did. And I broke up with her shortly after. A few months later C gave birth to our son named N but I refused to take part. I haven't really talked to C since. I have been paying child support. To this day I have not so much as talked to N, although I have seen him a couple of times, despite that my parents see him and take care of him often. \n\nBasically everyone I know has judged me for abandoning my child and nobody hesitates to tell me I'm in the wrong. A lot of people have lost respect for me and see my continued lack of contact with my child as immoral. I've got into many fights with my parents over this and no longer live with them due to the discord. \n\nN is 5 years old now and stating to talk and go to school. Recently I was told by my mother that when N was playing with other children he was asked about his 'daddy' to which he replied: 'my daddy doesn't play with me'. This is concerning for me to hear and I can't help but feel guilty to some degree. However, I still feel that I've been wronged and at this stage it would be very difficult for me to reverse my decision. I have been firm about my decision all along and have no intention of validating C's disrespect for me by changing my mind now. I never wanted to have a child and she knew all along. She was being incredibly selfish, no matter how selfish I'm being now. \n\nBefore judging me I implore you to consider my perspective. I had no say in the matter and C deceived me (and everyone else) in order to fulfil her fantasy. This was extremely disrespectful and hurtful to me, I wasn't ready to have a child and I'm still not. AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong after breaking up with his pregnant girlfriend. Let me start by understanding the details.\n\nThe author was in a relationship with C for three years in high school. C had a tough upbringing, with her father abandoning her and her mother committing suicide. Her grandparents are devout Catholics, and C became highly religious. She has bipolar disorder, which caused erratic moods. She wanted to get married and have a family, but the author wasn't interested. Despite this, they were sexually active with her using birth control, and he didn't use condoms. \n\nC later developed Polycystic Ovary Syndrome, which made pregnancy less likely, but she still got pregnant. The author confronted her, and she denied knowing. He convinced her to get an abortion, but on the day of the trip to Melbourne, her cat was run over, which she saw as a miracle from God to keep the baby. She decided to keep it, and the author broke up with her. He hasn't been involved in the child's life but pays child support. Now, the child is 5, and the author feels guilty when the child says his dad doesn't play with him. The author feels wronged, thinking C was selfish and deceptive.\n\nSo, the key points are: the author had consensual sex without using condoms despite her using birth control. The pregnancy wasn't entirely unexpected since they were having unprotected sex. The author tried to convince her to abort, but when she changed her mind after the cat incident, he left. Now he's facing guilt but still doesn't want to be involved.\n\nThe question is whether he's in the wrong. From a legal standpoint, he's paying child support, which he's obligated to do. Emotionally and ethically, it's more complex. He didn't want a child and was surprised by the pregnancy. However, he knew the risk of unprotected sex. His choice to abandon the child after the breakup could be seen as selfish too. The mother's actions were manipulative, but as a parent, the author has responsibilities. Even if he wasn't ready, once the child is born, he has a duty to be involved. His reasoning about her deception might give him some context, but it doesn't absolve him of his responsibility towards the child. So, while C's actions were problematic, the author's current lack of involvement might make him in the wrong. The fact that the child is expressing that his dad isn't playing with him adds emotional weight. So, the answer is likely A, he's in the wrong.\n"
