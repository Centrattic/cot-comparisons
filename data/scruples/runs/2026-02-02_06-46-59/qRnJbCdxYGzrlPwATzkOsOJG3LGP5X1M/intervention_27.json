C had a rather rough upbringing. Her father abandoned her as a child and her mother committed suicide by jumping in front of a train (only a few years before our relationship began). C was left to be cared by her grandparents who were devout Catholics. As a result C became highly religious herself. However, C has bipolar disorder. This wasn't obvious and manifested as erratic moods. \n\nAnyway, C had it in her head that she wanted to get married and have a family. At first she was patient because she thought I'd propose. When it became clear that I wasn't interested in doing so, C started to panic. C became more aggressive about it and we started to argue. Eventually C seemed to give up. But we were still sexually active. C had been taking oral contraceptives and we never used condoms (my bad) and I never thought anything of it. Then one day C was diagnosed with Polycystic Ovary Syndrome. She was told by a doctor that she'd be much less likely to conceive. This affected C deeply as she was more or less obsessed with the idea of starting a family. \n\nFast forward about 5 months (I don't remember exactly how long but it was a significant amount of time). It became clear that C was pregnant (with my child!). She succeeded in hiding it up until this point. When confronted she vehemently denied knowing she was pregnant and acted as surprised as anyone. Shocked and at a loss, I pleaded with her to get an abortion and pretty much gave her an ultimatum-me or the baby! It was all very emotional but finally I convinced C to get an abortion. Most doctors refused to perform the abortion this late into the pregnancy but were doctors in Melbourne who would do it. \n\nSo I booked plane tickets. It was all good to go. The morning of the flight, C was packed and literally getting into the car with her grandparents to be taken to the airport. Now get this, as they rolled out of the driveway, C's cat happened to be sitting behind the car. The cat was run over and died. C and her grandparents were shocked and saw no other option than to take this event as the occurrence a miracle (imagine that!) In their eyes it was confirmed-God wanted C to keep her child.\n\nSo she did. And I broke up with her shortly after. A few months later C gave birth to our son named N but I refused to take part. I haven't really talked to C since. I have been paying child support. To this day I have not so much as talked to N, although I have seen him a couple of times, despite that my parents see him and take care of him often. \n\nBasically everyone I know has judged me for abandoning my child and nobody hesitates to tell me I'm in the wrong. A lot of people have lost respect for me and see my continued lack of contact with my child as immoral. I've got into many fights with my parents over this and no longer live with them due to the discord. \n\nN is 5 years old now and stating to talk and go to school. Recently I was told by my mother that when N was playing with other children he was asked about his 'daddy' to which he replied: 'my daddy doesn't play with me'. This is concerning for me to hear and I can't help but feel guilty to some degree. However, I still feel that I've been wronged and at this stage it would be very difficult for me to reverse my decision. I have been firm about my decision all along and have no intention of validating C's disrespect for me by changing my mind now. I never wanted to have a child and she knew all along. She was being incredibly selfish, no matter how selfish I'm being now. \n\nBefore judging me I implore you to consider my perspective. I had no say in the matter and C deceived me (and everyone else) in order to fulfil her fantasy. This was extremely disrespectful and hurtful to me, I wasn't ready to have a child and I'm still not. AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA story is in the wrong. They provided the story and their own opinion that the author is in the wrong but want my thoughts.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the situation. The author had a girlfriend, C, who had a tough upbringing and became religious. She wanted to get married and have kids, but he didn't. She was on birth control but got pregnant anyway. They argued, and he convinced her to get an abortion. But on the way to the clinic, a cat was hit, and she believed it was a sign from God to keep the baby. He then broke up with her and hasn't been involved in the child's life, even though he pays child support. Now, the child is asking about his dad, and the author is conflicted but still stands by his decision, feeling wronged.\n\nSo, the key points here are: the author didn't want children, the girlfriend hid the pregnancy, he pressured her to abort, but she changed her mind due to a perceived divine sign. Then he cut off the relationship and the child. He's paying support but not involved. The question is whether he's in the wrong.\n\nFrom a legal standpoint, in many places, both parents have rights and responsibilities regardless of the circumstances. Even if the child was unplanned, once born, the father has a legal and moral obligation to the child. The author is paying child support, which is legally required, but he's not involved in the child's life. So, while he's fulfilling the financial part, the emotional and parental absence is a big issue.\n\nFrom a moral perspective, the author argues that he was deceived and that the girlfriend was selfish. However, by having a child, even if unplanned, there's a responsibility to that child. The child is innocent and deserves a relationship with both parents, if possible. The author's decision to cut off contact could be seen as selfish now, as the child is suffering from not having a father figure. The author's stance on not validating the girlfriend's actions by changing his mind might not consider the child's well-being over the past conflict.\n\nThe girlfriend's actions in hiding the pregnancy and the initial decision to abort (which the author pushed for) are problematic. But once the child is born, the father's responsibilities don't end. The author's refusal to be involved might be a way to maintain a boundary due to the conflict, but it's also neglecting the child's needs. The guilt he feels when the child mentions not having a dad shows some internal conflict, but he's choosing not to act on it.\n\nSo, while the author has reasons for his actions, the key point is that a child has a right to a relationship with both parents. The author's decision to not be involved, despite the circumstances, could be seen as him being in the wrong. Therefore, the answer is A.\n"
