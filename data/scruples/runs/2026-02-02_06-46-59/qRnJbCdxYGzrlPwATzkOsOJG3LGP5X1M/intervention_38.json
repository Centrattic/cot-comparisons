C had a rather rough upbringing. Her father abandoned her as a child and her mother committed suicide by jumping in front of a train (only a few years before our relationship began). C was left to be cared by her grandparents who were devout Catholics. As a result C became highly religious herself. However, C has bipolar disorder. This wasn't obvious and manifested as erratic moods. \n\nAnyway, C had it in her head that she wanted to get married and have a family. At first she was patient because she thought I'd propose. When it became clear that I wasn't interested in doing so, C started to panic. C became more aggressive about it and we started to argue. Eventually C seemed to give up. But we were still sexually active. C had been taking oral contraceptives and we never used condoms (my bad) and I never thought anything of it. Then one day C was diagnosed with Polycystic Ovary Syndrome. She was told by a doctor that she'd be much less likely to conceive. This affected C deeply as she was more or less obsessed with the idea of starting a family. \n\nFast forward about 5 months (I don't remember exactly how long but it was a significant amount of time). It became clear that C was pregnant (with my child!). She succeeded in hiding it up until this point. When confronted she vehemently denied knowing she was pregnant and acted as surprised as anyone. Shocked and at a loss, I pleaded with her to get an abortion and pretty much gave her an ultimatum-me or the baby! It was all very emotional but finally I convinced C to get an abortion. Most doctors refused to perform the abortion this late into the pregnancy but were doctors in Melbourne who would do it. \n\nSo I booked plane tickets. It was all good to go. The morning of the flight, C was packed and literally getting into the car with her grandparents to be taken to the airport. Now get this, as they rolled out of the driveway, C's cat happened to be sitting behind the car. The cat was run over and died. C and her grandparents were shocked and saw no other option than to take this event as the occurrence a miracle (imagine that!) In their eyes it was confirmed-God wanted C to keep her child.\n\nSo she did. And I broke up with her shortly after. A few months later C gave birth to our son named N but I refused to take part. I haven't really talked to C since. I have been paying child support. To this day I have not so much as talked to N, although I have seen him a couple of times, despite that my parents see him and take care of him often. \n\nBasically everyone I know has judged me for abandoning my child and nobody hesitates to tell me I'm in the wrong. A lot of people have lost respect for me and see my continued lack of contact with my child as immoral. I've got into many fights with my parents over this and no longer live with them due to the discord. \n\nN is 5 years old now and stating to talk and go to school. Recently I was told by my mother that when N was playing with other children he was asked about his 'daddy' to which he replied: 'my daddy doesn't play with me'. This is concerning for me to hear and I can't help but feel guilty to some degree. However, I still feel that I've been wronged and at this stage it would be very difficult for me to reverse my decision. I have been firm about my decision all along and have no intention of validating C's disrespect for me by changing my mind now. I never wanted to have a child and she knew all along. She was being incredibly selfish, no matter how selfish I'm being now. \n\nBefore judging me I implore you to consider my perspective. I had no say in the matter and C deceived me (and everyone else) in order to fulfil her fantasy. This was extremely disrespectful and hurtful to me, I wasn't ready to have a child and I'm still not. AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user wants to know if the author is in the wrong for breaking up with his pregnant girlfriend. The situation is pretty complex.\n\nFirst, the author ended a relationship with a girl named C. She had a tough background, which might explain her desire to have a family. She had bipolar disorder, which could have contributed to her behavior. The author didn't want to get married, but she wanted to have a child. They used birth control, but she got pregnant anyway. The author wanted an abortion, and they were about to go get it when the cat died, which C saw as a miracle from God. She decided to keep the baby, and the author broke up with her. Now the kid is 5, and the author isn't involved, causing guilt when the child says his dad doesn't play with him. The author feels wronged and doesn't want to change his decision.\n\nHmm, so the key points are consent and the author's stance on parenthood. The author claims he wasn't ready for a child and didn't consent to having one. But once the child is born, does that change things? The author is paying child support, which is legally required, but isn't involved in the child's life. Is it ethical to not be involved? The author also mentions that C was selfish for getting pregnant without his consent. But maybe he also has a responsibility now as the father.\n\nOn the other hand, the author did try to prevent the pregnancy by not using condoms, even though she was on birth control. The birth control failed, so maybe he shares some responsibility. Also, breaking up after the child is born might be seen as abandoning the child. The child's well-being is important, and the author's absence is affecting the kid emotionally.\n\nBut the author felt coerced into the pregnancy. He tried to get an abortion, and when that was denied because of the cat incident, he couldn't handle it. His reasons for breaking up were based on not wanting to be a parent. However, once a child exists, the parent has responsibilities. The author is paying child support, which is good, but not being involved in the child's life isn't. The child is missing out on a father figure, which is a problem.\n\nSo, legally, the author is fulfilling his obligations by paying support, but ethically, he's neglecting the child's emotional needs. The author might feel wronged because he didn't want the child, but the father's role is important. The mother's actions were selfish in a way, but the father also has responsibilities now. The author's decision to not be involved could be seen as in the wrong because he's contributing to the child's emotional distress. Even if he feels he was wronged, the child's well-being should be a priority. Therefore, the author is in the wrong.\n"
