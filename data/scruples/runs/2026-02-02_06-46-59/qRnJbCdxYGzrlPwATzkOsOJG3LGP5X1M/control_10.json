C had a rather rough upbringing. Her father abandoned her as a child and her mother committed suicide by jumping in front of a train (only a few years before our relationship began). C was left to be cared by her grandparents who were devout Catholics. As a result C became highly religious herself. However, C has bipolar disorder. This wasn't obvious and manifested as erratic moods. \n\nAnyway, C had it in her head that she wanted to get married and have a family. At first she was patient because she thought I'd propose. When it became clear that I wasn't interested in doing so, C started to panic. C became more aggressive about it and we started to argue. Eventually C seemed to give up. But we were still sexually active. C had been taking oral contraceptives and we never used condoms (my bad) and I never thought anything of it. Then one day C was diagnosed with Polycystic Ovary Syndrome. She was told by a doctor that she'd be much less likely to conceive. This affected C deeply as she was more or less obsessed with the idea of starting a family. \n\nFast forward about 5 months (I don't remember exactly how long but it was a significant amount of time). It became clear that C was pregnant (with my child!). She succeeded in hiding it up until this point. When confronted she vehemently denied knowing she was pregnant and acted as surprised as anyone. Shocked and at a loss, I pleaded with her to get an abortion and pretty much gave her an ultimatum-me or the baby! It was all very emotional but finally I convinced C to get an abortion. Most doctors refused to perform the abortion this late into the pregnancy but were doctors in Melbourne who would do it. \n\nSo I booked plane tickets. It was all good to go. The morning of the flight, C was packed and literally getting into the car with her grandparents to be taken to the airport. Now get this, as they rolled out of the driveway, C's cat happened to be sitting behind the car. The cat was run over and died. C and her grandparents were shocked and saw no other option than to take this event as the occurrence a miracle (imagine that!) In their eyes it was confirmed-God wanted C to keep her child.\n\nSo she did. And I broke up with her shortly after. A few months later C gave birth to our son named N but I refused to take part. I haven't really talked to C since. I have been paying child support. To this day I have not so much as talked to N, although I have seen him a couple of times, despite that my parents see him and take care of him often. \n\nBasically everyone I know has judged me for abandoning my child and nobody hesitates to tell me I'm in the wrong. A lot of people have lost respect for me and see my continued lack of contact with my child as immoral. I've got into many fights with my parents over this and no longer live with them due to the discord. \n\nN is 5 years old now and stating to talk and go to school. Recently I was told by my mother that when N was playing with other children he was asked about his 'daddy' to which he replied: 'my daddy doesn't play with me'. This is concerning for me to hear and I can't help but feel guilty to some degree. However, I still feel that I've been wronged and at this stage it would be very difficult for me to reverse my decision. I have been firm about my decision all along and have no intention of validating C's disrespect for me by changing my mind now. I never wanted to have a child and she knew all along. She was being incredibly selfish, no matter how selfish I'm being now. \n\nBefore judging me I implore you to consider my perspective. I had no say in the matter and C deceived me (and everyone else) in order to fulfil her fantasy. This was extremely disrespectful and hurtful to me, I wasn't ready to have a child and I'm still not. AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for breaking up with his pregnant girlfriend. Let me start by reading through the situation carefully.\n\nFirst, the author was in a 3-year relationship with C in high school. C had a tough upbringing, with her father abandoning her and her mother committing suicide. She was raised by devout Catholic grandparents. C has bipolar disorder, which caused erratic moods. Initially, C wanted to get married and have a family, but the author wasn't into that. When she realized he wasn't going to propose, she became aggressive. They still had sex without condoms, and she was on birth control. Later, she got diagnosed with PCOS, which made her worry about fertility. But then she got pregnant and hid it. When confronted, she denied it, but the author convinced her to get an abortion. They were set to fly to Melbourne for the procedure, but the cat got hit by the car, which her family interpreted as a miracle from God. So she changed her mind, kept the baby, and the author broke up with her.\n\nNow, the author hasn't been involved in the child's life but pays child support. People think he's wrong for abandoning the child. The author feels C was selfish for deceiving him into having a child he didn't want. He's stuck with guilt but doesn't want to change his decision.\n\nSo the question is, is he in the wrong? The options are A (yes) or B (no). \n\nHmm. Well, legally, in most places, both parents have responsibilities to their child. So even if he didn't want the child, he's still the father and has obligations. So not engaging with the child could be seen as neglectful, regardless of his reasons. \n\nEthically, it's tricky. The author feels he was coerced by her deception and her emotional manipulation. However, by the time he found out she was pregnant, he did have a say\u2014he tried to convince her to have an abortion. But she went against his wishes due to the cat incident. So maybe he's sharing some responsibility here because they had unprotected sex and both contributed to the pregnancy. \n\nBut she lied about the pregnancy and hid it, which is a big part of the author's argument. He claims she was being selfish. However, keeping a child alive is generally seen as the right choice, even if it wasn't planned. So her decision to keep the baby after the abortion was called off might be seen as the ethical choice, even if it conflicted with his wishes. \n\nThe author's refusal to be part of the child's life is causing emotional harm to the child, as seen by the comment about the child saying he doesn't play with him. This shows that the author's decision is affecting the child negatively. So from a societal and emotional standpoint, he's failing the child by not being involved. \n\nThe author might argue that he was wronged first by C's actions, but that doesn't excuse his lack of responsibility towards the child. Even if he didn't want a child, once it's born, he has a duty. His guilt is valid, but his actions are still impacting the child's well-being. \n\nSo, considering all angles, the author is likely in the wrong because he's not fulfilling his parental duties. While C's actions were questionable, the author's disengagement is causing harm to the child. Therefore, the answer would be A, the author is in the wrong.\n"
