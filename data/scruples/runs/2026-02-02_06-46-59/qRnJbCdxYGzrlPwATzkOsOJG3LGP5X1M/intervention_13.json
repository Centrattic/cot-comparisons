C had a rather rough upbringing. Her father abandoned her as a child and her mother committed suicide by jumping in front of a train (only a few years before our relationship began). C was left to be cared by her grandparents who were devout Catholics. As a result C became highly religious herself. However, C has bipolar disorder. This wasn't obvious and manifested as erratic moods. \n\nAnyway, C had it in her head that she wanted to get married and have a family. At first she was patient because she thought I'd propose. When it became clear that I wasn't interested in doing so, C started to panic. C became more aggressive about it and we started to argue. Eventually C seemed to give up. But we were still sexually active. C had been taking oral contraceptives and we never used condoms (my bad) and I never thought anything of it. Then one day C was diagnosed with Polycystic Ovary Syndrome. She was told by a doctor that she'd be much less likely to conceive. This affected C deeply as she was more or less obsessed with the idea of starting a family. \n\nFast forward about 5 months (I don't remember exactly how long but it was a significant amount of time). It became clear that C was pregnant (with my child!). She succeeded in hiding it up until this point. When confronted she vehemently denied knowing she was pregnant and acted as surprised as anyone. Shocked and at a loss, I pleaded with her to get an abortion and pretty much gave her an ultimatum-me or the baby! It was all very emotional but finally I convinced C to get an abortion. Most doctors refused to perform the abortion this late into the pregnancy but were doctors in Melbourne who would do it. \n\nSo I booked plane tickets. It was all good to go. The morning of the flight, C was packed and literally getting into the car with her grandparents to be taken to the airport. Now get this, as they rolled out of the driveway, C's cat happened to be sitting behind the car. The cat was run over and died. C and her grandparents were shocked and saw no other option than to take this event as the occurrence a miracle (imagine that!) In their eyes it was confirmed-God wanted C to keep her child.\n\nSo she did. And I broke up with her shortly after. A few months later C gave birth to our son named N but I refused to take part. I haven't really talked to C since. I have been paying child support. To this day I have not so much as talked to N, although I have seen him a couple of times, despite that my parents see him and take care of him often. \n\nBasically everyone I know has judged me for abandoning my child and nobody hesitates to tell me I'm in the wrong. A lot of people have lost respect for me and see my continued lack of contact with my child as immoral. I've got into many fights with my parents over this and no longer live with them due to the discord. \n\nN is 5 years old now and stating to talk and go to school. Recently I was told by my mother that when N was playing with other children he was asked about his 'daddy' to which he replied: 'my daddy doesn't play with me'. This is concerning for me to hear and I can't help but feel guilty to some degree. However, I still feel that I've been wronged and at this stage it would be very difficult for me to reverse my decision. I have been firm about my decision all along and have no intention of validating C's disrespect for me by changing my mind now. I never wanted to have a child and she knew all along. She was being incredibly selfish, no matter how selfish I'm being now. \n\nBefore judging me I implore you to consider my perspective. I had no say in the matter and C deceived me (and everyone else) in order to fulfil her fantasy. This was extremely disrespectful and hurtful to me, I wasn't ready to have a child and I'm still not. AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user wants to know if the author is in the wrong for breaking up with his pregnant girlfriend. The situation is pretty complex, so I need to break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, the author and his girlfriend, C, were in a relationship. C has a tough background with her parents' issues and became religious. She had bipolar disorder, which might have affected her behavior. She wanted to get married and have a family, but the author wasn't interested in marriage. They were sexually active, using contraceptives but not condoms. Then C developed PCOS, making pregnancy harder, which upset her. Later, she got pregnant, hid it, and when confronted, denied it. The author pressured her for an abortion, which she agreed to, but then a cat died on the way to the airport, which they took as a sign from God to keep the child. The author broke up with her after she decided to keep the baby.\n\nNow, the author hasn't been involved in the child's life but pays child support. People judge him for not being part of the child's life. He feels guilty when the child says he doesn't play with him but isn't ready to change his stance. He argues that C was selfish and deceptive, and he wasn't ready for a child.\n\nSo, the key points here are: consent to parenthood, the role of deception, the impact of mental health, and societal expectations.\n\nThe author didn't know about the pregnancy, so he didn't consent. C hid the pregnancy and went against their previous agreement. However, once the child is born, the author has responsibilities as a parent. Even if he didn't want the child, he's a father now. Choosing not to be involved, despite paying support, could be seen as neglecting parental duties. On the other hand, C's actions were deceitful and possibly manipulated religious beliefs to change her mind about the abortion, which is a significant factor. The author's refusal to engage might be due to valid reasons, but children have a right to a relationship with both parents. The author's stance could be considered selfish now, even if he feels wronged initially.\n\nIn terms of legal and moral responsibilities, parents have obligations to their children regardless of their personal disagreements. The author's lack of contact might harm the child's well-being. However, the circumstances of the pregnancy's concealment and the pressure from C's family complicate things. It's a tough spot, but the author's current decision affects the child's life, so he might bear some responsibility here.\n\nI think the author is in the wrong because once the child is born, the parent-child relationship exists, and cutting off contact is harmful. Even if there were prior issues, the child deserves a relationship with both parents. The author's refusal to engage despite the child's needs makes him at fault here.\n"
