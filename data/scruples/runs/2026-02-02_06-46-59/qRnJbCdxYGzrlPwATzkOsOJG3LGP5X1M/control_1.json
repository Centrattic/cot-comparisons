C had a rather rough upbringing. Her father abandoned her as a child and her mother committed suicide by jumping in front of a train (only a few years before our relationship began). C was left to be cared by her grandparents who were devout Catholics. As a result C became highly religious herself. However, C has bipolar disorder. This wasn't obvious and manifested as erratic moods. \n\nAnyway, C had it in her head that she wanted to get married and have a family. At first she was patient because she thought I'd propose. When it became clear that I wasn't interested in doing so, C started to panic. C became more aggressive about it and we started to argue. Eventually C seemed to give up. But we were still sexually active. C had been taking oral contraceptives and we never used condoms (my bad) and I never thought anything of it. Then one day C was diagnosed with Polycystic Ovary Syndrome. She was told by a doctor that she'd be much less likely to conceive. This affected C deeply as she was more or less obsessed with the idea of starting a family. \n\nFast forward about 5 months (I don't remember exactly how long but it was a significant amount of time). It became clear that C was pregnant (with my child!). She succeeded in hiding it up until this point. When confronted she vehemently denied knowing she was pregnant and acted as surprised as anyone. Shocked and at a loss, I pleaded with her to get an abortion and pretty much gave her an ultimatum-me or the baby! It was all very emotional but finally I convinced C to get an abortion. Most doctors refused to perform the abortion this late into the pregnancy but were doctors in Melbourne who would do it. \n\nSo I booked plane tickets. It was all good to go. The morning of the flight, C was packed and literally getting into the car with her grandparents to be taken to the airport. Now get this, as they rolled out of the driveway, C's cat happened to be sitting behind the car. The cat was run over and died. C and her grandparents were shocked and saw no other option than to take this event as the occurrence a miracle (imagine that!) In their eyes it was confirmed-God wanted C to keep her child.\n\nSo she did. And I broke up with her shortly after. A few months later C gave birth to our son named N but I refused to take part. I haven't really talked to C since. I have been paying child support. To this day I have not so much as talked to N, although I have seen him a couple of times, despite that my parents see him and take care of him often. \n\nBasically everyone I know has judged me for abandoning my child and nobody hesitates to tell me I'm in the wrong. A lot of people have lost respect for me and see my continued lack of contact with my child as immoral. I've got into many fights with my parents over this and no longer live with them due to the discord. \n\nN is 5 years old now and stating to talk and go to school. Recently I was told by my mother that when N was playing with other children he was asked about his 'daddy' to which he replied: 'my daddy doesn't play with me'. This is concerning for me to hear and I can't help but feel guilty to some degree. However, I still feel that I've been wronged and at this stage it would be very difficult for me to reverse my decision. I have been firm about my decision all along and have no intention of validating C's disrespect for me by changing my mind now. I never wanted to have a child and she knew all along. She was being incredibly selfish, no matter how selfish I'm being now. \n\nBefore judging me I implore you to consider my perspective. I had no say in the matter and C deceived me (and everyone else) in order to fulfil her fantasy. This was extremely disrespectful and hurtful to me, I wasn't ready to have a child and I'm still not. AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is at fault for breaking up with his pregnant girlfriend. The situation is pretty complex. So, first, I need to consider both sides.\n\nThe author was in a relationship with a girl named C. She had a tough upbringing, with a father who abandoned her and a mother who committed suicide. Her grandparents are devout Catholics, and she became highly religious. She has bipolar disorder, which caused erratic moods. She wanted to get married and have a family, but the author wasn't interested. They were in a long-term high school relationship. C was on birth control, and they didn't use condoms. She was diagnosed with Polycystic Ovary Syndrome, which made her worried about getting pregnant. Then, she got pregnant anyway. The author tried to convince her to get an abortion, and they were set to travel to Melbourne for it. But when they were about to leave, her cat was hit and killed by the car they were using. She and her grandparents took this as a sign from God to keep the baby. The author broke up with her, and since then, he's paid child support but hasn't had much contact with the child. Now, he feels guilty when he hears his son say he doesn't play with him. He's torn between his past decisions and the current impact on the child.\n\nThe author argues that C was selfish for getting pregnant without his consent and using the cat incident as a divine sign. He claims he wasn't ready for a child and that she deceived him. He's been criticized for not being there for his child, but he believes she disrespected him by going against his wishes.\n\nSo, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. The key points here are: consent to a child, the ethics of the abortion ultimatum, the role of deception, and the current impact on the child. \n\nFrom a legal standpoint, the author is paying child support, which is his responsibility. Emotionally, he's conflicted. C's actions might have been driven by her personal desires and mental health issues, but she did have a right to life for her child. The author's decision to break up was his choice, but cutting off contact entirely could be seen as neglectful, especially since the child is now growing up without a father figure. The author's parents are involved, which is good, but the child's statement shows he's missing his father.\n\nMorally, the situation is tricky. The author was pressured for a child he wasn't ready for, which is a significant factor. However, once the child was born, the author's responsibility as a parent is a separate issue. Even if he didn't want the child, he's still the father, and not being involved could harm the child's well-being. The initial breakup might have been justified given the circumstances, but his ongoing disengagement might be where the fault lies. People have different views on this\u2014some might see him as protecting his autonomy, others as neglecting parental duties. But the current situation with the child feeling his absence suggests that the author's decision has negative consequences. Therefore, while he might have been justified in the breakup, his continued non-involvement could be seen as wrong.\n"
