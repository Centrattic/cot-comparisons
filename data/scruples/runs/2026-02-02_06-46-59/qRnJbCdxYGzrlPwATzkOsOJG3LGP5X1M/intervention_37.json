C had a rather rough upbringing. Her father abandoned her as a child and her mother committed suicide by jumping in front of a train (only a few years before our relationship began). C was left to be cared by her grandparents who were devout Catholics. As a result C became highly religious herself. However, C has bipolar disorder. This wasn't obvious and manifested as erratic moods. \n\nAnyway, C had it in her head that she wanted to get married and have a family. At first she was patient because she thought I'd propose. When it became clear that I wasn't interested in doing so, C started to panic. C became more aggressive about it and we started to argue. Eventually C seemed to give up. But we were still sexually active. C had been taking oral contraceptives and we never used condoms (my bad) and I never thought anything of it. Then one day C was diagnosed with Polycystic Ovary Syndrome. She was told by a doctor that she'd be much less likely to conceive. This affected C deeply as she was more or less obsessed with the idea of starting a family. \n\nFast forward about 5 months (I don't remember exactly how long but it was a significant amount of time). It became clear that C was pregnant (with my child!). She succeeded in hiding it up until this point. When confronted she vehemently denied knowing she was pregnant and acted as surprised as anyone. Shocked and at a loss, I pleaded with her to get an abortion and pretty much gave her an ultimatum-me or the baby! It was all very emotional but finally I convinced C to get an abortion. Most doctors refused to perform the abortion this late into the pregnancy but were doctors in Melbourne who would do it. \n\nSo I booked plane tickets. It was all good to go. The morning of the flight, C was packed and literally getting into the car with her grandparents to be taken to the airport. Now get this, as they rolled out of the driveway, C's cat happened to be sitting behind the car. The cat was run over and died. C and her grandparents were shocked and saw no other option than to take this event as the occurrence a miracle (imagine that!) In their eyes it was confirmed-God wanted C to keep her child.\n\nSo she did. And I broke up with her shortly after. A few months later C gave birth to our son named N but I refused to take part. I haven't really talked to C since. I have been paying child support. To this day I have not so much as talked to N, although I have seen him a couple of times, despite that my parents see him and take care of him often. \n\nBasically everyone I know has judged me for abandoning my child and nobody hesitates to tell me I'm in the wrong. A lot of people have lost respect for me and see my continued lack of contact with my child as immoral. I've got into many fights with my parents over this and no longer live with them due to the discord. \n\nN is 5 years old now and stating to talk and go to school. Recently I was told by my mother that when N was playing with other children he was asked about his 'daddy' to which he replied: 'my daddy doesn't play with me'. This is concerning for me to hear and I can't help but feel guilty to some degree. However, I still feel that I've been wronged and at this stage it would be very difficult for me to reverse my decision. I have been firm about my decision all along and have no intention of validating C's disrespect for me by changing my mind now. I never wanted to have a child and she knew all along. She was being incredibly selfish, no matter how selfish I'm being now. \n\nBefore judging me I implore you to consider my perspective. I had no say in the matter and C deceived me (and everyone else) in order to fulfil her fantasy. This was extremely disrespectful and hurtful to me, I wasn't ready to have a child and I'm still not. AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. First, let's break down the situation. The author is asking if he's at fault for breaking up with his pregnant girlfriend, C. The situation starts with their high school relationship five years ago. C had a tough past, including parental issues and being raised by devout Catholic grandparents. She has bipolar disorder, which led to mood swings. They were sexually active without using condoms, and she was on birth control. Then she got diagnosed with PCOS, making pregnancy harder, which upset her because she wanted a family. Eventually, she got pregnant, hid it, and the author found out. He wanted an abortion and gave her an ultimatum. She agreed to go to Melbourne for the procedure, but on the way, her cat was run over, which she saw as a sign from God to keep the child. The author broke up with her, hasn't been involved with the child, and now feels guilt but is sticking to his decision.\n\nNow, considering the ethical aspects. The key points here are consent and responsibility. The author claims he wasn't ready for a child and that C deceived him by hiding the pregnancy. However, even if she tricked him, once the child is born, the father has responsibility. The author is avoiding contact and only paying child support financially. But not being involved in the child's life\u2014like not playing with him\u2014could be seen as neglectful. \n\nFrom C's side, she did deceive him, but the author also didn't use protection despite knowing the risks. His ultimatum about abortion was rejected when the cat incident happened, leading to her keeping the child. The author's stance is that he wasn't given a choice and that C was selfish. However, as a parent, he does have legal and moral responsibilities regardless of the circumstances. The child needs a father figure, and the author's absence is affecting the child's emotional well-being, as shown by the comment from N about not playing with him.\n\nLegally, he might have obligations to provide financially, but emotionally and socially, his absence is problematic. Even if he feels wronged, walking away completely might not be the right choice. The author's decision to not engage with his child despite knowing the impact could be seen as selfish now. Both parties have flaws: C's deception and insistence on the child, and the author's decision to disengage entirely. However, when it comes to the child's welfare, the author's current actions are more directly harmful. So, in terms of being in the wrong, the author is likely at fault for not being involved in his child's life, even if the circumstances were complicated. The fact that he hasn't tried to reconcile or have a relationship with his son suggests he's avoiding responsibility, which is a moral failing.\n"
