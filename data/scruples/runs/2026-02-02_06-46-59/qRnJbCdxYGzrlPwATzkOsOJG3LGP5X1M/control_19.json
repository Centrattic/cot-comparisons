C had a rather rough upbringing. Her father abandoned her as a child and her mother committed suicide by jumping in front of a train (only a few years before our relationship began). C was left to be cared by her grandparents who were devout Catholics. As a result C became highly religious herself. However, C has bipolar disorder. This wasn't obvious and manifested as erratic moods. \n\nAnyway, C had it in her head that she wanted to get married and have a family. At first she was patient because she thought I'd propose. When it became clear that I wasn't interested in doing so, C started to panic. C became more aggressive about it and we started to argue. Eventually C seemed to give up. But we were still sexually active. C had been taking oral contraceptives and we never used condoms (my bad) and I never thought anything of it. Then one day C was diagnosed with Polycystic Ovary Syndrome. She was told by a doctor that she'd be much less likely to conceive. This affected C deeply as she was more or less obsessed with the idea of starting a family. \n\nFast forward about 5 months (I don't remember exactly how long but it was a significant amount of time). It became clear that C was pregnant (with my child!). She succeeded in hiding it up until this point. When confronted she vehemently denied knowing she was pregnant and acted as surprised as anyone. Shocked and at a loss, I pleaded with her to get an abortion and pretty much gave her an ultimatum-me or the baby! It was all very emotional but finally I convinced C to get an abortion. Most doctors refused to perform the abortion this late into the pregnancy but were doctors in Melbourne who would do it. \n\nSo I booked plane tickets. It was all good to go. The morning of the flight, C was packed and literally getting into the car with her grandparents to be taken to the airport. Now get this, as they rolled out of the driveway, C's cat happened to be sitting behind the car. The cat was run over and died. C and her grandparents were shocked and saw no other option than to take this event as the occurrence a miracle (imagine that!) In their eyes it was confirmed-God wanted C to keep her child.\n\nSo she did. And I broke up with her shortly after. A few months later C gave birth to our son named N but I refused to take part. I haven't really talked to C since. I have been paying child support. To this day I have not so much as talked to N, although I have seen him a couple of times, despite that my parents see him and take care of him often. \n\nBasically everyone I know has judged me for abandoning my child and nobody hesitates to tell me I'm in the wrong. A lot of people have lost respect for me and see my continued lack of contact with my child as immoral. I've got into many fights with my parents over this and no longer live with them due to the discord. \n\nN is 5 years old now and stating to talk and go to school. Recently I was told by my mother that when N was playing with other children he was asked about his 'daddy' to which he replied: 'my daddy doesn't play with me'. This is concerning for me to hear and I can't help but feel guilty to some degree. However, I still feel that I've been wronged and at this stage it would be very difficult for me to reverse my decision. I have been firm about my decision all along and have no intention of validating C's disrespect for me by changing my mind now. I never wanted to have a child and she knew all along. She was being incredibly selfish, no matter how selfish I'm being now. \n\nBefore judging me I implore you to consider my perspective. I had no say in the matter and C deceived me (and everyone else) in order to fulfil her fantasy. This was extremely disrespectful and hurtful to me, I wasn't ready to have a child and I'm still not. AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the person who wrote this is in the wrong. Let's start by reading through the situation carefully. \n\nThe author is a guy who broke up with his pregnant girlfriend, C. They were in a high school relationship, and C had a rough upbringing with her father abandoning her and her mother committing suicide. She was raised by devout Catholic grandparents, which influenced her religious views. She has bipolar disorder, which caused erratic moods. The main issue here is that C wanted to get married and have a family, but the author wasn't interested in marriage. Despite that, they had a long-term relationship and were sexually active with contraception, but she got pregnant. The author found out she was hiding the pregnancy, and he tried to convince her to get an abortion, which they did plan to go through with. But then on the day of the abortion, her cat got hit by the car, and she and her family saw it as a sign from God to keep the baby. The author broke up with her after she decided to keep the child and hasn't been involved in the child's life since, only paying child support. Now the child is 5, and the author feels guilty when he hears the child say that his dad doesn't play with him. He feels wronged because he wasn't ready for a child and believes C was selfish, but he's also conflicted.\n\nSo the question is, is the author in the wrong? The options are A (yes) or B (no). \n\nFirst, let's consider the legal and ethical aspects. In many places, a parent has the right to make decisions about their own body, including continuing a pregnancy. The author wanted an abortion, but C decided not to go through with it after the \"miracle\" with the cat. At that point, the pregnancy was no longer his decision to terminate. So legally, C had the right to continue the pregnancy. \n\nEthically, the author's position is that he wasn't ready for a child and felt deceived because C hid the pregnancy. However, the author also admitted that they didn't use condoms and he was aware of her taking birth control, which failed. So he was aware of the possibility of pregnancy but didn't take full precautions. \n\nBreaking up with her after she decided to keep the child is a personal decision, but choosing not to be involved in the child's life beyond paying child support is where the conflict arises. Child support is a legal obligation in many cases, and not having contact is a personal choice. However, from a societal and ethical standpoint, some might argue that the author has a responsibility to maintain a relationship with his child, regardless of the circumstances of the child's birth. \n\nOn the other hand, the author feels that C was being selfish by pursuing pregnancy against his wishes, and that he wasn't given a choice. He also mentions that she deceived him by hiding the pregnancy. However, C had the right to make decisions about her own body and future. \n\nThe author's decision to cut off contact could be seen as selfish as well. The child is growing up without a father figure, and the author is aware of the child's feelings. The fact that the child says \"my daddy doesn't play with me\" suggests that the author's absence is affecting the child's well-being. \n\nIt's possible that both parties have valid points. The author wasn't ready for a child and felt pressured by C's desires, but once the pregnancy continued without his consent, his obligations as a parent might be seen as necessary. However, the situation is complex, and societal views may vary. Some might side with the author because he wasn't given a choice, while others would argue that becoming a parent is a responsibility he must accept regardless of the circumstances. \n\nGiven that the author has not reengaged with the child despite the child's growing need for a father figure, many would consider this a failure to fulfill a parental duty. Therefore, the author might be seen as in the wrong for not maintaining contact and involvement, even though the initial decision to have the child was against his wishes. The key point is that once a child is born, the parent's responsibilities extend beyond just financial support.\n"
