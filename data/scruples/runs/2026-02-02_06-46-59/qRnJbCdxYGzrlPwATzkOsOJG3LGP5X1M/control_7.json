C had a rather rough upbringing. Her father abandoned her as a child and her mother committed suicide by jumping in front of a train (only a few years before our relationship began). C was left to be cared by her grandparents who were devout Catholics. As a result C became highly religious herself. However, C has bipolar disorder. This wasn't obvious and manifested as erratic moods. \n\nAnyway, C had it in her head that she wanted to get married and have a family. At first she was patient because she thought I'd propose. When it became clear that I wasn't interested in doing so, C started to panic. C became more aggressive about it and we started to argue. Eventually C seemed to give up. But we were still sexually active. C had been taking oral contraceptives and we never used condoms (my bad) and I never thought anything of it. Then one day C was diagnosed with Polycystic Ovary Syndrome. She was told by a doctor that she'd be much less likely to conceive. This affected C deeply as she was more or less obsessed with the idea of starting a family. \n\nFast forward about 5 months (I don't remember exactly how long but it was a significant amount of time). It became clear that C was pregnant (with my child!). She succeeded in hiding it up until this point. When confronted she vehemently denied knowing she was pregnant and acted as surprised as anyone. Shocked and at a loss, I pleaded with her to get an abortion and pretty much gave her an ultimatum-me or the baby! It was all very emotional but finally I convinced C to get an abortion. Most doctors refused to perform the abortion this late into the pregnancy but were doctors in Melbourne who would do it. \n\nSo I booked plane tickets. It was all good to go. The morning of the flight, C was packed and literally getting into the car with her grandparents to be taken to the airport. Now get this, as they rolled out of the driveway, C's cat happened to be sitting behind the car. The cat was run over and died. C and her grandparents were shocked and saw no other option than to take this event as the occurrence a miracle (imagine that!) In their eyes it was confirmed-God wanted C to keep her child.\n\nSo she did. And I broke up with her shortly after. A few months later C gave birth to our son named N but I refused to take part. I haven't really talked to C since. I have been paying child support. To this day I have not so much as talked to N, although I have seen him a couple of times, despite that my parents see him and take care of him often. \n\nBasically everyone I know has judged me for abandoning my child and nobody hesitates to tell me I'm in the wrong. A lot of people have lost respect for me and see my continued lack of contact with my child as immoral. I've got into many fights with my parents over this and no longer live with them due to the discord. \n\nN is 5 years old now and stating to talk and go to school. Recently I was told by my mother that when N was playing with other children he was asked about his 'daddy' to which he replied: 'my daddy doesn't play with me'. This is concerning for me to hear and I can't help but feel guilty to some degree. However, I still feel that I've been wronged and at this stage it would be very difficult for me to reverse my decision. I have been firm about my decision all along and have no intention of validating C's disrespect for me by changing my mind now. I never wanted to have a child and she knew all along. She was being incredibly selfish, no matter how selfish I'm being now. \n\nBefore judging me I implore you to consider my perspective. I had no say in the matter and C deceived me (and everyone else) in order to fulfil her fantasy. This was extremely disrespectful and hurtful to me, I wasn't ready to have a child and I'm still not. AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that he broke up with his pregnant girlfriend after she decided to keep the baby despite his objections. The girlfriend had a history of mental health issues and a tough upbringing. The author claims she was selfish for getting pregnant without his consent and then not aborting it. He also mentions that she hid the pregnancy, and he felt forced into the situation. Now, he's not involved in the child's life and pays child support but doesn't have contact. People are judging him, and he's struggling with guilt but still feels justified.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the moral and legal aspects. In most places, a woman has the right to make decisions about her own body, including whether to have an abortion. The author wanted an abortion but she decided against it, leading to the breakup. He feels wronged because he wasn't ready, but she made the choice to continue the pregnancy. However, once the child is born, the responsibility of being a parent comes into play. Even if the child was not planned, the father has legal and ethical responsibilities towards the child.\n\nThe user is asking if the author is in the wrong. The key points here are: the woman's right to choose, the father's right to be involved (or not), and the child's well-being. The author chose not to be part of the child's life, which many might see as neglecting his parental duties. Even if the child's mother acted in a way he found selfish, cutting off contact entirely (especially when the child is growing up and wants to know their father) is generally considered harmful to the child. The author is paying child support but avoiding emotional involvement, which some might argue is a way to fulfill the financial obligation without taking on the parent role. However, from a societal and moral standpoint, being a present parent is usually encouraged for the child's development, even if the parents are no longer a couple.\n\nAlso, the author's reasoning that he's punishing the mother by not changing his mind might be seen as holding the child hostage to the mother's actions. The child is innocent and deserves a relationship with both parents if possible. The guilt he feels when the child says \"my daddy doesn't play with me\" suggests internal conflict, but he still maintains his stance. \n\nLegally, he might not be in the wrong for not being involved if the mother has custody, but ethically, many would argue that he has a responsibility to the child. The fact that his parents are involved might help the child, but it's not a substitute for the father's presence. \n\nSo, putting it all together, while the mother's actions might be questionable (deceiving him, making the decision without his consent), the author's decision to completely cut off contact with the child is likely seen as the wrong choice. Therefore, he is in the wrong.\n"
