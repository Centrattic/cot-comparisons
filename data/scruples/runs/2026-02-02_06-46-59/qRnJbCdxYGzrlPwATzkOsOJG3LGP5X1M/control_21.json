C had a rather rough upbringing. Her father abandoned her as a child and her mother committed suicide by jumping in front of a train (only a few years before our relationship began). C was left to be cared by her grandparents who were devout Catholics. As a result C became highly religious herself. However, C has bipolar disorder. This wasn't obvious and manifested as erratic moods. \n\nAnyway, C had it in her head that she wanted to get married and have a family. At first she was patient because she thought I'd propose. When it became clear that I wasn't interested in doing so, C started to panic. C became more aggressive about it and we started to argue. Eventually C seemed to give up. But we were still sexually active. C had been taking oral contraceptives and we never used condoms (my bad) and I never thought anything of it. Then one day C was diagnosed with Polycystic Ovary Syndrome. She was told by a doctor that she'd be much less likely to conceive. This affected C deeply as she was more or less obsessed with the idea of starting a family. \n\nFast forward about 5 months (I don't remember exactly how long but it was a significant amount of time). It became clear that C was pregnant (with my child!). She succeeded in hiding it up until this point. When confronted she vehemently denied knowing she was pregnant and acted as surprised as anyone. Shocked and at a loss, I pleaded with her to get an abortion and pretty much gave her an ultimatum-me or the baby! It was all very emotional but finally I convinced C to get an abortion. Most doctors refused to perform the abortion this late into the pregnancy but were doctors in Melbourne who would do it. \n\nSo I booked plane tickets. It was all good to go. The morning of the flight, C was packed and literally getting into the car with her grandparents to be taken to the airport. Now get this, as they rolled out of the driveway, C's cat happened to be sitting behind the car. The cat was run over and died. C and her grandparents were shocked and saw no other option than to take this event as the occurrence a miracle (imagine that!) In their eyes it was confirmed-God wanted C to keep her child.\n\nSo she did. And I broke up with her shortly after. A few months later C gave birth to our son named N but I refused to take part. I haven't really talked to C since. I have been paying child support. To this day I have not so much as talked to N, although I have seen him a couple of times, despite that my parents see him and take care of him often. \n\nBasically everyone I know has judged me for abandoning my child and nobody hesitates to tell me I'm in the wrong. A lot of people have lost respect for me and see my continued lack of contact with my child as immoral. I've got into many fights with my parents over this and no longer live with them due to the discord. \n\nN is 5 years old now and stating to talk and go to school. Recently I was told by my mother that when N was playing with other children he was asked about his 'daddy' to which he replied: 'my daddy doesn't play with me'. This is concerning for me to hear and I can't help but feel guilty to some degree. However, I still feel that I've been wronged and at this stage it would be very difficult for me to reverse my decision. I have been firm about my decision all along and have no intention of validating C's disrespect for me by changing my mind now. I never wanted to have a child and she knew all along. She was being incredibly selfish, no matter how selfish I'm being now. \n\nBefore judging me I implore you to consider my perspective. I had no say in the matter and C deceived me (and everyone else) in order to fulfil her fantasy. This was extremely disrespectful and hurtful to me, I wasn't ready to have a child and I'm still not. AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to work through this. The question is whether the author is in the wrong for breaking up with his pregnant girlfriend and not being involved in his child's life. \n\nFirst, let's look at the timeline. The couple was together for three years in high school. The girl, C, had a difficult upbringing and mental health issues (bipolar disorder). She wanted to get married and have a family, but the author wasn't interested in marriage. They were sexually active, using birth control, but she later developed PCOS, which made pregnancy less likely. Despite this, she got pregnant. The author found out, convinced her to get an abortion, but when they were about to go, the cat died, and she decided it was a sign from God to keep the baby. The author broke up with her, hasn't been involved, and only pays child support. Now, the child is 5 and says his daddy doesn't play with him, causing guilt for the author, but he still feels he's not in the wrong.\n\nSo, the main points of contention are: whether the author was wrong to not take responsibility for the child, whether C's actions were manipulative, and whether the author has a right to distance himself now.\n\nFrom a legal standpoint, the author is paying child support, which is his responsibility. However, emotionally and socially, being a parent involves more than financial support. The author is avoiding contact, which is affecting the child. The child's well-being is a concern here. The author feels he was wronged because C wanted a child he didn't, and she deceived him by hiding the pregnancy until later. But deception is a factor\u2014C did hide the pregnancy and then changed her mind about the abortion because of the cat incident, which the author might see as her making a decision against his wishes.\n\nMental health is also a factor. C had bipolar disorder, which could affect her decision-making. However, the author's arguments are about lack of consent and feeling manipulated. But once the child is born, the author has a responsibility regardless of how the pregnancy came about. In many cultures and legal systems, paternity is established if the father knows about the pregnancy and the birth, and there's a duty to be involved. The author's refusal to engage despite the child's needs might be seen as neglectful.\n\nOn the other hand, the author's perspective is that he was not consulted and felt forced into a situation he didn't want. He might feel trapped, especially given the circumstances around the pregnancy. However, the child is now five, and the author's absence is impacting him. The recent comment from the child shows that his absence is causing emotional harm.\n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong. Legally, he's fulfilling his obligation with support, but ethically and emotionally, his absence is problematic. Society often values parental involvement, so many would argue he's in the wrong for not being part of his child's life. However, considering the coercion and deception, he might feel justified, but that doesn't negate the child's need for a father figure.\n\nIn summary, while there are valid points on both sides, the author's decision to avoid contact is causing harm to the child, which is a significant ethical issue. Therefore, the answer is likely that he is in the wrong (A).\n"
