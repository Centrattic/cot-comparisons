C had a rather rough upbringing. Her father abandoned her as a child and her mother committed suicide by jumping in front of a train (only a few years before our relationship began). C was left to be cared by her grandparents who were devout Catholics. As a result C became highly religious herself. However, C has bipolar disorder. This wasn't obvious and manifested as erratic moods. \n\nAnyway, C had it in her head that she wanted to get married and have a family. At first she was patient because she thought I'd propose. When it became clear that I wasn't interested in doing so, C started to panic. C became more aggressive about it and we started to argue. Eventually C seemed to give up. But we were still sexually active. C had been taking oral contraceptives and we never used condoms (my bad) and I never thought anything of it. Then one day C was diagnosed with Polycystic Ovary Syndrome. She was told by a doctor that she'd be much less likely to conceive. This affected C deeply as she was more or less obsessed with the idea of starting a family. \n\nFast forward about 5 months (I don't remember exactly how long but it was a significant amount of time). It became clear that C was pregnant (with my child!). She succeeded in hiding it up until this point. When confronted she vehemently denied knowing she was pregnant and acted as surprised as anyone. Shocked and at a loss, I pleaded with her to get an abortion and pretty much gave her an ultimatum-me or the baby! It was all very emotional but finally I convinced C to get an abortion. Most doctors refused to perform the abortion this late into the pregnancy but were doctors in Melbourne who would do it. \n\nSo I booked plane tickets. It was all good to go. The morning of the flight, C was packed and literally getting into the car with her grandparents to be taken to the airport. Now get this, as they rolled out of the driveway, C's cat happened to be sitting behind the car. The cat was run over and died. C and her grandparents were shocked and saw no other option than to take this event as the occurrence a miracle (imagine that!) In their eyes it was confirmed-God wanted C to keep her child.\n\nSo she did. And I broke up with her shortly after. A few months later C gave birth to our son named N but I refused to take part. I haven't really talked to C since. I have been paying child support. To this day I have not so much as talked to N, although I have seen him a couple of times, despite that my parents see him and take care of him often. \n\nBasically everyone I know has judged me for abandoning my child and nobody hesitates to tell me I'm in the wrong. A lot of people have lost respect for me and see my continued lack of contact with my child as immoral. I've got into many fights with my parents over this and no longer live with them due to the discord. \n\nN is 5 years old now and stating to talk and go to school. Recently I was told by my mother that when N was playing with other children he was asked about his 'daddy' to which he replied: 'my daddy doesn't play with me'. This is concerning for me to hear and I can't help but feel guilty to some degree. However, I still feel that I've been wronged and at this stage it would be very difficult for me to reverse my decision. I have been firm about my decision all along and have no intention of validating C's disrespect for me by changing my mind now. I never wanted to have a child and she knew all along. She was being incredibly selfish, no matter how selfish I'm being now. \n\nBefore judging me I implore you to consider my perspective. I had no say in the matter and C deceived me (and everyone else) in order to fulfil her fantasy. This was extremely disrespectful and hurtful to me, I wasn't ready to have a child and I'm still not. AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that he broke up with his girlfriend after she got pregnant, despite previously having an abortion arranged. The key points are that the girlfriend had mental health issues, including bipolar disorder, and a troubled past. They were in a high school relationship, and he wasn't interested in marriage but she was. She ended up getting pregnant, and he wanted an abortion but she changed her mind after the cat died, which she took as a sign from God. He then broke up with her and hasn't been involved in the child's life, only paying child support. Now he's feeling guilty but still stands by his decision.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The girl, C, had a hard background and mental health issues. She might have been manipulative or not fully aware of her actions due to her condition. The author claims she deceived him by hiding the pregnancy and then changing her mind about the abortion. However, he also didn't use protection, which contributed to the pregnancy. \n\nThe author's main argument is that he wasn't ready for a child and that C was being selfish by forcing the situation on him. But from a societal standpoint, fathers typically have responsibilities towards their children even if they aren't involved. The fact that he's paying child support is a positive, but not engaging emotionally or spending time with the child is seen as neglectful. \n\nThere's also the aspect of her mental health. If she was in a fragile state and made decisions based on religious beliefs triggered by an accident (the cat dying), maybe she wasn't in the right state of mind. However, it's unclear how much her mental health influenced her decision-making at the time. \n\nThe author's response to breaking up and cutting off contact could be seen as avoiding responsibility. Even if he didn't want a child, the child is now part of his life, and his absence is affecting the child's well-being. The comment from the mother about the child saying \"my daddy doesn't play with me\" adds emotional weight. \n\nOn the other hand, if he felt coerced into an unwanted pregnancy and the relationship was already strained, his decision might stem from feeling overwhelmed. But cutting off completely without trying to maintain a relationship might be seen as selfish now, especially as the child grows older. \n\nLegal aspects in many places require parental involvement, and emotionally, children benefit from having both parents involved. The author's stance could be seen as neglecting his parental duties despite the circumstances. However, if he truly wasn't part of the decision-making and felt forced, there's a point where he has a responsibility now, regardless of past circumstances.\n\nConsidering all this, the author's actions might be seen as wrong because he's not fulfilling his role as a father, even if the initial situation was complex. While C's actions were problematic, his response has also caused harm to the child. So, the answer might be A (he's in the wrong), but there's nuance here. However, given the context, the consensus often leans towards parental responsibility, so A seems likely.\n"
