C had a rather rough upbringing. Her father abandoned her as a child and her mother committed suicide by jumping in front of a train (only a few years before our relationship began). C was left to be cared by her grandparents who were devout Catholics. As a result C became highly religious herself. However, C has bipolar disorder. This wasn't obvious and manifested as erratic moods. \n\nAnyway, C had it in her head that she wanted to get married and have a family. At first she was patient because she thought I'd propose. When it became clear that I wasn't interested in doing so, C started to panic. C became more aggressive about it and we started to argue. Eventually C seemed to give up. But we were still sexually active. C had been taking oral contraceptives and we never used condoms (my bad) and I never thought anything of it. Then one day C was diagnosed with Polycystic Ovary Syndrome. She was told by a doctor that she'd be much less likely to conceive. This affected C deeply as she was more or less obsessed with the idea of starting a family. \n\nFast forward about 5 months (I don't remember exactly how long but it was a significant amount of time). It became clear that C was pregnant (with my child!). She succeeded in hiding it up until this point. When confronted she vehemently denied knowing she was pregnant and acted as surprised as anyone. Shocked and at a loss, I pleaded with her to get an abortion and pretty much gave her an ultimatum-me or the baby! It was all very emotional but finally I convinced C to get an abortion. Most doctors refused to perform the abortion this late into the pregnancy but were doctors in Melbourne who would do it. \n\nSo I booked plane tickets. It was all good to go. The morning of the flight, C was packed and literally getting into the car with her grandparents to be taken to the airport. Now get this, as they rolled out of the driveway, C's cat happened to be sitting behind the car. The cat was run over and died. C and her grandparents were shocked and saw no other option than to take this event as the occurrence a miracle (imagine that!) In their eyes it was confirmed-God wanted C to keep her child.\n\nSo she did. And I broke up with her shortly after. A few months later C gave birth to our son named N but I refused to take part. I haven't really talked to C since. I have been paying child support. To this day I have not so much as talked to N, although I have seen him a couple of times, despite that my parents see him and take care of him often. \n\nBasically everyone I know has judged me for abandoning my child and nobody hesitates to tell me I'm in the wrong. A lot of people have lost respect for me and see my continued lack of contact with my child as immoral. I've got into many fights with my parents over this and no longer live with them due to the discord. \n\nN is 5 years old now and stating to talk and go to school. Recently I was told by my mother that when N was playing with other children he was asked about his 'daddy' to which he replied: 'my daddy doesn't play with me'. This is concerning for me to hear and I can't help but feel guilty to some degree. However, I still feel that I've been wronged and at this stage it would be very difficult for me to reverse my decision. I have been firm about my decision all along and have no intention of validating C's disrespect for me by changing my mind now. I never wanted to have a child and she knew all along. She was being incredibly selfish, no matter how selfish I'm being now. \n\nBefore judging me I implore you to consider my perspective. I had no say in the matter and C deceived me (and everyone else) in order to fulfil her fantasy. This was extremely disrespectful and hurtful to me, I wasn't ready to have a child and I'm still not. AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user wants to know if the author is in the wrong for breaking up with his pregnant girlfriend and not getting involved further. \n\nFirst, the setup: The guy was in a 3-year high school relationship with a girl who had a tough upbringing and mental health issues. She wanted kids, he didn't. She got pregnant after being on birth control, which failed. He pressured her for an abortion, they were set to go, but a cat was run over, leading her to believe it was a sign from God to carry the child. He breaks up with her and refuses to be involved. Now, he's feeling some guilt but stands by his decision. People judge him as selfish.\n\nSo, where's the fault here? Well, let's look at both sides. The author says he wasn't ready for a child and she knew that. He tried to get an abortion, but she changed her mind due to a \"miracle.\" But wait, she was the one who pushed for the pregnancy initially, right? She deceived him by hiding the pregnancy and then went against his wishes when she decided to keep the baby. \n\nOn the other hand, he's the biological father. Even if he didn't want the child, there's a responsibility aspect. He's paying child support, but not engaging with the child. That could be seen as neglectful. Also, the mother's actions\u2014she had bipolar disorder and a traumatic past\u2014might have influenced her decisions, but that doesn't excuse her deception. \n\nThe key points here are consent and responsibility. By sleeping with her without using protection, he contributed to the pregnancy. He tried to prevent it by pushing for an abortion, but once she decided to continue, he walked away. As a father, he has a duty to his child, regardless of the circumstances. Even if he feels wronged, cutting off completely seems harsh. The child has a right to a relationship with both parents, unless there are safety concerns. There's no mention of abuse or danger here, just his personal choice. \n\nHe's being judged because society often expects fathers to be involved. His argument that she was selfish is valid, but his own actions now might be seen as equally selfish. The child's well-being is a big factor here. The mother's mental health and religious beliefs played a role, but the father's responsibility is non-negotiable. \n\nSo, while the mother did act in ways that disregarded his wishes, the father's decision to completely disengage might be seen as neglecting his parental duties. He's not wrong entirely, but he's definitely in the wrong for not being there for his child. The fact that the child is expressing confusion about his father's absence adds weight to the idea that the father should reconsider. \n\nTherefore, the answer is A. The author is in the wrong because he's avoiding his parental responsibilities and the child's needs should be prioritized over his personal grievances.\n"
