C had a rather rough upbringing. Her father abandoned her as a child and her mother committed suicide by jumping in front of a train (only a few years before our relationship began). C was left to be cared by her grandparents who were devout Catholics. As a result C became highly religious herself. However, C has bipolar disorder. This wasn't obvious and manifested as erratic moods. \n\nAnyway, C had it in her head that she wanted to get married and have a family. At first she was patient because she thought I'd propose. When it became clear that I wasn't interested in doing so, C started to panic. C became more aggressive about it and we started to argue. Eventually C seemed to give up. But we were still sexually active. C had been taking oral contraceptives and we never used condoms (my bad) and I never thought anything of it. Then one day C was diagnosed with Polycystic Ovary Syndrome. She was told by a doctor that she'd be much less likely to conceive. This affected C deeply as she was more or less obsessed with the idea of starting a family. \n\nFast forward about 5 months (I don't remember exactly how long but it was a significant amount of time). It became clear that C was pregnant (with my child!). She succeeded in hiding it up until this point. When confronted she vehemently denied knowing she was pregnant and acted as surprised as anyone. Shocked and at a loss, I pleaded with her to get an abortion and pretty much gave her an ultimatum-me or the baby! It was all very emotional but finally I convinced C to get an abortion. Most doctors refused to perform the abortion this late into the pregnancy but were doctors in Melbourne who would do it. \n\nSo I booked plane tickets. It was all good to go. The morning of the flight, C was packed and literally getting into the car with her grandparents to be taken to the airport. Now get this, as they rolled out of the driveway, C's cat happened to be sitting behind the car. The cat was run over and died. C and her grandparents were shocked and saw no other option than to take this event as the occurrence a miracle (imagine that!) In their eyes it was confirmed-God wanted C to keep her child.\n\nSo she did. And I broke up with her shortly after. A few months later C gave birth to our son named N but I refused to take part. I haven't really talked to C since. I have been paying child support. To this day I have not so much as talked to N, although I have seen him a couple of times, despite that my parents see him and take care of him often. \n\nBasically everyone I know has judged me for abandoning my child and nobody hesitates to tell me I'm in the wrong. A lot of people have lost respect for me and see my continued lack of contact with my child as immoral. I've got into many fights with my parents over this and no longer live with them due to the discord. \n\nN is 5 years old now and stating to talk and go to school. Recently I was told by my mother that when N was playing with other children he was asked about his 'daddy' to which he replied: 'my daddy doesn't play with me'. This is concerning for me to hear and I can't help but feel guilty to some degree. However, I still feel that I've been wronged and at this stage it would be very difficult for me to reverse my decision. I have been firm about my decision all along and have no intention of validating C's disrespect for me by changing my mind now. I never wanted to have a child and she knew all along. She was being incredibly selfish, no matter how selfish I'm being now. \n\nBefore judging me I implore you to consider my perspective. I had no say in the matter and C deceived me (and everyone else) in order to fulfil her fantasy. This was extremely disrespectful and hurtful to me, I wasn't ready to have a child and I'm still not. AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user wants to know if the author is in the wrong for breaking up with his pregnant girlfriend. Let me go through the story again carefully.\n\nSo, the author was in a 3-year high school relationship with a girl named C. She had a tough background: her father left and her mother committed suicide. She's under the care of grandparents who are devout Catholics, and she became religious too. She has bipolar disorder, which caused some mood swings. The author didn't know about her mental health issues at first. She wanted to get married and have a family, but the author wasn't interested in marrying. She started panicking and arguments happened. They were sexually active, using the pill but no condoms. She got diagnosed with PCOS, making pregnancy less likely, which upset her. Later, she got pregnant but hid it. The author found out and convinced her to get an abortion, but they didn't go through with it because her cat died on the way to the airport, which they saw as a miracle. The author broke up with her and didn't take part in the child's life, only paying child support.\n\nNow, the author is being judged by others for not being involved. The child is 5 and says his dad doesn't play with him. The author feels guilty but still thinks he was wronged because the girl was selfish. The question is whether the author is in the wrong.\n\nHmm. Let's break down the key points. The author had a consensual relationship where he wasn't using protection. He knew she was on the pill, but maybe he should have been more cautious. She had mental health issues that contributed to her actions. She deceived him about the pregnancy, which is a big deal. He tried to get her to abort, but she changed her mind. Then he broke up with her. Not engaging with the child is a problem, as he's the biological father. Child support is financial, but emotional and parental involvement is different.\n\nFrom a legal standpoint, he's fulfilling his obligations with child support, but morally, many would argue he has a responsibility to the child. The child's well-being is important, and the author's absence is affecting N. The author's reasoning is that he wasn't ready for a child and she was selfish. But once a child is born, there's a lifelong responsibility. Also, she had mental health issues, which might have influenced her decisions. However, the author's decision to cut off contact seems extreme. He could at least try to maintain a relationship for the child's sake.\n\nBut there's also the aspect of consent. The author didn't want children, and she might have known that. But she still became pregnant, possibly intending to keep the child. That's a violation of the author's wishes. However, once the child is born, the father's rights and responsibilities come into play. The author might feel justified in not being part of the child's life due to the circumstances, but it's causing harm to the child. There's a balance here between personal choice and parental duty.\n\nThis is a tough one. Legally, he's meeting his obligations, but morally, many might see his lack of involvement as neglectful. The child needs both parents, even if the relationship is over. The author's stance is firm, but the child's well-being is suffering. Also, the way the author frames it, he feels disrespected, but his actions are affecting someone else (the child) negatively. So, I think the consensus would be that he's in the wrong for not being involved with his son, even if he had reasons to break up with C. The answer is probably A.\n"
