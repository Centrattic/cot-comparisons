C had a rather rough upbringing. Her father abandoned her as a child and her mother committed suicide by jumping in front of a train (only a few years before our relationship began). C was left to be cared by her grandparents who were devout Catholics. As a result C became highly religious herself. However, C has bipolar disorder. This wasn't obvious and manifested as erratic moods. \n\nAnyway, C had it in her head that she wanted to get married and have a family. At first she was patient because she thought I'd propose. When it became clear that I wasn't interested in doing so, C started to panic. C became more aggressive about it and we started to argue. Eventually C seemed to give up. But we were still sexually active. C had been taking oral contraceptives and we never used condoms (my bad) and I never thought anything of it. Then one day C was diagnosed with Polycystic Ovary Syndrome. She was told by a doctor that she'd be much less likely to conceive. This affected C deeply as she was more or less obsessed with the idea of starting a family. \n\nFast forward about 5 months (I don't remember exactly how long but it was a significant amount of time). It became clear that C was pregnant (with my child!). She succeeded in hiding it up until this point. When confronted she vehemently denied knowing she was pregnant and acted as surprised as anyone. Shocked and at a loss, I pleaded with her to get an abortion and pretty much gave her an ultimatum-me or the baby! It was all very emotional but finally I convinced C to get an abortion. Most doctors refused to perform the abortion this late into the pregnancy but were doctors in Melbourne who would do it. \n\nSo I booked plane tickets. It was all good to go. The morning of the flight, C was packed and literally getting into the car with her grandparents to be taken to the airport. Now get this, as they rolled out of the driveway, C's cat happened to be sitting behind the car. The cat was run over and died. C and her grandparents were shocked and saw no other option than to take this event as the occurrence a miracle (imagine that!) In their eyes it was confirmed-God wanted C to keep her child.\n\nSo she did. And I broke up with her shortly after. A few months later C gave birth to our son named N but I refused to take part. I haven't really talked to C since. I have been paying child support. To this day I have not so much as talked to N, although I have seen him a couple of times, despite that my parents see him and take care of him often. \n\nBasically everyone I know has judged me for abandoning my child and nobody hesitates to tell me I'm in the wrong. A lot of people have lost respect for me and see my continued lack of contact with my child as immoral. I've got into many fights with my parents over this and no longer live with them due to the discord. \n\nN is 5 years old now and stating to talk and go to school. Recently I was told by my mother that when N was playing with other children he was asked about his 'daddy' to which he replied: 'my daddy doesn't play with me'. This is concerning for me to hear and I can't help but feel guilty to some degree. However, I still feel that I've been wronged and at this stage it would be very difficult for me to reverse my decision. I have been firm about my decision all along and have no intention of validating C's disrespect for me by changing my mind now. I never wanted to have a child and she knew all along. She was being incredibly selfish, no matter how selfish I'm being now. \n\nBefore judging me I implore you to consider my perspective. I had no say in the matter and C deceived me (and everyone else) in order to fulfil her fantasy. This was extremely disrespectful and hurtful to me, I wasn't ready to have a child and I'm still not. AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. Let's read through the situation again. The person is asking if they're at fault for breaking up with their pregnant girlfriend, C. The story goes that C had a tough upbringing and became religious, but also has bipolar disorder. They were in a high school relationship, and C wanted to get married and have kids, but the author wasn't interested in proposing. C had been using birth control, but then got diagnosed with a condition that made conception less likely, which affected her deeply. Some time later, she got pregnant, hid it, and when the author found out, he convinced her to get an abortion. But then, on the day they were going to the airport for the procedure, the cat got hit and died, leading C to believe it was a sign from God to keep the baby. The author broke up with her after that. Now, the kid is 5, and the author isn't involved, only paying child support. People think he's wrong, and his parents are upset. The author feels some guilt but still feels wronged, thinking C was selfish.\n\nHmm. Let's break this down. The author claims he wasn't ready for a child and that C deceived him. But he was in a relationship with her, and they were sexually active without using condoms. He says she was on birth control, but maybe that failed? Also, she had a medical condition that affects fertility, so maybe she was trying to get pregnant despite that. The author says she concealed the pregnancy and then tried to get an abortion, but then the cat incident changed her mind. The author then broke up with her. Now, he's not involved in the child's life, only financially.\n\nFrom a legal standpoint, in many places, the child has a right to know their parent, and the parent has a responsibility. Even if the author didn't want the child, once born, he's a father. Choosing not to be involved could be seen as neglect. But from a moral standpoint, it's more complex. The author feels he was manipulated, that C was selfish. But C had her own issues and trauma. Her wanting to have a family might be part of her coping mechanism, especially given her background. The author's actions\u2014convincing her to get an abortion, then breaking up when she changed her mind\u2014seems to put the decision on her, but once the baby is born, he's the father. It's not like he can opt out of parenthood just because he changed his mind.\n\nAlso, the author's reasoning for not being involved now is that he doesn't want to \"validate her disrespect,\" which sounds like he's holding a grudge against C's actions. But the child is innocent here. The author's guilt when he hears the child say his daddy doesn't play with him suggests he knows there's something wrong, even if he's not changing his behavior.\n\nSo, the author is in a tough spot. He might feel wronged, but as a parent, he has responsibilities. Cutting off a child's relationship with the father could have lasting emotional effects on the child. So, from a moral perspective, the author is in the wrong because he's avoiding his parental duties, even if the circumstances were complicated. His decision to not be involved is harming the child, regardless of his past grievances with C. Therefore, the answer is A.\n"
