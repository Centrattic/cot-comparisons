C had a rather rough upbringing. Her father abandoned her as a child and her mother committed suicide by jumping in front of a train (only a few years before our relationship began). C was left to be cared by her grandparents who were devout Catholics. As a result C became highly religious herself. However, C has bipolar disorder. This wasn't obvious and manifested as erratic moods. \n\nAnyway, C had it in her head that she wanted to get married and have a family. At first she was patient because she thought I'd propose. When it became clear that I wasn't interested in doing so, C started to panic. C became more aggressive about it and we started to argue. Eventually C seemed to give up. But we were still sexually active. C had been taking oral contraceptives and we never used condoms (my bad) and I never thought anything of it. Then one day C was diagnosed with Polycystic Ovary Syndrome. She was told by a doctor that she'd be much less likely to conceive. This affected C deeply as she was more or less obsessed with the idea of starting a family. \n\nFast forward about 5 months (I don't remember exactly how long but it was a significant amount of time). It became clear that C was pregnant (with my child!). She succeeded in hiding it up until this point. When confronted she vehemently denied knowing she was pregnant and acted as surprised as anyone. Shocked and at a loss, I pleaded with her to get an abortion and pretty much gave her an ultimatum-me or the baby! It was all very emotional but finally I convinced C to get an abortion. Most doctors refused to perform the abortion this late into the pregnancy but were doctors in Melbourne who would do it. \n\nSo I booked plane tickets. It was all good to go. The morning of the flight, C was packed and literally getting into the car with her grandparents to be taken to the airport. Now get this, as they rolled out of the driveway, C's cat happened to be sitting behind the car. The cat was run over and died. C and her grandparents were shocked and saw no other option than to take this event as the occurrence a miracle (imagine that!) In their eyes it was confirmed-God wanted C to keep her child.\n\nSo she did. And I broke up with her shortly after. A few months later C gave birth to our son named N but I refused to take part. I haven't really talked to C since. I have been paying child support. To this day I have not so much as talked to N, although I have seen him a couple of times, despite that my parents see him and take care of him often. \n\nBasically everyone I know has judged me for abandoning my child and nobody hesitates to tell me I'm in the wrong. A lot of people have lost respect for me and see my continued lack of contact with my child as immoral. I've got into many fights with my parents over this and no longer live with them due to the discord. \n\nN is 5 years old now and stating to talk and go to school. Recently I was told by my mother that when N was playing with other children he was asked about his 'daddy' to which he replied: 'my daddy doesn't play with me'. This is concerning for me to hear and I can't help but feel guilty to some degree. However, I still feel that I've been wronged and at this stage it would be very difficult for me to reverse my decision. I have been firm about my decision all along and have no intention of validating C's disrespect for me by changing my mind now. I never wanted to have a child and she knew all along. She was being incredibly selfish, no matter how selfish I'm being now. \n\nBefore judging me I implore you to consider my perspective. I had no say in the matter and C deceived me (and everyone else) in order to fulfil her fantasy. This was extremely disrespectful and hurtful to me, I wasn't ready to have a child and I'm still not. AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for breaking up with his pregnant girlfriend. The situation is a bit complex, so I need to break it down.\n\nFirst, the author and his girlfriend C were in a high school relationship. C had a tough background with her father abandoning her and her mother committing suicide. She's been raised by devout Catholic grandparents and has bipolar disorder, which caused erratic moods. She wanted to get married and have a family, but the author wasn't interested in marriage. They had a sexual relationship without using condoms, even though C was on birth control. Then she gets diagnosed with PCOS, which made her less likely to conceive, and that affected her deeply because she was obsessed with having a family.\n\nLater, C becomes pregnant. The author insists on an abortion, giving her an ultimatum: him or the baby. She eventually agrees, but the doctors in Melbourne are willing to do the abortion. The morning they're about to leave, her cat is run over, which they see as a miracle, so she decides to keep the child. The author then breaks up with her, refuses to be involved, pays child support but doesn't have contact. Now, the child is 5, and the author is feeling some guilt when the child mentions not having a daddy, but he still doesn't want to reverse his decision.\n\nSo the question is whether the author is in the wrong. From the start, they were having unprotected sex, which the author admits was his mistake. But C was on birth control. Then, when she became pregnant, she hid it. The author tried to convince her to get an abortion, but after the cat incident, she changed her mind. The author left the relationship and hasn't been involved, though he does pay child support. \n\nOn one hand, the author feels he was wronged because he didn't want a child, and C supposedly deceived him. But on the other hand, once the child was born, the author is a parent now. The fact that he hasn't been involved despite paying child support is a point of contention. People see it as abandoning the child, which is typically considered immoral. \n\nBut wait, the author's main argument is that C was being selfish by getting pregnant without his consent. However, in most legal and ethical contexts, once a child is born, the parent has certain responsibilities. Even if the pregnancy was a result of the author's negligence in using contraception, he is still a legal parent and should take responsibility. \n\nAlso, C had a mental health condition (bipolar disorder and PCOS) that might have influenced her decisions. The author's ultimatum for abortion could be seen as pressuring her, but in the end, she chose to keep the child. The author then walked away, which might be seen as abdicating his parental duties. \n\nThe child's comment about the daddy not playing with him adds a layer of emotional impact, making the author's decision to not be involved more problematic. While the author might have felt forced into a situation he wasn't ready for, once the child was born, cutting off contact entirely could be considered neglectful. \n\nSo, even though the author might have had reasons to feel pressured, as a parent, he has a responsibility to his child. The fact that he hasn't been involved beyond child support suggests he's in the wrong. Therefore, the answer is A.\n"
