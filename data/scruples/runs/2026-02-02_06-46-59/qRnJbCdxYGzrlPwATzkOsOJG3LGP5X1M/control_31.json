C had a rather rough upbringing. Her father abandoned her as a child and her mother committed suicide by jumping in front of a train (only a few years before our relationship began). C was left to be cared by her grandparents who were devout Catholics. As a result C became highly religious herself. However, C has bipolar disorder. This wasn't obvious and manifested as erratic moods. \n\nAnyway, C had it in her head that she wanted to get married and have a family. At first she was patient because she thought I'd propose. When it became clear that I wasn't interested in doing so, C started to panic. C became more aggressive about it and we started to argue. Eventually C seemed to give up. But we were still sexually active. C had been taking oral contraceptives and we never used condoms (my bad) and I never thought anything of it. Then one day C was diagnosed with Polycystic Ovary Syndrome. She was told by a doctor that she'd be much less likely to conceive. This affected C deeply as she was more or less obsessed with the idea of starting a family. \n\nFast forward about 5 months (I don't remember exactly how long but it was a significant amount of time). It became clear that C was pregnant (with my child!). She succeeded in hiding it up until this point. When confronted she vehemently denied knowing she was pregnant and acted as surprised as anyone. Shocked and at a loss, I pleaded with her to get an abortion and pretty much gave her an ultimatum-me or the baby! It was all very emotional but finally I convinced C to get an abortion. Most doctors refused to perform the abortion this late into the pregnancy but were doctors in Melbourne who would do it. \n\nSo I booked plane tickets. It was all good to go. The morning of the flight, C was packed and literally getting into the car with her grandparents to be taken to the airport. Now get this, as they rolled out of the driveway, C's cat happened to be sitting behind the car. The cat was run over and died. C and her grandparents were shocked and saw no other option than to take this event as the occurrence a miracle (imagine that!) In their eyes it was confirmed-God wanted C to keep her child.\n\nSo she did. And I broke up with her shortly after. A few months later C gave birth to our son named N but I refused to take part. I haven't really talked to C since. I have been paying child support. To this day I have not so much as talked to N, although I have seen him a couple of times, despite that my parents see him and take care of him often. \n\nBasically everyone I know has judged me for abandoning my child and nobody hesitates to tell me I'm in the wrong. A lot of people have lost respect for me and see my continued lack of contact with my child as immoral. I've got into many fights with my parents over this and no longer live with them due to the discord. \n\nN is 5 years old now and stating to talk and go to school. Recently I was told by my mother that when N was playing with other children he was asked about his 'daddy' to which he replied: 'my daddy doesn't play with me'. This is concerning for me to hear and I can't help but feel guilty to some degree. However, I still feel that I've been wronged and at this stage it would be very difficult for me to reverse my decision. I have been firm about my decision all along and have no intention of validating C's disrespect for me by changing my mind now. I never wanted to have a child and she knew all along. She was being incredibly selfish, no matter how selfish I'm being now. \n\nBefore judging me I implore you to consider my perspective. I had no say in the matter and C deceived me (and everyone else) in order to fulfil her fantasy. This was extremely disrespectful and hurtful to me, I wasn't ready to have a child and I'm still not. AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that he broke up with his pregnant girlfriend after she had a miscarriage because she decided to keep the baby instead of getting an abortion, which he wanted. He felt pressured by her to get married and have a family, and when she got pregnant despite her PCOS, he tried to convince her to abort. But then when the cat died, she took it as a sign from God to keep the child, and he broke up with her. Now he's paying child support but not involved in the child's life, and people are judging him.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. On his side, he claims he wasn't ready for a child, and he felt forced into a situation where she was manipulating him. He tried to get her to abort, but she went against his wishes. He might feel that his autonomy was violated because he didn't want to be a father. He might believe that she was being selfish by deciding to go against his wishes, especially after he had convinced her to abort initially. But then she changed her mind because of the cat incident. He broke up with her, which he might see as necessary to protect himself from being a parent he didn't want to be.\n\nOn the other side, she had a history of mental health issues (bipolar) and a traumatic upbringing. She might have been struggling with her own needs and desires. But she did choose to keep the child after the cat incident, which might be seen as her making a decision based on her beliefs. The child is now 5, and the author isn't involved in his life. The child is asking about his father, and the author feels guilty but is still firm in his decision. \n\nLegally, he's paying child support, which is his responsibility. However, the emotional aspect is more complex. Even if he didn't want the child, the child has a right to a relationship with both parents, assuming it's safe. The author's refusal to engage could be seen as neglecting his parental responsibilities beyond financial support. Also, the initial breakup was his choice, but cutting off contact entirely might be harmful to the child.\n\nHe mentions that she was being disrespectful by going against their previous agreement. But he also had a role in not using protection and contributing to the pregnancy. He might have shared responsibility. His parents are involved, which is good, but the father's absence could have long-term effects on the child. The author's parents stepping in might mitigate some of the issues, but the child losing contact with his biological father is a significant concern.\n\nMoral perspectives vary. Some might argue that once a child is born, the parent has a responsibility regardless of the circumstances. Others might empathize with the author's stance, especially if he wasn't prepared and felt manipulated. However, the child's well-being is a key factor here. The author's decision to not engage emotionally could be seen as selfish now, even if he had his reasons before.\n\nIn terms of societal judgment, people often expect parents to be involved in their child's life. The author's refusal to change his stance despite the child's feelings might be seen as inconsiderate. Even if he feels wronged initially, the child's needs now might outweigh his past grievances.\n\nSo, considering all these points, the author might be seen as in the wrong for not being involved in his child's life beyond financial support. The fact that the child is expressing a desire for his father adds to the weight of the author's responsibility. While the initial circumstances were complicated, his ongoing disengagement could be viewed as harmful. Therefore, the answer is likely A (the author is in the wrong).\n"
