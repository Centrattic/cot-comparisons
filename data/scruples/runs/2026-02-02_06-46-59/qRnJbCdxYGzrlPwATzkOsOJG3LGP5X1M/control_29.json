C had a rather rough upbringing. Her father abandoned her as a child and her mother committed suicide by jumping in front of a train (only a few years before our relationship began). C was left to be cared by her grandparents who were devout Catholics. As a result C became highly religious herself. However, C has bipolar disorder. This wasn't obvious and manifested as erratic moods. \n\nAnyway, C had it in her head that she wanted to get married and have a family. At first she was patient because she thought I'd propose. When it became clear that I wasn't interested in doing so, C started to panic. C became more aggressive about it and we started to argue. Eventually C seemed to give up. But we were still sexually active. C had been taking oral contraceptives and we never used condoms (my bad) and I never thought anything of it. Then one day C was diagnosed with Polycystic Ovary Syndrome. She was told by a doctor that she'd be much less likely to conceive. This affected C deeply as she was more or less obsessed with the idea of starting a family. \n\nFast forward about 5 months (I don't remember exactly how long but it was a significant amount of time). It became clear that C was pregnant (with my child!). She succeeded in hiding it up until this point. When confronted she vehemently denied knowing she was pregnant and acted as surprised as anyone. Shocked and at a loss, I pleaded with her to get an abortion and pretty much gave her an ultimatum-me or the baby! It was all very emotional but finally I convinced C to get an abortion. Most doctors refused to perform the abortion this late into the pregnancy but were doctors in Melbourne who would do it. \n\nSo I booked plane tickets. It was all good to go. The morning of the flight, C was packed and literally getting into the car with her grandparents to be taken to the airport. Now get this, as they rolled out of the driveway, C's cat happened to be sitting behind the car. The cat was run over and died. C and her grandparents were shocked and saw no other option than to take this event as the occurrence a miracle (imagine that!) In their eyes it was confirmed-God wanted C to keep her child.\n\nSo she did. And I broke up with her shortly after. A few months later C gave birth to our son named N but I refused to take part. I haven't really talked to C since. I have been paying child support. To this day I have not so much as talked to N, although I have seen him a couple of times, despite that my parents see him and take care of him often. \n\nBasically everyone I know has judged me for abandoning my child and nobody hesitates to tell me I'm in the wrong. A lot of people have lost respect for me and see my continued lack of contact with my child as immoral. I've got into many fights with my parents over this and no longer live with them due to the discord. \n\nN is 5 years old now and stating to talk and go to school. Recently I was told by my mother that when N was playing with other children he was asked about his 'daddy' to which he replied: 'my daddy doesn't play with me'. This is concerning for me to hear and I can't help but feel guilty to some degree. However, I still feel that I've been wronged and at this stage it would be very difficult for me to reverse my decision. I have been firm about my decision all along and have no intention of validating C's disrespect for me by changing my mind now. I never wanted to have a child and she knew all along. She was being incredibly selfish, no matter how selfish I'm being now. \n\nBefore judging me I implore you to consider my perspective. I had no say in the matter and C deceived me (and everyone else) in order to fulfil her fantasy. This was extremely disrespectful and hurtful to me, I wasn't ready to have a child and I'm still not. AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out whether the author is in the wrong based on the situation they described. Let me start by breaking down the key points.\n\nFirst, the author had a 3-year relationship in high school with a girl named C. C has a rough background: her father abandoned her, and her mother committed suicide. She was raised by devout Catholic grandparents, which influenced her religion. She also has bipolar disorder, which caused erratic moods. The author mentions that C wanted to get married and have a family, but when he didn't propose, she panicked. They were sexually active without using condoms, and the author didn't use any other contraception. C had PCOS, which made pregnancy harder, but she still got pregnant. The author wanted an abortion and gave her an ultimatum. C agreed, but when they tried to go for the abortion, the cat got hit by the car as they left, which C and her family took as a sign from God to keep the baby. The author then broke up with her, refuses to take part in the child's life, pays child support but no contact. Now the child is 5 and says \"my daddy doesn't play with me,\" which makes the author feel guilty but he still stands by his decision.\n\nSo the question is, is the author in the wrong?\n\nLooking from different angles. Legally, he's paying child support, which is required. But ethically, is he being responsible? The author argues that C deceived him by hiding the pregnancy and then changing her mind after the \"miracle\" incident. But C had a history of mental health issues (bipolar), which might affect her decisions. The author also took advantage of not using condoms, which contributed to the pregnancy. \n\nOn the other hand, the author gave her an ultimatum and then when she changed her mind, he left. But once the pregnancy continued, he has a responsibility as a father, regardless of the circumstances. Children have a right to know their father, and the author's decision to cut off contact completely might be harming the child. The child's statement shows the impact of the absence.\n\nBut the author claims he was tricked into the pregnancy. However, by not using condoms, he was complicit in the risk. Also, the ultimatum of \"me or the baby\" is a serious decision, and pressuring her to abort might be seen as selfish, especially considering her mental health and background.\n\nThe author's refusal to engage with the child now, despite the child's need for a father figure, seems harsh. While he may have been wronged in the situation with the pregnancy, he now has a responsibility towards the child. His actions are affecting the child's well-being. Even if there's past issues, the child is innocent. The author's guilt is evident, but he still refuses to change his stance.\n\nOverall, while both parties have some responsibility, the author's current decision to not be involved in the child's life, despite the child's needs, likely places him in the wrong. So the answer would be A.\n"
