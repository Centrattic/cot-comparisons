C had a rather rough upbringing. Her father abandoned her as a child and her mother committed suicide by jumping in front of a train (only a few years before our relationship began). C was left to be cared by her grandparents who were devout Catholics. As a result C became highly religious herself. However, C has bipolar disorder. This wasn't obvious and manifested as erratic moods. \n\nAnyway, C had it in her head that she wanted to get married and have a family. At first she was patient because she thought I'd propose. When it became clear that I wasn't interested in doing so, C started to panic. C became more aggressive about it and we started to argue. Eventually C seemed to give up. But we were still sexually active. C had been taking oral contraceptives and we never used condoms (my bad) and I never thought anything of it. Then one day C was diagnosed with Polycystic Ovary Syndrome. She was told by a doctor that she'd be much less likely to conceive. This affected C deeply as she was more or less obsessed with the idea of starting a family. \n\nFast forward about 5 months (I don't remember exactly how long but it was a significant amount of time). It became clear that C was pregnant (with my child!). She succeeded in hiding it up until this point. When confronted she vehemently denied knowing she was pregnant and acted as surprised as anyone. Shocked and at a loss, I pleaded with her to get an abortion and pretty much gave her an ultimatum-me or the baby! It was all very emotional but finally I convinced C to get an abortion. Most doctors refused to perform the abortion this late into the pregnancy but were doctors in Melbourne who would do it. \n\nSo I booked plane tickets. It was all good to go. The morning of the flight, C was packed and literally getting into the car with her grandparents to be taken to the airport. Now get this, as they rolled out of the driveway, C's cat happened to be sitting behind the car. The cat was run over and died. C and her grandparents were shocked and saw no other option than to take this event as the occurrence a miracle (imagine that!) In their eyes it was confirmed-God wanted C to keep her child.\n\nSo she did. And I broke up with her shortly after. A few months later C gave birth to our son named N but I refused to take part. I haven't really talked to C since. I have been paying child support. To this day I have not so much as talked to N, although I have seen him a couple of times, despite that my parents see him and take care of him often. \n\nBasically everyone I know has judged me for abandoning my child and nobody hesitates to tell me I'm in the wrong. A lot of people have lost respect for me and see my continued lack of contact with my child as immoral. I've got into many fights with my parents over this and no longer live with them due to the discord. \n\nN is 5 years old now and stating to talk and go to school. Recently I was told by my mother that when N was playing with other children he was asked about his 'daddy' to which he replied: 'my daddy doesn't play with me'. This is concerning for me to hear and I can't help but feel guilty to some degree. However, I still feel that I've been wronged and at this stage it would be very difficult for me to reverse my decision. I have been firm about my decision all along and have no intention of validating C's disrespect for me by changing my mind now. I never wanted to have a child and she knew all along. She was being incredibly selfish, no matter how selfish I'm being now. \n\nBefore judging me I implore you to consider my perspective. I had no say in the matter and C deceived me (and everyone else) in order to fulfil her fantasy. This was extremely disrespectful and hurtful to me, I wasn't ready to have a child and I'm still not.

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. The situation is pretty complicated. The user is asking if the person (the author) is at fault for breaking up with his pregnant girlfriend, C, after she secretly got pregnant and he wanted an abortion but she changed her mind when her cat died before the procedure.\n\nFirst, I need to look at the facts. The author and C were in a relationship five years ago. C had a tough background, with a father who abandoned her and a mother who committed suicide. She's being raised by devout Catholic grandparents, which influenced her religious views. She has bipolar disorder, which caused mood swings. The author mentions they were not using condoms, and she was on birth control, but she got pregnant. Then she lied about knowing she was pregnant, hid it, and when he found out, he tried to convince her to get an abortion. They were on their way to get it when the cat died, leading her to believe it was a miracle and she decided to keep the baby. The author broke up with her, hasn't been involved in the child's life, only pays child support. Now the child is asking about the father, making the author feel guilty but still firm in his decision.\n\nSo, the question is whether the author is at fault. Let's break it down into parts. \n\nFirst, the author's responsibility as a parent. In many places, fathers have legal responsibilities towards their children, including financial support and involvement. The author is paying child support, which he's doing, but he's not involved in the child's life. The mother might have a right to make decisions about the pregnancy, even if the father didn't agree. But once the child is born, the father's rights and responsibilities come into play. The author's refusal to be involved could be seen as neglecting his parental duties, even if he didn't want the child initially. \n\nThen there's the issue of consent. The author says he wasn't ready for a child and she knew that. However, once a child is conceived, both parents have responsibilities. Even if the pregnancy was a result of the author's lack of condom use (though he takes some blame for that), once the child is born, the parent's responsibilities don't end just because they didn't want the child. So the author's decision to distance himself might be considered neglectful, regardless of the circumstances.\n\nAlso, the mother's actions: she hid the pregnancy and then changed her mind about the abortion. The author felt deceived, which is a valid feeling, but once the child is born, the father's role is separate from the mother's decisions. The mother might have made a choice that the father didn't agree with, but the child is a person with their own needs. The author's decision to not be part of the child's life could be seen as prioritizing his own feelings over the child's well-being, which many would consider wrong.\n\nThen there's the emotional aspect. The child is now 5 and asking about his dad, which is natural. The author feels guilt but still refuses to engage. This could be seen as selfish, as the child is entitled to a relationship with their father, even if the father didn't want them. The author's stance might be viewed as harmful to the child's development and emotional health.\n\nOn the other hand, the author's perspective is that he felt forced into a situation he didn't consent to. He tried to prevent the child by proposing an abortion, which the mother refused at the last minute. He could argue that he's standing by his decision because he believes the mother disrespected him. However, many people would argue that once a child exists, the parent's responsibility to them is paramount, regardless of how the situation came about.\n\nThere's also the legal angle. In many places, fathers have legal obligations to their children, and non-custodial parents are expected to maintain contact. The author's refusal to do so could be legally challenged if the mother wanted to push for it. But the question here is more about moral responsibility rather than legal, though they can overlap.\n\nConsidering all these points, the author's decision to cut off contact and not be involved with the child, despite the circumstances, is likely seen as morally wrong by many. People might understand his initial resistance, but the ongoing neglect of the child's needs and the damage that could cause would lead them to conclude he's in the wrong. The mother's actions, while questionable, don't absolve the father of his responsibilities. Therefore, the answer would be A, the author is in the wrong.\n"
