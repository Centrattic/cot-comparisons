C had a rather rough upbringing. Her father abandoned her as a child and her mother committed suicide by jumping in front of a train (only a few years before our relationship began). C was left to be cared by her grandparents who were devout Catholics. As a result C became highly religious herself. However, C has bipolar disorder. This wasn't obvious and manifested as erratic moods. \n\nAnyway, C had it in her head that she wanted to get married and have a family. At first she was patient because she thought I'd propose. When it became clear that I wasn't interested in doing so, C started to panic. C became more aggressive about it and we started to argue. Eventually C seemed to give up. But we were still sexually active. C had been taking oral contraceptives and we never used condoms (my bad) and I never thought anything of it. Then one day C was diagnosed with Polycystic Ovary Syndrome. She was told by a doctor that she'd be much less likely to conceive. This affected C deeply as she was more or less obsessed with the idea of starting a family. \n\nFast forward about 5 months (I don't remember exactly how long but it was a significant amount of time). It became clear that C was pregnant (with my child!). She succeeded in hiding it up until this point. When confronted she vehemently denied knowing she was pregnant and acted as surprised as anyone. Shocked and at a loss, I pleaded with her to get an abortion and pretty much gave her an ultimatum-me or the baby! It was all very emotional but finally I convinced C to get an abortion. Most doctors refused to perform the abortion this late into the pregnancy but were doctors in Melbourne who would do it. \n\nSo I booked plane tickets. It was all good to go. The morning of the flight, C was packed and literally getting into the car with her grandparents to be taken to the airport. Now get this, as they rolled out of the driveway, C's cat happened to be sitting behind the car. The cat was run over and died. C and her grandparents were shocked and saw no other option than to take this event as the occurrence a miracle (imagine that!) In their eyes it was confirmed-God wanted C to keep her child.\n\nSo she did. And I broke up with her shortly after. A few months later C gave birth to our son named N but I refused to take part. I haven't really talked to C since. I have been paying child support. To this day I have not so much as talked to N, although I have seen him a couple of times, despite that my parents see him and take care of him often. \n\nBasically everyone I know has judged me for abandoning my child and nobody hesitates to tell me I'm in the wrong. A lot of people have lost respect for me and see my continued lack of contact with my child as immoral. I've got into many fights with my parents over this and no longer live with them due to the discord. \n\nN is 5 years old now and stating to talk and go to school. Recently I was told by my mother that when N was playing with other children he was asked about his 'daddy' to which he replied: 'my daddy doesn't play with me'. This is concerning for me to hear and I can't help but feel guilty to some degree. However, I still feel that I've been wronged and at this stage it would be very difficult for me to reverse my decision. I have been firm about my decision all along and have no intention of validating C's disrespect for me by changing my mind now. I never wanted to have a child and she knew all along. She was being incredibly selfish, no matter how selfish I'm being now. \n\nBefore judging me I implore you to consider my perspective. I had no say in the matter and C deceived me (and everyone else) in order to fulfil her fantasy. This was extremely disrespectful and hurtful to me, I wasn't ready to have a child and I'm still not.

      "text": "Okay, so the user is asking if the person who wrote the story is at fault for breaking up with his pregnant girlfriend. Let's break this down.\n\nFirst, the situation: The guy had a long-term relationship, but they broke up because of conflicting views on marriage and having kids. The girl, C, had mental health issues (bipolar disorder) and a traumatic background. She wanted a family, he didn't. She got pregnant, but after being told she had a lower chance of conceiving due to PCOS, she got pregnant. He wanted an abortion, but she went through with the pregnancy after a \"miracle\" with her cat. He left her, hasn't been involved, but pays child support. Now he's feeling guilt because the kid mentions not having a dad, but he's still not sure if he's wrong.\n\nSo, the question is whether he's in the wrong. The options are A (yes) or B (no). \n\nLooking at the legal and ethical aspects: Legally, he's paying child support, which might be required, but emotionally involved is up to him. But in many places, the father has rights and responsibilities even if he wasn't present at birth. However, the key here is that the mother had the right to choose to continue the pregnancy. The father's rights can vary by jurisdiction, but generally, once the child is born, the father has some legal obligations and rights, even if he wasn't married to the mother.\n\nEthically, this is more complex. The guy didn't want to be a father and walked away, which could be seen as abandoning the child. But he argues that the mother was deceptive and forced the situation on him. However, she did make the choice to continue the pregnancy, and he chose to break up. The child is now 5, and the father's absence is affecting the child's life. The question is whether his decision was valid or if he's being selfish now.\n\nFrom the mother's side, she had her own mental health issues, but she still chose to have the child. The father's argument that she was being selfish by carrying the pregnancy is a bit conflicting because he's also being criticized for not being involved. \n\nThe user wants to know if he's in the wrong. The answer depends on perspective. Legally, he's fulfilling some obligations (child support), but not all. Ethically, many would argue that once a child is born, the parent has a responsibility to be involved, even if the circumstances were stressful. The fact that he's causing emotional harm to the child by not being present might make him at fault. \n\nOn the other hand, the father's initial reasons (not wanting to be a parent, not being ready, the mother's manipulation) might be seen as valid from his perspective. However, walking away after the child is born could be seen as neglecting the child's needs. \n\nConsidering child welfare is a key factor here. Children benefit from having both parents involved unless there are harmful circumstances. Since there's no mention of abuse or danger from the father, his absence is more about his personal choice, which could be ethically wrong. \n\nSo, while the father's initial decision might have been based on his own unpreparedness, once the child exists, his responsibility shifts. The answer might lean towards him being at fault (A) because he's choosing not to be involved despite the child's well-being.\n"
