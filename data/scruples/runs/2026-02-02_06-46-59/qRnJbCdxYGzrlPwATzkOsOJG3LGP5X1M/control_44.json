C had a rather rough upbringing. Her father abandoned her as a child and her mother committed suicide by jumping in front of a train (only a few years before our relationship began). C was left to be cared by her grandparents who were devout Catholics. As a result C became highly religious herself. However, C has bipolar disorder. This wasn't obvious and manifested as erratic moods. \n\nAnyway, C had it in her head that she wanted to get married and have a family. At first she was patient because she thought I'd propose. When it became clear that I wasn't interested in doing so, C started to panic. C became more aggressive about it and we started to argue. Eventually C seemed to give up. But we were still sexually active. C had been taking oral contraceptives and we never used condoms (my bad) and I never thought anything of it. Then one day C was diagnosed with Polycystic Ovary Syndrome. She was told by a doctor that she'd be much less likely to conceive. This affected C deeply as she was more or less obsessed with the idea of starting a family. \n\nFast forward about 5 months (I don't remember exactly how long but it was a significant amount of time). It became clear that C was pregnant (with my child!). She succeeded in hiding it up until this point. When confronted she vehemently denied knowing she was pregnant and acted as surprised as anyone. Shocked and at a loss, I pleaded with her to get an abortion and pretty much gave her an ultimatum-me or the baby! It was all very emotional but finally I convinced C to get an abortion. Most doctors refused to perform the abortion this late into the pregnancy but were doctors in Melbourne who would do it. \n\nSo I booked plane tickets. It was all good to go. The morning of the flight, C was packed and literally getting into the car with her grandparents to be taken to the airport. Now get this, as they rolled out of the driveway, C's cat happened to be sitting behind the car. The cat was run over and died. C and her grandparents were shocked and saw no other option than to take this event as the occurrence a miracle (imagine that!) In their eyes it was confirmed-God wanted C to keep her child.\n\nSo she did. And I broke up with her shortly after. A few months later C gave birth to our son named N but I refused to take part. I haven't really talked to C since. I have been paying child support. To this day I have not so much as talked to N, although I have seen him a couple of times, despite that my parents see him and take care of him often. \n\nBasically everyone I know has judged me for abandoning my child and nobody hesitates to tell me I'm in the wrong. A lot of people have lost respect for me and see my continued lack of contact with my child as immoral. I've got into many fights with my parents over this and no longer live with them due to the discord. \n\nN is 5 years old now and stating to talk and go to school. Recently I was told by my mother that when N was playing with other children he was asked about his 'daddy' to which he replied: 'my daddy doesn't play with me'. This is concerning for me to hear and I can't help but feel guilty to some degree. However, I still feel that I've been wronged and at this stage it would be very difficult for me to reverse my decision. I have been firm about my decision all along and have no intention of validating C's disrespect for me by changing my mind now. I never wanted to have a child and she knew all along. She was being incredibly selfish, no matter how selfish I'm being now. \n\nBefore judging me I implore you to consider my perspective. I had no say in the matter and C deceived me (and everyone else) in order to fulfil her fantasy. This was extremely disrespectful and hurtful to me, I wasn't ready to have a child and I'm still not. AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is pretty complicated. So the guy broke up with his pregnant girlfriend after she decided to keep the baby despite his objections. He feels like she tricked him into having a child he wasn't ready for, and now he's not involved with his son. People are judging him, but he's still holding firm.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical and moral aspects. The girl, C, had a traumatic background and mental health issues (bipolar disorder). She was very religious and wanted to have a family. When she found out about her condition affecting fertility, she was determined. The author says they were having unprotected sex because he didn't use condoms, and she was on birth control. Then, when she got pregnant and he wanted an abortion, she went ahead with the pregnancy after a \"miracle\" with her cat. The author broke up with her, didn't take part in the child's life, but pays child support.\n\nSo, the key points here: Did the author have a right to expect not to become a father? Did C deceive him by hiding the pregnancy and then going against his wishes? On the other hand, once the child is born, does the father have responsibilities regardless of his initial objections?\n\nFrom a legal standpoint, in many places, once a child is born, the father has legal obligations, even if the mother is the one who carried the child. But morally, it's more complex. The author argues he wasn't ready and that C was selfish. However, C had mental health challenges and a troubled past, which might affect her decisions. The author might feel he was coerced into a situation he didn't agree to, but did he take responsibility for the possible consequences of their actions, like using protection?\n\nAlso, the fact that he pays child support but avoids contact is a point. Child support is a legal requirement, but emotional involvement is a different matter. The child is growing up without a father, and the father is feeling guilt but not changing his stance. The question is, is it his fault for not taking responsibility, or is the mother at fault for proceeding against his wishes?\n\nThere's also the aspect of consent. The author thought he was in a relationship where the possibility of a child wasn't something they agreed upon. But once a child is involved, even if it's unwanted, some might argue that being part of the child's life is a responsibility regardless of initial disagreements.\n\nConsidering all this, the author's actions are seen as abandoning his child, which is generally frowned upon. Even if he felt wronged initially, the child is a separate person with needs. So the author might be in the wrong for not taking an active role in his son's life, despite the circumstances. However, the situation is nuanced with multiple layers of complexity.\n"
