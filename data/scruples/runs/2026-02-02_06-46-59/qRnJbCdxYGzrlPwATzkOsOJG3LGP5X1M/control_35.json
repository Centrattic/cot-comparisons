C had a rather rough upbringing. Her father abandoned her as a child and her mother committed suicide by jumping in front of a train (only a few years before our relationship began). C was left to be cared by her grandparents who were devout Catholics. As a result C became highly religious herself. However, C has bipolar disorder. This wasn't obvious and manifested as erratic moods. \n\nAnyway, C had it in her head that she wanted to get married and have a family. At first she was patient because she thought I'd propose. When it became clear that I wasn't interested in doing so, C started to panic. C became more aggressive about it and we started to argue. Eventually C seemed to give up. But we were still sexually active. C had been taking oral contraceptives and we never used condoms (my bad) and I never thought anything of it. Then one day C was diagnosed with Polycystic Ovary Syndrome. She was told by a doctor that she'd be much less likely to conceive. This affected C deeply as she was more or less obsessed with the idea of starting a family. \n\nFast forward about 5 months (I don't remember exactly how long but it was a significant amount of time). It became clear that C was pregnant (with my child!). She succeeded in hiding it up until this point. When confronted she vehemently denied knowing she was pregnant and acted as surprised as anyone. Shocked and at a loss, I pleaded with her to get an abortion and pretty much gave her an ultimatum-me or the baby! It was all very emotional but finally I convinced C to get an abortion. Most doctors refused to perform the abortion this late into the pregnancy but were doctors in Melbourne who would do it. \n\nSo I booked plane tickets. It was all good to go. The morning of the flight, C was packed and literally getting into the car with her grandparents to be taken to the airport. Now get this, as they rolled out of the driveway, C's cat happened to be sitting behind the car. The cat was run over and died. C and her grandparents were shocked and saw no other option than to take this event as the occurrence a miracle (imagine that!) In their eyes it was confirmed-God wanted C to keep her child.\n\nSo she did. And I broke up with her shortly after. A few months later C gave birth to our son named N but I refused to take part. I haven't really talked to C since. I have been paying child support. To this day I have not so much as talked to N, although I have seen him a couple of times, despite that my parents see him and take care of him often. \n\nBasically everyone I know has judged me for abandoning my child and nobody hesitates to tell me I'm in the wrong. A lot of people have lost respect for me and see my continued lack of contact with my child as immoral. I've got into many fights with my parents over this and no longer live with them due to the discord. \n\nN is 5 years old now and stating to talk and go to school. Recently I was told by my mother that when N was playing with other children he was asked about his 'daddy' to which he replied: 'my daddy doesn't play with me'. This is concerning for me to hear and I can't help but feel guilty to some degree. However, I still feel that I've been wronged and at this stage it would be very difficult for me to reverse my decision. I have been firm about my decision all along and have no intention of validating C's disrespect for me by changing my mind now. I never wanted to have a child and she knew all along. She was being incredibly selfish, no matter how selfish I'm being now. \n\nBefore judging me I implore you to consider my perspective. I had no say in the matter and C deceived me (and everyone else) in order to fulfil her fantasy. This was extremely disrespectful and hurtful to me, I wasn't ready to have a child and I'm still not. AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's start by understanding the situation presented here. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for breaking up with his pregnant girlfriend. Let me break down the key points.\n\nFirst, there's the background: the author and his girlfriend, C, were in a high school relationship. C has a difficult past\u2014her father abandoned her, her mother committed suicide, and she was raised by devout Catholic grandparents. She's also been diagnosed with bipolar disorder, which might have contributed to her erratic moods. The author mentions that C was focused on marriage and having a family, but he wasn't interested in getting married. \n\nThey were sexually active, using oral contraceptives but not condoms. Then C was diagnosed with PCOS, which made her less likely to conceive. This worried her because of her strong desire to have a family. Later, she got pregnant and hid it until it was discovered. The author tried to convince her to get an abortion, which she eventually agreed to, but on the day they were about to go, her cat was run over, which she and her family saw as a divine sign to keep the child. The author then broke up with her.\n\nNow, the author is facing judgment for not being involved in his child's life. He feels wronged because he wasn't ready for a child and felt C was being selfish. He hasn't seen his son, N, much, but pays child support. His parents are involved, and N is starting school and asking about his dad.\n\nThe main ethical questions here revolve around responsibility, consent, and the aftermath of a broken relationship, especially involving a child. Let's consider both sides.\n\nFrom the author's perspective, he wasn't ready to be a father and felt that C tricked him into a situation he didn't want. He might believe that his autonomy was violated when he wasn't given a choice in having a child. He might feel that he acted in the best interest by leaving the relationship to avoid being a father under unwanted circumstances. However, by doing so, he's not involved in his child's life, which could be seen as neglectful.\n\nFrom the other side, C's situation is also complex. She had a traumatic background and mental health issues that might have influenced her decisions. She might have felt that having a child was her only way to fulfill her desire for a family, especially after her PCOS diagnosis. However, tricking the author into pregnancy could be seen as manipulative. The decision to keep the child after the abortion was called off might have been influenced by her religious beliefs and family, but it changed the trajectory of both their lives without the author's consent.\n\nLegally, in many places, a father has certain responsibilities even if he wasn't involved during the pregnancy. The author is paying child support, which he must by law, but his lack of involvement beyond that could be seen as harmful to the child's well-being. Children generally benefit from having a relationship with both parents, unless there are valid safety concerns. The author mentions feeling guilty when N says his dad doesn't play with him, which indicates some emotional conflict.\n\nMoral considerations vary. Some might argue that the author is being selfish for cutting off contact, as the child has a right to know and have a relationship with his father. Others might empathize with the author's position if he genuinely didn't want to be a parent and felt forced into it. However, the act of breaking up and not engaging could be seen as abandoning responsibility, even if the initial situation was unwanted.\n\nThe deception by C is a critical point. She hid the pregnancy and the abortion details, which could be seen as a breach of trust. However, the author also didn't use protection, which contributed to the situation. The cat incident leading them to keep the child is a pivotal moment where the author decided to leave, but that event seems to have been out of their control, adding a layer of unpredictability to the situation.\n\nIn terms of responsibility, once a child is born, the father has a lifelong duty towards the child's welfare. While the author isn't in a relationship with C anymore, the child's well-being is a separate issue. The author's decision to not engage could be impacting N's life negatively, especially with the child expressing confusion about his father's absence.\n\nThe societal judgment the author faces is another aspect. While he feels wronged, society often places a high value on parental responsibility. The author's actions could be viewed as avoiding that responsibility, which is seen as wrong, regardless of the initial circumstances.\n\nIn summary, the author's decision to break up and not engage in a paternal relationship could be considered wrong from a moral standpoint because it affects the child's life. However, the initial circumstances involved deception and conflicting desires, which complicates the judgment. The key is whether avoiding responsibility for the child's upbringing is the right choice, regardless of the initial conflict.\n"
