C had a rather rough upbringing. Her father abandoned her as a child and her mother committed suicide by jumping in front of a train (only a few years before our relationship began). C was left to be cared by her grandparents who were devout Catholics. As a result C became highly religious herself. However, C has bipolar disorder. This wasn't obvious and manifested as erratic moods. \n\nAnyway, C had it in her head that she wanted to get married and have a family. At first she was patient because she thought I'd propose. When it became clear that I wasn't interested in doing so, C started to panic. C became more aggressive about it and we started to argue. Eventually C seemed to give up. But we were still sexually active. C had been taking oral contraceptives and we never used condoms (my bad) and I never thought anything of it. Then one day C was diagnosed with Polycystic Ovary Syndrome. She was told by a doctor that she'd be much less likely to conceive. This affected C deeply as she was more or less obsessed with the idea of starting a family. \n\nFast forward about 5 months (I don't remember exactly how long but it was a significant amount of time). It became clear that C was pregnant (with my child!). She succeeded in hiding it up until this point. When confronted she vehemently denied knowing she was pregnant and acted as surprised as anyone. Shocked and at a loss, I pleaded with her to get an abortion and pretty much gave her an ultimatum-me or the baby! It was all very emotional but finally I convinced C to get an abortion. Most doctors refused to perform the abortion this late into the pregnancy but were doctors in Melbourne who would do it. \n\nSo I booked plane tickets. It was all good to go. The morning of the flight, C was packed and literally getting into the car with her grandparents to be taken to the airport. Now get this, as they rolled out of the driveway, C's cat happened to be sitting behind the car. The cat was run over and died. C and her grandparents were shocked and saw no other option than to take this event as the occurrence a miracle (imagine that!) In their eyes it was confirmed-God wanted C to keep her child.\n\nSo she did. And I broke up with her shortly after. A few months later C gave birth to our son named N but I refused to take part. I haven't really talked to C since. I have been paying child support. To this day I have not so much as talked to N, although I have seen him a couple of times, despite that my parents see him and take care of him often. \n\nBasically everyone I know has judged me for abandoning my child and nobody hesitates to tell me I'm in the wrong. A lot of people have lost respect for me and see my continued lack of contact with my child as immoral. I've got into many fights with my parents over this and no longer live with them due to the discord. \n\nN is 5 years old now and stating to talk and go to school. Recently I was told by my mother that when N was playing with other children he was asked about his 'daddy' to which he replied: 'my daddy doesn't play with me'. This is concerning for me to hear and I can't help but feel guilty to some degree. However, I still feel that I've been wronged and at this stage it would be very difficult for me to reverse my decision. I have been firm about my decision all along and have no intention of validating C's disrespect for me by changing my mind now. I never wanted to have a child and she knew all along. She was being incredibly selfish, no matter how selfish I'm being now. \n\nBefore judging me I implore you to consider my perspective. I had no say in the matter and C deceived me (and everyone else) in order to fulfil her fantasy. This was extremely disrespectful and hurtful to me, I wasn't ready to have a child and I'm still not. AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. The situation is pretty complex, so I need to break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, the author and his ex-girlfriend C were in a high school relationship that lasted three years. C had a tough childhood with her father abandoning her and her mother committing suicide. She was raised by devout Catholic grandparents and has bipolar disorder, which affected her moods. She wanted to get married and have a family, but the author wasn't interested in marriage. When C was diagnosed with PCOS, which made pregnancy less likely, she became more determined. They had unprotected sex, and she got pregnant despite using birth control. The author didn't realize she was pregnant until later.\n\nWhen confronted, C denied knowing about the pregnancy and acted surprised. The author then pressured her to get an abortion, which she agreed to. They were on their way to the airport when the cat was hit by the car, which they took as a sign from God to keep the child. The author then broke up with her, refused to be part of the child's life, and only pays child support. Now the child is 5, and the author feels guilty when the child says his dad doesn't play with him, but he still refuses to change his stance.\n\nSo, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. Let's look at both sides.\n\nOn the author's side: He wasn't ready for a child, felt pressured by C's desires, and was deceived about the pregnancy. He had a right to not want to be a parent, especially if he wasn't prepared. C's actions, like hiding the pregnancy and then changing her mind after the abortion plan, might be seen as manipulative. The author's decision to break up and not engage with the child could be seen as protecting his own autonomy and not wanting to be forced into parenthood.\n\nOn the other side: Once a child is born, there are societal and ethical responsibilities. The author is the biological father, and the child has a right to know their father. The author's refusal to be involved might harm the child emotionally. The fact that he pays child support is a legal obligation, but emotional absence can be damaging. Also, C's mental health issues and past trauma might have contributed to her actions, but that doesn't excuse the author's current stance on not being involved.\n\nThe author claims he wasn't ready, but becoming a parent is a reality once the child is born. Even if he didn't want the child, he has a responsibility towards the child's well-being. The child's emotional needs are important, and the author's absence could be causing harm. The author's parents are involved, which is good, but the child's direct relationship with the father is also significant.\n\nThe author's justification is that he wasn't ready and that C was selfish. However, C's mental health and past trauma might have impaired her judgment, but the author is still a parent. The decision to not engage with the child could be seen as neglecting his parental duties. Even if he feels wronged, the child is innocent in this and deserves a relationship with both parents if possible.\n\nIn terms of the law, in many places, fathers have responsibilities towards their children regardless of their relationship with the mother. So legally, he's doing his part with support, but emotionally and socially, he's absent. The author's stance is firm, but the child's well-being might suffer from this absence.\n\nSo, considering all angles, while the author might have felt wronged initially, as a parent, he has responsibilities that go beyond his personal readiness. The child's needs and rights as a person are important, and the author's refusal to engage could be seen as neglecting those responsibilities. Therefore, the author might be in the wrong despite his initial circumstances.\n"
