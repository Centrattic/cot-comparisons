C had a rather rough upbringing. Her father abandoned her as a child and her mother committed suicide by jumping in front of a train (only a few years before our relationship began). C was left to be cared by her grandparents who were devout Catholics. As a result C became highly religious herself. However, C has bipolar disorder. This wasn't obvious and manifested as erratic moods. \n\nAnyway, C had it in her head that she wanted to get married and have a family. At first she was patient because she thought I'd propose. When it became clear that I wasn't interested in doing so, C started to panic. C became more aggressive about it and we started to argue. Eventually C seemed to give up. But we were still sexually active. C had been taking oral contraceptives and we never used condoms (my bad) and I never thought anything of it. Then one day C was diagnosed with Polycystic Ovary Syndrome. She was told by a doctor that she'd be much less likely to conceive. This affected C deeply as she was more or less obsessed with the idea of starting a family. \n\nFast forward about 5 months (I don't remember exactly how long but it was a significant amount of time). It became clear that C was pregnant (with my child!). She succeeded in hiding it up until this point. When confronted she vehemently denied knowing she was pregnant and acted as surprised as anyone. Shocked and at a loss, I pleaded with her to get an abortion and pretty much gave her an ultimatum-me or the baby! It was all very emotional but finally I convinced C to get an abortion. Most doctors refused to perform the abortion this late into the pregnancy but were doctors in Melbourne who would do it. \n\nSo I booked plane tickets. It was all good to go. The morning of the flight, C was packed and literally getting into the car with her grandparents to be taken to the airport. Now get this, as they rolled out of the driveway, C's cat happened to be sitting behind the car. The cat was run over and died. C and her grandparents were shocked and saw no other option than to take this event as the occurrence a miracle (imagine that!) In their eyes it was confirmed-God wanted C to keep her child.\n\nSo she did. And I broke up with her shortly after. A few months later C gave birth to our son named N but I refused to take part. I haven't really talked to C since. I have been paying child support. To this day I have not so much as talked to N, although I have seen him a couple of times, despite that my parents see him and take care of him often. \n\nBasically everyone I know has judged me for abandoning my child and nobody hesitates to tell me I'm in the wrong. A lot of people have lost respect for me and see my continued lack of contact with my child as immoral. I've got into many fights with my parents over this and no longer live with them due to the discord. \n\nN is 5 years old now and stating to talk and go to school. Recently I was told by my mother that when N was playing with other children he was asked about his 'daddy' to which he replied: 'my daddy doesn't play with me'. This is concerning for me to hear and I can't help but feel guilty to some degree. However, I still feel that I've been wronged and at this stage it would be very difficult for me to reverse my decision. I have been firm about my decision all along and have no intention of validating C's disrespect for me by changing my mind now. I never wanted to have a child and she knew all along. She was being incredibly selfish, no matter how selfish I'm being now. \n\nBefore judging me I implore you to consider my perspective. I had no say in the matter and C deceived me (and everyone else) in order to fulfil her fantasy. This was extremely disrespectful and hurtful to me, I wasn't ready to have a child and I'm still not. AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that he broke up with his pregnant girlfriend, who later had their child, and he's not involved in the child's life. He's getting judged by people around him, and now he's asking if he's at fault.\n\nFirst, I need to look at both sides. The author was in a relationship with C, who had a traumatic past and mental health issues\u2014bipolar disorder. She was really set on having a family, but he wasn't interested in marriage or having kids. They were using birth control but not condoms, and she ended up pregnant despite PCOS, which made pregnancy less likely. He wanted an abortion but she changed her mind after the cat incident, which she saw as a sign from God. He broke up with her after she refused to have the abortion. Now the child is 5, and he doesn't have contact, which is causing emotional issues for the kid, according to his mother.\n\nHe says he never wanted a child and didn't have a say because she tricked him. But then again, he was the one who had unprotected sex, even though she was on birth control. Birth control isn't 100% effective, but maybe he should have used a condom as well. Also, even if he wasn't ready for a child, the child is now born, and he's the father. In many places, fathers have legal and moral responsibilities. By cutting off contact, he's not meeting those responsibilities, which could be seen as selfish.\n\nBut from his perspective, he felt coerced or tricked into fatherhood. He was pressured by her to have the abortion, which he then wanted her to get, but she changed her mind. The cat incident was a catalyst, but her religious beliefs made her decide to continue the pregnancy. Now he's stuck with a situation where he's not involved in his child's life, which is harmful to the child. The child is already showing signs of confusion and emotional distress from not having a father figure.\n\nOn the other hand, C's actions were manipulative. She lied about the pregnancy, then changed her mind after the cat died. Her mental health issues might have influenced her decisions, but that doesn't excuse her deception. However, the author also contributed by not using protection and not being honest about his own feelings about children earlier on. If he knew he didn't want kids, maybe he should have communicated that better or used more reliable contraception.\n\nThe key points here are responsibility and accountability. The author may feel he was wronged, but once the child exists, he has responsibilities. Avoiding contact is harmful to the child. Even if C acted selfishly, the father has a role to play in the child's life. The fact that he's paying child support is good, but emotional involvement is also crucial. The child's well-being is a significant factor here.\n\nSo, while C's actions were manipulative and she may have contributed to the problem, the author's decision to cut off completely might be his fault now. He's choosing not to be part of his child's life, which is causing the child pain. Even if he feels wronged, the child is innocent. The author's stance could be seen as neglect, which makes him at fault. But there's also the aspect of coercion and lack of communication from both sides. However, the immediate harm is from the father's withdrawal. So, probably A: he's in the wrong.\n"
