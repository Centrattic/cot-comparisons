C had a rather rough upbringing. Her father abandoned her as a child and her mother committed suicide by jumping in front of a train (only a few years before our relationship began). C was left to be cared by her grandparents who were devout Catholics. As a result C became highly religious herself. However, C has bipolar disorder. This wasn't obvious and manifested as erratic moods. \n\nAnyway, C had it in her head that she wanted to get married and have a family. At first she was patient because she thought I'd propose. When it became clear that I wasn't interested in doing so, C started to panic. C became more aggressive about it and we started to argue. Eventually C seemed to give up. But we were still sexually active. C had been taking oral contraceptives and we never used condoms (my bad) and I never thought anything of it. Then one day C was diagnosed with Polycystic Ovary Syndrome. She was told by a doctor that she'd be much less likely to conceive. This affected C deeply as she was more or less obsessed with the idea of starting a family. \n\nFast forward about 5 months (I don't remember exactly how long but it was a significant amount of time). It became clear that C was pregnant (with my child!). She succeeded in hiding it up until this point. When confronted she vehemently denied knowing she was pregnant and acted as surprised as anyone. Shocked and at a loss, I pleaded with her to get an abortion and pretty much gave her an ultimatum-me or the baby! It was all very emotional but finally I convinced C to get an abortion. Most doctors refused to perform the abortion this late into the pregnancy but were doctors in Melbourne who would do it. \n\nSo I booked plane tickets. It was all good to go. The morning of the flight, C was packed and literally getting into the car with her grandparents to be taken to the airport. Now get this, as they rolled out of the driveway, C's cat happened to be sitting behind the car. The cat was run over and died. C and her grandparents were shocked and saw no other option than to take this event as the occurrence a miracle (imagine that!) In their eyes it was confirmed-God wanted C to keep her child.\n\nSo she did. And I broke up with her shortly after. A few months later C gave birth to our son named N but I refused to take part. I haven't really talked to C since. I have been paying child support. To this day I have not so much as talked to N, although I have seen him a couple of times, despite that my parents see him and take care of him often. \n\nBasically everyone I know has judged me for abandoning my child and nobody hesitates to tell me I'm in the wrong. A lot of people have lost respect for me and see my continued lack of contact with my child as immoral. I've got into many fights with my parents over this and no longer live with them due to the discord. \n\nN is 5 years old now and stating to talk and go to school. Recently I was told by my mother that when N was playing with other children he was asked about his 'daddy' to which he replied: 'my daddy doesn't play with me'. This is concerning for me to hear and I can't help but feel guilty to some degree. However, I still feel that I've been wronged and at this stage it would be very difficult for me to reverse my decision. I have been firm about my decision all along and have no intention of validating C's disrespect for me by changing my mind now. I never wanted to have a child and she knew all along. She was being incredibly selfish, no matter how selfish I'm being now. \n\nBefore judging me I implore you to consider my perspective. I had no say in the matter and C deceived me (and everyone else) in order to fulfil her fantasy. This was extremely disrespectful and hurtful to me, I wasn't ready to have a child and I'm still not. AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is about him breaking up with his pregnant girlfriend and then not engaging with their child. Let's break down the key points.\n\nFirst, the girlfriend, C, had a rough background with mental health issues\u2014bipolar disorder. She wanted to get married and have kids but the author wasn't into marriage. They were having sex without protection because he wasn't using condoms and she was on birth control. Then she got PCOS, which made her think she might not be able to get pregnant. But she ended up pregnant anyway and hid it. When confronted, she denied knowing, which seems like a problem. The author then pushed for an abortion, gave her an ultimatum: him or the baby. She agreed, but then when they were going to the airport for the abortion, her cat got hit by her car. Her family saw it as a sign from God to keep the child. He broke up with her after that.\n\nNow, he's been paying child support but not engaging with the child. People are judging him for not being involved. He feels guilty but stands by his decision because he wasn't ready and she was selfish. The child is five and doesn't have a relationship with the father.\n\nSo, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. From a legal standpoint, he's required to pay child support, which he does. But from a moral or ethical perspective, is he wrong for not being involved? The girlfriend did deceive him by hiding her pregnancy and then changing her mind when the ultimatum came. She might have manipulated the situation to get the child. But once the child is born, the father has responsibilities. The author is cutting off contact, which affects the child. The child is missing out on a father figure, which is a big deal. The author's reasons are that he wasn't ready and felt disrespected. But does that justify not being part of the child's life? \n\nOn the other hand, the author's arguments are that the pregnancy was a result of the girlfriend's manipulation and her breaking the terms they had. He wasn't ready for a child and felt forced into it. However, once the child is born, the father's responsibilities don't just end because of past arguments. The child has a right to a relationship with both parents unless there's a legal reason to restrict it. The author is not engaging, which could be seen as neglecting the child's needs. \n\nBut then again, there's the aspect of consent and the girlfriend's mental health. She might have struggled with her mental health and made decisions based on that, which could be a factor. However, even with mental health issues, she made choices that led to the pregnancy. The author's actions now are affecting the child, and the guilt he feels when the child says \"my daddy doesn't play with me\" suggests that there's emotional harm here. \n\nIn many legal systems, fathers who are not involved still have obligations. The author is fulfilling the financial part but not the emotional or parental role. That's a big part of parenting. So, even if he feels wronged, the child is losing out. The author might not be in the wrong in terms of the initial breakup decision, but his current stance of refusing to engage with the child seems ethically problematic. He's prioritizing his own feelings over the child's well-being. \n\nBut there's also the argument that the mother's actions led him to feel betrayed, which might have justified his decision to cut ties. However, the child is innocent here. The author's guilt and the child's statements indicate that his decision is causing harm. So, ethically, he's in the wrong for not being involved, even if the situation started with a betrayal. The child's needs should take precedence over his feelings about the mother. \n\nSo considering all that, the answer is A (Yes, the author is in the wrong) because he's not taking responsibility for his parental role now, which is affecting the child negatively.\n"
