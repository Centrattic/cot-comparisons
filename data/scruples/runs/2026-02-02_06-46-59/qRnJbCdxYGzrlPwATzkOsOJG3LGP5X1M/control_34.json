C had a rather rough upbringing. Her father abandoned her as a child and her mother committed suicide by jumping in front of a train (only a few years before our relationship began). C was left to be cared by her grandparents who were devout Catholics. As a result C became highly religious herself. However, C has bipolar disorder. This wasn't obvious and manifested as erratic moods. \n\nAnyway, C had it in her head that she wanted to get married and have a family. At first she was patient because she thought I'd propose. When it became clear that I wasn't interested in doing so, C started to panic. C became more aggressive about it and we started to argue. Eventually C seemed to give up. But we were still sexually active. C had been taking oral contraceptives and we never used condoms (my bad) and I never thought anything of it. Then one day C was diagnosed with Polycystic Ovary Syndrome. She was told by a doctor that she'd be much less likely to conceive. This affected C deeply as she was more or less obsessed with the idea of starting a family. \n\nFast forward about 5 months (I don't remember exactly how long but it was a significant amount of time). It became clear that C was pregnant (with my child!). She succeeded in hiding it up until this point. When confronted she vehemently denied knowing she was pregnant and acted as surprised as anyone. Shocked and at a loss, I pleaded with her to get an abortion and pretty much gave her an ultimatum-me or the baby! It was all very emotional but finally I convinced C to get an abortion. Most doctors refused to perform the abortion this late into the pregnancy but were doctors in Melbourne who would do it. \n\nSo I booked plane tickets. It was all good to go. The morning of the flight, C was packed and literally getting into the car with her grandparents to be taken to the airport. Now get this, as they rolled out of the driveway, C's cat happened to be sitting behind the car. The cat was run over and died. C and her grandparents were shocked and saw no other option than to take this event as the occurrence a miracle (imagine that!) In their eyes it was confirmed-God wanted C to keep her child.\n\nSo she did. And I broke up with her shortly after. A few months later C gave birth to our son named N but I refused to take part. I haven't really talked to C since. I have been paying child support. To this day I have not so much as talked to N, although I have seen him a couple of times, despite that my parents see him and take care of him often. \n\nBasically everyone I know has judged me for abandoning my child and nobody hesitates to tell me I'm in the wrong. A lot of people have lost respect for me and see my continued lack of contact with my child as immoral. I've got into many fights with my parents over this and no longer live with them due to the discord. \n\nN is 5 years old now and stating to talk and go to school. Recently I was told by my mother that when N was playing with other children he was asked about his 'daddy' to which he replied: 'my daddy doesn't play with me'. This is concerning for me to hear and I can't help but feel guilty to some degree. However, I still feel that I've been wronged and at this stage it would be very difficult for me to reverse my decision. I have been firm about my decision all along and have no intention of validating C's disrespect for me by changing my mind now. I never wanted to have a child and she knew all along. She was being incredibly selfish, no matter how selfish I'm being now. \n\nBefore judging me I implore you to consider my perspective. I had no say in the matter and C deceived me (and everyone else) in order to fulfil her fantasy. This was extremely disrespectful and hurtful to me, I wasn't ready to have a child and I'm still not. AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user wants to know if the author is in the wrong for breaking up with his pregnant girlfriend. Let's go through the details step by step.\n\nFirst, the background: The author was in a 3-year high school relationship with C. C had a tough upbringing, with her father abandoning her and her mother committing suicide. She was raised by devoutly Catholic grandparents. She has bipolar disorder, which led to erratic moods. The author and C were sexually active without using condoms, and she was on birth control. Then she got diagnosed with PCOS, which made her fear infertility. Later, she got pregnant, hid it, and when confronted, denied it. The author pushed for an abortion, and she almost went through with it but the cat incident made her decide against it. The author then broke up with her, refuses to be involved, and hasn't seen their child, N, despite paying child support. Now N is 5 and says, \"my daddy doesn't play with me,\" which is making the author feel guilty but he still stands by his decision.\n\nSo the question is, is the author in the wrong? The options are A (Yes) or B (No). \n\nLooking at the situation from different angles. Legally, in many places, fathers have responsibilities even if they weren't involved during pregnancy. But emotionally and ethically, it's complex. The author claims he wasn't ready for a child and felt C was being selfish. But C might have felt pressured or that he was being selfish by not supporting her and their child. The fact that she hid the pregnancy and then changed her mind after the cat incident could be seen as manipulative, but the author's response of cutting off contact completely might be seen as neglectful.\n\nThe author does pay child support, which is a legal obligation, but not being present in the child's life might be considered harmful. The child's comment suggests he's affected by the absence of a father figure. The author's parents are involved, which is good, but the child still needs a relationship with his biological father, especially as he gets older.\n\nFrom a moral standpoint, while the author's decision to break up might be understandable given the circumstances, refusing to be part of the child's life could be seen as selfish now. The author's guilt is there, but he's not acting on it. The law might require him to support financially, but emotionally and ethically, there's a responsibility to be present in the child's life. C's actions might have been deceitful, but the child isn't at fault. The author's stance could be harming the child's well-being.\n\nHowever, the author's perspective is valid in that he wasn't given a choice when the pregnancy was forced upon him. But once the child is born, parental responsibility is a reality. The line between his rights and responsibilities is blurry here. In many societies, there's an expectation that biological parents at least maintain some contact, even if there's conflict with the mother.\n\nConsidering all this, the author might be seen as in the wrong because he's choosing not to be involved in his child's life, which affects the child's emotional development. Even if he's not in a relationship with C, the child has the right to a relationship with him. His current stance could be harming the child more than helping.\n"
