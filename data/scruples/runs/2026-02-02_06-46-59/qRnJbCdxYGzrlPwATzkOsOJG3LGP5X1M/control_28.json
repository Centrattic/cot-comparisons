C had a rather rough upbringing. Her father abandoned her as a child and her mother committed suicide by jumping in front of a train (only a few years before our relationship began). C was left to be cared by her grandparents who were devout Catholics. As a result C became highly religious herself. However, C has bipolar disorder. This wasn't obvious and manifested as erratic moods. \n\nAnyway, C had it in her head that she wanted to get married and have a family. At first she was patient because she thought I'd propose. When it became clear that I wasn't interested in doing so, C started to panic. C became more aggressive about it and we started to argue. Eventually C seemed to give up. But we were still sexually active. C had been taking oral contraceptives and we never used condoms (my bad) and I never thought anything of it. Then one day C was diagnosed with Polycystic Ovary Syndrome. She was told by a doctor that she'd be much less likely to conceive. This affected C deeply as she was more or less obsessed with the idea of starting a family. \n\nFast forward about 5 months (I don't remember exactly how long but it was a significant amount of time). It became clear that C was pregnant (with my child!). She succeeded in hiding it up until this point. When confronted she vehemently denied knowing she was pregnant and acted as surprised as anyone. Shocked and at a loss, I pleaded with her to get an abortion and pretty much gave her an ultimatum-me or the baby! It was all very emotional but finally I convinced C to get an abortion. Most doctors refused to perform the abortion this late into the pregnancy but were doctors in Melbourne who would do it. \n\nSo I booked plane tickets. It was all good to go. The morning of the flight, C was packed and literally getting into the car with her grandparents to be taken to the airport. Now get this, as they rolled out of the driveway, C's cat happened to be sitting behind the car. The cat was run over and died. C and her grandparents were shocked and saw no other option than to take this event as the occurrence a miracle (imagine that!) In their eyes it was confirmed-God wanted C to keep her child.\n\nSo she did. And I broke up with her shortly after. A few months later C gave birth to our son named N but I refused to take part. I haven't really talked to C since. I have been paying child support. To this day I have not so much as talked to N, although I have seen him a couple of times, despite that my parents see him and take care of him often. \n\nBasically everyone I know has judged me for abandoning my child and nobody hesitates to tell me I'm in the wrong. A lot of people have lost respect for me and see my continued lack of contact with my child as immoral. I've got into many fights with my parents over this and no longer live with them due to the discord. \n\nN is 5 years old now and stating to talk and go to school. Recently I was told by my mother that when N was playing with other children he was asked about his 'daddy' to which he replied: 'my daddy doesn't play with me'. This is concerning for me to hear and I can't help but feel guilty to some degree. However, I still feel that I've been wronged and at this stage it would be very difficult for me to reverse my decision. I have been firm about my decision all along and have no intention of validating C's disrespect for me by changing my mind now. I never wanted to have a child and she knew all along. She was being incredibly selfish, no matter how selfish I'm being now. \n\nBefore judging me I implore you to consider my perspective. I had no say in the matter and C deceived me (and everyone else) in order to fulfil her fantasy. This was extremely disrespectful and hurtful to me, I wasn't ready to have a child and I'm still not. AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is pretty complicated. So, the guy broke up with his pregnant girlfriend after she ended an abortion plan because her cat was run over, which she took as a miracle. Now he's not involved with their child, and people are judging him.\n\nFirst, I need to look at both sides. The author argues that he wasn't ready for a child and that the girlfriend was selfish for getting pregnant secretly and then changing her mind about the abortion. He feels like he had no say in the matter because she tricked him. But on the other hand, once the child is born, he's responsible for child support and there's the emotional impact on the child not having a father figure.\n\nLegally, he's paying child support, which is right. But emotionally and ethically, is it right to cut off contact with your child? Even if you didn't want the child, the child has a right to a relationship with their father. The author mentions feeling guilty when he hears the child say \"my daddy doesn't play with me,\" but he still refuses to change his stance. \n\nThe girlfriend's actions were definitely manipulative and selfish. She lied about the pregnancy and then changed her mind based on a perceived miracle. That's really problematic. However, the author's response seems extreme. By cutting off contact completely, he's denying the child a father. Even if he's not in love with the mother, the child deserves to have a relationship with both parents if possible. \n\nAlso, the author's reasoning now is that he doesn't want to validate her disrespect. But that seems like a justification for his own inaction. The child isn't at fault here. The author's parents are involved, which is good, but it's not the same as the father being present.\n\nSo, considering all this, the author is wrong. Even if the mother was at fault, the child shouldn't suffer. The author has a responsibility to his child beyond just financial support. Emotional and parental presence is crucial for the child's well-being. So, the answer should be A (the author is in the wrong).\n"
