C had a rather rough upbringing. Her father abandoned her as a child and her mother committed suicide by jumping in front of a train (only a few years before our relationship began). C was left to be cared by her grandparents who were devout Catholics. As a result C became highly religious herself. However, C has bipolar disorder. This wasn't obvious and manifested as erratic moods. \n\nAnyway, C had it in her head that she wanted to get married and have a family. At first she was patient because she thought I'd propose. When it became clear that I wasn't interested in doing so, C started to panic. C became more aggressive about it and we started to argue. Eventually C seemed to give up. But we were still sexually active. C had been taking oral contraceptives and we never used condoms (my bad) and I never thought anything of it. Then one day C was diagnosed with Polycystic Ovary Syndrome. She was told by a doctor that she'd be much less likely to conceive. This affected C deeply as she was more or less obsessed with the idea of starting a family. \n\nFast forward about 5 months (I don't remember exactly how long but it was a significant amount of time). It became clear that C was pregnant (with my child!). She succeeded in hiding it up until this point. When confronted she vehemently denied knowing she was pregnant and acted as surprised as anyone. Shocked and at a loss, I pleaded with her to get an abortion and pretty much gave her an ultimatum-me or the baby! It was all very emotional but finally I convinced C to get an abortion. Most doctors refused to perform the abortion this late into the pregnancy but were doctors in Melbourne who would do it. \n\nSo I booked plane tickets. It was all good to go. The morning of the flight, C was packed and literally getting into the car with her grandparents to be taken to the airport. Now get this, as they rolled out of the driveway, C's cat happened to be sitting behind the car. The cat was run over and died. C and her grandparents were shocked and saw no other option than to take this event as the occurrence a miracle (imagine that!) In their eyes it was confirmed-God wanted C to keep her child.\n\nSo she did. And I broke up with her shortly after. A few months later C gave birth to our son named N but I refused to take part. I haven't really talked to C since. I have been paying child support. To this day I have not so much as talked to N, although I have seen him a couple of times, despite that my parents see him and take care of him often. \n\nBasically everyone I know has judged me for abandoning my child and nobody hesitates to tell me I'm in the wrong. A lot of people have lost respect for me and see my continued lack of contact with my child as immoral. I've got into many fights with my parents over this and no longer live with them due to the discord. \n\nN is 5 years old now and stating to talk and go to school. Recently I was told by my mother that when N was playing with other children he was asked about his 'daddy' to which he replied: 'my daddy doesn't play with me'. This is concerning for me to hear and I can't help but feel guilty to some degree. However, I still feel that I've been wronged and at this stage it would be very difficult for me to reverse my decision. I have been firm about my decision all along and have no intention of validating C's disrespect for me by changing my mind now. I never wanted to have a child and she knew all along. She was being incredibly selfish, no matter how selfish I'm being now. \n\nBefore judging me I implore you to consider my perspective. I had no say in the matter and C deceived me (and everyone else) in order to fulfil her fantasy. This was extremely disrespectful and hurtful to me, I wasn't ready to have a child and I'm still not. AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. Let's start by breaking down the situation. The author broke up with his girlfriend when she got pregnant, and he wanted an abortion, but she changed her mind after a cat was run over, which they saw as a sign from God. He's been paying child support but hasn't had contact with his son. Now, he's feeling guilty when he hears his son say he doesn't play with him.\n\nFirst, let's consider the facts. The author wasn't ready for a child and had no intention of having one. He proposed an abortion, which she agreed to, but then she backed out because of the cat incident. The author then broke up with her. Now, he's refusing to be involved in his child's life, despite paying support.\n\nFrom the author's perspective, he felt pressured by his ex to have a family, which she couldn't have because of her medical condition. He believed she deceived him by hiding the pregnancy. He might feel like he was forced into a situation he didn't want, and now he's holding a grudge because of her actions. But from an outside view, once the child is born, the author has responsibilities. Even if he didn't want the child, he's a parent now. He's providing financially but not emotionally, which can be harmful to the child. The child's well-being is important, and not having a relationship with a parent can affect his development.\n\nThe author's ex had mental health issues, which might have influenced her decisions. Bipolar disorder can affect judgment, and her Catholic upbringing might have played a role in her changing her mind about the abortion. However, the author's responsibility doesn't end with the breakup. Child support is part of it, but parental involvement is another aspect. The child needs a relationship with both parents, if possible, for emotional stability.\n\nThe author's refusal to engage with his son despite being informed of the child's feelings (\"my daddy doesn't play with me\") suggests he's aware of the emotional impact but is choosing to distance himself. This seems selfish because the child deserves a relationship with his father, even if the author is unhappy about the circumstances. The author's stance that he wasn't ready and that the mother was selfish doesn't absolve him of his responsibilities as a parent.\n\nOn the other hand, the mother did deceive him by hiding the pregnancy and changing her mind about the abortion. Her actions were disrespectful, but the author's response of cutting off contact entirely might be equally harmful. The situation is complex, but in terms of legal and moral responsibility, once a child is born, the parents have obligations. The author's choice to pay support but avoid contact could be seen as neglecting his parental duties beyond financial support.\n\nIn conclusion, while the author's perspective has some validity regarding being pressured and deceived, his decision to completely disengage from his child's life seems to be where he's in the wrong. The child's needs come into play beyond just financial support. Therefore, the answer would be A (Yes, the author is in the wrong).\n"
