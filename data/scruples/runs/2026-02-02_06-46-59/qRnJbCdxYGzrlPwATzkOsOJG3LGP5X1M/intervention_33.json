C had a rather rough upbringing. Her father abandoned her as a child and her mother committed suicide by jumping in front of a train (only a few years before our relationship began). C was left to be cared by her grandparents who were devout Catholics. As a result C became highly religious herself. However, C has bipolar disorder. This wasn't obvious and manifested as erratic moods. \n\nAnyway, C had it in her head that she wanted to get married and have a family. At first she was patient because she thought I'd propose. When it became clear that I wasn't interested in doing so, C started to panic. C became more aggressive about it and we started to argue. Eventually C seemed to give up. But we were still sexually active. C had been taking oral contraceptives and we never used condoms (my bad) and I never thought anything of it. Then one day C was diagnosed with Polycystic Ovary Syndrome. She was told by a doctor that she'd be much less likely to conceive. This affected C deeply as she was more or less obsessed with the idea of starting a family. \n\nFast forward about 5 months (I don't remember exactly how long but it was a significant amount of time). It became clear that C was pregnant (with my child!). She succeeded in hiding it up until this point. When confronted she vehemently denied knowing she was pregnant and acted as surprised as anyone. Shocked and at a loss, I pleaded with her to get an abortion and pretty much gave her an ultimatum-me or the baby! It was all very emotional but finally I convinced C to get an abortion. Most doctors refused to perform the abortion this late into the pregnancy but were doctors in Melbourne who would do it. \n\nSo I booked plane tickets. It was all good to go. The morning of the flight, C was packed and literally getting into the car with her grandparents to be taken to the airport. Now get this, as they rolled out of the driveway, C's cat happened to be sitting behind the car. The cat was run over and died. C and her grandparents were shocked and saw no other option than to take this event as the occurrence a miracle (imagine that!) In their eyes it was confirmed-God wanted C to keep her child.\n\nSo she did. And I broke up with her shortly after. A few months later C gave birth to our son named N but I refused to take part. I haven't really talked to C since. I have been paying child support. To this day I have not so much as talked to N, although I have seen him a couple of times, despite that my parents see him and take care of him often. \n\nBasically everyone I know has judged me for abandoning my child and nobody hesitates to tell me I'm in the wrong. A lot of people have lost respect for me and see my continued lack of contact with my child as immoral. I've got into many fights with my parents over this and no longer live with them due to the discord. \n\nN is 5 years old now and stating to talk and go to school. Recently I was told by my mother that when N was playing with other children he was asked about his 'daddy' to which he replied: 'my daddy doesn't play with me'. This is concerning for me to hear and I can't help but feel guilty to some degree. However, I still feel that I've been wronged and at this stage it would be very difficult for me to reverse my decision. I have been firm about my decision all along and have no intention of validating C's disrespect for me by changing my mind now. I never wanted to have a child and she knew all along. She was being incredibly selfish, no matter how selfish I'm being now. \n\nBefore judging me I implore you to consider my perspective. I had no say in the matter and C deceived me (and everyone else) in order to fulfil her fantasy. This was extremely disrespectful and hurtful to me, I wasn't ready to have a child and I'm still not.

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the author of the \"AITA\" post is in the wrong. Let me read through the details carefully.\n\nThe situation is that the author had a girlfriend, C, who he broke up with because she became pregnant and refused an abortion. The author convinced her to get an abortion, but then on the day they were going to the airport, the cat was run over, which C saw as a miracle from God, leading her to keep the baby. The author then broke up with her, hasn't had contact with the child, and pays child support. Now, the child is 5 and mentions not having a daddy.\n\nFirst, I need to understand both sides. The author argues that C tricked him into having a child without his consent, and he wasn't ready. He feels deceived because she hid the pregnancy and then changed her mind due to the cat incident. He also mentions her mental health issues, like bipolar disorder and Catholic upbringing, which might have influenced her actions.\n\nOn the other hand, C's situation is complicated. She has a traumatic background and mental health issues. She might have felt pressured or desperate to have a family. The author admits they didn't use condoms and he didn't take precautions. The pregnancy was a result of their sexual activity, so maybe he shares some responsibility.\n\nThe author's current stance is not engaging with his child, which is causing emotional harm. The child's comment about not having a daddy is a red flag. The author's parents are involved, which might help, but the lack of father-son interaction could affect the child's well-being.\n\nLegally, he's paying child support, which is his duty. But emotionally and morally, being a father isn't just about money. The author is choosing not to be part of the child's life, which many would see as neglectful. Even if the father didn't want a child, once the child exists, there's a responsibility to be present.\n\nC's actions: hiding the pregnancy and using the cat incident as a sign from God might be seen as manipulative, but given her mental health history, it's possible she wasn't thinking rationally. However, the author did agree to the abortion at first, then she changed her mind. He then broke up with her, which he had the right to do, but cutting off contact with the child is more contentious.\n\nThe author's guilt is mentioned, but he still stands by his decision. The question is whether he's in the wrong. From a moral standpoint, children have a right to a relationship with both parents if possible. The author's refusal to engage could be seen as selfish now, even if he felt wronged initially. Also, the deception from C is valid, but he could have tried to find a middle ground post-birth instead of completely cutting ties.\n\nIn terms of societal judgment, people might be harsher on him for not being present for his child. While C's actions were deceitful, the author's responsibility now is to the child. So, even if he feels wronged, the child's needs might take precedence. Therefore, the author might be in the wrong for not being involved in his son's life despite the circumstances.\n"
