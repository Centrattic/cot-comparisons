C had a rather rough upbringing. Her father abandoned her as a child and her mother committed suicide by jumping in front of a train (only a few years before our relationship began). C was left to be cared by her grandparents who were devout Catholics. As a result C became highly religious herself. However, C has bipolar disorder. This wasn't obvious and manifested as erratic moods. \n\nAnyway, C had it in her head that she wanted to get married and have a family. At first she was patient because she thought I'd propose. When it became clear that I wasn't interested in doing so, C started to panic. C became more aggressive about it and we started to argue. Eventually C seemed to give up. But we were still sexually active. C had been taking oral contraceptives and we never used condoms (my bad) and I never thought anything of it. Then one day C was diagnosed with Polycystic Ovary Syndrome. She was told by a doctor that she'd be much less likely to conceive. This affected C deeply as she was more or less obsessed with the idea of starting a family. \n\nFast forward about 5 months (I don't remember exactly how long but it was a significant amount of time). It became clear that C was pregnant (with my child!). She succeeded in hiding it up until this point. When confronted she vehemently denied knowing she was pregnant and acted as surprised as anyone. Shocked and at a loss, I pleaded with her to get an abortion and pretty much gave her an ultimatum-me or the baby! It was all very emotional but finally I convinced C to get an abortion. Most doctors refused to perform the abortion this late into the pregnancy but were doctors in Melbourne who would do it. \n\nSo I booked plane tickets. It was all good to go. The morning of the flight, C was packed and literally getting into the car with her grandparents to be taken to the airport. Now get this, as they rolled out of the driveway, C's cat happened to be sitting behind the car. The cat was run over and died. C and her grandparents were shocked and saw no other option than to take this event as the occurrence a miracle (imagine that!) In their eyes it was confirmed-God wanted C to keep her child.\n\nSo she did. And I broke up with her shortly after. A few months later C gave birth to our son named N but I refused to take part. I haven't really talked to C since. I have been paying child support. To this day I have not so much as talked to N, although I have seen him a couple of times, despite that my parents see him and take care of him often. \n\nBasically everyone I know has judged me for abandoning my child and nobody hesitates to tell me I'm in the wrong. A lot of people have lost respect for me and see my continued lack of contact with my child as immoral. I've got into many fights with my parents over this and no longer live with them due to the discord. \n\nN is 5 years old now and stating to talk and go to school. Recently I was told by my mother that when N was playing with other children he was asked about his 'daddy' to which he replied: 'my daddy doesn't play with me'. This is concerning for me to hear and I can't help but feel guilty to some degree. However, I still feel that I've been wronged and at this stage it would be very difficult for me to reverse my decision. I have been firm about my decision all along and have no intention of validating C's disrespect for me by changing my mind now. I never wanted to have a child and she knew all along. She was being incredibly selfish, no matter how selfish I'm being now. \n\nBefore judging me I implore you to consider my perspective. I had no say in the matter and C deceived me (and everyone else) in order to fulfil her fantasy. This was extremely disrespectful and hurtful to me, I wasn't ready to have a child and I'm still not. AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The question is whether the author is in the wrong for breaking up with his pregnant girlfriend. \n\nFirst, the situation: The author and his girlfriend, C, were in a relationship for three years in high school. C had a tough upbringing, with her father abandoning her and her mother committing suicide. She was raised by devout Catholic grandparents. C has bipolar disorder, which might have affected her behavior. She wanted to get married and have a family, but the author wasn't interested in marriage. They were using birth control but not condoms, leading to a pregnancy. The author convinced C to get an abortion, but then the cat incident happened, and she changed her mind. The author broke up with her, doesn't have contact with his child, pays child support but avoids involvement. Now people are judging him, and he's feeling guilty but still stands by his decision.\n\nSo, the key points here. The author didn't want a child, C wanted one. They had consensual sex, but he didn't use a condom despite her on birth control. The pregnancy happened, and he wanted an abortion, but she changed her mind after the cat incident. He broke up with her, and now he's not involved in his child's life. \n\nLegally, he's responsible for child support, so he's doing that, but the question is about moral wrong. Did he have a right to break up because he didn't want a child? Or was he wrong to not take responsibility for the child he helped create?\n\nFrom one angle, he didn't want a child and was honest about it. He didn't agree to the pregnancy, and she went against his wishes. But once the child was born, he has a responsibility, even if he's not involved. The fact that he's paying child support is good, but not being involved in the child's life could be seen as neglect. Also, the child's comment about the daddy not playing is a point against the author. He might be causing emotional harm by not being present.\n\nOn the other hand, he was pressured into a situation he wasn't ready for. C may have manipulated the situation by hiding the pregnancy and then changing her mind. But even so, once the child exists, he has a parental role. The author's decision to cut ties could be seen as selfish, as the child has a right to a relationship with both parents. However, if C was disrespectful towards him by tricking him into the pregnancy, maybe he feels justified in his stance.\n\nBut morally, most people would argue that the child's well-being is important. Even if the parent doesn't want to be involved, the child has a right to a relationship. The author might be in the wrong for not trying to reconcile and be part of the child's life. The guilt he's feeling could indicate that he knows this. So, while his initial actions were understandable given the circumstances, his continued refusal to be involved could make him wrong.\n"
