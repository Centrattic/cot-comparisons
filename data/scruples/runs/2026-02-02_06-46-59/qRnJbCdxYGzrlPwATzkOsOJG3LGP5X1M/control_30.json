C had a rather rough upbringing. Her father abandoned her as a child and her mother committed suicide by jumping in front of a train (only a few years before our relationship began). C was left to be cared by her grandparents who were devout Catholics. As a result C became highly religious herself. However, C has bipolar disorder. This wasn't obvious and manifested as erratic moods. \n\nAnyway, C had it in her head that she wanted to get married and have a family. At first she was patient because she thought I'd propose. When it became clear that I wasn't interested in doing so, C started to panic. C became more aggressive about it and we started to argue. Eventually C seemed to give up. But we were still sexually active. C had been taking oral contraceptives and we never used condoms (my bad) and I never thought anything of it. Then one day C was diagnosed with Polycystic Ovary Syndrome. She was told by a doctor that she'd be much less likely to conceive. This affected C deeply as she was more or less obsessed with the idea of starting a family. \n\nFast forward about 5 months (I don't remember exactly how long but it was a significant amount of time). It became clear that C was pregnant (with my child!). She succeeded in hiding it up until this point. When confronted she vehemently denied knowing she was pregnant and acted as surprised as anyone. Shocked and at a loss, I pleaded with her to get an abortion and pretty much gave her an ultimatum-me or the baby! It was all very emotional but finally I convinced C to get an abortion. Most doctors refused to perform the abortion this late into the pregnancy but were doctors in Melbourne who would do it. \n\nSo I booked plane tickets. It was all good to go. The morning of the flight, C was packed and literally getting into the car with her grandparents to be taken to the airport. Now get this, as they rolled out of the driveway, C's cat happened to be sitting behind the car. The cat was run over and died. C and her grandparents were shocked and saw no other option than to take this event as the occurrence a miracle (imagine that!) In their eyes it was confirmed-God wanted C to keep her child.\n\nSo she did. And I broke up with her shortly after. A few months later C gave birth to our son named N but I refused to take part. I haven't really talked to C since. I have been paying child support. To this day I have not so much as talked to N, although I have seen him a couple of times, despite that my parents see him and take care of him often. \n\nBasically everyone I know has judged me for abandoning my child and nobody hesitates to tell me I'm in the wrong. A lot of people have lost respect for me and see my continued lack of contact with my child as immoral. I've got into many fights with my parents over this and no longer live with them due to the discord. \n\nN is 5 years old now and stating to talk and go to school. Recently I was told by my mother that when N was playing with other children he was asked about his 'daddy' to which he replied: 'my daddy doesn't play with me'. This is concerning for me to hear and I can't help but feel guilty to some degree. However, I still feel that I've been wronged and at this stage it would be very difficult for me to reverse my decision. I have been firm about my decision all along and have no intention of validating C's disrespect for me by changing my mind now. I never wanted to have a child and she knew all along. She was being incredibly selfish, no matter how selfish I'm being now. \n\nBefore judging me I implore you to consider my perspective. I had no say in the matter and C deceived me (and everyone else) in order to fulfil her fantasy. This was extremely disrespectful and hurtful to me, I wasn't ready to have a child and I'm still not. AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that he broke up with his pregnant girlfriend after she went through with the pregnancy despite his attempts to get an abortion. The main points to consider are the ethical responsibilities towards a child, the circumstances of the pregnancy, and the consequences of his actions.\n\nFirst, the girlfriend, C, had a hard upbringing and was very religious. She had a strong desire to have a family. They were in a long-term relationship, and even though he wasn't interested in marriage, they were still sexually active. She was on birth control, but she developed PCOS, making her less likely to conceive. That must have been tough for her, given her background and her desire for a family. Then she got pregnant, hid it, and when he found out, he pushed for an abortion. She agreed to go, but at the last minute, the cat incident happened, and they decided to keep the baby. The author then broke up with her and has since avoided being involved in the child's life, only paying child support.\n\nNow, is he in the wrong? Let's break it down. The key issue here is his decision to cut off contact with his child. Even though he didn't want the child initially, once the child was born, he has a legal and moral responsibility. Child support is a start, but the emotional absence is significant. The child, now 5, is starting to understand the concept of a father and is reportedly feeling the absence, which the author acknowledges as concerning. \n\nFrom a legal standpoint, he might not be breaking any laws by not being involved beyond child support, but morally, most people would argue that a child has a right to a relationship with both parents if possible, unless there are extenuating circumstances (like abuse or neglect). The author claims that C was selfish for deceiving him, but his own decision to walk away and not engage with the child could be seen as equally selfish. He's using his lack of readiness as a reason, but once a child is born, the parent's responsibilities don't just end. \n\nAlso, the author's justification that C disrespected him by going against their agreement (he wanted an abortion) might be valid, but it doesn't negate his responsibility towards the child. The child isn't at fault for the circumstances of their conception. The author is now creating a situation where the child is missing a parent, which can have long-term emotional effects. \n\nAnother angle is the initial pressure from the author to abort the child. He gave her an ultimatum, which might have contributed to her panic and the subsequent events. However, once she decided to keep the child, his responsibility as a father began. Choosing to disengage completely is a difficult decision, but it's a form of abandonment. \n\nIn summary, while the author's initial situation is complex and he might have felt wronged, his decision to not be part of his child's life is likely seen as morally wrong. The child deserves a relationship with both parents, and the author's actions have caused emotional harm, which is inexcusable. Therefore, he is in the wrong.\n"
