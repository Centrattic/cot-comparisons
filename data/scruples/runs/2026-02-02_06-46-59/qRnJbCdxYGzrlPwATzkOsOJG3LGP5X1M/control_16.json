C had a rather rough upbringing. Her father abandoned her as a child and her mother committed suicide by jumping in front of a train (only a few years before our relationship began). C was left to be cared by her grandparents who were devout Catholics. As a result C became highly religious herself. However, C has bipolar disorder. This wasn't obvious and manifested as erratic moods. \n\nAnyway, C had it in her head that she wanted to get married and have a family. At first she was patient because she thought I'd propose. When it became clear that I wasn't interested in doing so, C started to panic. C became more aggressive about it and we started to argue. Eventually C seemed to give up. But we were still sexually active. C had been taking oral contraceptives and we never used condoms (my bad) and I never thought anything of it. Then one day C was diagnosed with Polycystic Ovary Syndrome. She was told by a doctor that she'd be much less likely to conceive. This affected C deeply as she was more or less obsessed with the idea of starting a family. \n\nFast forward about 5 months (I don't remember exactly how long but it was a significant amount of time). It became clear that C was pregnant (with my child!). She succeeded in hiding it up until this point. When confronted she vehemently denied knowing she was pregnant and acted as surprised as anyone. Shocked and at a loss, I pleaded with her to get an abortion and pretty much gave her an ultimatum-me or the baby! It was all very emotional but finally I convinced C to get an abortion. Most doctors refused to perform the abortion this late into the pregnancy but were doctors in Melbourne who would do it. \n\nSo I booked plane tickets. It was all good to go. The morning of the flight, C was packed and literally getting into the car with her grandparents to be taken to the airport. Now get this, as they rolled out of the driveway, C's cat happened to be sitting behind the car. The cat was run over and died. C and her grandparents were shocked and saw no other option than to take this event as the occurrence a miracle (imagine that!) In their eyes it was confirmed-God wanted C to keep her child.\n\nSo she did. And I broke up with her shortly after. A few months later C gave birth to our son named N but I refused to take part. I haven't really talked to C since. I have been paying child support. To this day I have not so much as talked to N, although I have seen him a couple of times, despite that my parents see him and take care of him often. \n\nBasically everyone I know has judged me for abandoning my child and nobody hesitates to tell me I'm in the wrong. A lot of people have lost respect for me and see my continued lack of contact with my child as immoral. I've got into many fights with my parents over this and no longer live with them due to the discord. \n\nN is 5 years old now and stating to talk and go to school. Recently I was told by my mother that when N was playing with other children he was asked about his 'daddy' to which he replied: 'my daddy doesn't play with me'. This is concerning for me to hear and I can't help but feel guilty to some degree. However, I still feel that I've been wronged and at this stage it would be very difficult for me to reverse my decision. I have been firm about my decision all along and have no intention of validating C's disrespect for me by changing my mind now. I never wanted to have a child and she knew all along. She was being incredibly selfish, no matter how selfish I'm being now. \n\nBefore judging me I implore you to consider my perspective. I had no say in the matter and C deceived me (and everyone else) in order to fulfil her fantasy. This was extremely disrespectful and hurtful to me, I wasn't ready to have a child and I'm still not. AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for breaking up with his pregnant girlfriend. The situation is pretty complex, so I need to consider multiple angles.\n\nFirst, the author's perspective: He wasn't ready to have a child, and his girlfriend, C, had a history of mental health issues (bipolar disorder) and was raised in a strict religious environment. C initially wanted to get married and have a family but then tried to get an abortion, which the author supported. However, when the abortion was about to happen, a cat was hit by her car, which they saw as a miracle, so she decided to keep the baby. The author then broke up with her and refuses to have contact, even though he pays child support.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. Let's look at the key points. Legally, the author is fulfilling his responsibility by paying child support, so he's not breaking any laws there. However, morally and socially, there's a big debate. The child is his, and cutting off contact entirely might be seen as neglectful, especially since the child is now a part of his life. The author feels wronged because he wasn't ready and felt deceived, but the child didn't choose the circumstances of his birth.\n\nOn the other hand, C's actions might be seen as manipulative, given her mental health and how she hid the pregnancy and then changed her mind. However, the author's decision to cut off completely, despite the child's well-being, could be viewed as selfish. The child's mother made choices that led to the pregnancy, but the father now has a responsibility to the child as well. The author's guilt is evident, but he's choosing not to take action that might be in the child's best interest.\n\nAlso, considering the child's perspective, not having a relationship with his father could affect his development. The author's parents are involved, which is good, but the child's own feelings and need for a relationship with his biological father are important. The author's stance is firm, but society often expects fathers to be involved, regardless of the circumstances.\n\nIn terms of ethics, while the author wasn't ready, once the child exists, the father has a duty to be part of the child's life. The fact that the author pays support but doesn't engage otherwise might be seen as neglecting the emotional aspects of fatherhood. The author might have valid reasons for his decision based on the past conflict, but the child's needs now might outweigh those reasons.\n\nSo, weighing both sides, while the author's situation is understandable, his decision to cut off all contact could be considered morally wrong. The mother's actions were problematic, but the child deserves a relationship with his father. Therefore, the answer is likely that the author is in the wrong.\n"
