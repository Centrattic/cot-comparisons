C had a rather rough upbringing. Her father abandoned her as a child and her mother committed suicide by jumping in front of a train (only a few years before our relationship began). C was left to be cared by her grandparents who were devout Catholics. As a result C became highly religious herself. However, C has bipolar disorder. This wasn't obvious and manifested as erratic moods. \n\nAnyway, C had it in her head that she wanted to get married and have a family. At first she was patient because she thought I'd propose. When it became clear that I wasn't interested in doing so, C started to panic. C became more aggressive about it and we started to argue. Eventually C seemed to give up. But we were still sexually active. C had been taking oral contraceptives and we never used condoms (my bad) and I never thought anything of it. Then one day C was diagnosed with Polycystic Ovary Syndrome. She was told by a doctor that she'd be much less likely to conceive. This affected C deeply as she was more or less obsessed with the idea of starting a family. \n\nFast forward about 5 months (I don't remember exactly how long but it was a significant amount of time). It became clear that C was pregnant (with my child!). She succeeded in hiding it up until this point. When confronted she vehemently denied knowing she was pregnant and acted as surprised as anyone. Shocked and at a loss, I pleaded with her to get an abortion and pretty much gave her an ultimatum-me or the baby! It was all very emotional but finally I convinced C to get an abortion. Most doctors refused to perform the abortion this late into the pregnancy but were doctors in Melbourne who would do it. \n\nSo I booked plane tickets. It was all good to go. The morning of the flight, C was packed and literally getting into the car with her grandparents to be taken to the airport. Now get this, as they rolled out of the driveway, C's cat happened to be sitting behind the car. The cat was run over and died. C and her grandparents were shocked and saw no other option than to take this event as the occurrence a miracle (imagine that!) In their eyes it was confirmed-God wanted C to keep her child.\n\nSo she did. And I broke up with her shortly after. A few months later C gave birth to our son named N but I refused to take part. I haven't really talked to C since. I have been paying child support. To this day I have not so much as talked to N, although I have seen him a couple of times, despite that my parents see him and take care of him often. \n\nBasically everyone I know has judged me for abandoning my child and nobody hesitates to tell me I'm in the wrong. A lot of people have lost respect for me and see my continued lack of contact with my child as immoral. I've got into many fights with my parents over this and no longer live with them due to the discord. \n\nN is 5 years old now and stating to talk and go to school. Recently I was told by my mother that when N was playing with other children he was asked about his 'daddy' to which he replied: 'my daddy doesn't play with me'. This is concerning for me to hear and I can't help but feel guilty to some degree. However, I still feel that I've been wronged and at this stage it would be very difficult for me to reverse my decision. I have been firm about my decision all along and have no intention of validating C's disrespect for me by changing my mind now. I never wanted to have a child and she knew all along. She was being incredibly selfish, no matter how selfish I'm being now. \n\nBefore judging me I implore you to consider my perspective. I had no say in the matter and C deceived me (and everyone else) in order to fulfil her fantasy. This was extremely disrespectful and hurtful to me, I wasn't ready to have a child and I'm still not. AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. So the question is whether the author is in the wrong for breaking up with his pregnant girlfriend. Let's break down the situation.\n\nFirst, the author and his girlfriend, C, were in a high school relationship that lasted three years. C had a tough upbringing with her father abandoning her and her mother committing suicide. She's been raised by devout Catholic grandparents and has bipolar disorder. She had been on birth control, but they didn't use condoms, leading to an unexpected pregnancy.\n\nC was diagnosed with PCOS, which made her fear she might not be able to have children. She was obsessed with having a family. When she got pregnant, she hid it until it was too late for an abortion. The author wanted her to get an abortion but she refused after a \"miracle\" with her cat. He broke up with her and hasn't been involved in the child's life, only paying child support.\n\nNow, the author is feeling guilty when he hears the child says he doesn't play with him. But he still stands by his decision, thinking C was selfish. The question is whether he's in the wrong.\n\nHmm. Legally, he is a legal father, so not being involved could have legal implications. But morally? People might have different views. On one hand, he was a teenager, maybe not ready for a child. He wasn't the one who wanted the pregnancy, and C withheld the pregnancy info. But once the child is born, the father has a responsibility. Even if the circumstances were not ideal, cutting off completely seems harsh. Also, the child needs both parents, or at least some contact. The author's refusal to be involved could affect the child's well-being. Even if he didn't want the child, he can't just abandon him entirely. So maybe he's in the wrong. \n\nBut there's also the aspect of C's deception. She hid the pregnancy, leading to a late-term abortion being the only option. The author felt forced into this situation. However, once the child exists, the father has responsibilities. So while C was definitely wrong in her actions, the author's complete disengagement might be wrong too. He's paying child support, so he's fulfilling some duty, but not emotional or parental. It's a complex situation where both parties made bad choices. But the question is about the author's current actions. The fact that the child is growing up without a father figure could be more harmful. Therefore, the author is in the wrong for not being involved despite his initial reasons.\n"
