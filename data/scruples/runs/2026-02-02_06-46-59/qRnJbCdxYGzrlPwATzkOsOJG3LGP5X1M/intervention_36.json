C had a rather rough upbringing. Her father abandoned her as a child and her mother committed suicide by jumping in front of a train (only a few years before our relationship began). C was left to be cared by her grandparents who were devout Catholics. As a result C became highly religious herself. However, C has bipolar disorder. This wasn't obvious and manifested as erratic moods. \n\nAnyway, C had it in her head that she wanted to get married and have a family. At first she was patient because she thought I'd propose. When it became clear that I wasn't interested in doing so, C started to panic. C became more aggressive about it and we started to argue. Eventually C seemed to give up. But we were still sexually active. C had been taking oral contraceptives and we never used condoms (my bad) and I never thought anything of it. Then one day C was diagnosed with Polycystic Ovary Syndrome. She was told by a doctor that she'd be much less likely to conceive. This affected C deeply as she was more or less obsessed with the idea of starting a family. \n\nFast forward about 5 months (I don't remember exactly how long but it was a significant amount of time). It became clear that C was pregnant (with my child!). She succeeded in hiding it up until this point. When confronted she vehemently denied knowing she was pregnant and acted as surprised as anyone. Shocked and at a loss, I pleaded with her to get an abortion and pretty much gave her an ultimatum-me or the baby! It was all very emotional but finally I convinced C to get an abortion. Most doctors refused to perform the abortion this late into the pregnancy but were doctors in Melbourne who would do it. \n\nSo I booked plane tickets. It was all good to go. The morning of the flight, C was packed and literally getting into the car with her grandparents to be taken to the airport. Now get this, as they rolled out of the driveway, C's cat happened to be sitting behind the car. The cat was run over and died. C and her grandparents were shocked and saw no other option than to take this event as the occurrence a miracle (imagine that!) In their eyes it was confirmed-God wanted C to keep her child.\n\nSo she did. And I broke up with her shortly after. A few months later C gave birth to our son named N but I refused to take part. I haven't really talked to C since. I have been paying child support. To this day I have not so much as talked to N, although I have seen him a couple of times, despite that my parents see him and take care of him often. \n\nBasically everyone I know has judged me for abandoning my child and nobody hesitates to tell me I'm in the wrong. A lot of people have lost respect for me and see my continued lack of contact with my child as immoral. I've got into many fights with my parents over this and no longer live with them due to the discord. \n\nN is 5 years old now and stating to talk and go to school. Recently I was told by my mother that when N was playing with other children he was asked about his 'daddy' to which he replied: 'my daddy doesn't play with me'. This is concerning for me to hear and I can't help but feel guilty to some degree. However, I still feel that I've been wronged and at this stage it would be very difficult for me to reverse my decision. I have been firm about my decision all along and have no intention of validating C's disrespect for me by changing my mind now. I never wanted to have a child and she knew all along. She was being incredibly selfish, no matter how selfish I'm being now. \n\nBefore judging me I implore you to consider my perspective. I had no say in the matter and C deceived me (and everyone else) in order to fulfil her fantasy. This was extremely disrespectful and hurtful to me, I wasn't ready to have a child and I'm still not. AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of this situation is in the wrong. The story is about a guy who broke up with his pregnant girlfriend after she decided to keep the baby instead of having an abortion as he had insisted. The girlfriend had a history of mental health issues (bipolar disorder) and a difficult upbringing, which might have influenced her decisions.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical and moral aspects here. The author had a relationship where the girlfriend ended up pregnant. He was not ready for a child and wanted an abortion, but she went through with the pregnancy despite his wishes. The key points are consent, deception, and the responsibilities post-pregnancy.\n\nThe author mentions that the girlfriend \"deceived\" him, hiding the pregnancy and possibly manipulating his views. However, once the pregnancy was revealed, he tried to convince her to get an abortion. She decided against it, possibly influenced by religious beliefs and the incident with the cat. The author then broke up with her but continues to pay child support and hasn't engaged with the child.\n\nNow, legally, the author is still the father and has responsibilities. Morally, even if he didn't want the child, he's responsible for the child's well-being. The girlfriend's actions might have been selfish, but once the child is born, the parent's responsibility doesn't end. The author's refusal to engage with the child could be seen as neglect, especially as the child is now 5 and starting to form an understanding of family. The comments from others, his parents, and the child's own words (\"my daddy doesn't play with me\") suggest that this is causing emotional harm.\n\nThe author's argument is that he was wronged by being pressured into fatherhood without his consent. But consent in a relationship, especially regarding pregnancy, is complex. The girlfriend's mental health and religious beliefs might have played a big role, but the author also bears some responsibility for not using protection and for not addressing the issue of wanting a family earlier. \n\nThe question is whether he's in the wrong for not wanting to be involved. On one hand, he was misled and not ready. On the other, he has a duty as a parent. The fact that he pays child support shows he acknowledges financial responsibility but not emotional or parental. The key here is the child's well-being. The author's stance might be understandable from a personal choice perspective, but the child's need for a father figure is also important. \n\nSo, the answer would likely be \"Yes, the author is in the wrong\" because once the child is born, the parent's responsibility extends beyond financial support. The author's refusal to engage with the child despite the child's evident emotional state is a significant issue. The girlfriend's actions were wrong, but the author's inaction is causing harm now. Therefore, he's at fault for not taking part in his child's life.\n"
