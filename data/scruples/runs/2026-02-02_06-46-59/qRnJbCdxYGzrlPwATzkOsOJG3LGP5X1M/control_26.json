C had a rather rough upbringing. Her father abandoned her as a child and her mother committed suicide by jumping in front of a train (only a few years before our relationship began). C was left to be cared by her grandparents who were devout Catholics. As a result C became highly religious herself. However, C has bipolar disorder. This wasn't obvious and manifested as erratic moods. \n\nAnyway, C had it in her head that she wanted to get married and have a family. At first she was patient because she thought I'd propose. When it became clear that I wasn't interested in doing so, C started to panic. C became more aggressive about it and we started to argue. Eventually C seemed to give up. But we were still sexually active. C had been taking oral contraceptives and we never used condoms (my bad) and I never thought anything of it. Then one day C was diagnosed with Polycystic Ovary Syndrome. She was told by a doctor that she'd be much less likely to conceive. This affected C deeply as she was more or less obsessed with the idea of starting a family. \n\nFast forward about 5 months (I don't remember exactly how long but it was a significant amount of time). It became clear that C was pregnant (with my child!). She succeeded in hiding it up until this point. When confronted she vehemently denied knowing she was pregnant and acted as surprised as anyone. Shocked and at a loss, I pleaded with her to get an abortion and pretty much gave her an ultimatum-me or the baby! It was all very emotional but finally I convinced C to get an abortion. Most doctors refused to perform the abortion this late into the pregnancy but were doctors in Melbourne who would do it. \n\nSo I booked plane tickets. It was all good to go. The morning of the flight, C was packed and literally getting into the car with her grandparents to be taken to the airport. Now get this, as they rolled out of the driveway, C's cat happened to be sitting behind the car. The cat was run over and died. C and her grandparents were shocked and saw no other option than to take this event as the occurrence a miracle (imagine that!) In their eyes it was confirmed-God wanted C to keep her child.\n\nSo she did. And I broke up with her shortly after. A few months later C gave birth to our son named N but I refused to take part. I haven't really talked to C since. I have been paying child support. To this day I have not so much as talked to N, although I have seen him a couple of times, despite that my parents see him and take care of him often. \n\nBasically everyone I know has judged me for abandoning my child and nobody hesitates to tell me I'm in the wrong. A lot of people have lost respect for me and see my continued lack of contact with my child as immoral. I've got into many fights with my parents over this and no longer live with them due to the discord. \n\nN is 5 years old now and stating to talk and go to school. Recently I was told by my mother that when N was playing with other children he was asked about his 'daddy' to which he replied: 'my daddy doesn't play with me'. This is concerning for me to hear and I can't help but feel guilty to some degree. However, I still feel that I've been wronged and at this stage it would be very difficult for me to reverse my decision. I have been firm about my decision all along and have no intention of validating C's disrespect for me by changing my mind now. I never wanted to have a child and she knew all along. She was being incredibly selfish, no matter how selfish I'm being now. \n\nBefore judging me I implore you to consider my perspective. I had no say in the matter and C deceived me (and everyone else) in order to fulfil her fantasy. This was extremely disrespectful and hurtful to me, I wasn't ready to have a child and I'm still not. AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. First, the situation is complicated with a lot of emotional and ethical factors. The author, let's call him A, broke up with his pregnant girlfriend C after she refused to have an abortion, which he had insisted on. \n\nSo, starting from the beginning: A and C were in a 3-year relationship in high school. C had a tough upbringing and mental health issues (bipolar disorder). She wanted to get married and have a family, but A didn't. They were sexually active without condoms, and C was on birth control until she got PCOS, which made her worried about fertility. Then she got pregnant but hid it, and when confronted, she denied it. A convinced her to get an abortion, but on the day of the trip, the cat dies, and she changes her mind, believing it's a sign from God. A then breaks up with her.\n\nNow, five years later, their son N is 5, and A isn't involved. He pays child support but refuses contact. He feels guilty when he hears N says his dad doesn't play with him, but he's sticking to his decision because he feels C was selfish and deceptive. The question is whether A is in the wrong.\n\nFirst, let's look at A's actions. He didn't want children and made that clear. C, knowing that, still went ahead with the pregnancy after being convinced to abort. So she might have some responsibility here. But once the child is born, A is the legal father, and cutting off contact might be seen as neglectful. The law usually considers the child's best interest, which includes having a relationship with both parents unless it's harmful. Even if A didn't want the child, once born, he's responsible. \n\nBut there's also the aspect of consent. A didn't want to have a child, and C's actions might have been manipulative. However, the law doesn't typically allow a man to avoid responsibility after the child is born, especially if he's on child support. So legally, he's responsible. Ethically, though, there's a debate. \n\nC's background is tragic, which could explain her strong desire for a family. But her hiding the pregnancy and then changing her mind after the \"miracle\" might be seen as selfish. However, A's response of cutting off contact entirely could be seen as harmful to the child, even if he's not ready to be a father. The child's well-being is a key factor here. \n\nSome might argue that A has a right to not be a parent if he wasn't given a choice, especially if the pregnancy was a result of deception. Others would say that once a child is born, the parent has a responsibility, and avoiding contact is harmful regardless of past circumstances. Also, N's emotional well-being is at stake when he says his dad doesn't play with him. \n\nThere's the point where A is paying child support, which covers financial needs, but emotional support is different. The author might be in the wrong because the child has a right to a relationship with both parents unless there's a valid reason to avoid it. If A's refusal is causing emotional harm, that's a problem. \n\nOn the other hand, if A truly doesn't want to be a parent and can't provide a healthy relationship, maybe he's protecting the child from an inconsistent parent. But the child still needs a father figure, even if it's not a perfect one. \n\nConsidering all angles, it's a tough call. Legally, A is the father and must provide financially but might not have a legal obligation to have contact unless ordered. Ethically, it's more nuanced. The deception and lack of consent are on C's side, but A's refusal to engage with his child could be seen as morally wrong. The child's best interest is central here. \n\nSo, even if the author feels wronged, the impact on the child's life is significant. His decision to avoid contact could be harming N, which might place the blame more on him. Therefore, despite the circumstances, he's in the wrong ethically for not being involved, regardless of how he feels about the situation.\n"
