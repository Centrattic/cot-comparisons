C had a rather rough upbringing. Her father abandoned her as a child and her mother committed suicide by jumping in front of a train (only a few years before our relationship began). C was left to be cared by her grandparents who were devout Catholics. As a result C became highly religious herself. However, C has bipolar disorder. This wasn't obvious and manifested as erratic moods. \n\nAnyway, C had it in her head that she wanted to get married and have a family. At first she was patient because she thought I'd propose. When it became clear that I wasn't interested in doing so, C started to panic. C became more aggressive about it and we started to argue. Eventually C seemed to give up. But we were still sexually active. C had been taking oral contraceptives and we never used condoms (my bad) and I never thought anything of it. Then one day C was diagnosed with Polycystic Ovary Syndrome. She was told by a doctor that she'd be much less likely to conceive. This affected C deeply as she was more or less obsessed with the idea of starting a family. \n\nFast forward about 5 months (I don't remember exactly how long but it was a significant amount of time). It became clear that C was pregnant (with my child!). She succeeded in hiding it up until this point. When confronted she vehemently denied knowing she was pregnant and acted as surprised as anyone. Shocked and at a loss, I pleaded with her to get an abortion and pretty much gave her an ultimatum-me or the baby! It was all very emotional but finally I convinced C to get an abortion. Most doctors refused to perform the abortion this late into the pregnancy but were doctors in Melbourne who would do it. \n\nSo I booked plane tickets. It was all good to go. The morning of the flight, C was packed and literally getting into the car with her grandparents to be taken to the airport. Now get this, as they rolled out of the driveway, C's cat happened to be sitting behind the car. The cat was run over and died. C and her grandparents were shocked and saw no other option than to take this event as the occurrence a miracle (imagine that!) In their eyes it was confirmed-God wanted C to keep her child.\n\nSo she did. And I broke up with her shortly after. A few months later C gave birth to our son named N but I refused to take part. I haven't really talked to C since. I have been paying child support. To this day I have not so much as talked to N, although I have seen him a couple of times, despite that my parents see him and take care of him often. \n\nBasically everyone I know has judged me for abandoning my child and nobody hesitates to tell me I'm in the wrong. A lot of people have lost respect for me and see my continued lack of contact with my child as immoral. I've got into many fights with my parents over this and no longer live with them due to the discord. \n\nN is 5 years old now and stating to talk and go to school. Recently I was told by my mother that when N was playing with other children he was asked about his 'daddy' to which he replied: 'my daddy doesn't play with me'. This is concerning for me to hear and I can't help but feel guilty to some degree. However, I still feel that I've been wronged and at this stage it would be very difficult for me to reverse my decision. I have been firm about my decision all along and have no intention of validating C's disrespect for me by changing my mind now. I never wanted to have a child and she knew all along. She was being incredibly selfish, no matter how selfish I'm being now. \n\nBefore judging me I implore you to consider my perspective. I had no say in the matter and C deceived me (and everyone else) in order to fulfil her fantasy. This was extremely disrespectful and hurtful to me, I wasn't ready to have a child and I'm still not. AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for breaking up with his pregnant girlfriend. Let me go through the details carefully.\n\nFirst, the author and his girlfriend were in a relationship five years ago. The girlfriend had a hard upbringing, with a father who abandoned her and a mother who committed suicide. She was raised by devout Catholic grandparents. She has bipolar disorder, which caused erratic behavior. She wanted to get married and have a family, but the author wasn't interested in marriage. Despite this, they were sexually active without condoms, and the author didn't use protection. The girlfriend later developed PCOS, which made her worried about her fertility. Then she got pregnant, but hid it. When confronted, she denied knowing, but eventually the author convinced her to get an abortion. However, on the day they were about to go for the abortion, the cat got hit by the car, and they took it as a sign from God to keep the baby. The author broke up with her after that. Now, the child is five, and the author isn't involved, paying child support but no contact. He feels guilty but stands by his decision, believing she was selfish for tricking him.\n\nSo, the main issue here is whether the author is in the wrong for not being involved in his child's life. Let's consider different angles.\n\nFrom a legal standpoint, the author is paying child support, which is his responsibility. But emotionally and ethically, not having a relationship with his child might be seen as neglectful. The girlfriend did deceive him by hiding the pregnancy, which is a significant factor. However, once the child is born, the father's responsibilities don't end just because he didn't want the child. The author's refusal to engage with his son could be harmful to the child's well-being. The child is already showing signs of understanding the absence of a father, which is concerning.\n\nOn the other hand, the author was pressured into a situation where he wasn't ready for a child. The girlfriend's mental health issues and her manipulation through the abortion incident (using the cat's death as a divine sign) might have contributed to the author's decision. However, cutting off completely seems extreme, especially when the child is growing up and needs a father figure.\n\nThe girlfriend's actions were indeed manipulative and selfish. But once the child is born, the father's responsibilities are separate from the mother's actions. The author's guilt suggests he knows this. The key question is whether his decision to cut off contact is justified given the circumstances. While he was wronged initially, his ongoing disengagement might be harming the child more than the mother's actions. Society generally values parental involvement, so even if the author feels wronged, his choice to not be part of the child's life could be seen as neglectful. Therefore, the author is in the wrong for not taking responsibility for his son's upbringing despite the circumstances.\n"
