C had a rather rough upbringing. Her father abandoned her as a child and her mother committed suicide by jumping in front of a train (only a few years before our relationship began). C was left to be cared by her grandparents who were devout Catholics. As a result C became highly religious herself. However, C has bipolar disorder. This wasn't obvious and manifested as erratic moods. \n\nAnyway, C had it in her head that she wanted to get married and have a family. At first she was patient because she thought I'd propose. When it became clear that I wasn't interested in doing so, C started to panic. C became more aggressive about it and we started to argue. Eventually C seemed to give up. But we were still sexually active. C had been taking oral contraceptives and we never used condoms (my bad) and I never thought anything of it. Then one day C was diagnosed with Polycystic Ovary Syndrome. She was told by a doctor that she'd be much less likely to conceive. This affected C deeply as she was more or less obsessed with the idea of starting a family. \n\nFast forward about 5 months (I don't remember exactly how long but it was a significant amount of time). It became clear that C was pregnant (with my child!). She succeeded in hiding it up until this point. When confronted she vehemently denied knowing she was pregnant and acted as surprised as anyone. Shocked and at a loss, I pleaded with her to get an abortion and pretty much gave her an ultimatum-me or the baby! It was all very emotional but finally I convinced C to get an abortion. Most doctors refused to perform the abortion this late into the pregnancy but were doctors in Melbourne who would do it. \n\nSo I booked plane tickets. It was all good to go. The morning of the flight, C was packed and literally getting into the car with her grandparents to be taken to the airport. Now get this, as they rolled out of the driveway, C's cat happened to be sitting behind the car. The cat was run over and died. C and her grandparents were shocked and saw no other option than to take this event as the occurrence a miracle (imagine that!) In their eyes it was confirmed-God wanted C to keep her child.\n\nSo she did. And I broke up with her shortly after. A few months later C gave birth to our son named N but I refused to take part. I haven't really talked to C since. I have been paying child support. To this day I have not so much as talked to N, although I have seen him a couple of times, despite that my parents see him and take care of him often. \n\nBasically everyone I know has judged me for abandoning my child and nobody hesitates to tell me I'm in the wrong. A lot of people have lost respect for me and see my continued lack of contact with my child as immoral. I've got into many fights with my parents over this and no longer live with them due to the discord. \n\nN is 5 years old now and stating to talk and go to school. Recently I was told by my mother that when N was playing with other children he was asked about his 'daddy' to which he replied: 'my daddy doesn't play with me'. This is concerning for me to hear and I can't help but feel guilty to some degree. However, I still feel that I've been wronged and at this stage it would be very difficult for me to reverse my decision. I have been firm about my decision all along and have no intention of validating C's disrespect for me by changing my mind now. I never wanted to have a child and she knew all along. She was being incredibly selfish, no matter how selfish I'm being now. \n\nBefore judging me I implore you to consider my perspective. I had no say in the matter and C deceived me (and everyone else) in order to fulfil her fantasy. This was extremely disrespectful and hurtful to me, I wasn't ready to have a child and I'm still not. AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the person who wrote this is in the wrong. Let's break down the situation step by step.\n\nFirst, he was in a 3-year relationship with his girlfriend C. C had a tough childhood with her father abandoning her and her mother committing suicide. She's under the care of her grandparents who are devout Catholics, and she's also got bipolar disorder. They didn't use condoms because she was on birth control, but then she got diagnosed with PCOS, which made her worried about her fertility. So she secretly got pregnant.\n\nWhen confronted, she denied knowing about the pregnancy. He asked her to get an abortion and gave her an ultimatum: him or the baby. They were about to go to Melbourne for the abortion when the cat got run over, which they interpreted as a miracle from God, so she changed her mind. He then broke up with her and hasn't been involved with the child, only paying child support. Now he's feeling guilty because the kid doesn't know him as a dad and says \"my daddy doesn't play with me,\" but he's still sticking to his decision because he feels she was selfish and deceptive.\n\nSo the main points here are: the woman was hiding the pregnancy, he wanted an abortion but she changed her mind after a perceived miracle, he left her, hasn't been involved with the child, and is getting judged for it.\n\nNow, the question is whether he's in the wrong. Let's think about legal and ethical aspects. Legally, he might be required to pay child support, so that's correct. But emotionally and ethically, it's more complex. He argues that he wasn't ready for a child and she tricked him. However, by not using protection, he did contribute to the pregnancy. Also, even if she was being selfish, he has a responsibility towards the child. Abandoning the child could be seen as neglectful. The fact that he hasn't been involved despite the child's age might be considered harmful to the child's well-being. On the other hand, the situation was forced upon him due to her deception. But he could choose to be involved now, even if he wasn't before. The fact that the child is starting school and missing a father figure adds weight to the argument that he's being selfish now by not engaging. So maybe he's in the wrong because he's not taking responsibility for the child's emotional needs now, even if he had valid reasons before. But there's also the aspect of mutual responsibility in the relationship. He didn't use protection, so he shares some blame for the pregnancy. However, the key issue is whether he's in the wrong currently for not being involved. The answer might hinge on the idea that once a child is born, the parent has responsibilities beyond just financial support. So the answer might be A (he's in the wrong) because he's not engaging with the child and is contributing to the child's emotional distress.\n"
