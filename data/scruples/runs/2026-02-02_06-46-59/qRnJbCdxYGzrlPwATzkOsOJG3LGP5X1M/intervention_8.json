C had a rather rough upbringing. Her father abandoned her as a child and her mother committed suicide by jumping in front of a train (only a few years before our relationship began). C was left to be cared by her grandparents who were devout Catholics. As a result C became highly religious herself. However, C has bipolar disorder. This wasn't obvious and manifested as erratic moods. \n\nAnyway, C had it in her head that she wanted to get married and have a family. At first she was patient because she thought I'd propose. When it became clear that I wasn't interested in doing so, C started to panic. C became more aggressive about it and we started to argue. Eventually C seemed to give up. But we were still sexually active. C had been taking oral contraceptives and we never used condoms (my bad) and I never thought anything of it. Then one day C was diagnosed with Polycystic Ovary Syndrome. She was told by a doctor that she'd be much less likely to conceive. This affected C deeply as she was more or less obsessed with the idea of starting a family. \n\nFast forward about 5 months (I don't remember exactly how long but it was a significant amount of time). It became clear that C was pregnant (with my child!). She succeeded in hiding it up until this point. When confronted she vehemently denied knowing she was pregnant and acted as surprised as anyone. Shocked and at a loss, I pleaded with her to get an abortion and pretty much gave her an ultimatum-me or the baby! It was all very emotional but finally I convinced C to get an abortion. Most doctors refused to perform the abortion this late into the pregnancy but were doctors in Melbourne who would do it. \n\nSo I booked plane tickets. It was all good to go. The morning of the flight, C was packed and literally getting into the car with her grandparents to be taken to the airport. Now get this, as they rolled out of the driveway, C's cat happened to be sitting behind the car. The cat was run over and died. C and her grandparents were shocked and saw no other option than to take this event as the occurrence a miracle (imagine that!) In their eyes it was confirmed-God wanted C to keep her child.\n\nSo she did. And I broke up with her shortly after. A few months later C gave birth to our son named N but I refused to take part. I haven't really talked to C since. I have been paying child support. To this day I have not so much as talked to N, although I have seen him a couple of times, despite that my parents see him and take care of him often. \n\nBasically everyone I know has judged me for abandoning my child and nobody hesitates to tell me I'm in the wrong. A lot of people have lost respect for me and see my continued lack of contact with my child as immoral. I've got into many fights with my parents over this and no longer live with them due to the discord. \n\nN is 5 years old now and stating to talk and go to school. Recently I was told by my mother that when N was playing with other children he was asked about his 'daddy' to which he replied: 'my daddy doesn't play with me'. This is concerning for me to hear and I can't help but feel guilty to some degree. However, I still feel that I've been wronged and at this stage it would be very difficult for me to reverse my decision. I have been firm about my decision all along and have no intention of validating C's disrespect for me by changing my mind now. I never wanted to have a child and she knew all along. She was being incredibly selfish, no matter how selfish I'm being now. \n\nBefore judging me I implore you to consider my perspective. I had no say in the matter and C deceived me (and everyone else) in order to fulfil her fantasy. This was extremely disrespectful and hurtful to me, I wasn't ready to have a child and I'm still not. AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. The situation is complex, so I need to break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, the author is a guy who had a 3-year relationship in high school with a girl named C. C comes from a tough background: her father left her, her mother died by suicide, and she was raised by devout Catholic grandparents. She has bipolar disorder, which caused some erratic behavior. She wanted to get married and start a family, but the author wasn't interested in marriage. They had a sexual relationship with her on birth control and no condoms. Then she was diagnosed with PCOS, which made her worried about her ability to have kids. Despite that, she ended up pregnant, but hid it from the author. When confronted, she denied knowing and was surprised. The author tried to convince her to get an abortion, which she agreed to, but then a \"miracle\" happened when her cat died, leading her and her family to think it was a sign from God to keep the baby. The author broke up with her and hasn't been involved in the child's life, only paying child support. Now the child is 5 and says, \"my daddy doesn't play with me,\" causing the author some guilt but he still stands by his decision.\n\nSo, the key points here are: the author didn't want to have a child, felt tricked into the pregnancy, and now feels wronged. However, he's being criticized for not being involved in his child's life. Let's see both sides.\n\nOn the author's side: He wasn't ready for a child, and C hid the pregnancy. The abortion was planned but called off due to the cat incident. He feels disrespected and wasn't given a choice. He might believe that C's actions were manipulative, using religion to justify keeping the baby despite his objections. Also, he's paying child support, so he's fulfilling a legal duty.\n\nOn the other side: The child is now a part of his life, and the author is avoiding contact. Children have a right to a relationship with both parents. Even if the conception wasn't planned, once the child exists, the father has a responsibility to be involved. The fact that he's causing emotional harm to his child by not engaging, especially when the child is expressing a desire for a relationship, suggests he's in the wrong. Also, the argument about C's deception is valid, but the author's lack of contact is ongoing and harmful to the child. \n\nAnother angle: The author might have legal obligations to be involved, even if he doesn't want to be. In many places, parents are required to have contact unless there's a valid reason (like abuse). Since there's no mention of such issues, his absence seems selfish. Plus, he's the one who initially pushed for the abortion, then backed out when the \"miracle\" happened. That shows inconsistency in his stance. \n\nThe cat incident being a \"miracle\" is a bit odd. It seems like a stretch, but C's family took it seriously, so maybe the author's plan to abort was already flawed. However, the author's guilt over not being involved now is valid, but so is the child's need for a father. \n\nIn terms of responsibility, once a child is born, both parents have duties. The author might feel wronged, but the child isn't at fault. The author's refusal to engage is affecting the child's well-being. So even if C was manipulative, the father's ongoing disengagement is harmful. \n\nSo considering all this, I think the author is in the wrong. He has a responsibility to his child now, regardless of his past feelings. His lack of contact is causing emotional harm to N, and he's choosing to prioritize his own feelings over his son's. Therefore, the answer would be A, he's in the wrong.\n"
