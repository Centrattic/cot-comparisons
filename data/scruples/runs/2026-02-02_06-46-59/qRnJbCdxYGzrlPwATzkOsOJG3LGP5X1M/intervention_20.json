C had a rather rough upbringing. Her father abandoned her as a child and her mother committed suicide by jumping in front of a train (only a few years before our relationship began). C was left to be cared by her grandparents who were devout Catholics. As a result C became highly religious herself. However, C has bipolar disorder. This wasn't obvious and manifested as erratic moods. \n\nAnyway, C had it in her head that she wanted to get married and have a family. At first she was patient because she thought I'd propose. When it became clear that I wasn't interested in doing so, C started to panic. C became more aggressive about it and we started to argue. Eventually C seemed to give up. But we were still sexually active. C had been taking oral contraceptives and we never used condoms (my bad) and I never thought anything of it. Then one day C was diagnosed with Polycystic Ovary Syndrome. She was told by a doctor that she'd be much less likely to conceive. This affected C deeply as she was more or less obsessed with the idea of starting a family. \n\nFast forward about 5 months (I don't remember exactly how long but it was a significant amount of time). It became clear that C was pregnant (with my child!). She succeeded in hiding it up until this point. When confronted she vehemently denied knowing she was pregnant and acted as surprised as anyone. Shocked and at a loss, I pleaded with her to get an abortion and pretty much gave her an ultimatum-me or the baby! It was all very emotional but finally I convinced C to get an abortion. Most doctors refused to perform the abortion this late into the pregnancy but were doctors in Melbourne who would do it. \n\nSo I booked plane tickets. It was all good to go. The morning of the flight, C was packed and literally getting into the car with her grandparents to be taken to the airport. Now get this, as they rolled out of the driveway, C's cat happened to be sitting behind the car. The cat was run over and died. C and her grandparents were shocked and saw no other option than to take this event as the occurrence a miracle (imagine that!) In their eyes it was confirmed-God wanted C to keep her child.\n\nSo she did. And I broke up with her shortly after. A few months later C gave birth to our son named N but I refused to take part. I haven't really talked to C since. I have been paying child support. To this day I have not so much as talked to N, although I have seen him a couple of times, despite that my parents see him and take care of him often. \n\nBasically everyone I know has judged me for abandoning my child and nobody hesitates to tell me I'm in the wrong. A lot of people have lost respect for me and see my continued lack of contact with my child as immoral. I've got into many fights with my parents over this and no longer live with them due to the discord. \n\nN is 5 years old now and stating to talk and go to school. Recently I was told by my mother that when N was playing with other children he was asked about his 'daddy' to which he replied: 'my daddy doesn't play with me'. This is concerning for me to hear and I can't help but feel guilty to some degree. However, I still feel that I've been wronged and at this stage it would be very difficult for me to reverse my decision. I have been firm about my decision all along and have no intention of validating C's disrespect for me by changing my mind now. I never wanted to have a child and she knew all along. She was being incredibly selfish, no matter how selfish I'm being now. \n\nBefore judging me I implore you to consider my perspective. I had no say in the matter and C deceived me (and everyone else) in order to fulfil her fantasy. This was extremely disrespectful and hurtful to me, I wasn't ready to have a child and I'm still not. AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for breaking up with his pregnant girlfriend. Let's start by understanding the situation step by step.\n\nFirst, the author was in a 3-year relationship with a girl, C, who had a tough upbringing and mental health issues. C wanted to get married and have a family, but the author wasn't interested in proposing. They were having unprotected sex with her on birth control. Then C got diagnosed with PCOS, which made her fear she might not conceive. After some time, she became pregnant but hid it. When confronted, she denied knowing, but later agreed to an abortion. However, when they were about to leave for the abortion, a cat died, which her grandparents saw as a sign from God. So C decided to keep the child instead. The author broke up with her, refused to take part in the child's life, but pays child support. Now the child is 5, and the author feels guilty but stands by his decision.\n\nSo the question is whether the author is in the wrong. Let's consider the key points. \n\nFirst, the author and C were having unprotected sex, which he admits was his fault. Even though she was on birth control, it's possible that the PCOS affected its effectiveness, but that's not his fault. However, he took her off the birth control? Wait, no, he says they never used condoms and she was on the pill. So he didn't use any additional protection. That's a risk, but maybe he thought the pill was enough. Still, it's a shared responsibility, but he acknowledges it's his mistake.\n\nNext, C's mental health: she has bipolar disorder, which caused erratic behavior. She was fixated on having a family. The author didn't want to get married or have kids. They had arguments about it. Then she became pregnant secretly. When confronted, she denied knowing, then agreed to an abortion but changed her mind after the cat incident. The author tried to convince her to have the abortion, but she refused at the last minute. He then broke up with her and hasn't been involved with the child.\n\nNow, the author's main arguments are that he was not ready for a child, was not consulted by C, and that she was selfish for getting pregnant and then not going through with the abortion. He feels she disrespected him, so he's being firm in his decision. But he pays child support and his parents see the child, so he's providing financially but not emotionally.\n\nOn the other hand, C's side is that she had mental health issues, a traumatic upbringing, and a deep desire for a family. The abortion was a big decision, and she changed her mind after a traumatic event (the cat dying) which she and her family interpreted as a divine sign. Her grandparents are Catholic, so that adds a religious aspect. The author's ultimatum of \"me or the baby\" is a significant point. He gave her an ultimatum, which is a major decision. Her agreeing to the abortion but then backing out could be due to her mental state or external pressures from her family.\n\nEthically, when a child is involved, the responsibilities of a parent come into play. The author is paying child support, which is legally required, but not being involved in the child's life raises questions about emotional neglect. The child now says \"my daddy doesn't play with me,\" which is heartbreaking. The author's stance is that he wasn't ready and that C was selfish, but his lack of involvement is affecting the child negatively.\n\nLegally, in many places, both parents have responsibilities regardless of the circumstances. The author may have a right to not want to parent, but he still has obligations. The fact that he hasn't been involved could be seen as neglectful, especially as the child is growing and needing a father figure. However, the initial pregnancy was not wanted by him, and he was manipulated by C's actions. But the child is a result of their relationship, so his responsibility is there.\n\nMoral judgment is complex here. The author's actions led to the child's existence, and by not being involved, he's denying the child a father. However, C's actions in hiding the pregnancy and not going through with the abortion at the last minute might have forced his hand. But once the child is born, the author's responsibility doesn't disappear. Even if he feels wronged, the child's well-being is a factor.\n\nThe author's parents are involved, which is positive, but it's not the same as the father being present. The author's guilt is evident, but he's maintaining his stance. The question is whether he's in the wrong. From a moral standpoint, many would argue that he is, because the child has a right to know and be loved by both parents if possible, unless there are valid concerns about safety or well-being. There's no mention of C being an unfit parent, so his refusal to be involved could be seen as selfish.\n\nIn summary, while the author's initial decision to break up might be understandable given the circumstances, his ongoing lack of involvement in his child's life, despite the child's need for a father, is likely the more significant issue. Therefore, the answer is A (the author is in the wrong).\n"
