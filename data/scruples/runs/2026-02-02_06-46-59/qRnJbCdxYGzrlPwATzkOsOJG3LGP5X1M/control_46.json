C had a rather rough upbringing. Her father abandoned her as a child and her mother committed suicide by jumping in front of a train (only a few years before our relationship began). C was left to be cared by her grandparents who were devout Catholics. As a result C became highly religious herself. However, C has bipolar disorder. This wasn't obvious and manifested as erratic moods. \n\nAnyway, C had it in her head that she wanted to get married and have a family. At first she was patient because she thought I'd propose. When it became clear that I wasn't interested in doing so, C started to panic. C became more aggressive about it and we started to argue. Eventually C seemed to give up. But we were still sexually active. C had been taking oral contraceptives and we never used condoms (my bad) and I never thought anything of it. Then one day C was diagnosed with Polycystic Ovary Syndrome. She was told by a doctor that she'd be much less likely to conceive. This affected C deeply as she was more or less obsessed with the idea of starting a family. \n\nFast forward about 5 months (I don't remember exactly how long but it was a significant amount of time). It became clear that C was pregnant (with my child!). She succeeded in hiding it up until this point. When confronted she vehemently denied knowing she was pregnant and acted as surprised as anyone. Shocked and at a loss, I pleaded with her to get an abortion and pretty much gave her an ultimatum-me or the baby! It was all very emotional but finally I convinced C to get an abortion. Most doctors refused to perform the abortion this late into the pregnancy but were doctors in Melbourne who would do it. \n\nSo I booked plane tickets. It was all good to go. The morning of the flight, C was packed and literally getting into the car with her grandparents to be taken to the airport. Now get this, as they rolled out of the driveway, C's cat happened to be sitting behind the car. The cat was run over and died. C and her grandparents were shocked and saw no other option than to take this event as the occurrence a miracle (imagine that!) In their eyes it was confirmed-God wanted C to keep her child.\n\nSo she did. And I broke up with her shortly after. A few months later C gave birth to our son named N but I refused to take part. I haven't really talked to C since. I have been paying child support. To this day I have not so much as talked to N, although I have seen him a couple of times, despite that my parents see him and take care of him often. \n\nBasically everyone I know has judged me for abandoning my child and nobody hesitates to tell me I'm in the wrong. A lot of people have lost respect for me and see my continued lack of contact with my child as immoral. I've got into many fights with my parents over this and no longer live with them due to the discord. \n\nN is 5 years old now and stating to talk and go to school. Recently I was told by my mother that when N was playing with other children he was asked about his 'daddy' to which he replied: 'my daddy doesn't play with me'. This is concerning for me to hear and I can't help but feel guilty to some degree. However, I still feel that I've been wronged and at this stage it would be very difficult for me to reverse my decision. I have been firm about my decision all along and have no intention of validating C's disrespect for me by changing my mind now. I never wanted to have a child and she knew all along. She was being incredibly selfish, no matter how selfish I'm being now. \n\nBefore judging me I implore you to consider my perspective. I had no say in the matter and C deceived me (and everyone else) in order to fulfil her fantasy. This was extremely disrespectful and hurtful to me, I wasn't ready to have a child and I'm still not.

      "text": "Okay, so the user is asking whether the author of the story is in the wrong. Let me try to break this down.\n\nFirst, the situation: The author had a high school relationship that ended after a few years. His ex-girlfriend, C, had a tough upbringing and mental health issues, which might have influenced her decisions. She wanted to get married and have a family, but the author wasn't interested in marriage. They had a sexual relationship with contraception, but she developed polycystic ovary syndrome, which made pregnancy harder. Despite that, she got pregnant. The author convinced her to get an abortion, but before it happened, her cat got run over, which she and her grandparents saw as a sign to carry the baby to term. The author then broke up with her, refused to take part in the child's life, pays child support but no contact. Now, the child is 5 and says he doesn't have a father. The author feels guilty but still believes he's right.\n\nSo, the question is, is he in the wrong? Let's look at both sides.\n\nFrom the author's perspective: He wasn't ready for a child, didn't want one. C deceptively kept the pregnancy. He felt forced into a situation he didn't agree with. He might feel that his autonomy was violated. But he chose not to take part in the child's life, which could be seen as neglectful.\n\nOn the other hand, children have a right to know their parents. The author is a biological father, and cutting off contact entirely might be harmful to the child's well-being. Even if he didn't want the child, he has a responsibility. Also, the argument about C's mental health and the circumstances might affect the judgment. However, once a child is born, parental responsibility typically extends beyond just financial support.\n\nLegally, the author is paying child support, which is correct, but emotionally and ethically, having no contact could be seen as wrong. The child's emotional needs are important, and the author's refusal might be causing the child emotional harm. Also, the author's reasoning about C's actions\u2014calling her selfish\u2014might not fully account for her mental health issues, but that doesn't excuse his own lack of contact.\n\nThe author's stance is that he wasn't ready and felt disrespected. But once the child exists, the responsibilities change. Even if the father wasn't ready, he can't just disengage entirely. The child deserves a relationship with both parents, unless there are valid reasons to cut off contact for the child's safety, which isn't indicated here. So, the author's decision to not be involved might be seen as selfish now.\n\nConsidering societal views, most people would likely side with the child needing both parents. The author's guilt is evident, but his actions still leave the child without a father figure, which can have long-term effects. Therefore, the author is in the wrong for cutting off contact after the child's birth, even if he felt wronged initially. The initial situation might have some complexity, but the current impact on the child makes his stance problematic.\n"
