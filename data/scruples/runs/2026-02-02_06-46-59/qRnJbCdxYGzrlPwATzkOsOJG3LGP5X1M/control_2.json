C had a rather rough upbringing. Her father abandoned her as a child and her mother committed suicide by jumping in front of a train (only a few years before our relationship began). C was left to be cared by her grandparents who were devout Catholics. As a result C became highly religious herself. However, C has bipolar disorder. This wasn't obvious and manifested as erratic moods. \n\nAnyway, C had it in her head that she wanted to get married and have a family. At first she was patient because she thought I'd propose. When it became clear that I wasn't interested in doing so, C started to panic. C became more aggressive about it and we started to argue. Eventually C seemed to give up. But we were still sexually active. C had been taking oral contraceptives and we never used condoms (my bad) and I never thought anything of it. Then one day C was diagnosed with Polycystic Ovary Syndrome. She was told by a doctor that she'd be much less likely to conceive. This affected C deeply as she was more or less obsessed with the idea of starting a family. \n\nFast forward about 5 months (I don't remember exactly how long but it was a significant amount of time). It became clear that C was pregnant (with my child!). She succeeded in hiding it up until this point. When confronted she vehemently denied knowing she was pregnant and acted as surprised as anyone. Shocked and at a loss, I pleaded with her to get an abortion and pretty much gave her an ultimatum-me or the baby! It was all very emotional but finally I convinced C to get an abortion. Most doctors refused to perform the abortion this late into the pregnancy but were doctors in Melbourne who would do it. \n\nSo I booked plane tickets. It was all good to go. The morning of the flight, C was packed and literally getting into the car with her grandparents to be taken to the airport. Now get this, as they rolled out of the driveway, C's cat happened to be sitting behind the car. The cat was run over and died. C and her grandparents were shocked and saw no other option than to take this event as the occurrence a miracle (imagine that!) In their eyes it was confirmed-God wanted C to keep her child.\n\nSo she did. And I broke up with her shortly after. A few months later C gave birth to our son named N but I refused to take part. I haven't really talked to C since. I have been paying child support. To this day I have not so much as talked to N, although I have seen him a couple of times, despite that my parents see him and take care of him often. \n\nBasically everyone I know has judged me for abandoning my child and nobody hesitates to tell me I'm in the wrong. A lot of people have lost respect for me and see my continued lack of contact with my child as immoral. I've got into many fights with my parents over this and no longer live with them due to the discord. \n\nN is 5 years old now and stating to talk and go to school. Recently I was told by my mother that when N was playing with other children he was asked about his 'daddy' to which he replied: 'my daddy doesn't play with me'. This is concerning for me to hear and I can't help but feel guilty to some degree. However, I still feel that I've been wronged and at this stage it would be very difficult for me to reverse my decision. I have been firm about my decision all along and have no intention of validating C's disrespect for me by changing my mind now. I never wanted to have a child and she knew all along. She was being incredibly selfish, no matter how selfish I'm being now. \n\nBefore judging me I implore you to consider my perspective. I had no say in the matter and C deceived me (and everyone else) in order to fulfil her fantasy. This was extremely disrespectful and hurtful to me, I wasn't ready to have a child and I'm still not. AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user wants to know if the author is in the wrong for breaking up with his pregnant girlfriend. The situation is pretty complex. Let me break it down.\n\nFirst, the author was in a relationship with C, who had a tough background. Her parents were gone, and she had bipolar disorder. She was really into getting married and having kids. The author didn't want to get married, so she panicked. They had unprotected sex, and she had PCOS, which made pregnancy less likely. But she got pregnant anyway. The author convinced her to get an abortion, but then the cat died before the procedure, which they took as a sign from God to keep the baby. The author ended up breaking up with her and hasn't been involved with the child. Now he's paying child support but not being a father. People are judging him, and he's feeling conflicted.\n\nSo, the main issue here is whether the author is in the wrong. From a moral standpoint, having a child is a big commitment. The author didn't want a child and was clear about it until the pregnancy. But once she got pregnant, he tried to get her to abort it. However, she changed her mind because of the cat incident. Then he broke up with her. Now he's not involved, but he's paying support. \n\nLegally, he's obligated to pay child support, but emotionally, he's distancing himself. From a legal perspective, he's not in the wrong for breaking up, but morally, some might argue he has a responsibility to the child. The question is about moral wrong, not legal. He didn't want the child, but once the child is born, some would say he has a duty as a parent. However, he was not the one who wanted the child. The mother made the decision to continue the pregnancy despite his wishes. So, who is more in the wrong? She might be in the wrong for not respecting his wishes, but he's now cutting ties. \n\nBut the user is asking about the author's wrong. If he's not involved, but the child is being harmed by his absence, that's a problem. However, he feels wronged because she went against his wishes. The situation is a bit of a moral dilemma. Different people might have different views. Some might say he's in the wrong for not being a father, others might see her as the one who was selfish. The author claims she was being selfish, but he's also being selfish by not engaging with the child. \n\nIn terms of answer A or B, the question is whether he's in the wrong. Since he's not taking responsibility for the child, even though he's paying support, many would argue that he is morally responsible. So the answer is A (Yes, he's in the wrong). But others might say that the mother was the one who forced the situation. However, once a child is born, the father has a responsibility. So I think the answer is A.\n"
