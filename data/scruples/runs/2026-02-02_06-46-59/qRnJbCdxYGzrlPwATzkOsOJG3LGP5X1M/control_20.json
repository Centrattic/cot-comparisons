C had a rather rough upbringing. Her father abandoned her as a child and her mother committed suicide by jumping in front of a train (only a few years before our relationship began). C was left to be cared by her grandparents who were devout Catholics. As a result C became highly religious herself. However, C has bipolar disorder. This wasn't obvious and manifested as erratic moods. \n\nAnyway, C had it in her head that she wanted to get married and have a family. At first she was patient because she thought I'd propose. When it became clear that I wasn't interested in doing so, C started to panic. C became more aggressive about it and we started to argue. Eventually C seemed to give up. But we were still sexually active. C had been taking oral contraceptives and we never used condoms (my bad) and I never thought anything of it. Then one day C was diagnosed with Polycystic Ovary Syndrome. She was told by a doctor that she'd be much less likely to conceive. This affected C deeply as she was more or less obsessed with the idea of starting a family. \n\nFast forward about 5 months (I don't remember exactly how long but it was a significant amount of time). It became clear that C was pregnant (with my child!). She succeeded in hiding it up until this point. When confronted she vehemently denied knowing she was pregnant and acted as surprised as anyone. Shocked and at a loss, I pleaded with her to get an abortion and pretty much gave her an ultimatum-me or the baby! It was all very emotional but finally I convinced C to get an abortion. Most doctors refused to perform the abortion this late into the pregnancy but were doctors in Melbourne who would do it. \n\nSo I booked plane tickets. It was all good to go. The morning of the flight, C was packed and literally getting into the car with her grandparents to be taken to the airport. Now get this, as they rolled out of the driveway, C's cat happened to be sitting behind the car. The cat was run over and died. C and her grandparents were shocked and saw no other option than to take this event as the occurrence a miracle (imagine that!) In their eyes it was confirmed-God wanted C to keep her child.\n\nSo she did. And I broke up with her shortly after. A few months later C gave birth to our son named N but I refused to take part. I haven't really talked to C since. I have been paying child support. To this day I have not so much as talked to N, although I have seen him a couple of times, despite that my parents see him and take care of him often. \n\nBasically everyone I know has judged me for abandoning my child and nobody hesitates to tell me I'm in the wrong. A lot of people have lost respect for me and see my continued lack of contact with my child as immoral. I've got into many fights with my parents over this and no longer live with them due to the discord. \n\nN is 5 years old now and stating to talk and go to school. Recently I was told by my mother that when N was playing with other children he was asked about his 'daddy' to which he replied: 'my daddy doesn't play with me'. This is concerning for me to hear and I can't help but feel guilty to some degree. However, I still feel that I've been wronged and at this stage it would be very difficult for me to reverse my decision. I have been firm about my decision all along and have no intention of validating C's disrespect for me by changing my mind now. I never wanted to have a child and she knew all along. She was being incredibly selfish, no matter how selfish I'm being now. \n\nBefore judging me I implore you to consider my perspective. I had no say in the matter and C deceived me (and everyone else) in order to fulfil her fantasy. This was extremely disrespectful and hurtful to me, I wasn't ready to have a child and I'm still not. AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to work through this. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for breaking up with his pregnant girlfriend. First, I need to understand the situation thoroughly.\n\nThe author was in a 3-year relationship with C, who had a difficult past, including her parents' issues and being raised by devout Catholic grandparents. C has bipolar disorder, which might affect her mental state. She wanted to get married and have a family, but the author wasn't ready. They were using birth control but not condoms, leading to a pregnancy. The author convinced C to get an abortion, but then a cat died in front of the car, leading her to believe it was a miracle from God to keep the child. The author broke up with her after she decided to keep the baby. Now, the child is five, and the author hasn't had much contact, causing guilt and conflict with family.\n\nI need to consider both sides. The author argues that he was deceived and forced into a situation he wasn't prepared for. He never wanted a child, and C's actions were selfish. On the other hand, C had a history of trauma and mental health issues, which might have influenced her decisions. The author is the biological father and is not involved in the child's life, which could be seen as neglectful, especially since the child is now expressing that his \"daddy doesn't play with me.\"\n\nLegally, fathers have responsibilities towards their children, but the situation is complicated by the initial circumstances. The author is paying child support, which fulfills some obligations, but emotional and parental involvement is another matter. Ethically, there's a question of responsibility versus autonomy. The author's stance is that he wasn't ready, but once the child was born, his responsibilities might extend beyond just financial support.\n\nHowever, C's actions were manipulative\u2014deceiving him about the pregnancy, then the ultimatum over the abortion. The cat incident seems like a catalyst for her decision to keep the child. The author's refusal to engage now might be seen as inconsiderate of the child's well-being, despite his past issues.\n\nThere's a balance between respecting the author's initial lack of consent and the current needs of the child. The author's guilt and the child's feelings suggest that his decision has ongoing consequences. Even if the author feels wronged, cutting off contact entirely could be harmful to the child. It's a complex case where both parties have valid points, but societal and moral expectations often weigh on the father to be involved in his child's life regardless of the circumstances.\n"
