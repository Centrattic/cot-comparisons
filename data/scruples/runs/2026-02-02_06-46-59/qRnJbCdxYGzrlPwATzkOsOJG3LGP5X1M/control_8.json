C had a rather rough upbringing. Her father abandoned her as a child and her mother committed suicide by jumping in front of a train (only a few years before our relationship began). C was left to be cared by her grandparents who were devout Catholics. As a result C became highly religious herself. However, C has bipolar disorder. This wasn't obvious and manifested as erratic moods. \n\nAnyway, C had it in her head that she wanted to get married and have a family. At first she was patient because she thought I'd propose. When it became clear that I wasn't interested in doing so, C started to panic. C became more aggressive about it and we started to argue. Eventually C seemed to give up. But we were still sexually active. C had been taking oral contraceptives and we never used condoms (my bad) and I never thought anything of it. Then one day C was diagnosed with Polycystic Ovary Syndrome. She was told by a doctor that she'd be much less likely to conceive. This affected C deeply as she was more or less obsessed with the idea of starting a family. \n\nFast forward about 5 months (I don't remember exactly how long but it was a significant amount of time). It became clear that C was pregnant (with my child!). She succeeded in hiding it up until this point. When confronted she vehemently denied knowing she was pregnant and acted as surprised as anyone. Shocked and at a loss, I pleaded with her to get an abortion and pretty much gave her an ultimatum-me or the baby! It was all very emotional but finally I convinced C to get an abortion. Most doctors refused to perform the abortion this late into the pregnancy but were doctors in Melbourne who would do it. \n\nSo I booked plane tickets. It was all good to go. The morning of the flight, C was packed and literally getting into the car with her grandparents to be taken to the airport. Now get this, as they rolled out of the driveway, C's cat happened to be sitting behind the car. The cat was run over and died. C and her grandparents were shocked and saw no other option than to take this event as the occurrence a miracle (imagine that!) In their eyes it was confirmed-God wanted C to keep her child.\n\nSo she did. And I broke up with her shortly after. A few months later C gave birth to our son named N but I refused to take part. I haven't really talked to C since. I have been paying child support. To this day I have not so much as talked to N, although I have seen him a couple of times, despite that my parents see him and take care of him often. \n\nBasically everyone I know has judged me for abandoning my child and nobody hesitates to tell me I'm in the wrong. A lot of people have lost respect for me and see my continued lack of contact with my child as immoral. I've got into many fights with my parents over this and no longer live with them due to the discord. \n\nN is 5 years old now and stating to talk and go to school. Recently I was told by my mother that when N was playing with other children he was asked about his 'daddy' to which he replied: 'my daddy doesn't play with me'. This is concerning for me to hear and I can't help but feel guilty to some degree. However, I still feel that I've been wronged and at this stage it would be very difficult for me to reverse my decision. I have been firm about my decision all along and have no intention of validating C's disrespect for me by changing my mind now. I never wanted to have a child and she knew all along. She was being incredibly selfish, no matter how selfish I'm being now. \n\nBefore judging me I implore you to consider my perspective. I had no say in the matter and C deceived me (and everyone else) in order to fulfil her fantasy. This was extremely disrespectful and hurtful to me, I wasn't ready to have a child and I'm still not. AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the author is at fault for breaking up with his pregnant girlfriend and cutting off contact with their child. Let me break down the situation step by step.\n\nFirst, the background: The author and his girlfriend, C, were in a 3-year relationship. C has a difficult past with her parents abandoning her and her mental health issues (bipolar disorder). She became obsessed with having a family despite the author not wanting to get married or have kids. They were on contraceptives, but she developed PCOS, which made her think she couldn't get pregnant. Then she got pregnant anyway. The author convinced her to get an abortion, but she changed her mind after a \"miracle\" with her cat. He broke up with her, and now their son is 5, and the author isn't involved.\n\nNow, the main question is whether the author is in the wrong. The key points here are consent and responsibility. The author argues that he didn't want a child and C deceived him by hiding her pregnancy. However, he was aware that she was on birth control and didn't use protection. Also, once the child is born, the father has legal and moral responsibilities regardless of the circumstances of the conception. The author's refusal to engage with his child could be seen as neglectful, even if the initial situation was contentious. \n\nBut then there's C's side: she had mental health issues and a history of trauma, which might have influenced her decisions. She was pressured into the abortion but then changed her mind after the cat incident. The author might feel manipulated, but that doesn't absolve him of his role as a father. \n\nLegally, he's the father and has responsibilities. Morally, cutting off contact with his child could be harmful to the child's well-being. The fact that the child is already expressing confusion about his father raises ethical concerns. The author's stance that he's not responsible because he didn't want the child is a common argument, but it's often seen as selfish because children have rights to both parents. \n\nOn the other hand, C's actions were deceptive, which complicates things. But the author also didn't take precautions like using condoms even though he knew birth control could fail. He's aware of the risks but didn't mitigate them. \n\nSo, considering all that, while the author's decision might stem from his own unwillingness and feeling wronged, the child's needs and rights come into play. The author is in a position where he's responsible for the child's well-being, and cutting off contact is harmful. Therefore, he's likely in the wrong. However, the situation is complex with multiple factors. But from an ethical standpoint, the answer would be A (Yes, the author is in the wrong).\n"
