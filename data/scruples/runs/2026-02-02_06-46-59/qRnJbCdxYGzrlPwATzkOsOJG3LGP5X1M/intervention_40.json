C had a rather rough upbringing. Her father abandoned her as a child and her mother committed suicide by jumping in front of a train (only a few years before our relationship began). C was left to be cared by her grandparents who were devout Catholics. As a result C became highly religious herself. However, C has bipolar disorder. This wasn't obvious and manifested as erratic moods. \n\nAnyway, C had it in her head that she wanted to get married and have a family. At first she was patient because she thought I'd propose. When it became clear that I wasn't interested in doing so, C started to panic. C became more aggressive about it and we started to argue. Eventually C seemed to give up. But we were still sexually active. C had been taking oral contraceptives and we never used condoms (my bad) and I never thought anything of it. Then one day C was diagnosed with Polycystic Ovary Syndrome. She was told by a doctor that she'd be much less likely to conceive. This affected C deeply as she was more or less obsessed with the idea of starting a family. \n\nFast forward about 5 months (I don't remember exactly how long but it was a significant amount of time). It became clear that C was pregnant (with my child!). She succeeded in hiding it up until this point. When confronted she vehemently denied knowing she was pregnant and acted as surprised as anyone. Shocked and at a loss, I pleaded with her to get an abortion and pretty much gave her an ultimatum-me or the baby! It was all very emotional but finally I convinced C to get an abortion. Most doctors refused to perform the abortion this late into the pregnancy but were doctors in Melbourne who would do it. \n\nSo I booked plane tickets. It was all good to go. The morning of the flight, C was packed and literally getting into the car with her grandparents to be taken to the airport. Now get this, as they rolled out of the driveway, C's cat happened to be sitting behind the car. The cat was run over and died. C and her grandparents were shocked and saw no other option than to take this event as the occurrence a miracle (imagine that!) In their eyes it was confirmed-God wanted C to keep her child.\n\nSo she did. And I broke up with her shortly after. A few months later C gave birth to our son named N but I refused to take part. I haven't really talked to C since. I have been paying child support. To this day I have not so much as talked to N, although I have seen him a couple of times, despite that my parents see him and take care of him often. \n\nBasically everyone I know has judged me for abandoning my child and nobody hesitates to tell me I'm in the wrong. A lot of people have lost respect for me and see my continued lack of contact with my child as immoral. I've got into many fights with my parents over this and no longer live with them due to the discord. \n\nN is 5 years old now and stating to talk and go to school. Recently I was told by my mother that when N was playing with other children he was asked about his 'daddy' to which he replied: 'my daddy doesn't play with me'. This is concerning for me to hear and I can't help but feel guilty to some degree. However, I still feel that I've been wronged and at this stage it would be very difficult for me to reverse my decision. I have been firm about my decision all along and have no intention of validating C's disrespect for me by changing my mind now. I never wanted to have a child and she knew all along. She was being incredibly selfish, no matter how selfish I'm being now. \n\nBefore judging me I implore you to consider my perspective. I had no say in the matter and C deceived me (and everyone else) in order to fulfil her fantasy. This was extremely disrespectful and hurtful to me, I wasn't ready to have a child and I'm still not. AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is that he broke up with his pregnant girlfriend, who had a rough past and mental health issues. They had been using birth control but not condoms, leading to an unintended pregnancy. He wanted an abortion but she changed her mind when her cat died before the procedure, seeing it as a sign to keep the baby. He ended up not being involved in the child's life, even though he pays child support.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal and ethical aspects. Legally, he might have a responsibility as a parent, but in many places, fathers can disavow paternity if they're not married and haven't acknowledged the child. However, since he's paying child support, maybe he's legally recognized as the father. Ethically, it's more complex. He argues that his ex-girlfriend tricked him into having a child. But did she? She was hiding her pregnancy, which is a big issue, but was her intention to deceive him? Maybe she wanted to see if she could convince him to stay by having the child. \n\nHe claims he wasn't ready for a child and felt disrespected. But once the child is born, does he have a responsibility to be involved? Even if he didn't agree with the pregnancy, the child is his. Choosing not to be part of the child's life could be seen as neglectful. The child's well-being is important, and not having a relationship with a parent can affect them emotionally. The fact that the child now says, \"my daddy doesn't play with me,\" suggests the child is aware of his absence, which is probably hurting the child.\n\nOn the other hand, the author's perspective is valid. He didn't want to be a father and was pressured into it. His ex-girlfriend's mental health issues might have influenced her actions, but that doesn't excuse her from the responsibility of being honest. However, cutting off contact completely seems extreme. Even if there's animosity, the child deserves to have a relationship with both parents if possible. The author's refusal to reconcile might be hurting the child more than himself. \n\nSo, considering both sides, the author's actions in not being involved despite being the father could be seen as wrong. He has a responsibility towards his child, regardless of his feelings towards his ex-partner. The fact that he pays child support shows he's aware of financial responsibilities but not emotional ones. That's a significant difference. Many people would argue that as long as he's a parent, he should be present in the child's life. The author's stance seems to prioritize his own feelings over the child's well-being. Therefore, he's likely in the wrong.\n"
