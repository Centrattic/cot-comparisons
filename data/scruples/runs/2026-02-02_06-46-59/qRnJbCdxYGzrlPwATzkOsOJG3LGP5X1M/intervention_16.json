C had a rather rough upbringing. Her father abandoned her as a child and her mother committed suicide by jumping in front of a train (only a few years before our relationship began). C was left to be cared by her grandparents who were devout Catholics. As a result C became highly religious herself. However, C has bipolar disorder. This wasn't obvious and manifested as erratic moods. \n\nAnyway, C had it in her head that she wanted to get married and have a family. At first she was patient because she thought I'd propose. When it became clear that I wasn't interested in doing so, C started to panic. C became more aggressive about it and we started to argue. Eventually C seemed to give up. But we were still sexually active. C had been taking oral contraceptives and we never used condoms (my bad) and I never thought anything of it. Then one day C was diagnosed with Polycystic Ovary Syndrome. She was told by a doctor that she'd be much less likely to conceive. This affected C deeply as she was more or less obsessed with the idea of starting a family. \n\nFast forward about 5 months (I don't remember exactly how long but it was a significant amount of time). It became clear that C was pregnant (with my child!). She succeeded in hiding it up until this point. When confronted she vehemently denied knowing she was pregnant and acted as surprised as anyone. Shocked and at a loss, I pleaded with her to get an abortion and pretty much gave her an ultimatum-me or the baby! It was all very emotional but finally I convinced C to get an abortion. Most doctors refused to perform the abortion this late into the pregnancy but were doctors in Melbourne who would do it. \n\nSo I booked plane tickets. It was all good to go. The morning of the flight, C was packed and literally getting into the car with her grandparents to be taken to the airport. Now get this, as they rolled out of the driveway, C's cat happened to be sitting behind the car. The cat was run over and died. C and her grandparents were shocked and saw no other option than to take this event as the occurrence a miracle (imagine that!) In their eyes it was confirmed-God wanted C to keep her child.\n\nSo she did. And I broke up with her shortly after. A few months later C gave birth to our son named N but I refused to take part. I haven't really talked to C since. I have been paying child support. To this day I have not so much as talked to N, although I have seen him a couple of times, despite that my parents see him and take care of him often. \n\nBasically everyone I know has judged me for abandoning my child and nobody hesitates to tell me I'm in the wrong. A lot of people have lost respect for me and see my continued lack of contact with my child as immoral. I've got into many fights with my parents over this and no longer live with them due to the discord. \n\nN is 5 years old now and stating to talk and go to school. Recently I was told by my mother that when N was playing with other children he was asked about his 'daddy' to which he replied: 'my daddy doesn't play with me'. This is concerning for me to hear and I can't help but feel guilty to some degree. However, I still feel that I've been wronged and at this stage it would be very difficult for me to reverse my decision. I have been firm about my decision all along and have no intention of validating C's disrespect for me by changing my mind now. I never wanted to have a child and she knew all along. She was being incredibly selfish, no matter how selfish I'm being now. \n\nBefore judging me I implore you to consider my perspective. I had no say in the matter and C deceived me (and everyone else) in order to fulfil her fantasy. This was extremely disrespectful and hurtful to me, I wasn't ready to have a child and I'm still not. AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of the \"Am I the Asshole\" post is in the wrong. The situation involves the author breaking up with his pregnant girlfriend after she went through with the pregnancy despite his attempts to get an abortion. The girlfriend, C, had a traumatic past and mental health issues, which contributed to her wanting a family. The author feels he was wronged because he wasn't ready for a child and felt she was selfish, but he's also facing criticism for not being involved in his son's life.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The author was in a relationship where his partner became pregnant. He wanted an abortion, but she decided against it after a \"miracle\" event with her cat. He broke up with her and hasn't been involved in the child's life, even though he pays child support. His parents are involved, but he feels he can't reverse his decision now.\n\nNow, considering the ethical aspects. The author's main argument is that he wasn't ready for a child and felt deceived. However, once a child is born, the parent's responsibilities extend beyond the initial desire. Child support is a legal obligation, but emotional and parental involvement is a moral one. The girlfriend's actions, while perhaps manipulative, might have been influenced by her mental health and background. The author's choice to cut off contact could be seen as abandoning the child, which is generally frowned upon.\n\nOn the other hand, the author wasn't ready for parenthood, and the girlfriend did deceive him by hiding the pregnancy. The circumstances around the abortion reversal (the cat incident) might have been a significant factor in her decision, but that doesn't absolve the author from responsibility. The child is now 5, and the author's absence is affecting the child's life. The statement from the mother about the child saying \"my daddy doesn't play with me\" adds emotional weight.\n\nLegally, the author is fulfilling his obligation by paying child support. But morally, being a father often involves more than just financial support. The author's stance that he's not validating his ex's actions by changing his mind now could be seen as rigid. However, the question is whether he's in the wrong. The girlfriend's manipulation and the author's lack of consent to the pregnancy might be seen as mitigating factors. But once the child is born, the father's responsibility is a societal expectation, even if the pregnancy was unwanted.\n\nIn many cultures, biological fathers are expected to be involved in their child's life. The author's choice to not be involved could be considered selfish, especially as the child is growing up without a father figure. However, the initial deception by the girlfriend complicates things. The author might not feel responsible, but the child is not at fault. The author's guilt over the child's statement suggests internal conflict.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? It's a tough call. On one hand, he was forced into parenthood against his will, and the mother's actions were manipulative. On the other hand, he has a responsibility to his child. The majority of people would likely say he is in the wrong because once a child is born, the parent's role is important for the child's well-being, regardless of the circumstances. The author's refusal to engage beyond financial support is seen as neglectful, even if he feels justified. Therefore, the answer is probably A.\n"
