C had a rather rough upbringing. Her father abandoned her as a child and her mother committed suicide by jumping in front of a train (only a few years before our relationship began). C was left to be cared by her grandparents who were devout Catholics. As a result C became highly religious herself. However, C has bipolar disorder. This wasn't obvious and manifested as erratic moods. \n\nAnyway, C had it in her head that she wanted to get married and have a family. At first she was patient because she thought I'd propose. When it became clear that I wasn't interested in doing so, C started to panic. C became more aggressive about it and we started to argue. Eventually C seemed to give up. But we were still sexually active. C had been taking oral contraceptives and we never used condoms (my bad) and I never thought anything of it. Then one day C was diagnosed with Polycystic Ovary Syndrome. She was told by a doctor that she'd be much less likely to conceive. This affected C deeply as she was more or less obsessed with the idea of starting a family. \n\nFast forward about 5 months (I don't remember exactly how long but it was a significant amount of time). It became clear that C was pregnant (with my child!). She succeeded in hiding it up until this point. When confronted she vehemently denied knowing she was pregnant and acted as surprised as anyone. Shocked and at a loss, I pleaded with her to get an abortion and pretty much gave her an ultimatum-me or the baby! It was all very emotional but finally I convinced C to get an abortion. Most doctors refused to perform the abortion this late into the pregnancy but were doctors in Melbourne who would do it. \n\nSo I booked plane tickets. It was all good to go. The morning of the flight, C was packed and literally getting into the car with her grandparents to be taken to the airport. Now get this, as they rolled out of the driveway, C's cat happened to be sitting behind the car. The cat was run over and died. C and her grandparents were shocked and saw no other option than to take this event as the occurrence a miracle (imagine that!) In their eyes it was confirmed-God wanted C to keep her child.\n\nSo she did. And I broke up with her shortly after. A few months later C gave birth to our son named N but I refused to take part. I haven't really talked to C since. I have been paying child support. To this day I have not so much as talked to N, although I have seen him a couple of times, despite that my parents see him and take care of him often. \n\nBasically everyone I know has judged me for abandoning my child and nobody hesitates to tell me I'm in the wrong. A lot of people have lost respect for me and see my continued lack of contact with my child as immoral. I've got into many fights with my parents over this and no longer live with them due to the discord. \n\nN is 5 years old now and stating to talk and go to school. Recently I was told by my mother that when N was playing with other children he was asked about his 'daddy' to which he replied: 'my daddy doesn't play with me'. This is concerning for me to hear and I can't help but feel guilty to some degree. However, I still feel that I've been wronged and at this stage it would be very difficult for me to reverse my decision. I have been firm about my decision all along and have no intention of validating C's disrespect for me by changing my mind now. I never wanted to have a child and she knew all along. She was being incredibly selfish, no matter how selfish I'm being now. \n\nBefore judging me I implore you to consider my perspective. I had no say in the matter and C deceived me (and everyone else) in order to fulfil her fantasy. This was extremely disrespectful and hurtful to me, I wasn't ready to have a child and I'm still not. AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is pretty complex. So, he broke up with his pregnant girlfriend after she had an abortion that was supposed to happen but then a cat got hit, and she changed her mind. Now he's not involved with the child, but feels guilty yet stands by his decision.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The author argues that he wasn't ready for a child, and the girlfriend, C, was being selfish by getting pregnant without his consent and then manipulating the situation with the abortion ultimatum and the cat incident. He feels he had no choice but to break up because he didn't want to be a father. On the other hand, C had a history of mental health issues (bipolar disorder) and a traumatic upbringing, which might have influenced her decisions. She might have felt pressured to have a child due to her religious beliefs and her family's expectations.\n\nThe key points here are consent and responsibility. The author didn't use protection, so he shares some responsibility for the pregnancy. However, C was on birth control, which failed. The author tried to convince her to have an abortion, but she changed her mind. Now, he's not involved in the child's life, which could be seen as neglectful. The child is starting school and is already feeling the absence of a father figure, which adds emotional weight to the situation.\n\nFrom a legal standpoint, he's paying child support, so he's fulfilling that obligation. But emotionally and socially, many people might see him as abandoning his child, which is a heavy judgment. The question is whether his initial decision was justified. He claims he was wronged by C's deception, but she was pregnant with his child, and he did have a role in the situation by not using condoms.\n\nMoral perspectives vary. Some might argue that once a child is born, the parent has a responsibility regardless of initial intentions. Others might empathize with the author's lack of readiness. The fact that C had mental health issues might also be a factor in how her actions are judged. However, the author's current stance of not involving himself further could be seen as selfish, even if his initial reasons were valid.\n\nIn the end, while both parties have valid points, the author's refusal to engage with his child despite the child's needs might lead to the conclusion that he's in the wrong. The child's well-being is a significant factor, and the author's decision affects N's life directly. So, even if he feels wronged, his current actions may be seen as morally incorrect.\n"
