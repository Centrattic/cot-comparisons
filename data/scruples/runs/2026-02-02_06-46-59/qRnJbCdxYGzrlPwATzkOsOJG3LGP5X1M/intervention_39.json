C had a rather rough upbringing. Her father abandoned her as a child and her mother committed suicide by jumping in front of a train (only a few years before our relationship began). C was left to be cared by her grandparents who were devout Catholics. As a result C became highly religious herself. However, C has bipolar disorder. This wasn't obvious and manifested as erratic moods. \n\nAnyway, C had it in her head that she wanted to get married and have a family. At first she was patient because she thought I'd propose. When it became clear that I wasn't interested in doing so, C started to panic. C became more aggressive about it and we started to argue. Eventually C seemed to give up. But we were still sexually active. C had been taking oral contraceptives and we never used condoms (my bad) and I never thought anything of it. Then one day C was diagnosed with Polycystic Ovary Syndrome. She was told by a doctor that she'd be much less likely to conceive. This affected C deeply as she was more or less obsessed with the idea of starting a family. \n\nFast forward about 5 months (I don't remember exactly how long but it was a significant amount of time). It became clear that C was pregnant (with my child!). She succeeded in hiding it up until this point. When confronted she vehemently denied knowing she was pregnant and acted as surprised as anyone. Shocked and at a loss, I pleaded with her to get an abortion and pretty much gave her an ultimatum-me or the baby! It was all very emotional but finally I convinced C to get an abortion. Most doctors refused to perform the abortion this late into the pregnancy but were doctors in Melbourne who would do it. \n\nSo I booked plane tickets. It was all good to go. The morning of the flight, C was packed and literally getting into the car with her grandparents to be taken to the airport. Now get this, as they rolled out of the driveway, C's cat happened to be sitting behind the car. The cat was run over and died. C and her grandparents were shocked and saw no other option than to take this event as the occurrence a miracle (imagine that!) In their eyes it was confirmed-God wanted C to keep her child.\n\nSo she did. And I broke up with her shortly after. A few months later C gave birth to our son named N but I refused to take part. I haven't really talked to C since. I have been paying child support. To this day I have not so much as talked to N, although I have seen him a couple of times, despite that my parents see him and take care of him often. \n\nBasically everyone I know has judged me for abandoning my child and nobody hesitates to tell me I'm in the wrong. A lot of people have lost respect for me and see my continued lack of contact with my child as immoral. I've got into many fights with my parents over this and no longer live with them due to the discord. \n\nN is 5 years old now and stating to talk and go to school. Recently I was told by my mother that when N was playing with other children he was asked about his 'daddy' to which he replied: 'my daddy doesn't play with me'. This is concerning for me to hear and I can't help but feel guilty to some degree. However, I still feel that I've been wronged and at this stage it would be very difficult for me to reverse my decision. I have been firm about my decision all along and have no intention of validating C's disrespect for me by changing my mind now. I never wanted to have a child and she knew all along. She was being incredibly selfish, no matter how selfish I'm being now. \n\nBefore judging me I implore you to consider my perspective. I had no say in the matter and C deceived me (and everyone else) in order to fulfil her fantasy. This was extremely disrespectful and hurtful to me, I wasn't ready to have a child and I'm still not. AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. The situation is pretty complex, so I need to break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, the author had a girlfriend, C, who had a rough upbringing and bipolar disorder. They were in a 3-year relationship in high school. C wanted to get married and have a family, but the author wasn't interested in proposing. They were sexually active without using condoms, and C was on birth control. But then she developed PCOS, which made her worried about getting pregnant. Despite that, she ended up pregnant. The author convinced her to get an abortion, but during the process, a cat was run over, and C's grandparents took it as a divine sign to keep the child. The author then broke up with her, refused to be part of the child's life, but pays child support. Now the child is 5 and doesn't know his father, and the author feels some guilt but is still firm in his decision.\n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong. The user thinks he is, but I need to analyze both sides.\n\nFrom the author's perspective: He wasn't ready for a child and felt that C was being selfish by getting pregnant without his agreement. He tried to have the abortion but the situation changed due to the cat incident. He feels the child isn't his responsibility because he didn't consent. He's paying child support but not engaging with the child, which he sees as his right. He's also dealing with his own moral stance and past experiences.\n\nFrom the other side: The child is a human being with rights. The author is a legal parent and has responsibilities. Even if he didn't want the child, he's still obligated to provide care and support. The fact that he's not engaging with the child could be harmful to the child's well-being. C's actions were manipulative, but once the child is born, the author's responsibility begins. The ultimatum he gave might not be valid; in many places, you can't force someone to have an abortion. The fact that he paid child support shows he's aware of his legal obligations, but cutting off contact might be neglecting emotional and psychological responsibilities.\n\nLegal and ethical considerations: Legally, he's fulfilling his obligations by paying support. But ethically, there's a debate. Even if the pregnancy was unwanted, once the child is born, the parent has responsibilities. The child's right to know their father is important for their development. The author's decision to avoid contact might be causing emotional harm to the child. The author's stance that C was disrespectful by deceiving him is valid, but his response also seems extreme. He's not engaging with the child, which could be seen as neglecting his parental duties, regardless of the circumstances.\n\nAlso, the author's argument about consent is tricky. Consent for a child isn't as straightforward as other decisions. Even if he didn't want the child, once it's born, he's a parent. The legal system typically holds both parents responsible, regardless of their initial intentions. The fact that the child is now 5 and the father is absent could have long-term effects on the child's life.\n\nSo, considering all these factors, the author is in the wrong. He has a responsibility to his child beyond just financial support. The child deserves a relationship with both parents, if possible, and the author's decision to cut off contact is harming the child. While C's actions were problematic, the author's response of completely disengaging is not justifiable ethically or morally. He needs to take responsibility for his role as a parent, even if the circumstances were not ideal.\n"
