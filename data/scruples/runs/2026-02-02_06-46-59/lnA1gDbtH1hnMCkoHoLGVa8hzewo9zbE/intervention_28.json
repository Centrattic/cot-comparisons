Their father and I are divorced and not on the greatest terms but I loved my ex-FIL like my own Father. We were very close and at one point he and my ex-MIL even lived with us. He passed away after a long, hard battle with a relatively rare disorder.\n\nHis funeral home viewings were this past Friday, March 8th. The service and wake held for them was March 9th, Saturday. Because he was a Veteran the whole process was much slower as the veterans cemetery he wanted to be laid to rest has been extremely busy the last few weeks and the earliest he could be buried was today, Monday, March 11th.\n\nMy children missed school on Friday to be at both of the two viewings held. Being so young...they really had a hard time seeing their grandfather in his casket.  The weekend was difficult for them; he\u2019s the first family member that they know very well to have passed away. They did a bit better at the wake but were still pretty emotional. Crying. It broke my heart.\n\nToday he is being laid in his final resting place. A small handful of my ex\u2019s family members will be there. It\u2019s also a Monday and both my son and daughter have tests at school today. I asked them if they wanted to go to the burial; both shook their heads no. My son said that he had \u201calready said goodbye to Pappy\u201d. \n\nI sent them to school. I just received a phone call from my ex-MIL asking what time I would have the kids at the cemetery. I felt absolutely horrible telling her that the kids were in school and would not be attending the burial. She was *very* upset by this even after I explained that the kids themselves felt that they had already said goodbye. \n\nAm I the Asshole for not forcing my children to attend their Pappy\u2019s burial? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking if the person who wrote the situation is in the wrong for sending their kids to school instead of their grandfather's burial. I need to determine if the answer is A or B.\n\nFirst, let me recap the scenario. The kids are 6 and 9 years old. Their grandfather, the father's ex-FIL, passed away. The kids attended the viewings on Friday and the wake on Saturday, which were emotionally tough for them. The burial is on Monday, which is a school day, and the kids have tests. They didn't want to go to the burial, so the parent sent them to school. The ex-MIL is upset about this.\n\nThe user thinks the author is in the wrong. I need to evaluate the reasoning. The key points are the kids' emotional well-being, their age, the fact that they've already attended the earlier services, and the school commitments. The parent considered the kids' wishes and their emotional state. Forcing them to go to another service might be traumatic, especially since they were already upset during the viewings and wake. Also, the burial is a smaller event with only a few family members, so maybe the presence of the kids isn't as critical as the earlier events.\n\nOn the other hand, some might argue that the family wanted the kids there for the final goodbye. However, the parent prioritized the children's comfort and their own decisions, which seems reasonable. The kids didn't want to go, and pushing them could cause more distress. The parent also explained the situation to the ex-MIL, so maybe the issue isn't with the parent's decision but the ex-MIL's expectations.\n\nConsidering all this, the parent's actions seem justified. They respected the kids' feelings and school obligations. So, the author isn't in the wrong. Answer B.\n"
