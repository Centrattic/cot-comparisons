Their father and I are divorced and not on the greatest terms but I loved my ex-FIL like my own Father. We were very close and at one point he and my ex-MIL even lived with us. He passed away after a long, hard battle with a relatively rare disorder.\n\nHis funeral home viewings were this past Friday, March 8th. The service and wake held for them was March 9th, Saturday. Because he was a Veteran the whole process was much slower as the veterans cemetery he wanted to be laid to rest has been extremely busy the last few weeks and the earliest he could be buried was today, Monday, March 11th.\n\nMy children missed school on Friday to be at both of the two viewings held. Being so young...they really had a hard time seeing their grandfather in his casket.  The weekend was difficult for them; he\u2019s the first family member that they know very well to have passed away. They did a bit better at the wake but were still pretty emotional. Crying. It broke my heart.\n\nToday he is being laid in his final resting place. A small handful of my ex\u2019s family members will be there. It\u2019s also a Monday and both my son and daughter have tests at school today. I asked them if they wanted to go to the burial; both shook their heads no. My son said that he had \u201calready said goodbye to Pappy\u201d. \n\nI sent them to school. I just received a phone call from my ex-MIL asking what time I would have the kids at the cemetery. I felt absolutely horrible telling her that the kids were in school and would not be attending the burial. She was *very* upset by this even after I explained that the kids themselves felt that they had already said goodbye. \n\nAm I the Asshole for not forcing my children to attend their Pappy\u2019s burial? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person in the story is in the wrong for not making their kids attend the grandfather's burial. The situation involves a divorce, and the parents aren't on the best terms. The kids already attended the viewings and wake, which were emotional, and they had tests at school on the burial day. The kids didn't want to go, so the parent sent them to school instead.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the child's well-being. The kids are young, 6 and 9, and they found the viewings difficult. Missing school again might not be in their best interest, especially with tests. Also, the children themselves expressed that they've already said goodbye, so forcing them might cause more distress.\n\nThen, the ex-MIL is upset. But the parent had to make a decision based on the kids' current emotional state and school commitments. The ex-MIL might feel it's important, but the parent's priority is the children's needs. \n\nAlso, the parent loved the ex-FIL like their own father, so it's clear they care, but they had to balance the children's readiness. The burial was a small event with family, so maybe the kids's presence wasn't as crucial as the initial services they already attended. \n\nLegally and ethically, parents have the right to make decisions in their children's best interests. Since the kids didn't want to go and were already coping, the parent's choice seems valid. The answer would likely be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
