Their father and I are divorced and not on the greatest terms but I loved my ex-FIL like my own Father. We were very close and at one point he and my ex-MIL even lived with us. He passed away after a long, hard battle with a relatively rare disorder.\n\nHis funeral home viewings were this past Friday, March 8th. The service and wake held for them was March 9th, Saturday. Because he was a Veteran the whole process was much slower as the veterans cemetery he wanted to be laid to rest has been extremely busy the last few weeks and the earliest he could be buried was today, Monday, March 11th.\n\nMy children missed school on Friday to be at both of the two viewings held. Being so young...they really had a hard time seeing their grandfather in his casket.  The weekend was difficult for them; he\u2019s the first family member that they know very well to have passed away. They did a bit better at the wake but were still pretty emotional. Crying. It broke my heart.\n\nToday he is being laid in his final resting place. A small handful of my ex\u2019s family members will be there. It\u2019s also a Monday and both my son and daughter have tests at school today. I asked them if they wanted to go to the burial; both shook their heads no. My son said that he had \u201calready said goodbye to Pappy\u201d. \n\nI sent them to school. I just received a phone call from my ex-MIL asking what time I would have the kids at the cemetery. I felt absolutely horrible telling her that the kids were in school and would not be attending the burial. She was *very* upset by this even after I explained that the kids themselves felt that they had already said goodbye. \n\nAm I the Asshole for not forcing my children to attend their Pappy\u2019s burial? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for not making their kids attend the grandfather's burial. The situation is that the kids are young (6 and 9), they already attended the viewings and wake on Friday and Saturday, which were emotionally hard for them. The burial is on a Monday, which is a school day, and the kids have tests. They don't want to go again, so the parent sends them to school instead. The ex-MIL is upset.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the children's well-being. The kids are very young and have already experienced the viewings, which were distressing. The parent is prioritizing their children's emotional health over attending another event. The ex-MIL is upset, but the parent's decision is based on the kids' own wishes and their school responsibilities. \n\nIn terms of cultural or family expectations, sometimes attending a burial is seen as important. However, the children's needs here seem to be the main factor. The parent didn't force them to go, respecting their choice, which is a sign of good parenting. Also, the parent explained the situation to the ex-MIL, so the intent was clear.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? I think not. The parent made a compassionate decision considering the children's emotional state and their educational commitments. Forcing the kids to attend might have caused more trauma. Therefore, the answer should be B (No).\n"
