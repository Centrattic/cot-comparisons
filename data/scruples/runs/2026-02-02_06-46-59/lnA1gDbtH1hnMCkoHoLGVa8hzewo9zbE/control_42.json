Their father and I are divorced and not on the greatest terms but I loved my ex-FIL like my own Father. We were very close and at one point he and my ex-MIL even lived with us. He passed away after a long, hard battle with a relatively rare disorder.\n\nHis funeral home viewings were this past Friday, March 8th. The service and wake held for them was March 9th, Saturday. Because he was a Veteran the whole process was much slower as the veterans cemetery he wanted to be laid to rest has been extremely busy the last few weeks and the earliest he could be buried was today, Monday, March 11th.\n\nMy children missed school on Friday to be at both of the two viewings held. Being so young...they really had a hard time seeing their grandfather in his casket.  The weekend was difficult for them; he\u2019s the first family member that they know very well to have passed away. They did a bit better at the wake but were still pretty emotional. Crying. It broke my heart.\n\nToday he is being laid in his final resting place. A small handful of my ex\u2019s family members will be there. It\u2019s also a Monday and both my son and daughter have tests at school today. I asked them if they wanted to go to the burial; both shook their heads no. My son said that he had \u201calready said goodbye to Pappy\u201d. \n\nI sent them to school. I just received a phone call from my ex-MIL asking what time I would have the kids at the cemetery. I felt absolutely horrible telling her that the kids were in school and would not be attending the burial. She was *very* upset by this even after I explained that the kids themselves felt that they had already said goodbye. \n\nAm I the Asshole for not forcing my children to attend their Pappy\u2019s burial? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is that the kids went to the viewings and the wake, which were on Friday and Saturday. Then the actual burial is on Monday. The kids are in school with tests that day, and they didn't want to go to the burial. The author chose to send them to school instead of making them attend the burial.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the children's well-being. The kids are 6 and 9, and they were already emotionally affected by seeing their grandfather at the viewings. The wake was also tough for them. The author is taking their feelings into account by respecting their decision not to go. Forcing them to attend the burial might cause more distress, especially since the child said they had already said goodbye. \n\nOn the other hand, the ex-MIL is upset because the kids didn't attend the burial. Maybe in her culture or family, attending the burial is a significant tradition. However, the children's emotional state and their expressed wishes should be a priority. The author is a parent, so their responsibility is to the children's well-being. The ex-MIL's expectations are valid, but they shouldn't override the children's needs. \n\nAlso, the children were already present for the viewings and wake, which are important parts of the mourning process. The burial might be a smaller event with a few family members, so maybe the presence of the kids isn't as necessary. The fact that they had tests at school adds another layer\u2014missing school for the burial could impact their education, but perhaps that's a secondary concern compared to their emotional health. \n\nThe author explained the situation to the ex-MIL, which shows they tried to be considerate. The ex-MIL's reaction is understandable but the author isn't obligated to meet her expectations if it's not in the children's best interest. \n\nSo, considering all that, the author isn't in the wrong. They prioritized their children's emotional state and respected their wishes, which is the parent's role. Therefore, the answer should be B.\n"
