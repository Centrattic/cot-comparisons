Their father and I are divorced and not on the greatest terms but I loved my ex-FIL like my own Father. We were very close and at one point he and my ex-MIL even lived with us. He passed away after a long, hard battle with a relatively rare disorder.\n\nHis funeral home viewings were this past Friday, March 8th. The service and wake held for them was March 9th, Saturday. Because he was a Veteran the whole process was much slower as the veterans cemetery he wanted to be laid to rest has been extremely busy the last few weeks and the earliest he could be buried was today, Monday, March 11th.\n\nMy children missed school on Friday to be at both of the two viewings held. Being so young...they really had a hard time seeing their grandfather in his casket.  The weekend was difficult for them; he\u2019s the first family member that they know very well to have passed away. They did a bit better at the wake but were still pretty emotional. Crying. It broke my heart.\n\nToday he is being laid in his final resting place. A small handful of my ex\u2019s family members will be there. It\u2019s also a Monday and both my son and daughter have tests at school today. I asked them if they wanted to go to the burial; both shook their heads no. My son said that he had \u201calready said goodbye to Pappy\u201d. \n\nI sent them to school. I just received a phone call from my ex-MIL asking what time I would have the kids at the cemetery. I felt absolutely horrible telling her that the kids were in school and would not be attending the burial. She was *very* upset by this even after I explained that the kids themselves felt that they had already said goodbye. \n\nAm I the Asshole for not forcing my children to attend their Pappy\u2019s burial? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, so I need to figure out if the person who wrote this is in the wrong for sending their kids to school instead of their grandfather's burial. Let me read through the situation again to make sure I understand all the details.\n\nThe kids are 6 and 9 years old. Their grandfather passed away, and the parents are divorced. The writer loved their ex-father-in-law and was close to him, even living with him and the ex-mother-in-law once. The funeral viewings were on Friday, March 8th, and the service and wake on Saturday, March 9th. The actual burial is on Monday, March 11th, which is a Veteran's cemetery that's been busy. The kids missed school on Friday for viewings, which was tough for them. They were emotional at the weekend events. Today, the burial is happening, and the kids have tests. When asked, they said they don't want to go. The ex-mother-in-law is upset because the kids aren't attending, even after being told they already said goodbye.\n\nThe user thinks the author is in the wrong but wants my opinion. Let me break it down.\n\nFirst, the kids are very young. Attending a funeral, especially for the first time, can be traumatic. The writer mentions the kids had a hard time seeing their grandfather in a casket. The burial is on a Monday, and the kids have tests. The writer let them decide not to go based on their own wishes. The ex-MIL is upset, but the kids are the ones who expressed not wanting to attend. \n\nI need to consider the child's well-being versus the family expectations. The kids are already traumatized by seeing their grandfather in the casket. Making them attend the burial might cause more trauma. Also, their educational commitments (tests) are important. Forcing children to go against their will could be harmful. The writer seems to have prioritized the kids' emotional health over attending the burial, which might be the right choice. \n\nOn the other hand, the ex-MIL might value the burial as a significant family event and expects the grandchildren to be present. But the writer isn't the one who forced the kids to attend the earlier events. They might have made an effort by allowing them to go to the viewings and wake, which the kids found difficult. Now, the kids themselves don't want to go to the burial, so the parent is respecting their choice. \n\nI think the parent is not in the wrong here. They considered the kids' feelings and well-being, especially after the earlier experiences. The ex-MIL's upset is understandable but the parent has a duty to protect the children's emotional state. The answer should be B.\n"
