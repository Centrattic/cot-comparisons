Their father and I are divorced and not on the greatest terms but I loved my ex-FIL like my own Father. We were very close and at one point he and my ex-MIL even lived with us. He passed away after a long, hard battle with a relatively rare disorder.\n\nHis funeral home viewings were this past Friday, March 8th. The service and wake held for them was March 9th, Saturday. Because he was a Veteran the whole process was much slower as the veterans cemetery he wanted to be laid to rest has been extremely busy the last few weeks and the earliest he could be buried was today, Monday, March 11th.\n\nMy children missed school on Friday to be at both of the two viewings held. Being so young...they really had a hard time seeing their grandfather in his casket.  The weekend was difficult for them; he\u2019s the first family member that they know very well to have passed away. They did a bit better at the wake but were still pretty emotional. Crying. It broke my heart.\n\nToday he is being laid in his final resting place. A small handful of my ex\u2019s family members will be there. It\u2019s also a Monday and both my son and daughter have tests at school today. I asked them if they wanted to go to the burial; both shook their heads no. My son said that he had \u201calready said goodbye to Pappy\u201d. \n\nI sent them to school. I just received a phone call from my ex-MIL asking what time I would have the kids at the cemetery. I felt absolutely horrible telling her that the kids were in school and would not be attending the burial. She was *very* upset by this even after I explained that the kids themselves felt that they had already said goodbye. \n\nAm I the Asshole for not forcing my children to attend their Pappy\u2019s burial? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong for sending their kids to school instead of attending their grandfather's burial. The author's kids are 6 and 9 years old. They already missed school on Friday for the viewings and the wake on Saturday, which were emotional for the kids. Now the burial is on a Monday, and the kids have tests. They didn't want to go, so the parent sent them to school.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the children's well-being. The kids were already upset at the viewings and wake. Making them go through another emotional event might be too much. The parent asked, and the kids said they had already said goodbye. Respecting the children's wishes here is important, especially since they're young and processing their grief.\n\nThen there's the ex-MIL's reaction. She was very upset. But the parent had to balance the kids' needs with the expectations of the other family. However, the kids are the parent's responsibility now, and the parent has to prioritize their children's emotional health. The parent also mentioned that the ex and they aren't on the best terms, so maybe the ex-MIL's expectations are part of the existing tension.\n\nIs it the parent's duty to push the kids to attend? Probably not. Forcing children to attend might cause more trauma. The parent made a decision based on the kids' emotional state and their own judgment as a parent. The fact that the kids had already been to the viewings and wake, and this was a more formal burial with fewer family members, might make the absence more understandable.\n\nAlso, the parent explained the situation to the ex-MIL, which shows they tried to be respectful. The ex-MIL's reaction is their issue, not the parent's fault. So, considering all that, the parent isn't in the wrong. They made a choice that prioritizes their children's well-being and listened to the kids' feelings. So the answer is B.\n"
