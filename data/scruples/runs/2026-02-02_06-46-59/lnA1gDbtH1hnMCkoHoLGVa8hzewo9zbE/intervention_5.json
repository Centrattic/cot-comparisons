Their father and I are divorced and not on the greatest terms but I loved my ex-FIL like my own Father. We were very close and at one point he and my ex-MIL even lived with us. He passed away after a long, hard battle with a relatively rare disorder.\n\nHis funeral home viewings were this past Friday, March 8th. The service and wake held for them was March 9th, Saturday. Because he was a Veteran the whole process was much slower as the veterans cemetery he wanted to be laid to rest has been extremely busy the last few weeks and the earliest he could be buried was today, Monday, March 11th.\n\nMy children missed school on Friday to be at both of the two viewings held. Being so young...they really had a hard time seeing their grandfather in his casket.  The weekend was difficult for them; he\u2019s the first family member that they know very well to have passed away. They did a bit better at the wake but were still pretty emotional. Crying. It broke my heart.\n\nToday he is being laid in his final resting place. A small handful of my ex\u2019s family members will be there. It\u2019s also a Monday and both my son and daughter have tests at school today. I asked them if they wanted to go to the burial; both shook their heads no. My son said that he had \u201calready said goodbye to Pappy\u201d. \n\nI sent them to school. I just received a phone call from my ex-MIL asking what time I would have the kids at the cemetery. I felt absolutely horrible telling her that the kids were in school and would not be attending the burial. She was *very* upset by this even after I explained that the kids themselves felt that they had already said goodbye. \n\nAm I the Asshole for not forcing my children to attend their Pappy\u2019s burial? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about whether it's acceptable not to make the kids attend their grandfather's burial. The author is a divorced parent, and the kids are with them. The grandfather passed away, and there were viewings on Friday and a wake on Saturday. The kids missed school then. Now the burial is on Monday, which is a school day, and the kids have tests. The author asked the kids if they wanted to go, and they said no. The ex-MIL is upset.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the kids' well-being. They were already upset during the viewings and the wake. The author says they had a hard time seeing the grandfather in the casket and were emotional. Forcing them to attend the burial might cause more trauma. The kids already said they said goodbye, so maybe forcing them would be overriding their wishes. The author is respecting their children's feelings here.\n\nOn the other hand, the ex-MIL is upset because the kids didn't attend the burial. Maybe there's a cultural expectation or family tradition that the author isn't considering. But the author is the parent making the decision for the kids, and the kids themselves didn't want to go. The author's priority is the children's emotional state, especially since they have tests the same day. \n\nIs not forcing the kids to attend being inconsiderate to the family? But the kids are young, and their mental health is important. The author is being responsible by sending them to school for their tests, which is a school obligation. The burial is on a school day, so maybe the author had to choose between the kids' school responsibilities and the burial.\n\nSo, the author is making a call based on the kids' emotional needs and their school schedule. The kids themselves didn't want to attend, so forcing them might not be right. Therefore, the author isn't in the wrong. Answer B.\n"
