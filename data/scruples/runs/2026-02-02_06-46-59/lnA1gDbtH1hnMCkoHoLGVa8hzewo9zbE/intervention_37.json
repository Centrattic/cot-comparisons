Their father and I are divorced and not on the greatest terms but I loved my ex-FIL like my own Father. We were very close and at one point he and my ex-MIL even lived with us. He passed away after a long, hard battle with a relatively rare disorder.\n\nHis funeral home viewings were this past Friday, March 8th. The service and wake held for them was March 9th, Saturday. Because he was a Veteran the whole process was much slower as the veterans cemetery he wanted to be laid to rest has been extremely busy the last few weeks and the earliest he could be buried was today, Monday, March 11th.\n\nMy children missed school on Friday to be at both of the two viewings held. Being so young...they really had a hard time seeing their grandfather in his casket.  The weekend was difficult for them; he\u2019s the first family member that they know very well to have passed away. They did a bit better at the wake but were still pretty emotional. Crying. It broke my heart.\n\nToday he is being laid in his final resting place. A small handful of my ex\u2019s family members will be there. It\u2019s also a Monday and both my son and daughter have tests at school today. I asked them if they wanted to go to the burial; both shook their heads no. My son said that he had \u201calready said goodbye to Pappy\u201d. \n\nI sent them to school. I just received a phone call from my ex-MIL asking what time I would have the kids at the cemetery. I felt absolutely horrible telling her that the kids were in school and would not be attending the burial. She was *very* upset by this even after I explained that the kids themselves felt that they had already said goodbye. \n\nAm I the Asshole for not forcing my children to attend their Pappy\u2019s burial? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, so the user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong for sending their kids to school instead of the grandfather's burial. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the situation: The kids are 6 and 9 years old. Their grandfather passed away, and there was a viewing on Friday, a wake on Saturday. The burial is on Monday, a school day. The kids had tests that day. The parents are divorced, and the author is the parent who took the kids to the viewings and the wake. Now, the ex-mother-in-law is upset that the kids aren't going to the burial.\n\nThe author let the kids decide not to go, as they felt they had already said goodbye. The user thinks the author is in the wrong. I need to figure out if sending the kids to school instead of the burial is wrong.\n\nLet me consider the factors. The kids are very young, and they've already attended two events (viewing and wake) where they were upset. The burial is on a Monday, which is a school day, and the kids have tests. The author is respecting the kids' wishes. But the ex-MIL is upset because the burial is a traditional part of the funeral process.\n\nFrom a parent's perspective, the child's well-being is crucial. Forcing a child to attend might cause more trauma. The kids have already been through a lot. The author is prioritizing their education and the child's emotional state. The ex-MIL's expectations might be cultural or personal, but the parent has to balance that with the child's needs.\n\nHowever, some might argue that the burial is an important family tradition, and the kids should attend to show respect. But the author is a divorced parent, and the kids live with the mother, so perhaps the ex's family has different traditions. The key here is the child's emotional state and their own feelings. If the kids felt they said goodbye already, maybe it's not wrong to let them stay in school for their tests.\n\nI need to think about the child's age. At 6 and 9, they might not fully understand the burial's significance. The author is respecting their decision, which could be seen as being in their best interest. The ex-MIL's upset is understandable, but the parent's role is to protect their children's well-being. So, is the author in the wrong? Probably not. Answer B.\n"
