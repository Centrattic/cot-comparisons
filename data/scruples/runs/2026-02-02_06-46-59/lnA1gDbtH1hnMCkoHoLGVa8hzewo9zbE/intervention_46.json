Their father and I are divorced and not on the greatest terms but I loved my ex-FIL like my own Father. We were very close and at one point he and my ex-MIL even lived with us. He passed away after a long, hard battle with a relatively rare disorder.\n\nHis funeral home viewings were this past Friday, March 8th. The service and wake held for them was March 9th, Saturday. Because he was a Veteran the whole process was much slower as the veterans cemetery he wanted to be laid to rest has been extremely busy the last few weeks and the earliest he could be buried was today, Monday, March 11th.\n\nMy children missed school on Friday to be at both of the two viewings held. Being so young...they really had a hard time seeing their grandfather in his casket.  The weekend was difficult for them; he\u2019s the first family member that they know very well to have passed away. They did a bit better at the wake but were still pretty emotional. Crying. It broke my heart.\n\nToday he is being laid in his final resting place. A small handful of my ex\u2019s family members will be there. It\u2019s also a Monday and both my son and daughter have tests at school today. I asked them if they wanted to go to the burial; both shook their heads no. My son said that he had \u201calready said goodbye to Pappy\u201d. \n\nI sent them to school. I just received a phone call from my ex-MIL asking what time I would have the kids at the cemetery. I felt absolutely horrible telling her that the kids were in school and would not be attending the burial. She was *very* upset by this even after I explained that the kids themselves felt that they had already said goodbye. \n\nAm I the Asshole for not forcing my children to attend their Pappy\u2019s burial? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is about sending kids to school instead of a grandfather's burial. The kids are 6 and 9 years old. The grandfather passed away in March, and there were viewings on Friday, a wake on Saturday, and the burial on Monday. The kids already attended the viewings and the wake, but the author chose to send them to school instead of the burial because they had tests and the kids didn't want to go again.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the kids' well-being. They were already upset from seeing their grandfather in the casket during the viewings. The author mentioned they had a hard time, crying, and it's their first family member to pass away. If they're not emotionally ready to attend the burial, forcing them might cause more trauma. The kids themselves said they didn't want to go, so respecting their wishes might be important.\n\nOn the other hand, some might argue that attending the burial is a family tradition or a way to honor the grandfather. The ex-MIL was upset because she expected the kids to be there. However, the author's decision was based on the kids' emotional state and their own wishes. The burial is on a Monday, which is a school day, and they have tests. The author is a parent, so her priority is the children's immediate needs. \n\nI think the key factors are the children's emotional well-being and their own decision not to attend. Forcing them could be seen as disregarding their feelings. The author explained the situation to the ex-MIL, so maybe the upset is more about expectations not being met rather than the author's actions being wrong. So the answer might be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
