Their father and I are divorced and not on the greatest terms but I loved my ex-FIL like my own Father. We were very close and at one point he and my ex-MIL even lived with us. He passed away after a long, hard battle with a relatively rare disorder.\n\nHis funeral home viewings were this past Friday, March 8th. The service and wake held for them was March 9th, Saturday. Because he was a Veteran the whole process was much slower as the veterans cemetery he wanted to be laid to rest has been extremely busy the last few weeks and the earliest he could be buried was today, Monday, March 11th.\n\nMy children missed school on Friday to be at both of the two viewings held. Being so young...they really had a hard time seeing their grandfather in his casket.  The weekend was difficult for them; he\u2019s the first family member that they know very well to have passed away. They did a bit better at the wake but were still pretty emotional. Crying. It broke my heart.\n\nToday he is being laid in his final resting place. A small handful of my ex\u2019s family members will be there. It\u2019s also a Monday and both my son and daughter have tests at school today. I asked them if they wanted to go to the burial; both shook their heads no. My son said that he had \u201calready said goodbye to Pappy\u201d. \n\nI sent them to school. I just received a phone call from my ex-MIL asking what time I would have the kids at the cemetery. I felt absolutely horrible telling her that the kids were in school and would not be attending the burial. She was *very* upset by this even after I explained that the kids themselves felt that they had already said goodbye. \n\nAm I the Asshole for not forcing my children to attend their Pappy\u2019s burial? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not making their kids go to the grandfather's burial. So, the situation is that the kids already attended the viewings and the wake, which were on Friday and Saturday. The actual burial is on Monday, which is a school day, and the kids have tests. They didn't want to go, so the author sent them to school. The ex-MIL is upset.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the children's well-being. The kids are 6 and 9, which are pretty young. They already had a hard time seeing their grandfather at the viewings. Forcing them to attend another event, especially with tests, might add more stress. The author respected the kids' wishes when they said they were done saying goodbye. That seems considerate.\n\nThen there's the school aspect. Tests are important, but is missing school for a funeral more important? Since the kids are young, maybe the school would have been understanding, but the author had already taken them out of school for the viewings. Maybe they can't miss more days. Also, the burial is a Veteran's service, which might be a specific time they couldn't reschedule.\n\nThe ex-MIL's reaction is another point. She's upset because the kids didn't attend. But the author explained the situation. Should the kids have gone regardless? Well, the kids themselves didn't want to. The author didn't force them, which shows they valued the kids' emotional state over attending the burial. \n\nCultural or family expectations might play a role here. In some cultures, attending the burial is crucial. However, the question is about whether the author is in the wrong, not about cultural norms. The key factors here are the children's well-being and their own wishes. The author made a choice based on what was best for the kids, considering their age, the previous emotional strain, and the school tests. \n\nSo, I think the answer is B (No, the author is not in the wrong). They prioritized their children's emotional health and followed their wishes, which is important at that age. The ex-MIL's upset is understandable but the author isn't wrong for making that choice.\n"
