Their father and I are divorced and not on the greatest terms but I loved my ex-FIL like my own Father. We were very close and at one point he and my ex-MIL even lived with us. He passed away after a long, hard battle with a relatively rare disorder.\n\nHis funeral home viewings were this past Friday, March 8th. The service and wake held for them was March 9th, Saturday. Because he was a Veteran the whole process was much slower as the veterans cemetery he wanted to be laid to rest has been extremely busy the last few weeks and the earliest he could be buried was today, Monday, March 11th.\n\nMy children missed school on Friday to be at both of the two viewings held. Being so young...they really had a hard time seeing their grandfather in his casket.  The weekend was difficult for them; he\u2019s the first family member that they know very well to have passed away. They did a bit better at the wake but were still pretty emotional. Crying. It broke my heart.\n\nToday he is being laid in his final resting place. A small handful of my ex\u2019s family members will be there. It\u2019s also a Monday and both my son and daughter have tests at school today. I asked them if they wanted to go to the burial; both shook their heads no. My son said that he had \u201calready said goodbye to Pappy\u201d. \n\nI sent them to school. I just received a phone call from my ex-MIL asking what time I would have the kids at the cemetery. I felt absolutely horrible telling her that the kids were in school and would not be attending the burial. She was *very* upset by this even after I explained that the kids themselves felt that they had already said goodbye. \n\nAm I the Asshole for not forcing my children to attend their Pappy\u2019s burial? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for not making their kids attend the grandfather's burial. The author's kids are 6 and 9 years old, and they already missed school for the viewings. They were really upset during the viewings and the wake. The author explained that the kids didn't want to go to the burial, so she sent them to school because they had tests. Her ex-MIL was upset about it.\n\nHmm, so first, the key points here are the children's well-being and their emotional state. The kids had already attended the viewings and the wake, which were traumatic for them. They expressed not wanting to go to the burial again. The author chose to respect their wishes and send them to school instead. The ex-MIL is upset, but the author's priority seems to be the children's emotional health.\n\nIn similar situations, experts often recommend letting children participate in ways they feel comfortable with. Forcing them to attend might cause more distress. The author did explain the situation and listened to the kids, which is important. The fact that the kids had tests on a school day also plays a role here, as the author prioritized their education and their emotional needs.\n\nThe ex-MIL's reaction is understandable, but the author isn't the one responsible for the children's needs. The children's well-being should come first, especially at that age. The author isn't in the wrong for respecting their children's feelings and making a decision that's best for them. So the answer should be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
