Their father and I are divorced and not on the greatest terms but I loved my ex-FIL like my own Father. We were very close and at one point he and my ex-MIL even lived with us. He passed away after a long, hard battle with a relatively rare disorder.\n\nHis funeral home viewings were this past Friday, March 8th. The service and wake held for them was March 9th, Saturday. Because he was a Veteran the whole process was much slower as the veterans cemetery he wanted to be laid to rest has been extremely busy the last few weeks and the earliest he could be buried was today, Monday, March 11th.\n\nMy children missed school on Friday to be at both of the two viewings held. Being so young...they really had a hard time seeing their grandfather in his casket.  The weekend was difficult for them; he\u2019s the first family member that they know very well to have passed away. They did a bit better at the wake but were still pretty emotional. Crying. It broke my heart.\n\nToday he is being laid in his final resting place. A small handful of my ex\u2019s family members will be there. It\u2019s also a Monday and both my son and daughter have tests at school today. I asked them if they wanted to go to the burial; both shook their heads no. My son said that he had \u201calready said goodbye to Pappy\u201d. \n\nI sent them to school. I just received a phone call from my ex-MIL asking what time I would have the kids at the cemetery. I felt absolutely horrible telling her that the kids were in school and would not be attending the burial. She was *very* upset by this even after I explained that the kids themselves felt that they had already said goodbye. \n\nAm I the Asshole for not forcing my children to attend their Pappy\u2019s burial? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the \"Am I the Asshole?\" post is in the wrong for not making their kids attend the grandfather's burial. The user thinks the author is in the wrong, but wants my opinion.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The kids are 6 and 9 years old. Their grandfather on the father's side passed away. The parents are divorced and not on good terms. The kids attended the viewings and the wake but were upset. The burial is on a Monday, and they have tests at school. The kids themselves didn't want to go to the burial. The author sent them to school instead. The ex-MIL is upset about it.\n\nThe key points here are: the children's emotional well-being, their own wishes, the practical aspects like school tests, and cultural expectations around funerals. \n\nIn many cultures, attending a funeral is seen as a sign of respect. However, the children have already attended the viewings and wake, which might have been more appropriate for their age. The burial might be more for family and close relatives. The kids are young and were emotionally affected by seeing their grandfather. Forcing them to attend could cause further distress. \n\nAlso, the children expressed that they had already said goodbye. If they don't want to go, respecting their wishes could be important for their emotional health. The author is prioritizing the children's emotional state and academic responsibilities. The ex-MIL might feel slighted, but the author might not have control over that. \n\nAnother angle is the parent's responsibility to make decisions in the child's best interest. Since the kids were already traumatized, making them attend another event might not be in their best interest. The author isn't being disrespectful, just making a choice based on the children's needs. \n\nSo, considering all that, the author isn't in the wrong. They made a decision that prioritized their children's well-being over attending the burial, especially since the kids didn't want to go. The answer should be B (No).\n"
