Their father and I are divorced and not on the greatest terms but I loved my ex-FIL like my own Father. We were very close and at one point he and my ex-MIL even lived with us. He passed away after a long, hard battle with a relatively rare disorder.\n\nHis funeral home viewings were this past Friday, March 8th. The service and wake held for them was March 9th, Saturday. Because he was a Veteran the whole process was much slower as the veterans cemetery he wanted to be laid to rest has been extremely busy the last few weeks and the earliest he could be buried was today, Monday, March 11th.\n\nMy children missed school on Friday to be at both of the two viewings held. Being so young...they really had a hard time seeing their grandfather in his casket.  The weekend was difficult for them; he\u2019s the first family member that they know very well to have passed away. They did a bit better at the wake but were still pretty emotional. Crying. It broke my heart.\n\nToday he is being laid in his final resting place. A small handful of my ex\u2019s family members will be there. It\u2019s also a Monday and both my son and daughter have tests at school today. I asked them if they wanted to go to the burial; both shook their heads no. My son said that he had \u201calready said goodbye to Pappy\u201d. \n\nI sent them to school. I just received a phone call from my ex-MIL asking what time I would have the kids at the cemetery. I felt absolutely horrible telling her that the kids were in school and would not be attending the burial. She was *very* upset by this even after I explained that the kids themselves felt that they had already said goodbye. \n\nAm I the Asshole for not forcing my children to attend their Pappy\u2019s burial? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. The question is whether sending the kids to school instead of the grandfather's burial makes them the asshole.\n\nFirst, the situation: The kids are 6 and 9. They've already attended viewings and a wake, which were emotionally tough for them. The burial is on a Monday, and they have school tests. The kids themselves said they didn't want to go to the burial, so the parent sent them to school. The ex-MIL is upset, but the parent explains the kids' wishes.\n\nI need to consider the children's well-being. Young kids might not handle a burial well, especially if they're already upset. The parent might be prioritizing their emotional health by not forcing them to attend another event. The kids are old enough to express their feelings, and they chose not to go. The parent is respecting their choice, which seems good.\n\nOn the other hand, some might argue that attending the burial is a family tradition or important for closure. But the kids have already said goodbye and the parent is handling the situation based on the kids' needs. The parent isn't being selfish; they're considering the children's current emotional state and school commitments. The ex-MIL's reaction is understandable but the parent isn't obligated to satisfy the ex-MIL's expectations, especially since the ex-MIL is the parent's ex. \n\nSo, the parent made a decision based on the children's wishes and their well-being. They explained the situation, so they aren't being inconsiderate. Therefore, the answer is probably B (No, not in the wrong).\n"
