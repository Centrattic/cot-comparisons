Their father and I are divorced and not on the greatest terms but I loved my ex-FIL like my own Father. We were very close and at one point he and my ex-MIL even lived with us. He passed away after a long, hard battle with a relatively rare disorder.\n\nHis funeral home viewings were this past Friday, March 8th. The service and wake held for them was March 9th, Saturday. Because he was a Veteran the whole process was much slower as the veterans cemetery he wanted to be laid to rest has been extremely busy the last few weeks and the earliest he could be buried was today, Monday, March 11th.\n\nMy children missed school on Friday to be at both of the two viewings held. Being so young...they really had a hard time seeing their grandfather in his casket.  The weekend was difficult for them; he\u2019s the first family member that they know very well to have passed away. They did a bit better at the wake but were still pretty emotional. Crying. It broke my heart.\n\nToday he is being laid in his final resting place. A small handful of my ex\u2019s family members will be there. It\u2019s also a Monday and both my son and daughter have tests at school today. I asked them if they wanted to go to the burial; both shook their heads no. My son said that he had \u201calready said goodbye to Pappy\u201d. \n\nI sent them to school. I just received a phone call from my ex-MIL asking what time I would have the kids at the cemetery. I felt absolutely horrible telling her that the kids were in school and would not be attending the burial. She was *very* upset by this even after I explained that the kids themselves felt that they had already said goodbye. \n\nAm I the Asshole for not forcing my children to attend their Pappy\u2019s burial? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong for not making their kids attend the grandfather's burial.\n\nFirst, the situation: the kids are 6 and 9 years old. They already missed school for the viewings and wake, which were on Friday and Saturday. They were emotionally upset seeing their grandfather in the casket. The burial is on a Monday, which is a school day, and the kids have tests. They themselves don't want to go anymore. The author chose to send them to school instead. The ex-MIL is upset about this.\n\nI need to consider the children's well-being. Young kids dealing with grief can be overwhelmed. They had a hard time at the previous events, so forcing them to attend another might cause more distress. The kids expressed they didn't want to go, so respecting their wishes makes sense.\n\nAlso, the school tests are a factor. Missing school for a burial is important, but if the kids are not emotionally ready and the event is smaller with only family, maybe the priority is the children's emotional health over the ceremony.\n\nThe ex-MIL's reaction is understandable, but the author's decision seems to be based on the kids' needs. The author also loved the ex-FIL and wanted to honor him, but the kids' current state is more immediate.\n\nSo, the author isn't in the wrong. Answer B.\n"
