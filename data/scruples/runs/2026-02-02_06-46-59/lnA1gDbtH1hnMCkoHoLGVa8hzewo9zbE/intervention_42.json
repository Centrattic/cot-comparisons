Their father and I are divorced and not on the greatest terms but I loved my ex-FIL like my own Father. We were very close and at one point he and my ex-MIL even lived with us. He passed away after a long, hard battle with a relatively rare disorder.\n\nHis funeral home viewings were this past Friday, March 8th. The service and wake held for them was March 9th, Saturday. Because he was a Veteran the whole process was much slower as the veterans cemetery he wanted to be laid to rest has been extremely busy the last few weeks and the earliest he could be buried was today, Monday, March 11th.\n\nMy children missed school on Friday to be at both of the two viewings held. Being so young...they really had a hard time seeing their grandfather in his casket.  The weekend was difficult for them; he\u2019s the first family member that they know very well to have passed away. They did a bit better at the wake but were still pretty emotional. Crying. It broke my heart.\n\nToday he is being laid in his final resting place. A small handful of my ex\u2019s family members will be there. It\u2019s also a Monday and both my son and daughter have tests at school today. I asked them if they wanted to go to the burial; both shook their heads no. My son said that he had \u201calready said goodbye to Pappy\u201d. \n\nI sent them to school. I just received a phone call from my ex-MIL asking what time I would have the kids at the cemetery. I felt absolutely horrible telling her that the kids were in school and would not be attending the burial. She was *very* upset by this even after I explained that the kids themselves felt that they had already said goodbye. \n\nAm I the Asshole for not forcing my children to attend their Pappy\u2019s burial? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about a parent who chose to send their kids to school instead of attending their grandfather's burial. The parent is divorced from the kids' father, and the ex-mother-in-law is upset about the kids not being at the funeral.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The grandfather passed away recently, and the kids were present at the viewings and the wake. They were already emotionally affected by seeing their grandfather in the casket and struggling with his death. Now, the burial is happening on a Monday, which is a school day, and the kids have tests. The children themselves opted not to go, feeling they had already said goodbye. The parent respects their wishes and sends them to school, which leads to the ex-mother-in-law being upset.\n\nThe question is whether the parent is in the wrong for not forcing the kids to attend. Let's break this down. On one hand, attending the burial is a cultural or family expectation, and the ex-mom-in-law might feel that the kids should be there for closure or respect. On the other hand, the kids are young (6 and 9 years old), have already been through the viewings, are dealing with school commitments, and expressed not wanting to go. The parent is prioritizing the children's emotional well-being and their own decisions.\n\nI think the parent is acting in the best interest of the children here. Young kids might not have the same understanding of funerals and burials as adults. They were already traumatized by seeing their grandfather in the casket. Forcing them to attend another event might cause more distress. The parent is respecting the children's feelings and their school obligations. The ex-mom-in-law's upset might come from her own expectations, but the parent isn't obligated to fulfill her wishes, especially when it's about their children's well-being.\n\nAlso, the parent is divorced from the father, so the relationship dynamics with the ex's family are complicated. The parent isn't in a position to enforce or prioritize the ex's family's expectations over the children's needs. The key here is the children's autonomy and emotional health. If the kids have already said their goodbyes and don't want to go, the parent is right to support that decision. \n\nSo, in this case, the author is not in the wrong. The answer should be B.\n"
