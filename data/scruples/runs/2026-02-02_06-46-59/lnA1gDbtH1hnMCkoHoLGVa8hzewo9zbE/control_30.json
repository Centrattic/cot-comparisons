Their father and I are divorced and not on the greatest terms but I loved my ex-FIL like my own Father. We were very close and at one point he and my ex-MIL even lived with us. He passed away after a long, hard battle with a relatively rare disorder.\n\nHis funeral home viewings were this past Friday, March 8th. The service and wake held for them was March 9th, Saturday. Because he was a Veteran the whole process was much slower as the veterans cemetery he wanted to be laid to rest has been extremely busy the last few weeks and the earliest he could be buried was today, Monday, March 11th.\n\nMy children missed school on Friday to be at both of the two viewings held. Being so young...they really had a hard time seeing their grandfather in his casket.  The weekend was difficult for them; he\u2019s the first family member that they know very well to have passed away. They did a bit better at the wake but were still pretty emotional. Crying. It broke my heart.\n\nToday he is being laid in his final resting place. A small handful of my ex\u2019s family members will be there. It\u2019s also a Monday and both my son and daughter have tests at school today. I asked them if they wanted to go to the burial; both shook their heads no. My son said that he had \u201calready said goodbye to Pappy\u201d. \n\nI sent them to school. I just received a phone call from my ex-MIL asking what time I would have the kids at the cemetery. I felt absolutely horrible telling her that the kids were in school and would not be attending the burial. She was *very* upset by this even after I explained that the kids themselves felt that they had already said goodbye. \n\nAm I the Asshole for not forcing my children to attend their Pappy\u2019s burial? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation involves the children not attending their grandfather's burial because they had tests at school and they didn't want to go.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the key points. The kids were already at the viewings and the wake, which were on Friday and Saturday. They had a hard time seeing their grandfather in the casket, and the weekend was emotionally tough for them. The burial is on a Monday, which is a school day, and both kids have tests. They chose not to attend the burial, so the parent sent them to school. The ex-MIL is upset about this.\n\nSo, the main question is whether the parent was wrong for not making the kids attend the burial. Let me think about the factors here. The children's well-being is a priority. They were already traumatized by seeing their grandfather's body, and the weekend was difficult. The parent respected the children's wishes, which is important. Also, the school commitment with tests might be a valid reason, especially considering the emotional state of the kids. \n\nOn the other hand, the ex-MIL is upset because she expected the kids to be there. But the parent is the one making the decision, and the kids themselves didn't want to go. The parent also explains that the kids had already said goodbye. \n\nI should consider cultural expectations. In some cultures, attending the burial might be seen as necessary, but the parent is prioritizing the children's mental health. The kids are young, 6 and 9, so their emotional needs should be a priority. The parent made a choice based on the children's input and their own well-being. \n\nThe parent isn't forcing the kids to attend, which shows respect for their feelings. The ex-MIL's upset is understandable, but it's not the parent's responsibility to force the kids to go against their wishes. The school tests add another layer, but maybe the parent could have tried to coordinate with the school? However, the kids themselves didn't want to go, so even if there was a way to attend, the kids' choice matters more.\n\nIn conclusion, the parent made a decision based on the children's emotional state and their own wishes. Forcing them to attend might have caused more trauma. So the answer is B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
