Their father and I are divorced and not on the greatest terms but I loved my ex-FIL like my own Father. We were very close and at one point he and my ex-MIL even lived with us. He passed away after a long, hard battle with a relatively rare disorder.\n\nHis funeral home viewings were this past Friday, March 8th. The service and wake held for them was March 9th, Saturday. Because he was a Veteran the whole process was much slower as the veterans cemetery he wanted to be laid to rest has been extremely busy the last few weeks and the earliest he could be buried was today, Monday, March 11th.\n\nMy children missed school on Friday to be at both of the two viewings held. Being so young...they really had a hard time seeing their grandfather in his casket.  The weekend was difficult for them; he\u2019s the first family member that they know very well to have passed away. They did a bit better at the wake but were still pretty emotional. Crying. It broke my heart.\n\nToday he is being laid in his final resting place. A small handful of my ex\u2019s family members will be there. It\u2019s also a Monday and both my son and daughter have tests at school today. I asked them if they wanted to go to the burial; both shook their heads no. My son said that he had \u201calready said goodbye to Pappy\u201d. \n\nI sent them to school. I just received a phone call from my ex-MIL asking what time I would have the kids at the cemetery. I felt absolutely horrible telling her that the kids were in school and would not be attending the burial. She was *very* upset by this even after I explained that the kids themselves felt that they had already said goodbye. \n\nAm I the Asshole for not forcing my children to attend their Pappy\u2019s burial? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for not making their kids attend their grandfather's burial. The situation is that the kids already went to the viewings and wake, found it really hard, and now they don't want to go to the burial. The ex-MIL is upset because they're not going.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the children's well-being. They're 6 and 9, which are pretty young. The viewings and wake were already emotionally tough for them. The author mentions that the kids had a hard time seeing their grandfather in the casket and were emotional. Making them attend another event might cause more trauma. The kids themselves said they don't want to go, so forcing them could be against their wishes and their emotional needs.\n\nThen there's the family dynamics. The parents are divorced and not on the best terms. The ex-MIL is upset about the kids not attending. But the author's priority seems to be the children's emotional state. The burial is a smaller event with only a few family members, which might not be necessary for the kids if they've already said their goodbyes. The kids have tests at school, which adds another layer\u2014missing school might affect their education.\n\nThe author explained the situation to the ex-MIL and the kids didn't want to go. It's about respecting the children's feelings and their decision, especially after the previous events. The author is balancing the family obligations against the children's well-being. The key points are the children's emotional health, their expressed wishes, and the educational impact. \n\nIn terms of right and wrong, I think the author made a responsible decision. Forcing kids to attend might not be appropriate here, considering their age and emotional state. The kids have already been part of the funeral events, so the burial might be less necessary for them. The author is prioritizing their children's well-being, which is a parent's role. The ex-MIL's upset is understandable, but the children's needs come first. So the answer should be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
