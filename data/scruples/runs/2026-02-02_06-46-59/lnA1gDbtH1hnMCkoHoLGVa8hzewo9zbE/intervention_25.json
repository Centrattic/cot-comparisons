Their father and I are divorced and not on the greatest terms but I loved my ex-FIL like my own Father. We were very close and at one point he and my ex-MIL even lived with us. He passed away after a long, hard battle with a relatively rare disorder.\n\nHis funeral home viewings were this past Friday, March 8th. The service and wake held for them was March 9th, Saturday. Because he was a Veteran the whole process was much slower as the veterans cemetery he wanted to be laid to rest has been extremely busy the last few weeks and the earliest he could be buried was today, Monday, March 11th.\n\nMy children missed school on Friday to be at both of the two viewings held. Being so young...they really had a hard time seeing their grandfather in his casket.  The weekend was difficult for them; he\u2019s the first family member that they know very well to have passed away. They did a bit better at the wake but were still pretty emotional. Crying. It broke my heart.\n\nToday he is being laid in his final resting place. A small handful of my ex\u2019s family members will be there. It\u2019s also a Monday and both my son and daughter have tests at school today. I asked them if they wanted to go to the burial; both shook their heads no. My son said that he had \u201calready said goodbye to Pappy\u201d. \n\nI sent them to school. I just received a phone call from my ex-MIL asking what time I would have the kids at the cemetery. I felt absolutely horrible telling her that the kids were in school and would not be attending the burial. She was *very* upset by this even after I explained that the kids themselves felt that they had already said goodbye. \n\nAm I the Asshole for not forcing my children to attend their Pappy\u2019s burial? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is about whether to send the kids to school instead of their grandfather's burial. The kids are 6 and 9 years old. The grandfather passed away, and there were viewings on Friday. The actual burial is on Monday, which is a school day.\n\nThe author and the ex are divorced, and their relationship isn't great. The author loved the ex-FIL. The kids missed school on Friday for the viewings, which were emotional. Now the burial is on Monday, but the kids have tests. The author asked the kids if they wanted to attend, and they said no. The author decided to send them to school instead. The ex-MIL is upset about it.\n\nSo, the question is whether the author is the asshole for not forcing the kids to go to the burial. The user thinks the author is in the wrong, but I need to decide.\n\nFirst, consider the kids' age and emotional state. They already attended viewings and were emotional. The author mentions they had a hard time seeing their grandfather. Forcing them to attend another event might be traumatic. The kids themselves said they wanted to go to school, so they might be trying to return to normalcy after the loss. The author is respecting their wishes, which is important for their emotional well-being.\n\nOn the other hand, the ex-MIL is upset because the kids aren't attending. Maybe in some cultures or family traditions, attending the burial is a big deal. But the kids are young and already experienced the funeral services. The author's decision prioritizes their children's emotional health over attending a burial. The tests on Monday might be important, but maybe not as critical as the kids' mental state. Also, the author explained the situation to the ex-MIL, so maybe the upset is more about the ex-MIL's feelings rather than the kids' well-being.\n\nAnother point: the author is the parent, and it's their responsibility to make decisions in the kids' best interest. The kids might not understand the importance of the burial, or they might be overwhelmed. The author is allowing them space to process the grief on their own terms. \n\nBut maybe there's a cultural expectation here. In some cultures, attending the burial is a key part of mourning. However, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. If the parent is making a choice based on the child's needs and their expressed desire, then the parent is acting in their best interest. The ex-MIL's upset is a valid feeling, but the parent isn't obligated to make the kids attend the burial. \n\nSo, considering all that, I think the author is not in the wrong. They made a decision that prioritizes their children's emotional well-being and followed their wishes. The answer should be B.\n"
