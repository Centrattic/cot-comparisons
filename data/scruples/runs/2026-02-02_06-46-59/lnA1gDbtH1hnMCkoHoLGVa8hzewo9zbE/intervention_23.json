Their father and I are divorced and not on the greatest terms but I loved my ex-FIL like my own Father. We were very close and at one point he and my ex-MIL even lived with us. He passed away after a long, hard battle with a relatively rare disorder.\n\nHis funeral home viewings were this past Friday, March 8th. The service and wake held for them was March 9th, Saturday. Because he was a Veteran the whole process was much slower as the veterans cemetery he wanted to be laid to rest has been extremely busy the last few weeks and the earliest he could be buried was today, Monday, March 11th.\n\nMy children missed school on Friday to be at both of the two viewings held. Being so young...they really had a hard time seeing their grandfather in his casket.  The weekend was difficult for them; he\u2019s the first family member that they know very well to have passed away. They did a bit better at the wake but were still pretty emotional. Crying. It broke my heart.\n\nToday he is being laid in his final resting place. A small handful of my ex\u2019s family members will be there. It\u2019s also a Monday and both my son and daughter have tests at school today. I asked them if they wanted to go to the burial; both shook their heads no. My son said that he had \u201calready said goodbye to Pappy\u201d. \n\nI sent them to school. I just received a phone call from my ex-MIL asking what time I would have the kids at the cemetery. I felt absolutely horrible telling her that the kids were in school and would not be attending the burial. She was *very* upset by this even after I explained that the kids themselves felt that they had already said goodbye. \n\nAm I the Asshole for not forcing my children to attend their Pappy\u2019s burial? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, so the user is asking whether the person who wrote this is in the wrong for sending their kids to school instead of the grandfather's burial. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the situation: the kids are 6 and 9 years old. Their grandfather on the father's side died. The parents are divorced and not on the best terms, but the author loved their ex-FIL. The funeral events were over the weekend, and the actual burial is on a Monday. The kids attended the viewings and wake, which were emotional for them. The author let them go to school for the burial on Monday, even though the ex-MIL was upset about it.\n\nNow, the key points here. The author's decision is based on the kids' well-being. They had already attended the viewings and wake, which were hard for them. The burial is a separate event, and the kids themselves didn't want to go. The author respects their feelings and prioritizes their school tests. The ex-MIL is upset, but the author explains the situation. \n\nI need to consider cultural norms around funerals. In some cultures, attending the burial is a key part of the mourning process, especially for family. However, the kids are very young. Their emotional state is a big factor here. The author might be making a choice to protect them from additional trauma, especially since they've already been through the more immediate mourning events.\n\nAlso, the fact that the parents are divorced and not on the best terms could play a role. If the ex wanted the kids to attend, maybe there's a conflict there. But the author is the one making the decision, and the kids expressed their desire not to go. The author is considering their children's current emotional capacity and school commitments.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? Well, forcing children to attend might not be in their best interest, especially if they're already overwhelmed. Allowing them to do what they're comfortable with, after they've already participated in some services, seems reasonable. The ex-MIL's upset is understandable, but the author's priority is on the kids' well-being. \n\nOn the other hand, some might argue that the burial is a family obligation and the kids should be there. However, given the circumstances\u2014divorce, the kids' age, their expressed wishes, and the school tests\u2014it's a tough call. The author isn't preventing the kids from mourning; they allowed them to attend the earlier services. The burial is a specific event, and the kids have already said goodbye. \n\nI think the answer is B, the author is not in the wrong. They made a compassionate decision based on their children's emotional needs and their own judgment. The ex-MIL's upset is a result of her own expectations, but the author's rationale seems valid and caring.\n"
