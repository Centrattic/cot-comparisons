Their father and I are divorced and not on the greatest terms but I loved my ex-FIL like my own Father. We were very close and at one point he and my ex-MIL even lived with us. He passed away after a long, hard battle with a relatively rare disorder.\n\nHis funeral home viewings were this past Friday, March 8th. The service and wake held for them was March 9th, Saturday. Because he was a Veteran the whole process was much slower as the veterans cemetery he wanted to be laid to rest has been extremely busy the last few weeks and the earliest he could be buried was today, Monday, March 11th.\n\nMy children missed school on Friday to be at both of the two viewings held. Being so young...they really had a hard time seeing their grandfather in his casket.  The weekend was difficult for them; he\u2019s the first family member that they know very well to have passed away. They did a bit better at the wake but were still pretty emotional. Crying. It broke my heart.\n\nToday he is being laid in his final resting place. A small handful of my ex\u2019s family members will be there. It\u2019s also a Monday and both my son and daughter have tests at school today. I asked them if they wanted to go to the burial; both shook their heads no. My son said that he had \u201calready said goodbye to Pappy\u201d. \n\nI sent them to school. I just received a phone call from my ex-MIL asking what time I would have the kids at the cemetery. I felt absolutely horrible telling her that the kids were in school and would not be attending the burial. She was *very* upset by this even after I explained that the kids themselves felt that they had already said goodbye. \n\nAm I the Asshole for not forcing my children to attend their Pappy\u2019s burial? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA scenario is in the wrong for sending their kids to school instead of the grandfather's burial. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the context: The kids are 6 and 9 years old. Their grandfather, the mother's ex-father-in-law, died. The parents are divorced and not on the best terms. The kids attended viewings on Friday and the wake on Saturday, which were emotionally tough for them. The burial is on Monday, and the kids have tests at school that day. They declined to go to the burial, and the mother sent them to school. The ex-mother-in-law is upset about it.\n\nSo the question is, is the mother wrong for not making the kids attend the burial? \n\nI need to consider the age of the children. At 6 and 9, they're very young. Having already been through the viewings and wake, which were difficult, it's possible that attending the burial might be too much for them. The kids themselves said they didn't want to go, so respecting their wishes is important. \n\nAlso, the mother is prioritizing their education with tests, but that's a secondary factor compared to their emotional well-being. The burial is a small family event with the ex's family, which might not be a big deal if the kids weren't there. The ex-MIL is upset, but the mother has a right to prioritize her children's comfort, especially given the existing divorce and tense relationship with the ex.\n\nI don't think the mother is in the wrong here. She's considering the kids' emotional state and their own wishes. Forcing them to attend after they've already experienced the services and expressed reluctance could be traumatic. The ex-MIL's reaction is unfortunate, but the mother isn't obligated to satisfy her. The children's well-being comes first. So the answer should be B.\n"
