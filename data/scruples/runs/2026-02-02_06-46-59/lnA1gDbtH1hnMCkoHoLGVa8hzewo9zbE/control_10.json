Their father and I are divorced and not on the greatest terms but I loved my ex-FIL like my own Father. We were very close and at one point he and my ex-MIL even lived with us. He passed away after a long, hard battle with a relatively rare disorder.\n\nHis funeral home viewings were this past Friday, March 8th. The service and wake held for them was March 9th, Saturday. Because he was a Veteran the whole process was much slower as the veterans cemetery he wanted to be laid to rest has been extremely busy the last few weeks and the earliest he could be buried was today, Monday, March 11th.\n\nMy children missed school on Friday to be at both of the two viewings held. Being so young...they really had a hard time seeing their grandfather in his casket.  The weekend was difficult for them; he\u2019s the first family member that they know very well to have passed away. They did a bit better at the wake but were still pretty emotional. Crying. It broke my heart.\n\nToday he is being laid in his final resting place. A small handful of my ex\u2019s family members will be there. It\u2019s also a Monday and both my son and daughter have tests at school today. I asked them if they wanted to go to the burial; both shook their heads no. My son said that he had \u201calready said goodbye to Pappy\u201d. \n\nI sent them to school. I just received a phone call from my ex-MIL asking what time I would have the kids at the cemetery. I felt absolutely horrible telling her that the kids were in school and would not be attending the burial. She was *very* upset by this even after I explained that the kids themselves felt that they had already said goodbye. \n\nAm I the Asshole for not forcing my children to attend their Pappy\u2019s burial? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not making their kids go to the grandfather's burial. Let me read through the situation again carefully.\n\nSo, the kids are 6 and 9 years old. Their grandfather, the author's ex-father-in-law, passed away. The father and author are divorced and not on the best terms, but the author loved the grandfather. The grandfather had a long illness, and the funeral process was delayed because it's a veteran's cemetery. The kids already went to the viewings on Friday and the wake on Saturday, which were tough for them. Now, the burial is on Monday, which is a school day, and the kids have tests. The author asked the kids if they wanted to go, and they declined, saying they already said goodbye. The ex-mother-in-law is upset because the kids aren't attending.\n\nHmm. The key points here are the children's well-being versus the expectations of the family. The kids have already attended the viewings and wake, which were emotionally difficult. Now, the burial is on a school day with important tests. The children themselves have expressed not wanting to go. The author respects their wishes. The ex-MIL is upset, but the author's decision prioritizes the kids' emotional state and their school responsibilities.\n\nIn similar situations, experts often advise that children's emotional needs and their own wishes should be considered. Forcing children to attend a burial they don't want to go to, especially after already attending other events, might cause more trauma. Also, school attendance is important, and tests on a Monday might be significant. The author isn't ignoring the funeral; the kids have already participated in the earlier services.\n\nThe ex-MIL's reaction is valid in terms of family expectations, but the author is making a choice based on what's best for the kids. There's no indication the author is being selfish; they even tried to accommodate the kids' feelings. The grandfather was a Veteran, but the cemetery's busy schedule pushed the burial to Monday, which complicates things further.\n\nSo, in terms of the \"Am I the Asshole?\" framework, the author's actions seem justified. They considered the children's emotional state, their own wishes, and the practicalities of school. The ex-MIL's upset is understandable but not a reason to force the kids to attend if they're not ready. Therefore, the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
