Their father and I are divorced and not on the greatest terms but I loved my ex-FIL like my own Father. We were very close and at one point he and my ex-MIL even lived with us. He passed away after a long, hard battle with a relatively rare disorder.\n\nHis funeral home viewings were this past Friday, March 8th. The service and wake held for them was March 9th, Saturday. Because he was a Veteran the whole process was much slower as the veterans cemetery he wanted to be laid to rest has been extremely busy the last few weeks and the earliest he could be buried was today, Monday, March 11th.\n\nMy children missed school on Friday to be at both of the two viewings held. Being so young...they really had a hard time seeing their grandfather in his casket.  The weekend was difficult for them; he\u2019s the first family member that they know very well to have passed away. They did a bit better at the wake but were still pretty emotional. Crying. It broke my heart.\n\nToday he is being laid in his final resting place. A small handful of my ex\u2019s family members will be there. It\u2019s also a Monday and both my son and daughter have tests at school today. I asked them if they wanted to go to the burial; both shook their heads no. My son said that he had \u201calready said goodbye to Pappy\u201d. \n\nI sent them to school. I just received a phone call from my ex-MIL asking what time I would have the kids at the cemetery. I felt absolutely horrible telling her that the kids were in school and would not be attending the burial. She was *very* upset by this even after I explained that the kids themselves felt that they had already said goodbye. \n\nAm I the Asshole for not forcing my children to attend their Pappy\u2019s burial? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The question is whether the parent is in the wrong for not making their kids attend the grandfather's burial. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the kids are 6 and 9. They already went to the viewings and the wake, which were on Friday and Saturday. They found it really hard, especially seeing their grandfather in a casket. The burial is on a Monday, which is a school day, and the kids have tests. They themselves decided they didn't want to go, saying they already said goodbye. The parent sent them to school, and the ex-MIL was upset.\n\nSo, the key points here are the children's well-being and their own wishes. The parent considered the emotional state of the kids, who were already traumatized by seeing their grandfather's body. Forcing them to attend another service might cause more distress. Also, the kids prioritized their schoolwork, which is understandable given their age and the importance of their tests. The parent respected their children's wishes, which is important for their autonomy and mental health.\n\nOn the other hand, the ex-MIL is upset because the kids didn't attend the burial. But the parent's decision seems to be in the best interest of the children. The children had already participated in the viewings and wake, which are significant parts of the mourning process. The burial might have been more of a family event, and the kids' comfort was prioritized.\n\nI think the parent made the right choice. It's about balancing family obligations with the children's emotional needs. Since the kids were already affected by the previous events and expressed not wanting to go, forcing them could have been harmful. The answer should be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
