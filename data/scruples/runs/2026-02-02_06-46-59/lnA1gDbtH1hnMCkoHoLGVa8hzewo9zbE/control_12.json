Their father and I are divorced and not on the greatest terms but I loved my ex-FIL like my own Father. We were very close and at one point he and my ex-MIL even lived with us. He passed away after a long, hard battle with a relatively rare disorder.\n\nHis funeral home viewings were this past Friday, March 8th. The service and wake held for them was March 9th, Saturday. Because he was a Veteran the whole process was much slower as the veterans cemetery he wanted to be laid to rest has been extremely busy the last few weeks and the earliest he could be buried was today, Monday, March 11th.\n\nMy children missed school on Friday to be at both of the two viewings held. Being so young...they really had a hard time seeing their grandfather in his casket.  The weekend was difficult for them; he\u2019s the first family member that they know very well to have passed away. They did a bit better at the wake but were still pretty emotional. Crying. It broke my heart.\n\nToday he is being laid in his final resting place. A small handful of my ex\u2019s family members will be there. It\u2019s also a Monday and both my son and daughter have tests at school today. I asked them if they wanted to go to the burial; both shook their heads no. My son said that he had \u201calready said goodbye to Pappy\u201d. \n\nI sent them to school. I just received a phone call from my ex-MIL asking what time I would have the kids at the cemetery. I felt absolutely horrible telling her that the kids were in school and would not be attending the burial. She was *very* upset by this even after I explained that the kids themselves felt that they had already said goodbye. \n\nAm I the Asshole for not forcing my children to attend their Pappy\u2019s burial? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the parent who sent their kids to school instead of the grandfather's burial is in the wrong. The parent and ex are divorced and not on good terms. The kids already attended the viewings and wake, which were emotional for them. The burial is on a Monday, and the kids have tests. They declined to go, so the parent sent them to school.\n\nFirst, the parent's decision seems to prioritize the children's well-being. The kids were already upset during the earlier events. Forcing them to go to the burial might cause more trauma. The parent respected the kids' wishes, which is important for their emotional health.\n\nThe ex-mother-in-law is upset, but the parent had a good reason. The kids are young, and their education is also a factor with tests. The parent didn't force them to attend, which shows they considered the children's feelings. The parent also loved the ex-FIL, so it's a tough situation. They had to choose between the kids' needs and family obligations. Since the kids were already involved in the earlier services and chose not to go to the burial, the parent made a reasonable choice. The answer should be B, the parent is not in the wrong.\n"
