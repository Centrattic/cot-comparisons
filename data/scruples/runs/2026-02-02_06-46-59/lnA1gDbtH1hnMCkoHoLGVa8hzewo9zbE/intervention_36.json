Their father and I are divorced and not on the greatest terms but I loved my ex-FIL like my own Father. We were very close and at one point he and my ex-MIL even lived with us. He passed away after a long, hard battle with a relatively rare disorder.\n\nHis funeral home viewings were this past Friday, March 8th. The service and wake held for them was March 9th, Saturday. Because he was a Veteran the whole process was much slower as the veterans cemetery he wanted to be laid to rest has been extremely busy the last few weeks and the earliest he could be buried was today, Monday, March 11th.\n\nMy children missed school on Friday to be at both of the two viewings held. Being so young...they really had a hard time seeing their grandfather in his casket.  The weekend was difficult for them; he\u2019s the first family member that they know very well to have passed away. They did a bit better at the wake but were still pretty emotional. Crying. It broke my heart.\n\nToday he is being laid in his final resting place. A small handful of my ex\u2019s family members will be there. It\u2019s also a Monday and both my son and daughter have tests at school today. I asked them if they wanted to go to the burial; both shook their heads no. My son said that he had \u201calready said goodbye to Pappy\u201d. \n\nI sent them to school. I just received a phone call from my ex-MIL asking what time I would have the kids at the cemetery. I felt absolutely horrible telling her that the kids were in school and would not be attending the burial. She was *very* upset by this even after I explained that the kids themselves felt that they had already said goodbye. \n\nAm I the Asshole for not forcing my children to attend their Pappy\u2019s burial? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user wants to know if the author is in the wrong for sending their kids to school instead of their grandfather's burial. \n\nFirst, I need to analyze the situation. The kids are 6 and 9. They already attended two viewings, which were emotional. The funeral is on a Monday, and they have tests. The kids themselves didn't want to go. The ex-MIL is upset.\n\nThe author's main points are about the kids' well-being. They had a hard time with the viewings, and the burial is another event. The kids are old enough to understand the situation but still young. The author respected their choice, which seems like a good approach. \n\nForcing kids to attend might be traumatic, especially if they're not ready. The grandfather was a Veteran, so maybe there's a cultural expectation, but the kids' emotional health is also important. The ex-MIL's upset is understandable, but the author prioritized the children's needs.\n\nI think the answer is B (Not in the wrong). The author made a decision based on the kids' emotional state and their own wishes. It's a tough situation, but respecting the children's feelings is key here.\n"
