Their father and I are divorced and not on the greatest terms but I loved my ex-FIL like my own Father. We were very close and at one point he and my ex-MIL even lived with us. He passed away after a long, hard battle with a relatively rare disorder.\n\nHis funeral home viewings were this past Friday, March 8th. The service and wake held for them was March 9th, Saturday. Because he was a Veteran the whole process was much slower as the veterans cemetery he wanted to be laid to rest has been extremely busy the last few weeks and the earliest he could be buried was today, Monday, March 11th.\n\nMy children missed school on Friday to be at both of the two viewings held. Being so young...they really had a hard time seeing their grandfather in his casket.  The weekend was difficult for them; he\u2019s the first family member that they know very well to have passed away. They did a bit better at the wake but were still pretty emotional. Crying. It broke my heart.\n\nToday he is being laid in his final resting place. A small handful of my ex\u2019s family members will be there. It\u2019s also a Monday and both my son and daughter have tests at school today. I asked them if they wanted to go to the burial; both shook their heads no. My son said that he had \u201calready said goodbye to Pappy\u201d. \n\nI sent them to school. I just received a phone call from my ex-MIL asking what time I would have the kids at the cemetery. I felt absolutely horrible telling her that the kids were in school and would not be attending the burial. She was *very* upset by this even after I explained that the kids themselves felt that they had already said goodbye. \n\nAm I the Asshole for not forcing my children to attend their Pappy\u2019s burial? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who sent their kids to school instead of the grandfather's burial is in the wrong. They provided the scenario where the kids were already at the viewings and wake, found it emotionally tough, and now the burial is on a Monday when they have school tests. The kids themselves don't want to go, so the parent sent them to school.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the children's well-being. They're only 6 and 9, and the grandfather was a significant figure. The parent mentions the kids were already upset during the earlier events. Forcing them to attend the burial might cause more trauma. The parent respected the kids' wishes, which is important for their emotional health.\n\nThen there's the ex-MIL's reaction. She's upset they didn't attend the burial. But the parent's priority is the children's needs. The parent isn't in a good relationship with the ex, but that's not the main issue here. The children's emotional state and their school commitments (tests) are factors. Also, the burial is a small event with only a few family members, so maybe the presence of the kids wasn't mandatory.\n\nThe parent explained the situation to the ex-MIL, which shows they tried to be considerate. But the ex-MIL was still upset. However, the parent isn't obligated to attend the burial themselves if they've already done the viewings. The children's own decision not to go is crucial here. The parent made a choice that prioritizes their children's comfort and well-being over attending another event, which isn't inherently wrong.\n\nSchool attendance and tests are important, but if the kids were already excused for the viewings and wake, maybe the school would have been understanding for the burial. But the problem is the kids don't want to go, so the parent isn't forcing them. It's about respecting the children's feelings. \n\nIn terms of societal norms, some might expect grandchildren to attend a grandparent's burial, but the child's emotional state is a valid reason to opt out. The parent isn't being selfish; they're considering the kids' mental health. So, the answer would be B (not in the wrong). The key points are the children's well-being, their own decisions, and the parent's explanation to the ex-MIL.\n"
