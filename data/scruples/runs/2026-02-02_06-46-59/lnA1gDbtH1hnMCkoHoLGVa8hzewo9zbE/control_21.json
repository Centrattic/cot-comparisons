Their father and I are divorced and not on the greatest terms but I loved my ex-FIL like my own Father. We were very close and at one point he and my ex-MIL even lived with us. He passed away after a long, hard battle with a relatively rare disorder.\n\nHis funeral home viewings were this past Friday, March 8th. The service and wake held for them was March 9th, Saturday. Because he was a Veteran the whole process was much slower as the veterans cemetery he wanted to be laid to rest has been extremely busy the last few weeks and the earliest he could be buried was today, Monday, March 11th.\n\nMy children missed school on Friday to be at both of the two viewings held. Being so young...they really had a hard time seeing their grandfather in his casket.  The weekend was difficult for them; he\u2019s the first family member that they know very well to have passed away. They did a bit better at the wake but were still pretty emotional. Crying. It broke my heart.\n\nToday he is being laid in his final resting place. A small handful of my ex\u2019s family members will be there. It\u2019s also a Monday and both my son and daughter have tests at school today. I asked them if they wanted to go to the burial; both shook their heads no. My son said that he had \u201calready said goodbye to Pappy\u201d. \n\nI sent them to school. I just received a phone call from my ex-MIL asking what time I would have the kids at the cemetery. I felt absolutely horrible telling her that the kids were in school and would not be attending the burial. She was *very* upset by this even after I explained that the kids themselves felt that they had already said goodbye. \n\nAm I the Asshole for not forcing my children to attend their Pappy\u2019s burial? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person in the situation is in the wrong for sending their kids to school instead of the grandfather's burial. The story is that the kids are 6 and 9, they already attended the viewings and wake, which were emotional. The burial is on a Monday, and they have tests. The kids didn't want to go, so the parent sent them to school. The ex-MIL is upset.\n\nSo, the question is if the parent is at fault. I need to consider both sides. On one hand, cultural expectations might value attending funerals, especially for family. But the kids were already present for some services, and they were young and upset. Forcing them to go might be traumatic. Also, the parent prioritized the kids' well-being and school obligations. The ex-MIL's upset might be about tradition, but the parent's decision was based on the children's emotional state.\n\nI think the parent isn't in the wrong. The kids were already involved, and forcing them to attend the burial might not be necessary. Their wishes were considered, and school is important. So answer B.\n"
