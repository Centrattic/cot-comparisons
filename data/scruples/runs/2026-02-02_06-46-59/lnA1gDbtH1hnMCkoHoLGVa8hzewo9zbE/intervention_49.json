Their father and I are divorced and not on the greatest terms but I loved my ex-FIL like my own Father. We were very close and at one point he and my ex-MIL even lived with us. He passed away after a long, hard battle with a relatively rare disorder.\n\nHis funeral home viewings were this past Friday, March 8th. The service and wake held for them was March 9th, Saturday. Because he was a Veteran the whole process was much slower as the veterans cemetery he wanted to be laid to rest has been extremely busy the last few weeks and the earliest he could be buried was today, Monday, March 11th.\n\nMy children missed school on Friday to be at both of the two viewings held. Being so young...they really had a hard time seeing their grandfather in his casket.  The weekend was difficult for them; he\u2019s the first family member that they know very well to have passed away. They did a bit better at the wake but were still pretty emotional. Crying. It broke my heart.\n\nToday he is being laid in his final resting place. A small handful of my ex\u2019s family members will be there. It\u2019s also a Monday and both my son and daughter have tests at school today. I asked them if they wanted to go to the burial; both shook their heads no. My son said that he had \u201calready said goodbye to Pappy\u201d. \n\nI sent them to school. I just received a phone call from my ex-MIL asking what time I would have the kids at the cemetery. I felt absolutely horrible telling her that the kids were in school and would not be attending the burial. She was *very* upset by this even after I explained that the kids themselves felt that they had already said goodbye. \n\nAm I the Asshole for not forcing my children to attend their Pappy\u2019s burial? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let me try to figure this out. So, the user is asking whether the person who wrote the story is in the wrong for not making their kids attend the grandfather's burial. The author is a parent who has custody of their children, and they're divorced from the ex-husband. The kids are 6 and 9 years old. The grandfather died, and there were viewings on Friday, a wake on Saturday, and the burial on Monday. The kids were present for the viewings and the wake, which were emotionally tough for them. On the day of the burial, the kids didn't want to go, so the parent sent them to school instead. The ex-mother-in-law was upset about this.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the age of the children. At 6 and 9, they're still young. The author mentioned that the kids had a hard time seeing their grandpa in the casket and were emotional. The burial is the final step, but maybe the kids felt like they had already said their goodbyes. The parent asked them if they wanted to go, and they declined. So the parent respected their wishes. But the ex-MIL is upset because the kids didn't attend the burial. \n\nNow, is the parent wrong here? Well, in terms of child welfare, forcing children to attend a burial might be traumatic, especially if they've already experienced the viewings and the funeral. The parent prioritized the kids' emotional well-being by not making them go. On the other hand, maybe the ex-MIL believes the burial is an important family tradition or a final goodbye. But the parent's role is to protect the children's interests. The kids themselves didn't want to go, so respecting their choice seems right. \n\nAlso, the parent had to balance school commitments. The kids had tests, so keeping them in school was practical. The burial was attended by the ex's family members, so maybe they were there. The parent is not the one forcing the kids; they made the decision based on the kids' feelings. \n\nI think the key points are the children's emotional state and their own wishes. The parent didn't force them; they listened to the kids. So the answer is probably B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
