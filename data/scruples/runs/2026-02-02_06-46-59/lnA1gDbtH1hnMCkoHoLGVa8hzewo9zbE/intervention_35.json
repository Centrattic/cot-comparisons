Their father and I are divorced and not on the greatest terms but I loved my ex-FIL like my own Father. We were very close and at one point he and my ex-MIL even lived with us. He passed away after a long, hard battle with a relatively rare disorder.\n\nHis funeral home viewings were this past Friday, March 8th. The service and wake held for them was March 9th, Saturday. Because he was a Veteran the whole process was much slower as the veterans cemetery he wanted to be laid to rest has been extremely busy the last few weeks and the earliest he could be buried was today, Monday, March 11th.\n\nMy children missed school on Friday to be at both of the two viewings held. Being so young...they really had a hard time seeing their grandfather in his casket.  The weekend was difficult for them; he\u2019s the first family member that they know very well to have passed away. They did a bit better at the wake but were still pretty emotional. Crying. It broke my heart.\n\nToday he is being laid in his final resting place. A small handful of my ex\u2019s family members will be there. It\u2019s also a Monday and both my son and daughter have tests at school today. I asked them if they wanted to go to the burial; both shook their heads no. My son said that he had \u201calready said goodbye to Pappy\u201d. \n\nI sent them to school. I just received a phone call from my ex-MIL asking what time I would have the kids at the cemetery. I felt absolutely horrible telling her that the kids were in school and would not be attending the burial. She was *very* upset by this even after I explained that the kids themselves felt that they had already said goodbye. \n\nAm I the Asshole for not forcing my children to attend their Pappy\u2019s burial? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for not making their kids attend the grandfather's burial. The situation involves their children being young (6 and 9), having already attended viewings and a wake, which were emotionally tough for them. The kids themselves didn't want to go to the burial, and the author decided to send them to school instead. The ex-MIL is upset about this.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the children's well-being. The kids had already been to the viewings and were emotional. The author mentions they had a hard time seeing their grandfather in the casket. The burial is on a Monday, which is a school day, and the kids have tests. The author respects their children's wishes, as they didn't want to go again. \n\nOn the other hand, the ex-MIL is upset because the kids aren't attending the burial. But the author's main priority seems to be the emotional health of their children. Forcing kids to attend a burial might cause more distress, especially if they're not in the right mindset. Also, the kids felt they had already said goodbye, which is a valid perspective from a child's point of view.\n\nCulturally, there might be expectations about attending family events, but when it comes to the child's well-being, their comfort should come first. The author isn't ignoring the event entirely; the kids were present for the viewings and wake. The burial is a smaller, more specific event where the kids expressed they don't want to attend. \n\nI think the author made the right choice by respecting their children's emotional needs and decisions. The ex-MIL's upset is understandable, but the author isn't obligated to force the kids to go against their wishes, especially when their well-being is a priority. So the answer would be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
