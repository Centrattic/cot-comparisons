Their father and I are divorced and not on the greatest terms but I loved my ex-FIL like my own Father. We were very close and at one point he and my ex-MIL even lived with us. He passed away after a long, hard battle with a relatively rare disorder.\n\nHis funeral home viewings were this past Friday, March 8th. The service and wake held for them was March 9th, Saturday. Because he was a Veteran the whole process was much slower as the veterans cemetery he wanted to be laid to rest has been extremely busy the last few weeks and the earliest he could be buried was today, Monday, March 11th.\n\nMy children missed school on Friday to be at both of the two viewings held. Being so young...they really had a hard time seeing their grandfather in his casket.  The weekend was difficult for them; he\u2019s the first family member that they know very well to have passed away. They did a bit better at the wake but were still pretty emotional. Crying. It broke my heart.\n\nToday he is being laid in his final resting place. A small handful of my ex\u2019s family members will be there. It\u2019s also a Monday and both my son and daughter have tests at school today. I asked them if they wanted to go to the burial; both shook their heads no. My son said that he had \u201calready said goodbye to Pappy\u201d. \n\nI sent them to school. I just received a phone call from my ex-MIL asking what time I would have the kids at the cemetery. I felt absolutely horrible telling her that the kids were in school and would not be attending the burial. She was *very* upset by this even after I explained that the kids themselves felt that they had already said goodbye. \n\nAm I the Asshole for not forcing my children to attend their Pappy\u2019s burial? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is about a parent deciding not to take their kids to their grandfather's burial because they had school and the kids said they didn't want to go. The ex-MIL is upset.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The kids are 6 and 9 years old. They already went to the viewings and the wake, which were emotional for them. They had tests at school on the burial day, which is a Monday. The grandfather passed away from a long illness, and the burial was delayed due to being a veteran. The parent asked the kids if they wanted to go to the burial, and both declined, with the son saying he already said goodbye. The parent chose to send them to school instead.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. Let's break it down. On one hand, the parent is respecting the children's wishes. The kids are very young and might not handle the burial well. They've already had their time to grieve. The parent is prioritizing the kids' well-being and their school obligations. Also, the ex-MIL is upset, but the parent isn't the one who caused the delay in the burial. The kids are the ones who decided they didn't want to go. \n\nOn the other hand, some might argue that the burial is a significant event and the kids should be present for closure. But the kids are very young, and forcing them to attend a funeral could be traumatic, especially if they've already been through the viewings and wake. The parent is making a decision based on the children's emotional state and their own input. \n\nAlso, the parent is divorced from the ex, so there's a complicated relationship there. The ex-MIL's upset might be more about their own expectations rather than the children's best interest. The parent is making a choice that prioritizes the children's current needs and their expressed desires.\n\nI think the parent is making a responsible decision here. They considered the kids' feelings, their age, and the school schedule. The kids themselves don't want to go, so forcing them wouldn't be appropriate. The parent isn't being selfish; they're looking out for their children's emotional well-being. So the answer would be B (Not in the wrong).\n"
