Their father and I are divorced and not on the greatest terms but I loved my ex-FIL like my own Father. We were very close and at one point he and my ex-MIL even lived with us. He passed away after a long, hard battle with a relatively rare disorder.\n\nHis funeral home viewings were this past Friday, March 8th. The service and wake held for them was March 9th, Saturday. Because he was a Veteran the whole process was much slower as the veterans cemetery he wanted to be laid to rest has been extremely busy the last few weeks and the earliest he could be buried was today, Monday, March 11th.\n\nMy children missed school on Friday to be at both of the two viewings held. Being so young...they really had a hard time seeing their grandfather in his casket.  The weekend was difficult for them; he\u2019s the first family member that they know very well to have passed away. They did a bit better at the wake but were still pretty emotional. Crying. It broke my heart.\n\nToday he is being laid in his final resting place. A small handful of my ex\u2019s family members will be there. It\u2019s also a Monday and both my son and daughter have tests at school today. I asked them if they wanted to go to the burial; both shook their heads no. My son said that he had \u201calready said goodbye to Pappy\u201d. \n\nI sent them to school. I just received a phone call from my ex-MIL asking what time I would have the kids at the cemetery. I felt absolutely horrible telling her that the kids were in school and would not be attending the burial. She was *very* upset by this even after I explained that the kids themselves felt that they had already said goodbye. \n\nAm I the Asshole for not forcing my children to attend their Pappy\u2019s burial? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. So, the user is asking if the author is in the wrong for sending their kids to school instead of attending their grandfather's burial. The author is divorced from the kids' father, and the ex-mother-in-law is upset.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the age of the children\u20146 and 9 years old. They already attended two viewings and a wake, which were emotionally tough for them. The burial is on a Monday, and they have tests at school. The kids themselves don't want to go to the burial. The author respects their wishes and sends them to school. The ex-MIL is upset, but the author explains the situation. \n\nNow, the key points here: the children's well-being versus family expectations. The kids have already been through a lot of the funeral events. The burial is a more formal event with a small group, and the kids don't want to go. The author is prioritizing their children's emotional state and school responsibilities. \n\nIs it wrong to not force them to attend? Well, the kids are young and have shown distress at the viewings. Making them go to the burial might cause more trauma. Also, they've already said goodbye, so maybe attending isn't necessary. The author isn't keeping the kids from their father's family, but the ex-MIL is upset. However, the author isn't in a position to force the kids to attend against their will, especially if they're not on the best terms with the ex. \n\nSchool tests are important, but maybe not as important as the burial? But the kids are the ones choosing not to go. The author is respecting their decision. So, it's a balance between respecting the children's feelings and family obligations. The author isn't the one forcing the kids to not attend; the kids themselves don't want to. So, the author isn't in the wrong. Answer B.\n"
