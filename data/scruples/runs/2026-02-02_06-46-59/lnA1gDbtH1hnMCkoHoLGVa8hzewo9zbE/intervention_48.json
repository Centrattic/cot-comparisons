Their father and I are divorced and not on the greatest terms but I loved my ex-FIL like my own Father. We were very close and at one point he and my ex-MIL even lived with us. He passed away after a long, hard battle with a relatively rare disorder.\n\nHis funeral home viewings were this past Friday, March 8th. The service and wake held for them was March 9th, Saturday. Because he was a Veteran the whole process was much slower as the veterans cemetery he wanted to be laid to rest has been extremely busy the last few weeks and the earliest he could be buried was today, Monday, March 11th.\n\nMy children missed school on Friday to be at both of the two viewings held. Being so young...they really had a hard time seeing their grandfather in his casket.  The weekend was difficult for them; he\u2019s the first family member that they know very well to have passed away. They did a bit better at the wake but were still pretty emotional. Crying. It broke my heart.\n\nToday he is being laid in his final resting place. A small handful of my ex\u2019s family members will be there. It\u2019s also a Monday and both my son and daughter have tests at school today. I asked them if they wanted to go to the burial; both shook their heads no. My son said that he had \u201calready said goodbye to Pappy\u201d. \n\nI sent them to school. I just received a phone call from my ex-MIL asking what time I would have the kids at the cemetery. I felt absolutely horrible telling her that the kids were in school and would not be attending the burial. She was *very* upset by this even after I explained that the kids themselves felt that they had already said goodbye. \n\nAm I the Asshole for not forcing my children to attend their Pappy\u2019s burial? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. So the user is asking if the author is in the wrong for sending their kids to school instead of the grandfather's burial. The situation is a bit complex because of the family dynamics and the kids' emotions.\n\nFirst, the grandfather died, and the kids were already at the viewings and wake, which were emotionally tough for them. They missed school on Friday for those events. Now, the burial is on a Monday, and the kids have tests. They said they didn't want to go anymore. The ex-mother-in-law is upset because the kids aren't attending the burial.\n\nThe author's reasoning is that the kids are young, they've already said goodbye, and they have school commitments. The user thinks the author is in the wrong, but maybe I need to consider the kids' well-being. Sending kids to a funeral, especially after they've already been through the viewings and wake, might be too much for them emotionally. Also, the fact that they have tests could be a valid reason to prioritize school. The author is respecting the kids' wishes, which shows they're considering the children's emotional state. \n\nOn the other hand, the ex-MIL is upset because they didn't attend the burial. But the author isn't in a great relationship with the ex, and the kids are their responsibility. It's important to balance family obligations with the children's needs. The author might not be in the wrong here because they made a decision based on the kids' well-being and their own schedule. So I think the answer is B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
