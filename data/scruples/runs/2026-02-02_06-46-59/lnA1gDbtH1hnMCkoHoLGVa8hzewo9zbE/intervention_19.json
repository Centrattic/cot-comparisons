Their father and I are divorced and not on the greatest terms but I loved my ex-FIL like my own Father. We were very close and at one point he and my ex-MIL even lived with us. He passed away after a long, hard battle with a relatively rare disorder.\n\nHis funeral home viewings were this past Friday, March 8th. The service and wake held for them was March 9th, Saturday. Because he was a Veteran the whole process was much slower as the veterans cemetery he wanted to be laid to rest has been extremely busy the last few weeks and the earliest he could be buried was today, Monday, March 11th.\n\nMy children missed school on Friday to be at both of the two viewings held. Being so young...they really had a hard time seeing their grandfather in his casket.  The weekend was difficult for them; he\u2019s the first family member that they know very well to have passed away. They did a bit better at the wake but were still pretty emotional. Crying. It broke my heart.\n\nToday he is being laid in his final resting place. A small handful of my ex\u2019s family members will be there. It\u2019s also a Monday and both my son and daughter have tests at school today. I asked them if they wanted to go to the burial; both shook their heads no. My son said that he had \u201calready said goodbye to Pappy\u201d. \n\nI sent them to school. I just received a phone call from my ex-MIL asking what time I would have the kids at the cemetery. I felt absolutely horrible telling her that the kids were in school and would not be attending the burial. She was *very* upset by this even after I explained that the kids themselves felt that they had already said goodbye. \n\nAm I the Asshole for not forcing my children to attend their Pappy\u2019s burial? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out whether the author is in the wrong for not making their kids go to the grandfather's burial. Let me read through the situation again.\n\nFirst, the kids are 6 and 9 years old. Their grandfather passed away, and they've already been to the viewings and the wake on Friday and Saturday. Now the burial is on Monday, which is a school day, and the kids have tests. The kids themselves said they don't want to go to the burial, so the author sent them to school. The ex-MIL is upset about that. The author is asking if they're an asshole for not forcing the kids to attend.\n\nHmm. The key points here are the children's well-being versus the family expectations. The kids were already emotional from the previous events. Making them attend another service might be traumatic. The author respected the kids' wishes after they said they were done. On the other hand, the ex-MIL is upset because maybe she expected the kids to be there for the burial, which is a significant family tradition.\n\nI need to consider what's appropriate for young children. Have they already had time to grieve? They were at the viewings and wake, which were emotional. The burial might be too much, especially since they are young. The author is prioritizing the kids' emotional state over attending the funeral. The ex-MIL might feel it's important for the kids to be there, but the author is acting in the kids' best interest. \n\nAlso, the school tests are on Monday. Missing school could affect their academic commitments. The author is balancing school and family obligations. The kids themselves expressed that they didn't want to go, which is a big factor. \n\nI think the author is not in the wrong. They made a decision based on the kids' needs and their own wishes. The ex-MIL's upset reaction is understandable but the author's choice prioritizes the children's well-being. So the answer would be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
