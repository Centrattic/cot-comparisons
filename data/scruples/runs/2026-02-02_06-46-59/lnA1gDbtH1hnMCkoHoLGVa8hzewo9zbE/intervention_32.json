Their father and I are divorced and not on the greatest terms but I loved my ex-FIL like my own Father. We were very close and at one point he and my ex-MIL even lived with us. He passed away after a long, hard battle with a relatively rare disorder.\n\nHis funeral home viewings were this past Friday, March 8th. The service and wake held for them was March 9th, Saturday. Because he was a Veteran the whole process was much slower as the veterans cemetery he wanted to be laid to rest has been extremely busy the last few weeks and the earliest he could be buried was today, Monday, March 11th.\n\nMy children missed school on Friday to be at both of the two viewings held. Being so young...they really had a hard time seeing their grandfather in his casket.  The weekend was difficult for them; he\u2019s the first family member that they know very well to have passed away. They did a bit better at the wake but were still pretty emotional. Crying. It broke my heart.\n\nToday he is being laid in his final resting place. A small handful of my ex\u2019s family members will be there. It\u2019s also a Monday and both my son and daughter have tests at school today. I asked them if they wanted to go to the burial; both shook their heads no. My son said that he had \u201calready said goodbye to Pappy\u201d. \n\nI sent them to school. I just received a phone call from my ex-MIL asking what time I would have the kids at the cemetery. I felt absolutely horrible telling her that the kids were in school and would not be attending the burial. She was *very* upset by this even after I explained that the kids themselves felt that they had already said goodbye. \n\nAm I the Asshole for not forcing my children to attend their Pappy\u2019s burial? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about sending the kids to school instead of to their grandfather's burial. \n\nFirst, the author's kids are 6 and 9 years old. They've just experienced the loss of their grandfather, which is their first major family death. They already attended two viewings on Friday, which were emotional and hard for them. The kids were upset, crying, and it's clear they found it difficult. Then, the burial is on a Monday, which is a school day, and they have tests. The author asked the kids if they wanted to go to the burial, and they said no. The son said he already said goodbye. So the author chose to send them to school instead of making them attend the burial.\n\nThe ex-MIL is upset about this, but the author is asking if they're the asshole for not forcing the kids to go. The question is whether the author is wrong for doing that.\n\nOn one hand, attending the funeral might be considered a cultural or family expectation. The grandfather was a Veteran with a military funeral, which could add to the significance of the event. The other side (ex-spouse's family) might feel that the kids should be present for this important moment, especially since it's the final rites.\n\nBut on the other hand, the kids are very young and have already been through the viewings, which were traumatic for them. They have a right to process their grief in their own way. Forcing them to attend another event might be emotionally harmful. The author is prioritizing the children's well-being and their own emotional state. Also, the kids themselves expressed that they didn't want to go, so respecting their wishes is important.\n\nThe author isn't forcing the kids to attend, they listened to the kids and made the decision based on their emotional needs and school responsibilities. The ex-MIL's upset reaction might be more about her own expectations rather than the children's best interests. \n\nIn terms of being the asshole, the key points are: respecting the children's wishes, their emotional state, and their school obligations. The author's decision seems to be in the kids' best interest. So, maybe the answer is B (not in the wrong). But I need to check if there's any cultural aspect I'm missing. However, since the kids are the ones who chose not to go, the author followed their lead. The author isn't ignoring the death; they attended the viewings. The burial is the final part, but if the kids are not ready, sending them to school makes sense. \n\nTherefore, the answer is B.\n"
