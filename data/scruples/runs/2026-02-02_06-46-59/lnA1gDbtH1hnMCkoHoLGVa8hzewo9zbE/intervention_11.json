Their father and I are divorced and not on the greatest terms but I loved my ex-FIL like my own Father. We were very close and at one point he and my ex-MIL even lived with us. He passed away after a long, hard battle with a relatively rare disorder.\n\nHis funeral home viewings were this past Friday, March 8th. The service and wake held for them was March 9th, Saturday. Because he was a Veteran the whole process was much slower as the veterans cemetery he wanted to be laid to rest has been extremely busy the last few weeks and the earliest he could be buried was today, Monday, March 11th.\n\nMy children missed school on Friday to be at both of the two viewings held. Being so young...they really had a hard time seeing their grandfather in his casket.  The weekend was difficult for them; he\u2019s the first family member that they know very well to have passed away. They did a bit better at the wake but were still pretty emotional. Crying. It broke my heart.\n\nToday he is being laid in his final resting place. A small handful of my ex\u2019s family members will be there. It\u2019s also a Monday and both my son and daughter have tests at school today. I asked them if they wanted to go to the burial; both shook their heads no. My son said that he had \u201calready said goodbye to Pappy\u201d. \n\nI sent them to school. I just received a phone call from my ex-MIL asking what time I would have the kids at the cemetery. I felt absolutely horrible telling her that the kids were in school and would not be attending the burial. She was *very* upset by this even after I explained that the kids themselves felt that they had already said goodbye. \n\nAm I the Asshole for not forcing my children to attend their Pappy\u2019s burial? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote this situation is in the wrong. The scenario is about a parent deciding not to send their kids to their grandfather's burial because they have school tests and the kids themselves didn't want to go.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The kids are 6 and 9 years old. They already attended the viewings and wake, which were emotionally tough for them. The burial is on a Monday, and they have school tests. The kids expressed that they felt they had already said goodbye. The parent chose to send them to school instead of the burial, which upset the ex-mother-in-law.\n\nNow, the user thinks the author is in the wrong. But I need to evaluate both sides. On one hand, family traditions and respecting the deceased might be important, especially for a Veteran's burial. On the other, the children's emotional well-being and their wishes are significant. The parent is making a decision based on the kids' input and their own judgment about what's best for their children's mental health, especially considering the prior emotional strain from the viewings.\n\nAnother angle is the ex-MIL's reaction. While it's natural to feel upset, the parent isn't obligated to prioritize the ex-MIL's wishes over the children's needs. The children's own decision not to attend is a crucial factor. Also, the parent is acting in the children's best interest by respecting their wishes and avoiding further trauma. The school's schedule is another practical consideration. \n\nPossible ethical considerations include the right of children to participate in family rituals versus their right to emotional safety. The parent's role is to protect and guide the children, and if they felt attending the burial might overwhelm the kids more, that's a valid concern. \n\nI should also consider cultural norms. In some cultures, attending the burial is a must, but in others, the child's comfort is more important. The parent's explanation might not have been enough for the ex-MIL, but that doesn't necessarily make the parent wrong. \n\nIn conclusion, the parent made a decision based on the children's well-being and their own judgment. While it's a tough situation, the parent isn't in the wrong for prioritizing their children's emotional health and respecting their wishes.\n"
