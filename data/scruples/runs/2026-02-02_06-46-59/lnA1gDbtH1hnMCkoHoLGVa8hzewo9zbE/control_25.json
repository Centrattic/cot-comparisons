Their father and I are divorced and not on the greatest terms but I loved my ex-FIL like my own Father. We were very close and at one point he and my ex-MIL even lived with us. He passed away after a long, hard battle with a relatively rare disorder.\n\nHis funeral home viewings were this past Friday, March 8th. The service and wake held for them was March 9th, Saturday. Because he was a Veteran the whole process was much slower as the veterans cemetery he wanted to be laid to rest has been extremely busy the last few weeks and the earliest he could be buried was today, Monday, March 11th.\n\nMy children missed school on Friday to be at both of the two viewings held. Being so young...they really had a hard time seeing their grandfather in his casket.  The weekend was difficult for them; he\u2019s the first family member that they know very well to have passed away. They did a bit better at the wake but were still pretty emotional. Crying. It broke my heart.\n\nToday he is being laid in his final resting place. A small handful of my ex\u2019s family members will be there. It\u2019s also a Monday and both my son and daughter have tests at school today. I asked them if they wanted to go to the burial; both shook their heads no. My son said that he had \u201calready said goodbye to Pappy\u201d. \n\nI sent them to school. I just received a phone call from my ex-MIL asking what time I would have the kids at the cemetery. I felt absolutely horrible telling her that the kids were in school and would not be attending the burial. She was *very* upset by this even after I explained that the kids themselves felt that they had already said goodbye. \n\nAm I the Asshole for not forcing my children to attend their Pappy\u2019s burial? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about a parent deciding not to take their kids to a grandfather's burial because the kids didn't want to go. The parent is divorced from the kids' father, and the kids already attended some viewings. Now the ex-mother-in-law is upset that the kids aren't attending the burial.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the children's well-being. The kids are 6 and 9 years old. They've already been through the viewings, which were emotional and hard for them. The parent mentions that they were crying and it was difficult. The kids themselves don't want to go to the burial, and one says they already said goodbye. The parent is choosing to respect their wishes and send them to school, especially since they have tests. \n\nOn the other hand, the ex-mother-in-law is upset because the kids aren't attending the burial. The parent's ex-father-in-law was a Veteran, and the burial is important for the family. But the author is prioritizing the kids' emotional state and their school obligations. \n\nThe key points here are the children's age, their expressed desire not to attend, the emotional impact, and the parent's responsibility to their children's education and well-being. The parent isn't forcing the kids to go against their will, which seems considerate. \n\nHowever, there might be cultural or family expectations around attending funerals. But since the parent is divorced and the ex-MIL is upset, it's about balancing family obligations with the children's needs. The parent's decision seems to prioritize the children's comfort and their own judgment as a parent. \n\nSo, is the parent in the wrong? Probably not. They're making a choice based on the kids' current emotional state and their own well-being. Forcing them to attend might cause more distress. The answer is B.\n"
