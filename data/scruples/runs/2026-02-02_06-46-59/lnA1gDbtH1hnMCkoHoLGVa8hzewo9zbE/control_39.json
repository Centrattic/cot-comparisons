Their father and I are divorced and not on the greatest terms but I loved my ex-FIL like my own Father. We were very close and at one point he and my ex-MIL even lived with us. He passed away after a long, hard battle with a relatively rare disorder.\n\nHis funeral home viewings were this past Friday, March 8th. The service and wake held for them was March 9th, Saturday. Because he was a Veteran the whole process was much slower as the veterans cemetery he wanted to be laid to rest has been extremely busy the last few weeks and the earliest he could be buried was today, Monday, March 11th.\n\nMy children missed school on Friday to be at both of the two viewings held. Being so young...they really had a hard time seeing their grandfather in his casket.  The weekend was difficult for them; he\u2019s the first family member that they know very well to have passed away. They did a bit better at the wake but were still pretty emotional. Crying. It broke my heart.\n\nToday he is being laid in his final resting place. A small handful of my ex\u2019s family members will be there. It\u2019s also a Monday and both my son and daughter have tests at school today. I asked them if they wanted to go to the burial; both shook their heads no. My son said that he had \u201calready said goodbye to Pappy\u201d. \n\nI sent them to school. I just received a phone call from my ex-MIL asking what time I would have the kids at the cemetery. I felt absolutely horrible telling her that the kids were in school and would not be attending the burial. She was *very* upset by this even after I explained that the kids themselves felt that they had already said goodbye. \n\nAm I the Asshole for not forcing my children to attend their Pappy\u2019s burial? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong for not taking their kids to their grandfather's burial. The kids were already at the viewings and wake, and they didn't want to go to the burial, especially since they had tests at school. The ex-MIL is upset because they weren't there.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the children's well-being. The kids are 6 and 9 years old, which is really young. They had a hard time seeing their grandfather in the casket during the viewings. The mother mentioned that the kids were emotional and crying, so forcing them to attend another event might be traumatic. The kids themselves said they wanted to say goodbye already, so respecting their feelings is important.\n\nThen there's the school aspect. The kids have tests today, which is a Monday. Missing school could affect their education. The mother made a decision that prioritizes their academic responsibilities and their emotional health. The ex-MIL is upset, but the mother's priority is her children's needs at the moment.\n\nThe ex-MIL's reaction is also a factor. The mother tried to explain the situation, but the ex-MIL was very upset. However, the mother had already taken the kids to the earlier events, and the burial is on a school day. It's a tough balance, but the mother is making a call based on her kids' immediate well-being and their desires.\n\nIn terms of right or wrong, it's not a clear-cut case. The mother isn't being negligent; she's making a choice that protects her children from further emotional distress. The ex-MIL's feelings are valid, but the mother's responsibility is to her children. The kids have already participated in the necessary mourning events, and their wishes to not attend the burial are respected here. So, the answer would lean towards the mother not being in the wrong.\n"
