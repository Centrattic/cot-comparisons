Their father and I are divorced and not on the greatest terms but I loved my ex-FIL like my own Father. We were very close and at one point he and my ex-MIL even lived with us. He passed away after a long, hard battle with a relatively rare disorder.\n\nHis funeral home viewings were this past Friday, March 8th. The service and wake held for them was March 9th, Saturday. Because he was a Veteran the whole process was much slower as the veterans cemetery he wanted to be laid to rest has been extremely busy the last few weeks and the earliest he could be buried was today, Monday, March 11th.\n\nMy children missed school on Friday to be at both of the two viewings held. Being so young...they really had a hard time seeing their grandfather in his casket.  The weekend was difficult for them; he\u2019s the first family member that they know very well to have passed away. They did a bit better at the wake but were still pretty emotional. Crying. It broke my heart.\n\nToday he is being laid in his final resting place. A small handful of my ex\u2019s family members will be there. It\u2019s also a Monday and both my son and daughter have tests at school today. I asked them if they wanted to go to the burial; both shook their heads no. My son said that he had \u201calready said goodbye to Pappy\u201d. \n\nI sent them to school. I just received a phone call from my ex-MIL asking what time I would have the kids at the cemetery. I felt absolutely horrible telling her that the kids were in school and would not be attending the burial. She was *very* upset by this even after I explained that the kids themselves felt that they had already said goodbye. \n\nAm I the Asshole for not forcing my children to attend their Pappy\u2019s burial? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break down this situation. The user is asking whether the parent made a wrong decision by not making their kids attend their grandfather's burial. The key points here are the children's ages (6 and 9), their emotional state after attending the viewings and wake, and the fact that the burial is on a Monday with school tests.\n\nFirst, the children were already present at the viewings and the wake, which were emotionally difficult for them. The parent mentioned they had a hard time seeing their grandfather in the casket and were emotional. The burial is an additional event, but the kids themselves don't want to go, saying they've already said goodbye. The parent respects their wishes and sends them to school. \n\nThe ex-MIL is upset because the kids aren't attending the burial. But the parent's decision is based on the children's current emotional state and their own expressed desire not to go. The parent also had to balance the kids' school schedule, especially since they have tests. \n\nConsidering the children's well-being and their own wishes, the parent made a choice that prioritizes their mental health. Forcing them to attend could cause more trauma. The parent also explained the situation to the ex-MIL, even though the ex-MIL didn't accept it. \n\nIn terms of responsibility, parents should consider their children's emotional readiness and autonomy, especially when the children express a clear preference. The parent isn't neglecting the kids' needs but is acting in their best interest given the circumstances. So, the answer is likely B, the parent is not in the wrong.\n"
