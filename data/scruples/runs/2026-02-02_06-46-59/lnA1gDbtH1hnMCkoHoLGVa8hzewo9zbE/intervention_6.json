Their father and I are divorced and not on the greatest terms but I loved my ex-FIL like my own Father. We were very close and at one point he and my ex-MIL even lived with us. He passed away after a long, hard battle with a relatively rare disorder.\n\nHis funeral home viewings were this past Friday, March 8th. The service and wake held for them was March 9th, Saturday. Because he was a Veteran the whole process was much slower as the veterans cemetery he wanted to be laid to rest has been extremely busy the last few weeks and the earliest he could be buried was today, Monday, March 11th.\n\nMy children missed school on Friday to be at both of the two viewings held. Being so young...they really had a hard time seeing their grandfather in his casket.  The weekend was difficult for them; he\u2019s the first family member that they know very well to have passed away. They did a bit better at the wake but were still pretty emotional. Crying. It broke my heart.\n\nToday he is being laid in his final resting place. A small handful of my ex\u2019s family members will be there. It\u2019s also a Monday and both my son and daughter have tests at school today. I asked them if they wanted to go to the burial; both shook their heads no. My son said that he had \u201calready said goodbye to Pappy\u201d. \n\nI sent them to school. I just received a phone call from my ex-MIL asking what time I would have the kids at the cemetery. I felt absolutely horrible telling her that the kids were in school and would not be attending the burial. She was *very* upset by this even after I explained that the kids themselves felt that they had already said goodbye. \n\nAm I the Asshole for not forcing my children to attend their Pappy\u2019s burial? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. Let me start by reading through the situation again carefully.\n\nThe author has two kids, 6 and 9 years old. Their grandfather on the father's side passed away a few weeks back. The parents are divorced and not on good terms. The author loved the ex-FIL, who was close to the family even living with them at one point. The funeral process was delayed due to the Veterans cemetery being busy, so the burial was scheduled for Monday, March 11th. The kids attended the viewings on Friday and the wake on Saturday, but they found it very emotional. The author mentions they were struggling with the loss. The burial is today, Monday, and the kids have tests at school. The author asked the kids if they wanted to go, and they declined. The ex-MIL called upset that the kids aren't attending. The author is asking if they're the asshole for not forcing the kids to go.\n\nThe user thinks the author is in the wrong but wants my opinion. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the kids are very young, 6 and 9. They've just experienced the death of a close family member, which is their first such loss. They attended the viewings and the wake, which were hard for them. Now, the burial is happening on a school day when they have tests. The author respects the kids' wishes and sends them to school instead. The ex-MIL is upset, but the author explained the situation.\n\nSo, the key points are: the children's emotional well-being, their age, their own decisions to not attend, the school obligations, and the ex-MIL's reaction. \n\nIn my opinion, the author made a choice that prioritizes the children's emotional state. At such a young age, the kids have already gone through the difficult experience of attending the viewings and the wake, which were traumatic for them. The burial is another solemn event, and forcing them to attend against their will might cause more distress. The author listened to their children's wishes, which shows empathy and respect for their feelings. \n\nThe ex-MIL's upset reaction is understandable, but the author is the parent making decisions in the best interest of the children. The funeral process was already delayed due to the cemetery's schedule, and the kids have academic commitments. The author didn't force the kids to attend the viewings either, so it's consistent. \n\nI think the author is not in the wrong here because they are considering the children's emotional needs and respecting their choices. Forcing attendance could have been more harmful, especially since the kids felt they had already said goodbye. The author's decision seems reasonable given the circumstances.\n"
