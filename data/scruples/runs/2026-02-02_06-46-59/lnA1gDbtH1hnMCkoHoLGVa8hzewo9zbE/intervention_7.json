Their father and I are divorced and not on the greatest terms but I loved my ex-FIL like my own Father. We were very close and at one point he and my ex-MIL even lived with us. He passed away after a long, hard battle with a relatively rare disorder.\n\nHis funeral home viewings were this past Friday, March 8th. The service and wake held for them was March 9th, Saturday. Because he was a Veteran the whole process was much slower as the veterans cemetery he wanted to be laid to rest has been extremely busy the last few weeks and the earliest he could be buried was today, Monday, March 11th.\n\nMy children missed school on Friday to be at both of the two viewings held. Being so young...they really had a hard time seeing their grandfather in his casket.  The weekend was difficult for them; he\u2019s the first family member that they know very well to have passed away. They did a bit better at the wake but were still pretty emotional. Crying. It broke my heart.\n\nToday he is being laid in his final resting place. A small handful of my ex\u2019s family members will be there. It\u2019s also a Monday and both my son and daughter have tests at school today. I asked them if they wanted to go to the burial; both shook their heads no. My son said that he had \u201calready said goodbye to Pappy\u201d. \n\nI sent them to school. I just received a phone call from my ex-MIL asking what time I would have the kids at the cemetery. I felt absolutely horrible telling her that the kids were in school and would not be attending the burial. She was *very* upset by this even after I explained that the kids themselves felt that they had already said goodbye. \n\nAm I the Asshole for not forcing my children to attend their Pappy\u2019s burial? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the original post is in the wrong for not taking their kids to the grandfather's burial. The situation is that the kids are 6 and 9 years old. They already attended the viewings and the wake, which were emotionally tough for them. Now the burial is on a Monday, and the kids have tests at school. The author chose to send them to school instead of the burial, respecting their wishes after they said they were done saying goodbye. The ex-MIL is upset about this.\n\nHmm. So the user is asking if the author is the asshole here. The options are A for yes, B for no. The user thinks the author is in the wrong but wants my opinion.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the children's well-being. The kids had already been through a lot with the viewings and wake. They were emotional, crying, and it's their first family member passing away. Forcing them to go to the burial might be too much for them. The author explained that the kids themselves didn't want to go, so respecting their wishes seems like a good decision.\n\nAlso, the burial is on a school day with tests. Missing school might affect their education, but maybe not as critically as their emotional health. The parent had to balance both. The kids were already part of the earlier events, so maybe they had a chance to grieve adequately.\n\nThe ex-MIL's upset reaction is understandable but maybe not the parent's main responsibility. The parent's priority is the children's needs. The kids are with the mother, not the father's side, but the mother still made sure they attended the viewings and wake.\n\nSo, considering all that, the parent made a decision based on the kids' emotional state and their own wishes. Forcing them to attend might have been more traumatic. The answer would be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
