Their father and I are divorced and not on the greatest terms but I loved my ex-FIL like my own Father. We were very close and at one point he and my ex-MIL even lived with us. He passed away after a long, hard battle with a relatively rare disorder.\n\nHis funeral home viewings were this past Friday, March 8th. The service and wake held for them was March 9th, Saturday. Because he was a Veteran the whole process was much slower as the veterans cemetery he wanted to be laid to rest has been extremely busy the last few weeks and the earliest he could be buried was today, Monday, March 11th.\n\nMy children missed school on Friday to be at both of the two viewings held. Being so young...they really had a hard time seeing their grandfather in his casket.  The weekend was difficult for them; he\u2019s the first family member that they know very well to have passed away. They did a bit better at the wake but were still pretty emotional. Crying. It broke my heart.\n\nToday he is being laid in his final resting place. A small handful of my ex\u2019s family members will be there. It\u2019s also a Monday and both my son and daughter have tests at school today. I asked them if they wanted to go to the burial; both shook their heads no. My son said that he had \u201calready said goodbye to Pappy\u201d. \n\nI sent them to school. I just received a phone call from my ex-MIL asking what time I would have the kids at the cemetery. I felt absolutely horrible telling her that the kids were in school and would not be attending the burial. She was *very* upset by this even after I explained that the kids themselves felt that they had already said goodbye. \n\nAm I the Asshole for not forcing my children to attend their Pappy\u2019s burial? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not making their kids attend the grandfather's burial. The situation involves a divorced parent, the kids being young (6 and 9), and the funeral was a few days after viewings and a wake. The kids were already at the viewings and wake, which were more public, and the burial is a smaller, more private event on a Monday when they have tests. The kids themselves didn't want to go to the burial.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the children's well-being. The kids had a tough time seeing their grandfather at the viewings. The author mentions they were emotional and crying. Forcing them to attend another event might be traumatic. The kids said they had already said goodbye, which seems to be their own feelings, so respecting their wishes makes sense here.\n\nThe ex-MIL is upset, but the author's responsibility is to the children's emotional health. The author made an effort to let the kids decide, which is child-centered. The burial is for the family, but the kids are part of the family. However, the key point is respecting the children's emotional state. \n\nThe author isn't forcing the kids to attend school; they chose to go to school instead of the burial. The author isn't forcing them to go to the burial. The kids didn't want to go, so the author isn't in the wrong for honoring their wishes. The ex-MIL's upset is understandable but the priority is the children's needs. \n\nSo, the answer would be B (No, the author is not in the wrong) because they prioritized their children's emotional well-being and respected their decision not to attend the burial after the initial services.\n"
