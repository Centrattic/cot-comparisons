Their father and I are divorced and not on the greatest terms but I loved my ex-FIL like my own Father. We were very close and at one point he and my ex-MIL even lived with us. He passed away after a long, hard battle with a relatively rare disorder.\n\nHis funeral home viewings were this past Friday, March 8th. The service and wake held for them was March 9th, Saturday. Because he was a Veteran the whole process was much slower as the veterans cemetery he wanted to be laid to rest has been extremely busy the last few weeks and the earliest he could be buried was today, Monday, March 11th.\n\nMy children missed school on Friday to be at both of the two viewings held. Being so young...they really had a hard time seeing their grandfather in his casket.  The weekend was difficult for them; he\u2019s the first family member that they know very well to have passed away. They did a bit better at the wake but were still pretty emotional. Crying. It broke my heart.\n\nToday he is being laid in his final resting place. A small handful of my ex\u2019s family members will be there. It\u2019s also a Monday and both my son and daughter have tests at school today. I asked them if they wanted to go to the burial; both shook their heads no. My son said that he had \u201calready said goodbye to Pappy\u201d. \n\nI sent them to school. I just received a phone call from my ex-MIL asking what time I would have the kids at the cemetery. I felt absolutely horrible telling her that the kids were in school and would not be attending the burial. She was *very* upset by this even after I explained that the kids themselves felt that they had already said goodbye. \n\nAm I the Asshole for not forcing my children to attend their Pappy\u2019s burial? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is in the wrong but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who sent their kids to school instead of a grandfather's burial is in the wrong. The question is about AITA (Am I the Asshole) scenario.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the situation. The kids are 6 and 9 years old. They had already attended viewings on Friday and the wake on Saturday. The actual burial is on Monday, and the kids have tests. They expressed not wanting to go again. The mother decided to send them to school instead of the burial. The ex-MIL was upset because the kids weren't attending.\n\nThe key points here are the children's well-being versus respecting the deceased's wishes. The kids are very young and emotionally affected by the death. They were already at the viewings and had a hard time. The burial is a smaller event with the father's family. The mother prioritized the kids' emotional state and their school commitments. \n\nFrom a child's perspective, attending multiple services might be too traumatic, especially if they indicated they're okay after the previous services. The mother respected their wishes. On the other hand, the ex-MIL expected the kids to attend the burial. However, the mother's primary responsibility is to her children's emotional and educational needs.\n\nIn many cases, allowing children to make such decisions, especially when they show distress, is considered appropriate. Forcing them might cause more harm. The military burial adds a formal aspect, but the children's comfort and their expressed desire not to attend seem more critical here. \n\nSo, considering the children's emotional state and their own wishes, the mother's decision seems reasonable. The ex-MIL's upset is understandable but not a sign that the mother is wrong. Therefore, the answer would be B (Not in the wrong).\n"
