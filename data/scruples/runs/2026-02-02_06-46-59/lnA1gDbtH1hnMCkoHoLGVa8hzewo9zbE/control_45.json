Their father and I are divorced and not on the greatest terms but I loved my ex-FIL like my own Father. We were very close and at one point he and my ex-MIL even lived with us. He passed away after a long, hard battle with a relatively rare disorder.\n\nHis funeral home viewings were this past Friday, March 8th. The service and wake held for them was March 9th, Saturday. Because he was a Veteran the whole process was much slower as the veterans cemetery he wanted to be laid to rest has been extremely busy the last few weeks and the earliest he could be buried was today, Monday, March 11th.\n\nMy children missed school on Friday to be at both of the two viewings held. Being so young...they really had a hard time seeing their grandfather in his casket.  The weekend was difficult for them; he\u2019s the first family member that they know very well to have passed away. They did a bit better at the wake but were still pretty emotional. Crying. It broke my heart.\n\nToday he is being laid in his final resting place. A small handful of my ex\u2019s family members will be there. It\u2019s also a Monday and both my son and daughter have tests at school today. I asked them if they wanted to go to the burial; both shook their heads no. My son said that he had \u201calready said goodbye to Pappy\u201d. \n\nI sent them to school. I just received a phone call from my ex-MIL asking what time I would have the kids at the cemetery. I felt absolutely horrible telling her that the kids were in school and would not be attending the burial. She was *very* upset by this even after I explained that the kids themselves felt that they had already said goodbye. \n\nAm I the Asshole for not forcing my children to attend their Pappy\u2019s burial? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the parent is wrong for not forcing their kids to attend the grandfather's burial. The situation involves a divorce, the kids' emotional state, and the parent's decision to prioritize their education over the funeral.\n\nFirst, the grandfather died recently, and the kids already attended the viewings and wake. They were emotionally affected, which is understandable for young children. The burial is on a Monday, and the kids have tests at school. The parent asked the kids if they wanted to go, and they declined, saying they'd already said goodbye. The parent chose to send them to school instead. The ex-MIL is upset about this.\n\nThe key points here are the children's well-being and their choice. The kids were already traumatized by seeing their grandfather in the casket. Forcing them to attend another event might have been more harmful. The parent respected the children's wishes, which is important for their emotional health. Also, the school commitment is a practical consideration. The parent had to balance respect for family traditions with the kids' immediate emotional needs.\n\nDivorced parents can have complicated relationships, but the parent here prioritized the children's comfort. The ex-MIL's upset reaction is unfortunate, but the parent isn't obligated to satisfy the wishes of the ex's family. The decision to send the kids to school seems reasonable to protect their mental health and academic responsibilities. So, the answer is B; the parent isn't in the wrong.\n"
